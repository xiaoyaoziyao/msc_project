TI Genome-wide analysis identifies rare copy number variations associated
   with inflammatory bowel disease
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic, chronic disorder of unclear etiology with an underlying genetic predisposition. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified more than 200 IBD susceptibility loci, but the causes of IBD remain poorly defined. We hypothesized that rare (<0.1% population frequency) gene copy number variations (CNVs) could play an important mechanism for risk of IBD. We aimed to examine changes in DNA copy number in a population-based cohort of patients with IBD and search for novel genetic risk factors for IBD.
   Methods
   DNA samples from 243 individuals with IBD from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and 2988 healthy controls were analyzed using genome-wide SNP microarray technology. Three CNV calling algorithms were applied to maximize sensitivity and specificity of CNV detection. We identified IBD-associated genes affected by rare CNV from comparing the number of overlapping CNVs in IBD samples with the number of overlapping CNVs in controls for each gene.
   Results
   4,402 CNVs detected by two or three algorithms intersected 7,061 genes, in at least one analyzed sample. Four genes (e.g. DUSP22 and IP6K3) intersected by rare deletions and fourteen genes (e.g. SLC25A10, PSPN, GTF2F1) intersected by rare duplications demonstrated significant association with IBD (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.01). Of these, ten genes were functionally related to immune response and intracellular signalling pathways. Some of these genes were also identified in other IBD related genome-wide association studies. These suggested that the identified genes may play a role in the risk of IBD.
   Conclusion
   Our results revealed new genomic loci associated with IBD, which suggested the role of rare CNVs in IBD risk.

TI ukbtools: An R package to manage and query UK Biobank data
SO PLOS ONE
AB Introduction
   The UK Biobank (UKB) is a resource that includes detailed health-related data on about 500,000 individuals and is available to the research community. However, several obstacles limit immediate analysis of the data: data files vary in format, may be very large, and have numerical codes for column names.
   Results
   ukbtools removes all the upfront data wrangling required to get a single dataset for statistical analysis. All associated data files are merged into a single dataset with descriptive column names. The package also provides tools to assist in quality control by exploring the primary demographics of subsets of participants; query of disease diagnoses for one or more individuals, and estimating disease frequency relative to a reference variable; and to retrieve genetic metadata.
   Conclusion
   Having a dataset with meaningful variable names, a set of UKB-specific exploratory data analysis tools, disease query functions, and a set of helper functions to explore and write genetic metadata to file, will rapidly enable UKB users to undertake their research.

TI TB DEPOT (Data Exploration Portal): A multi-domain tuberculosis data
   analysis resource
SO PLOS ONE
AB The NIAID TB Portals Program (TBPP) established a unique and growing database repository of socioeconomic, geographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and genomic data from patient cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). Currently, there are 2,428 total cases from nine country sites (Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, Romania, China, India, Kazakhstan, and South Africa), 1,611 (66%) of which are multidrug-or extensively-drug resistant and 1,185 (49%), 863 (36%), and 952 (39%) of which contain X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, and genomic data, respectively. We introduce the Data Exploration Portal (TB DEPOT, https://depot.tbportals.niaid.nih.gov) to visualize and analyze these multi-domain data. The TB DEPOT leverages the TBPP integration of clinical, socioeconomic, genomic, and imaging data into standardized formats and enables user-driven, repeatable, and reproducible analyses. It furthers the TBPP goals to provide a web-enabled analytics platform to countries with a high burden of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) but limited IT resources and inaccessible data, and enables the reusability of data, in conformity with the NIH's Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles. TB DEPOT provides access to "analysis-ready" data and the ability to generate and test complex clinically-oriented hypotheses instantaneously with minimal statistical background and data processing skills. TB DEPOT is also promising for enhancing medical training and furnishing well annotated, hard to find, MDR-TB patient cases. TB DEPOT, as part of TBPP, further fosters collaborative research efforts to better understand drug-resistant tuberculosis and aid in the development of novel diagnostics and personalized treatment regimens.

TI A novel nonsense variant in SUPT2OH gene associated with Rheumatoid
   Arthritis identified by Whole Exome Sequencing of multiplex families
SO PLOS ONE
AB The triggering and development of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is conditioned by environmental and genetic factors. Despite the identification of more than one hundred genetic variants associated with the disease, not all the cases can be explained. Here, we performed Whole Exome Sequencing in 9 multiplex families (N = 30) to identify rare variants susceptible to play a role in the disease pathogenesis. We pre-selected 77 genes which carried rare variants with a complete segregation with RA in the studied families. Follow-up linkage and association analyses with pVAAST highlighted significant RA association of 43 genes (p-value < 0.05 after 10(6) permutations) and pinpointed their most likely causal variant. We resequenced the 10 most significant likely causal variants (p-value <= 3.78*10(-3) after 10(6) permutations) in the extended pedigrees and 9 additional multiplex families (N = 110). Only one SNV in SUPT2OH: c.73A>T (p.Lys25*), presented a complete segregation with RA in an extended pedigree with early-onset cases. In summary, we identified in this study a new variant associated with RA in SUPT2OH gene. This gene belongs to several biological pathways like macro-autophagy and monocyte/macrophage differentiation, which contribute to RA pathogenesis. In addition, these results showed that analyzing rare variants using a family-based approach is a strategy that allows to identify RA risk loci, even with a small dataset.

TI Genome-wide association studies for yield-related traits in soft red
   winter wheat grown in Virginia
SO PLOS ONE
AB Grain yield is a trait of paramount importance in the breeding of all cereals. In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), yield has steadily increased since the Green Revolution, though the current rate of increase is not forecasted to keep pace with demand due to growing world population and increasing affluence. While several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on yield and related component traits have been performed in wheat, the previous lack of a reference genome has made comparisons between studies difficult. In this study, a GWAS for yield and yield-related traits was carried out on a population of 322 soft red winter wheat lines across a total of four rain-fed environments in the state of Virginia using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker data generated by a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) protocol. Two separate mixed linear models were used to identify significant marker-trait associations (MTAs). The first was a single-locus model utilizing a leave-one-chromosome-out approach to estimating kinship. The second was a sub-setting kinship estimation multi-locus method (FarmCPU). The single-locus model identified nine significant MTAs for various yield-related traits, while the FarmCPU model identified 74 significant MTAs. The availability of the wheat reference genome allowed for the description of MTAs in terms of both genetic and physical positions, and enabled more extensive post-GWAS characterization of significant MTAs. The results indicate a number of promising candidate genes contributing to grain yield, including an ortholog of the rice aberrant panicle organization (APO1) protein and a gibberellin oxidase protein (GA2ox-A1) affecting the trait grains per square meter, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis thaliana mother of flowering time and terminal flowering 1 (MFT) gene affecting the trait seeds per square meter, and a B2 heat stress response protein affecting the trait seeds per head.

TI Genomic characterization of the Braque Francais type Pyrenees dog and
   relationship with other breeds
SO PLOS ONE
AB The evaluation of genetic variability is a useful research tool for the correct management of selection and conservation strategies in dog breeds. In addition to pedigree genealogies, genomic data allow a deeper knowledge of the variability and genetic structure of populations. To date, many dog breeds, such as small regional breeds, still remain uncharacterized. Braque Francais type Pyrenees (BRA) is a dog breed originating from a very old type of gun-dog used for pointing the location of game birds to hunters. Despite the ancient background, the knowledge about levels of genetic diversity, degree of inbreeding and population structure is scarce. This may raise concerns on the possibility that few inbred bloodlines may dominate the breed, and on its future health. The aim of this work was therefore to provide a high-resolution representation of the genome-wide diversity and population structure of BRA dogs, using the 170K genome-wide SNP array. Genome-wide polymorphisms in BRA were compared with those of other worldwide dog breeds. Between-dog relationships estimated from genomic data were very similar to pedigree relationships (Pearson correlation r(g,a) = 0.92). Results showed that BRA generally presents moderate levels of genetic diversity when compared with the major canine breeds. The estimated effective population size (recent N-e = 51) shows a similar declining pattern over generations as all other dog breeds, pointing at a common demographic history of modern canine breeds, clearly different from the demography of feral wolves. Multidimensional scaling (MDS), Bayesian clustering and Neighbor Joining tree were used to visualize and explore the genetic relationships among breeds, and revealed that BRA was highly differentiated and presented only low levels of admixture with other breeds. Brittany Spaniel, English Setter, Gordon Setter and Weimaraner dogs are the closest breeds to BRA. The exact reason for BRA being so divergent from other dog breeds, based on these results, is not yet clear. Further studies including additional "braccoid" breeds will be needed to refine the results presented here and to investigate the origin of the BRA breed. Nonetheless, the genome-wide characterization

TI Genotyping-by-sequencing identifies date palm clone preference in
   agronomics of the State of Qatar
SO PLOS ONE
AB Understanding the genetic diversity in a crop population is key to its targeted breeding for desired traits, such as higher yields, better fruit quality and resistance to disease and changing climates. Date fruits represent a major crop in the Middle East and are key to achieving future food independence in arid countries like Qatar. We previously determined the genome of the date palm Phoenix dactylifera and showed that date palm trees world-wide divide into two distinct subpopulations of Eastern and Western origins. Here we applied a resource of SNPs from 179 commercially available date fruits to assess the genetic diversity of date palm trees grown in the State of Qatar. We found that palm trees in Qatar are mainly of Eastern origin, and that their genetic diversity doesn't associate with regions of the State. Together with targeted genetic assays, our resource can be used in the future for date palm cultivar identification, to aid selecting suitable cultivars for targeted breeding, to improve a country's date palm genetic diversity, and to certify the origin of date fruits and trees.

TI Frailty Index associates with GRIN2B in two representative samples from
   the United States and the United Kingdom
SO PLOS ONE
AB The concept of frailty has been used in the clinical and research field for more than two decades. It is usually described as a clinical state of heightened vulnerability to poor resolution of homeostasis after a stressor event, which thereby increases the risk of adverse outcomes, including falls, delirium, disability and mortality. Here we report the results of the first genome-wide association scan and comparative gene ontology analyses where we aimed to identify genes and pathways associated with the deficit model of frailty. We used a discovery- replication design with two independent, nationally representative samples of older adults. The square-root transformed Frailty Index (FI) was the outcome variable, and age and sex were included as covariates. We report one hit exceeding genome-wide significance: the rs6765037 A allele was significantly associated with a decrease in the squareroot transformed FI score in the Discovery sample (beta =-0.01958, p = 2.14E-08), without confirmation in the Replication sample. We also report a nominal replication: the rs7134291 A allele was significantly associated with a decrease in the square-root transformed FI score (Discovery sample: beta =-0.01021, p = 1.85E-06, Replication sample: beta =-0.005013, p = 0.03433). These hits represent the KBTBD12 and the GRIN2B genes, respectively. Comparative gene ontology analysis identified the pathways ` Neuropathic pain signalling in dorsal horn neurons' and the 'GPCR-Mediated Nutrient Sensing in Enteroendocrine Cells', exceeding the p = 0.01 significance in both samples, although this result does not survive correction for multiple testing. Considering the crucial role of GRIN2B in brain development, synaptic plasticity and cognition, this gene appears to be a potential candidate to play a role in frailty. In conclusion, we conducted genome-wide association scan and pathway analyses and have identified genes and pathways with potential roles in frailty. However, frailty is a complex condition. Therefore, further research is required to confirm our results and more thoroughly identify relevant biological mechanisms.

TI Exome sequencing in large, multiplex bipolar disorder families from Cuba
SO PLOS ONE
AB Bipolar disorder (BD) is a major psychiatric illness affecting around 1% of the global population. BD is characterized by recurrent manic and depressive episodes, and has an estimated heritability of around 70%. Research has identified the first BD susceptibility genes. However, the underlying pathways and regulatory networks remain largely unknown. Research suggests that the cumulative impact of common alleles with small effects explains only around 25-38% of the phenotypic variance for BD. A plausible hypothesis therefore is that rare, high penetrance variants may contribute to BD risk. The present study investigated the role of rare, nonsynonymous, and potentially functional variants via whole exome sequencing in 15 BD cases from two large, multiply affected families from Cuba. The high prevalence of BD in these pedigrees renders them promising in terms of the identification of genetic risk variants with large effect sizes. In addition, SNP array data were used to calculate polygenic risk scores for affected and unaffected family members. After correction for multiple testing, no significant increase in polygenic risk scores for common, BD-associated genetic variants was found in BD cases compared to healthy relatives. Exome sequencing identified a total of 17 rare and potentially damaging variants in 17 genes. The identified variants were shared by all investigated BD cases in the respective pedigree. The most promising variant was located in the gene SERPING1 (p.L349F), which has been reported previously as a genome-wide significant risk gene for schizophrenia. The present data suggest novel candidate genes for BD susceptibility, and may facilitate the discovery of disease-relevant pathways and regulatory networks.

TI Multiple genomic regions influence root morphology and seedling growth
   in cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) under wellwatered and
   water-limited conditions
SO PLOS ONE
AB With climate change and an ever-increasing human population threatening food security, developing a better understanding of the genetic basis of crop performance under stressful conditions has become increasingly important. Here, we used genome-wide association studies to genetically dissect variation in seedling growth traits in cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) under well-watered and water-limited (i.e., osmotic stress) conditions, with a particular focus on root morphology. Water limitation reduced seedling size and produced a shift toward deeper rooting. These effects varied across genotypes, and we identified 13 genomic regions that were associated with traits of interest across the two environments. These regions varied in size from a single marker to 186.2 Mbp and harbored numerous genes, some of which are known to be involved in the plant growth/development as well as the response to osmotic stress. In many cases, these associations corresponded to growth traits where the common allele outperformed the rare variant, suggesting that selection for increased vigor during the evolution of cultivated sunflower might be responsible for the relatively high frequency of these alleles. We also found evidence of pleiotropy across multiple traits, as well as numerous environmentally independent genetic effects. Overall, our results indicate the existence of genetic variation in root morphology and allocation and further suggest that the majority of alleles associated with these traits have consistent effects across environments.

TI Prediction model for pancreatic cancer risk in the general Japanese
   population
SO PLOS ONE
AB Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility. We sought to replicate the associations of 61 GWAS-identified SNPs at 42 loci with pancreatic cancer in Japanese and to develop a risk model for the identification of individuals at high risk for pancreatic cancer development in the general Japanese population. The model was based on data including directly determined or imputed SNP genotypes for 664 pancreatic cancer case and 664 age-and sex-matched control subjects. Stepwise logistic regression uncovered five GWAS-identified SNPs at five loci that also showed significant associations in our case-control cohort. These five SNPs were included in the risk model and also applied to calculation of the polygenic risk score (PRS). The area under the curve determined with the leave-one-out cross-validation method was 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.66) or 0.61 (0.58-0.64) for versions of the model that did or did not include cigarette smoking and family history of pancreatic cancer in addition to the five SNPs, respectively. Individuals in the lowest and highest quintiles for the PRS had odds ratios of 0.62 (0.42-0.91) and 1.98 (1.42-2.76), respectively, for pancreatic cancer development compared with those in the middle quintile. We have thus developed a risk model for pancreatic cancer that showed moderately good discriminatory ability with regard to differentiation of pancreatic cancer patients from control individuals. Our findings suggest the potential utility of a risk model that incorporates replicated GWAS-identified SNPs and established demographic or environmental factors for the identification of individuals at increased risk for pancreatic cancer development.

TI Rare gene deletions in genetic generalized and Rolandic epilepsies
SO PLOS ONE
AB Genetic Generalized Epilepsy (GGE) and benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes or Rolandic Epilepsy (RE) are common forms of genetic epilepsies. Rare copy number variants have been recognized as important risk factors in brain disorders. We performed a systematic survey of rare deletions affecting protein-coding genes derived from exome data of patients with common forms of genetic epilepsies. We analysed exomes from 390 European patients (196 GGE and 194 RE) and 572 population controls to identify low-frequency genic deletions. We found that 75 (32 GGE and 43 RE) patients out of 390, i.e. similar to 19%, carried rare genic deletions. In particular, large deletions (>400 kb) represent a higher burden in both GGE and RE syndromes as compared to controls. The detected low-frequency deletions (1) share genes with brain-expressed exons that are under negative selection, (2) overlap with known autism and epilepsy-associated candidate genes, (3) are enriched for CNV intolerant genes recorded by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and (4) coincide with likely disruptive de novo mutations from the NPdenovo database. Employing several knowledge databases, we discuss the most prominent epilepsy candidate genes and their protein-protein networks for GGE and RE.

TI Population genetic analysis of aquaculture salmonid populations in China
   using a 57K rainbow trout SNP array
SO PLOS ONE
AB Various salmonid species are cultivated in cold water aquaculture. However, due to limited genomic data resources, specific high-throughput genotyping tools are not available to many of the salmonid species. In this study, a 57K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was utilized to detect polymorphisms in seven salmonid species, including Hucho taimen, Oncorhynchus masou, Salvelinus fontinalis, Brachymystax lenok, Salvelinus leucomaenis, O. kisutch, and O. mykiss. The number of polymorphic markers per population ranged from 3,844 (O. kisutch) to 53,734 (O. mykiss), indicating that the rainbow trout SNP array was applicable as a universal genotyping tool for other salmonid species. Among the six other salmonid populations from four genera, 28,882 SNPs were shared, whereas 525 SNPs were polymorphic in all four genera. The genetic diversity and population relationships of the seven salmonid species were studied by principal component analysis (PCA). The phylogenetic relationships among populations were analyzed using the maximum likelihood method, which indicated that the shared SNP markers provide reliable genomic information for population genetic analyses in common aquaculture salmonid fishes. Furthermore, this obtained genomic information may be applicable for population genetic evaluation, marker-assisted breeding, and propagative parent selection in fry production.

TI Genome-wide association study using haplotype alleles for the evaluation
   of reproductive traits in Nelore cattle
SO PLOS ONE
AB Zebu cattle (Bos taurus indicus) are highly adapted to tropical regions. However, females reach puberty after taurine heifers, which affects the economic efficiency of beef cattle breeding in the tropical regions. The aims of this study were to establish associations between the haplotype alleles of the bovine genome and age at first calving (AFC) in the Nelore cattle, and to identify the genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to this phenotype. A total of 2,273 Nelore cattle (995 males and 1,278 females) genotyped using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip were used in the current study. The association analysis included females with valid first calving records as well as open heifers. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis among the markers was performed using blocks of 5, 10, and 15 markers, which were determined by sliding windows shifting one marker at a time. Then, the haplotype block size to be used in the association study was chosen based on the highest r(2) average among the SNPs in the block. The five HapAlleles most strongly associated with the trait (top five) were considered as significant associations. The results of the analysis revealed four genomic regions related to AFC, which overlapped with 20 QTL of the reproductive traits reported previously. Furthermore, there were 19 genes related to reproduction in those regions. In conclusion, the use of haplotypes allowed the detection of chromosomal regions associated with AFC in Nelore cattle, and provided the basis for elucidating the mechanisms underlying this trait.

TI Fast score test with global null estimation regardless of missing
   genotypes
SO PLOS ONE
AB In genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for binary traits (or case-control samples) in the presence of covariates to be adjusted for, researchers often use a logistic regression model to test variants for disease association. Popular tests include Wald, likelihood ratio, and score tests. For likelihood ratio test and Wald test, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which requires iterative procedure, must be computed for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). In contrast, the score test only requires MLE under the null model, being lower in computational cost than other tests. Usually, genotype data include missing genotypes because of assay failures. It loses computational efficiency in the conventional score test (CST), which requires null estimation by excluding individuals with missing genotype for each SNP. In this study, we propose two new score tests, called PM1 and PM2, that use a single global null estimator for all SNPs regardless of missing genotypes, thereby enabling faster computation than CST. We prove that PM2 and CST have an equivalent asymptotic power and that the power of PM1 is asymptotically lower than that of PM2. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods in terms of type I error rates and power by simulation studies and application to real GWAS data provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), confirming our theoretical results. ADNI-GWAS application demonstrated that the proposed score tests improve computational speed about 6-18 times faster than the existing tests, CST, Wald tests and likelihood ratio tests. Our score tests are general and applicable to other regression models.

TI Genetic contributions to lupus nephritis in a multi-ethnic cohort of
   systemic lupus erythematous patients
SO PLOS ONE
AB Objective
   African Americans, East Asians, and Hispanics with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) are more likely to develop lupus nephritis (LN) than are SLE patients of European descent. The etiology of this difference is not clear, and this study was undertaken to investigate how genetic variants might explain this effect.
   Methods
   In this cross-sectional study, 1244 SLE patients from multiethnic case collections were genotyped for 817,810 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. Continental genetic ancestry was estimated utilizing the program ADMIXTURE. Gene-based testing and pathway analysis was performed within each ethnic group and meta-analyzed across ethnicities. We also performed candidate SNP association tests with SNPs previously established as risk alleles for SLE, LN, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Association testing and logistic regression models were performed with LN as the outcome, adjusted for continental ancestries, sex, disease duration, and age.
   Results
   We studied 255 North European, 263 South European, 238 Hispanic, 224 African American and 264 East Asian SLE patients, of whom 606 had LN (48.7%). In genome-wide gene-based and candidate SNP analyses, we found distinct genes, pathways and established risk SNPs associated with LN for each ethnic group. Gene-based analyses showed significant associations between variation in ZNF546 (p = 1.0E-06), TRIM15 (p = 1.0E-06), and TRIMI0 (p = 1.0E-06) and LN among South Europeans, and TTC34 (p = 8.0E-06) was significantly associated with LN among Hispanics. The SNP rs8091180 in NFATC1 was associated with LN (OR 1.43, p = 3.3E-04) in the candidate SNP meta-analysis with the highest OR among African-Americans (OR 2.17, p = 0.0035).
   Conclusion
   Distinct genetic factors are associated with the risk of LN in SLE patients of different ethnicities. CKD risk alleles may play a role in the development of LN in addition to SLE-associated risk variants. These findings may further explain the clinical heterogeneity of LN risk and response to therapy observed between different ethnic groups.

TI Genetic polymorphisms of NOS2 and predisposition to fracture non-union:
   A case control study based on Han Chinese population
SO PLOS ONE
AB A non-union, especially atrophic non-unions, is a permanent failure of healing following a fracture and can be difficult to treat. Approximately 5-10% of fractures will result in a nonunion during the healing process. non-unions can be classified into two types: atrophic nonunion which is often due to impaired bone healing with a potential biological mechanism, and hypertrophic non-union which is due to inadequate fixation after fracture. Genetic variations also play an important role in the fracture healing response. Previous studies based on animal models have indicated that NOS2 might be greatly involved in the bone fracture healing process. In this case-control study, 346 nonunion patients were compared to 883 patients with normal fracture healing to investigate the potential genetic association between NOS2 and the fracture healing process using study subjects of Chinese Han ancestry. Twenty-seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering NOS2were genotyped in our study subjects and analyzed. In addition to the single marker-based analysis, we performed a gene-by-environment analysis to examine the potential interactions between genetic polymorphisms and some environmental factors. SNP rs2297514 showed significant association with the fracture healing process after adjusting for age and gender (OR = 1.38, P= 0.0005). Our results indicated that the T allele of rs2297514 significantly increased the risk of a non-union during the fracture healing process by 38% compared to the C allele. Further stratification analyses conducted for this SNP using data from subgroups classified by different sites of fracture indicated that significance could only be observed in the tibial diaphysis subgroup (N = 428, OR = 1.77, P= 0.0007) but not other groups including femur diaphysis, humeral shaft, ulnar shaft, and femur neck. Gene-by-environment interaction analyses of the three environmental factors showed no significant results. In this study, rs2297514 was significantly associated with the non-union status of fracture healing using a large Chinese population-based study sample. Our findings replicated those of a previous preliminary study and offered strong evidence linking NOS2 and fracture healing.

TI Genetic association study of NLRP1, CARD, and CASP1 inflammasome genes
   with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy among Trypanosoma cruzi seropositive
   patients in Bolivia
SO PLOS ONE
AB About 20-30% of people infected with Chagas disease present with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), the most serious and frequent manifestation of the disease, while others remain asymptomatic and often do not experience Chagas-specific mortality. It is not currently well understood what causes these differential disease outcomes, but a genetic predisposition within the host could play an important role. This study examined variants in the NLRP1, CARD, and CASP1 inflammasome genes among 62 T. cruzi seropositive patients from Bolivia (38 cases with CCC and 24 asymptomatic controls) to uncover associations with CCC. All subjects underwent a complete medical examination including electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram. After genotype calling and quality control filtering with exclusion of 3 cases and 3 controls, association analysis was performed across 76 directly genotyped SNPs in NLRP1, CARD, and CASP1 genes, adjusting for age, sex, and population stratification. One SNP (rs11651270; Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.036) corresponding to a missense mutation in NLPR1 was found to be significant after adjustment for multiple testing, and a suggestive association was seen in CARD11 (rs6953573; Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.060). Although limited by sample size, the study results suggest variations in the inflammasome, particularly in NLRP1 and CARD11, may be associated with CCC.

TI Estimation of linkage disequilibrium and analysis of genetic diversity
   in Korean chicken lines
SO PLOS ONE
AB The development of genetic markers for animal breeding is an effective strategy to reduce the time and cost required to improve economically important traits. To implement genomic selection in the multibreed chicken population of Korea, an understanding of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) status of the target population is essential. In this study, we performed population genetic analyses to investigate LD decay, the effective population size, and breed diversity using 600 K high-density single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes of 189 native chickens in 14 lines (including Korean native chicken, imported and adapted purebred and commercial chickens). The results indicated that commercial native chickens have less calculated LD (average, r(2) = 0.13-0.26) and purebred native chickens have more calculated LD (average, r(2) = 0.24-0.37) across the entire genome. The effective population sizes of the examined lines showed patterns opposite to those of population LD. The phylogeny and admixture analyses showed that commercial and purebred chickens were well distinguished, except for Rhode Island Red (RIR) purebred lines of NC (NIAS_RIR_C) and ND (NIAS_RIR_D). These lines are difficult to distinguish clearly because they originated from the same respective breeds. The results of this study may provide important information for the development of genetic markers that can be used in breeding to improve the economic traits of native chickens.

TI CELSR2 is a candidate susceptibility gene in idiopathic scoliosis
SO PLOS ONE
AB A Swedish pedigree with an autosomal dominant inheritance of idiopathic scoliosis was initially studied by genetic linkage analysis, prioritising genomic regions for further analysis. This revealed a locus on chromosome 1 with a putative risk haplotype shared by all affected individuals. Two affected individuals were subsequently exome-sequenced, identifying a rare, non-synonymous variant in the CELSR2 gene. This variant is rs141489111, a c. G6859A change in exon 21 (NM_001408), leading to a predicted p. V2287I (NP_001399.1) change. This variant was found in all affected members of the pedigree, but showed reduced penetrance. Analysis of tagging variants in CELSR1-3 in a set of 1739 Swedish-Danish scoliosis cases and 1812 controls revealed significant association (p = 0.0001) to rs2281894, a common synonymous variant in CELSR2. This association was not replicated in case-control cohorts from Japan and the US. No association was found to variants in CELSR1 or CELSR3. Our findings suggest a rare variant in CELSR2 as causative for idiopathic scoliosis in a family with dominant segregation and further highlight common variation in CELSR2 in general susceptibility to idiopathic scoliosis in the Swedish-Danish population. Both variants are located in the highly conserved GAIN protein domain, which is necessary for the auto-proteolysis of CELSR2, suggesting its functional importance.

TI Genome-wide association study identifies a locus associated with rotator
   cuff injury
SO PLOS ONE
AB Rotator cuff tears are common, especially in the fifth and sixth decades of life, but can also occur in the competitive athlete. Genetic differences may contribute to overall injury risk. Identifying genetic loci associated with rotator cuff injury could shed light on the etiology of this injury. We performed a genome-wide association screen using publically available data from the Research Program in Genes, Environment and Health including 8,357 cases of rotator cuff injury and 94,622 controls. We found rs71404070 to show a genome-wide significant association with rotator cuff injury with p = 2.31x10(-8) and an odds ratio of 1.25 per allele. This SNP is located next to cadherin8, which encodes a protein involved in cell adhesion. We also attempted to validate previous gene association studies that had reported a total of 18 SNPs showing a significant association with rotator cuff injury. However, none of the 18 SNPs were validated in our dataset. rs71404070 may be informative in explaining why some individuals are more susceptible to rotator cuff injury than others.

TI Genome-wide analysis of the diversity and ancestry of Korean dogs
SO PLOS ONE
AB There are various hypotheses on dog domestication based on archeological and genetic studies. Although many studies have been conducted on the origin of dogs, the existing literature about the ancestry, diversity, and population structure of Korean dogs is sparse. Therefore, this study is focused on the origin, diversity and population structure of Korean dogs. The study sample comprised four major categories, including non-dogs (coyotes and wolves), ancient, modern and Korean dogs. Selected samples were genotyped using an Illumina CanineHD array containing 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphisms. The genome-wide data were filtered using quality control parameters in PLINK 1.9. Only autosomal chromosomes were used for further analysis. The negative off-diagonal variance of the genetic relationship matrix analysis depicted, the variability of samples in each population. FIS (inbreeding rate within a population) values indicated, a low level of inbreeding within populations, and the patterns were in concordance with the results of Nei's genetic distance analysis. The lowest FST (inbreeding rate between populations) values among Korean and Chinese breeds, using a phylogenetic tree, multi-dimensional scaling, and a TreeMix likelihood tree showed Korean breeds are highly related to Chinese breeds. The Korean breeds possessed a unique and large diversity of admixtures compared with other breeds. The highest and lowest effective population sizes were observed in Korean Jindo Black (485) and Korean Donggyeong White (109), respectively. The historical effective population size of all Korean dogs showed declining trend from the past to present. It is important to take immediate action to protect the Korean dog population while conserving their diversity. Furthermore, this study suggests that Korean dogs have unique diversity and are one of the basal lineages of East Asian dogs, originating from China.

TI Association and clinical utility of NAT2 in the prediction of
   isoniazid-induced liver injury in Singaporean patients
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background and aims
   Isoniazid (INH) is part of the first-line-therapy for tuberculosis (TB) but can cause drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Several candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been previously identified but the clinical utility of these SNPs in the prediction of INH-DILI remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess the association between selected candidate SNPs and the risk of INH-DILI and to assess the clinical validity of associated variants in a Singaporean population.
   Methods
   This was a case-control study where 24 INH-DILI cases and 79 controls were recruited from the TB control unit in a tertiary hospital. Logistic regression was used to test for the association between candidate SNPs and INH-DILI. NAT2 acetylator status was inferred from genotypes and tested for association with INH-DILI. Finally, clinical validity measures were estimated for significant variants.
   Results
   Two SNPs in NAT2 (rs1041983 and rs1495741) and NAT2 slow acetylators (SA) were significantly associated with INH-DILI (OR (95% CI) = 13.86 (4.30-44.70), 0.10 (0.03-0.33) and 9.98 (3.32-33.80), respectively). Based on an INH-DILI prevalence of 10%, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of NAT2 SA were 75%, 78%, 28% and 97%, respectively. The population attributable fraction (PAF) and number needed to test (NNT) for NAT2 SA were estimated to be 0.67 and 4.08, respectively. A model with clinical and NAT2 acetylator status provided significantly better prediction for INH-DILI than a clinical model alone (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.863 vs. 0.766, respectively, p = 0.027).
   Conclusions
   We show the association between NAT2 SA and INH-DILI in a Singaporean population and demonstrated its clinical utility in the prediction of INH-DILI.

TI The Bos taurus-Bos indicus balance in fertility and milk related genes
SO PLOS ONE
AB Numerical approaches to high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data are often employed independently to address individual questions. We linked independent approaches in a bioinformatics pipeline for further insight. The pipeline driven by heterozygosity and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) analyses was applied to characterize Bos taurus and Bos indicus ancestry. We infer a gene co-heterozygosity network that regulates bovine fertility, from data on 18,363 cattle with genotypes for 729,068 SNP. Hierarchical clustering separated populations according to Bos taurus and Bos indicus ancestry. The weights of the first principal component were subjected to Normal mixture modelling allowing the estimation of a gene's contribution to the Bos taurus-Bos indicus axis. We used deviation from HWE, contribution to Bos indicus content and association to fertility traits to select 1,284 genes. With this set, we developed a co-heterozygosity network where the group of genes annotated as fertility-related had significantly higher Bos indicus content compared to other functional classes of genes, while the group of genes associated with milk production had significantly higher Bos taurus content. The network analysis resulted in capturing novel gene associations of relevance to bovine domestication events. We report transcription factors that are likely to regulate genes associated with cattle domestication and tropical adaptation. Our pipeline can be generalized to any scenarios where population structure requires scrutiny at the molecular level, particularly in the presence of a priori set of genes known to impact a phenotype of evolutionary interest such as fertility.

TI Whole genome structural analysis of Caribbean hair sheep reveals
   quantitative link to West African ancestry
SO PLOS ONE
AB Hair sheep of Caribbean origin have become an important part of the U.S. sheep industry. Their lack of wool eliminates a number of health concerns and drastically reduces the cost of production. More importantly, Caribbean hair sheep demonstrate robust production performance even in the presence of drug-resistant gastrointestinal nematodes, a rising concern to the industry. Despite the growing importance of hair sheep in the Americas their genetic origins have remained speculative. Prior to this report no genetic studies were able to identify a unique geographical origin of hair sheep in the New World. Our study clarifies the African and European ancestry of Caribbean hair sheep. Whole-genome structural analysis was conducted on four established breeds of hair sheep from the Caribbean region. Using breeds representing Africa and Europe we establish an objective measure indicating Caribbean hair sheep are derived from Iberian and West African origins. Caribbean hair sheep result from West African introgression into established ecotypes of Iberian descent. Genotypes from 47,750 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers scored in 290 animals were used to characterize the population structure of the St. Croix, Barbados Black-belly, Morada Nova, and Santa Ines. Principal components, admixture, and phylogenetic analyses results correlate with historical patterns of colonization and trade. These patterns support co-migration of these sheep with humans.

TI Quickly identifying identical and closely related subjects in large
   databases using genotype data
SO PLOS ONE
AB Genome- wide association studies (GWAS) usually rely on the assumption that different samples are not from closely related individuals. Detection of duplicates and close relatives becomes more difficult both statistically and computationally when one wants to combine datasets that may have been genotyped on different platforms. The dbGaP repository at the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) contains datasets from hundreds of studies with over one million samples. There are many duplicates and closely related individuals both within and across studies from different submitters. Relationships between studies cannot always be identified by the submitters of individual datasets. To aid in curation of dbGaP, we developed a rapid statistical method called Genetic Relationship and Fingerprinting (GRAF) to detect duplicates and closely related samples, even when the sets of genotyped markers differ and the DNA strand orientations are unknown. GRAF extracts genotypes of 10,000 informative and independent SNPs from genotype datasets obtained using different methods, and implements quick algorithms that enable it to find all of the duplicate pairs from more than 880,000 samples within and across dbGaP studies in less than two hours. In addition, GRAF uses two statistical metrics called All Genotype Mismatch Rate (AGMR) and Homozygous Genotype Mismatch Rate (HGMR) to determine subject relationships directly from the observed genotypes, without estimating probabilities of identity by descent (IBD), or kinship coefficients, and compares the predicted relationships with those reported in the pedigree files. We implemented GRAF in a freely available C++ program of the same name. In this paper, we describe the methods in GRAF and validate the usage of GRAF on samples from the dbGaP repository. Other scientists can use GRAF on their own samples and in combination with samples downloaded from dbGaP.

TI Genetic variants in ALDH1B1 and alcohol dependence risk in a British and
   Irish population: A bioinformatic and genetic study
SO PLOS ONE
AB Alcohol is metabolized in the liver via the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Polymorphisms in the genes encoding these enzymes, which are common in East Asian populations, can alter enzyme kinetics and hence the risk of alcohol dependence and its sequelae. One of the most important genetic variants, in this regards, is the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs671 in ALDH2, the gene encoding the primary acetaldehyde metabolizing enzyme ALDH2. However, the protective allele of rs671 is absent in most Europeans although ALDH1B1, which shares significant sequence homology with ALDH2, contains several, potentially functional, missense SNPs that do occur in European populations. The aims of this study were: (i) to use bioinformatic techniques to characterize the possible effects of selected variants in ALDH1B1 on protein structure and function; and, (ii) to genotype three missense and one stop-gain, protein-altering, non-synonymous SNPs in 1478 alcohol dependent cases and 1254 controls of matched British and Irish ancestry. No significant allelic associations were observed between the three missense SNPs and alcohol dependence risk. The minor allele frequency of rs142427338 (Gln378Ter) was higher in alcohol dependent cases than in controls (allelic P = 0.19, OR = 2.98, [0.62-14.37]) but as this SNP is very rare the study was likely underpowered to detect an association with alcohol dependence risk. This potential association will needs to be further evaluated in other large, independent European populations.

TI A longitudinal cline characterizes the genetic structure of human
   populations in the Tibetan plateau
SO PLOS ONE
AB Indigenous populations of the Tibetan plateau have attracted much attention for their good performance at extreme high altitude. Most genetic studies of Tibetan adaptations have used genetic variation data at the genome scale, while genetic inferences about their demography and population structure are largely based on uniparental markers. To provide genome-wide information on population structure, we analyzed new and published data of 338 individuals from indigenous populations across the plateau in conjunction with worldwide genetic variation data. We found a clear signal of genetic stratification across the eastwest axis within Tibetan samples. Samples from more eastern locations tend to have higher genetic affinity with lowland East Asians, which can be explained by more gene flow from lowland East Asia onto the plateau. Our findings corroborate a previous report of admixture signals in Tibetans, which were based on a subset of the samples analyzed here, but add evidence for isolation by distance in a broader geospatial context.

TI Genome-wide association analysis in dogs implicates 99 loci as risk
   variants for anterior cruciate ligament rupture
SO PLOS ONE
AB Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common condition that can be devastating and life changing, particularly in young adults. A non-contact mechanism is typical. Second ACL ruptures through rupture of the contralateral ACL or rupture of a graft repair is also common. Risk of rupture is increased in females. ACL rupture is also common in dogs. Disease prevalence exceeds 5% in several dog breeds, similar to 100 fold higher than human beings. We provide insight into the genetic etiology of ACL rupture by genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a high-risk breed using 98 case and 139 control Labrador Retrievers. We identified 129 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 99 risk loci. Associated loci (P< 5E-04) explained approximately half of phenotypic variance in the ACL rupture trait. Two of these loci were located in uncharacterized or non-coding regions of the genome. A chromosome 24 locus containing nine genes with diverse functions met genome-wide significance (P = 3.63E-0.6). GWAS pathways were enriched for c-type lectins, a gene set that includes aggrecan, a gene set encoding antimicrobial proteins, and a gene set encoding membrane transport proteins with a variety of physiological functions. Genotypic risk estimated for each dog based on the risk contributed by each GWAS locus showed clear separation of ACL rupture cases and controls. Power analysis of the GWAS data set estimated that similar to 172 loci explain the genetic contribution to ACL rupture in the Labrador Retriever. Heritability was estimated at 0.48. We conclude ACL rupture is a moderately heritable highly polygenic complex trait. Our results implicate c-type lectin pathways in ACL homeostasis.

TI Exome-wide association study reveals novel susceptibility genes to
   sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy
SO PLOS ONE
AB Aims
   Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of heart failure with a strong familial component. We performed an exome-wide array-based association study (EWAS) to assess the contribution of missense variants to sporadic DCM.
   Methods and results
   116,855 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were analyzed in 2796 DCM patients and 6877 control subjects from 6 populations of European ancestry. We confirmed two previously identified associations with SNVs in BAG3 and ZBTB17 and discovered six novel DCM-associated loci (Q-value<0.01). The lead-SNVs at novel loci are common and located in TTN, SLC39A8, MLIP, FLNC, ALPK3 and FHOD3. In silico fine mapping identified HSPB7 as the most likely candidate at the ZBTB17 locus. Rare variant analysis (MAF<0.01) demonstrated significant association for TTN variants only (P = 0.0085). All candidate genes but one (SLC39A8) exhibit preferential expression in striated muscle tissues and mutations in TTN, BAG3, FLNC and FHOD3 are known to cause familial cardiomyopathy. We also investigated a panel of 48 known cardiomyopathy genes. Collectively, rare (n = 228, P = 0.0033) or common (n = 36, P = 0.019) variants with elevated in silico severity scores were associated with DCM, indicating that the spectrum of genes contributing to sporadic DCM extends beyond those identified here.
   Conclusion
   We identified eight loci independently associated with sporadic DCM. The functions of the best candidate genes at these loci suggest that proteostasis regulation might play a role in DCM pathophysiology.

TI A novel TCF7L2 type 2 diabetes SNP identified from fine mapping in
   African American women
SO PLOS ONE
AB SNP rs7903146 in the Wnt pathway's TCF7L2 gene is the variant most significantly associated with type 2 diabetes to date, with associations observed across diverse populations. We sought to determine whether variants in other Wnt pathway genes are also associated with this disease. We evaluated 69 genes involved in the Wnt pathway, including TCF7L2, for associations with type 2 diabetes in 2632 African American cases and 2596 controls from the Black Women's Health Study. Tag SNPs for each gene region were genotyped on a custom Affymetrix Axiom Array, and imputation was performed to 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data. Gene-based analyses were conducted using the adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) statistic. The PSMD2 gene was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes after correction for multiple testing (corrected p = 0.016), based on the nine most significant single variants in the +/-20 kb region surrounding the gene, which includes nearby genes EIF4G1, ECE2, and EIF2B5. Association data on four of the nine variants were available from an independent sample of 8284 African American cases and 15,543 controls; associations were in the same direction, but weak and not statistically significant. TCF7L2 was the only other gene associated with type 2 diabetes at nominal p <0.01 in our data. One of the three variants in the best gene-based model for TCF7L2, rs114770437, was not correlated with the GWAS index SNP rs7903146 and may represent an independent association signal seen only in African ancestry populations. Data on this SNP were not available in the replication sample.

TI SNP-Discovery by RAD-Sequencing in a Germplasm Collection of Wild and
   Cultivated Grapevines ( V-vinifera L.)
SO PLOS ONE
AB Whole-genome comparisons of Vitis vinifera subsp. sativa and V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris are expected to provide a better estimate of the valuable genetic diversity still present in grapevine, and help to reconstruct the evolutionary history of a major crop worldwide. To this aim, the increase of molecular marker density across the grapevine genome is fundamental. Here we describe the SNP discovery in a grapevine germplasm collection of 51 cultivars and 44 wild accessions through a novel protocol of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. By resequencing 1.1% of the grapevine genome at a high coverage, we recovered 34K BamHI unique restriction sites, of which 6.8% were absent in the 'PN40024' reference genome. Moreover, we identified 37,748 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 93% of which belonged to the 19 assembled chromosomes with an average of 1.8K SNPs per chromosome. Nearly half of the SNPs fell in genic regions mostly assigned to the functional categories of metabolism and regulation, whereas some nonsynonymous variants were identified in genes related with the detection and response to environmental stimuli. SNP validation was carried-out, showing the ability of RAD-seq to accurately determine genotypes in a highly heterozygous species. To test the usefulness of our SNP panel, the main diversity statistics were evaluated, highlighting how the wild grapevine retained less genetic variability than the cultivated form. Furthermore, the analysis of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) in the two subspecies separately revealed how the LD decays faster within the domesticated grapevine compared to its wild relative. Being the first application of RAD-seq in a diverse grapevine germplasm collection, our approach holds great promise for exploiting the genetic resources available in one of the most economically important fruit crops.

TI Genome-Wide Association Study for Muscle Fat Content and Abdominal Fat
   Traits in Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio)
SO PLOS ONE
AB Muscle fat content is an important phenotypic trait in fish, as it affects the nutritional, technical and sensory qualities of flesh. To identify loci and candidate genes associated with muscle fat content and abdominal fat traits, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the common carp 250 K SNP assay in a common carp F2 resource population. A total of 18 loci surpassing the genome-wide suggestive significance level were detected for 4 traits: fat content in dorsal muscle (MFdo), fat content in abdominal muscle (MFab), abdominal fat weight (AbFW), and AbFW as a percentage of eviscerated weight (AbFP). Among them, one SNP (carp089419) affecting both AbFW and AbFP reached the genome-wide significance level. Ten of those loci were harbored in or near known genes. Furthermore, relative expressions of 5 genes related to MFdo were compared using dorsal muscle samples with high and low phenotypic values. The results showed that 4 genes were differentially expressed between the high and low phenotypic groups. These genes are, therefore, prospective candidate genes for muscle fat content: ankyrin repeat domain 10a (ankrd10a), tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing 2 (tanc2), and four jointed box 1 (fjx1) and choline kinase alpha (chka). These results offer valuable insights into the complex genetic basis of fat metabolism and deposition.

TI Genome-Wide Association of Heroin Dependence in Han Chinese
SO PLOS ONE
AB Drug addiction is a costly and recurring healthcare problem, necessitating a need to understand risk factors and mechanisms of addiction, and to identify new biomarkers. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for heroin addiction have been limited; moreover they have been restricted to examining samples of European and African-American origin due to difficulty of recruiting samples from other populations. This is the first study to test a Han Chinese population; we performed a GWAS on a homogeneous sample of 370 Han Chinese subjects diagnosed with heroin dependence using the DSM-IV criteria and 134 ethnically matched controls. Analysis using the diagnostic criteria of heroin dependence yielded suggestive evidence for association between variants in the genes CCDC42 (coiled coil domain 42; p = 2.8x10(-7)) and BRSK2 (BR serine/threonine 2; p = 4.110(-6)). In addition, we found evidence for risk variants within the ARHGEF10 (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10) gene on chromosome 8 and variants in a region on chromosome 20q13, which is gene-poor but has a concentration of mRNAs and predicted miRNAs. Gene-based association analysis identified genome-wide significant association between variants in CCDC42 and heroin addiction. Additionally, when we investigated shared risk variants between heroin addiction and risk of other addiction-related and psychiatric phenotypes using polygenic risk scores, we found a suggestive relationship with variants predicting tobacco addiction, and a significant relationship with variants predicting schizophrenia. Our genome wide association study of heroin dependence provides data in a novel sample, with functionally plausible results and evidence of genetic data of value to the field.

TI Genome-Wide Association Study of HIV Whole Genome Sequences Validated
   using Drug Resistance
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have considerably advanced our understanding of human traits and diseases. With the increasing availability of whole genome sequences (WGS) for pathogens, it is important to establish whether GWAS of viral genomes could reveal important biological insights. Here we perform the first proof of concept viral GWAS examining drug resistance (DR), a phenotype with well understood genetics.
   Method
   We performed a GWAS of DR in a sample of 343 HIV subtype C patients failing 1st line antiretroviral treatment in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The majority and minority variants within each sequence were called using PILON, and GWAS was performed within PLINK. HIV WGS from patients failing on different antiretroviral treatments were compared to sequences derived from individuals naive to the respective treatment.
   Results
   GWAS methodology was validated by identifying five associations on a genetic level that led to amino acid changes known to cause DR. Further, we highlighted the ability of GWAS to identify epistatic effects, identifying two replicable variants within amino acid 68 of the reverse transcriptase protein previously described as potential fitness compensatory mutations. A possible additional DR variant within amino acid 91 of the matrix region of the Gag protein was associated with tenofovir failure, highlighting GWAS's ability to identify variants outside classical candidate genes. Our results also suggest a polygenic component to DR.
   Conclusions
   These results validate the applicability of GWAS to HIV WGS data even in relative small samples, and emphasise how high throughput sequencing can provide novel and clinically relevant insights. Further they suggested that for viruses like HIV, population structure was only minor concern compared to that seen in bacteria or parasite GWAS. Given the small genome length and reduced burden for multiple testing, this makes HIV an ideal candidate for GWAS.

TI Genome-Wide Analysis Identifies IL-18 and FUCA2 as Novel Genes
   Associated with Diastolic Function in African Americans with Sickle Cell
   Disease
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Diastolic dysfunction is common in sickle cell disease (SCD), and is associated with an increased risk of mortality. However, the molecular pathogenesis underlying this development is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify a gene expression profile that is associated with diastolic function in SCD, potentially elucidating molecular mechanisms behind diastolic dysfunction development.
   Methods
   Diastolic function was measured via echocardiography in 65 patients with SCD from two independent study populations. Gene expression microarray data was compared with diastolic function in both study cohorts. Candidate genes that associated in both analyses were tested for validation in a murine SCD model. Lastly, genotyping array data from the replication cohort was used to derive cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) and genetic associations within the candidate gene regions.
   Results
   Transcriptome data from both patient cohorts implicated 7 genes associated with diastolic function, and mouse SCD myocardial expression validated 3 of these genes. Genetic associations and eQTLs were detected in 2 of the 3 genes, FUCA2 and IL18.
   Conclusions
   FUCA2 and IL18 are associated with diastolic function in SCD patients, and may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Genetic polymorphisms within the FUCA2 and IL18 gene regions are also associated with diastolic function in SCD, likely by affecting expression levels of the genes.

TI A Genome-Wide Search for Greek and Jewish Admixture in the Kashmiri
   Population
SO PLOS ONE
AB The Kashmiri population is an ethno-linguistic group that resides in the Kashmir Valley in northern India. A longstanding hypothesis is that this population derives ancestry from Jewish and/or Greek sources. There is historical and archaeological evidence of ancient Greek presence in India and Kashmir. Further, some historical accounts suggest ancient Hebrew ancestry as well. To date, it has not been determined whether signatures of Greek or Jewish admixture can be detected in the Kashmiri population. Using genome-wide genotyping and admixture detection methods, we determined there are no significant or substantial signs of Greek or Jewish admixture in modern-day Kashmiris. The ancestry of Kashmiri Tibetans was also determined, which showed signs of admixture with populations from northern India and west Eurasia. These results contribute to our understanding of the existing population structure in northern India and its surrounding geographical areas.

TI Literature-Informed Analysis of a Genome-Wide Association Study of
   Gestational Age in Norwegian Women and Children Suggests Involvement of
   Inflammatory Pathways
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Five-to-eighteen percent of pregnancies worldwide end in preterm birth, which is the major cause of neonatal death and morbidity. Approximately 30% of the variation in gestational age at birth can be attributed to genetic factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not shown robust evidence of association with genomic loci yet.
   Methods
   We separately investigated 1921 Norwegian mothers and 1199 children from pregnancies with spontaneous onset of delivery. Individuals were further divided based on the onset of delivery: initiated by labor or prelabor rupture of membranes. Genetic association with ultrasound- dated gestational age was evaluated using three genetic models and adaptive permutations. The top-ranked loci were tested for enrichment in 12 candidate gene-sets generated by text-mining PubMed abstracts containing pregnancy-related keywords.
   Results
   The six GWAS did not reveal significant associations, with the most extreme empirical p = 5.1 x 10(-7). The top loci from maternal GWAS with deliveries initiated by labor showed significant enrichment in 10 PubMed gene-sets, e.g., p = 0.001 and 0.005 for keywords "uterus" and "preterm" respectively. Enrichment signals were mainly caused by infection/inflammation-related genes TLR4, NFKB1, ABCA1, MMP9. Literature-informed analysis of top loci revealed further immunity genes: IL1A, IL1B, CAMP, TREM1, TFRC, NFKBIA, MEFV, IRF8, WNT5A.
   Conclusion
   Our analyses support the role of inflammatory pathways in determining pregnancy duration and provide a list of 32 candidate genes for a follow-up work. We observed that the top regions from GWAS in mothers with labor-initiated deliveries significantly more often overlap with pregnancy-related genes than would be expected by chance, suggesting that increased sample size would benefit similar studies.

TI Pleiotropic Genes Affecting Carcass Traits in Bos indicus (Nellore)
   Cattle Are Modulators of Growth
SO PLOS ONE
AB Two complementary methods, namely Multi-Trait Meta-Analysis and Versatile Gene-Based Test for Genome-wide Association Studies (VEGAS), were used to identify putative pleiotropic genes affecting carcass traits in Bos indicus (Nellore) cattle. The genotypic data comprised over 777,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers scored in 995 bulls, and the phenotypic data included deregressed breeding values (dEBV) for weight measurements at birth, weaning and yearling, as well visual scores taken at weaning and yearling for carcass finishing precocity, conformation and muscling. Both analyses pointed to the pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) as a major pleiotropic gene. VEGAS analysis revealed 224 additional candidates. From these, 57 participated, together with PLAG1, in a network involved in the modulation of the function and expression of IGF1 (insulin like growth factor 1), IGF2 (insulin like growth factor 2), GH1 (growth hormone 1), IGF1R (insulin like growth factor 1 receptor) and GHR (growth hormone receptor), suggesting that those pleiotropic genes operate as satellite regulators of the growth pathway.

TI Genome Sequencing and Comparative Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   Strains of the Peterhof Genetic Collection
SO PLOS ONE
AB The Peterhof genetic collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (PGC) is a large laboratory stock that has accumulated several thousands of strains for over than half a century. It originated independently of other common laboratory stocks from a distillery lineage (race XII). Several PGC strains have been extensively used in certain fields of yeast research but their genomes have not been thoroughly explored yet. Here we employed whole genome sequencing to characterize five selected PGC strains including one of the closest to the progenitor, 15V-P4, and several strains that have been used to study translation termination and prions in yeast (25-25-2V-P3982, 1B-D1606, 74-D694, and 6P-33G-D373). The genetic distance between the PGC progenitor and S288C is comparable to that between two geographically isolated populations. The PGC seems to be closer to two bakery strains than to S288C-related laboratory stocks or European wine strains. In genomes of the PGC strains, we found several loci which are absent from the S288C genome; 15V-P4 harbors a rare combination of the gene cluster characteristic for wine strains and the RTM1 cluster. We closely examined known and previously uncharacterized gene variants of particular strains and were able to establish the molecular basis for known phenotypes including phenylalanine auxotrophy, clumping behavior and galactose utilization. Finally, we made sequencing data and results of the analysis available for the yeast community. Our data widen the knowledge about genetic variation between Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and can form the basis for planning future work in PGC-related strains and with PGC-derived alleles.

TI A Protein Domain and Family Based Approach to Rare Variant Association
   Analysis
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   It has become common practice to analyse large scale sequencing data with statistical approaches based around the aggregation of rare variants within the same gene. We applied a novel approach to rare variant analysis by collapsing variants together using protein domain and family coordinates, regarded to be a more discrete definition of a biologically functional unit.
   Methods
   Using Pfam definitions, we collapsed rare variants (Minor Allele Frequency <= 1%) together in three different ways 1) variants within single genomic regions which map to individual protein domains 2) variants within two individual protein domain regions which are predicted to be responsible for a protein-protein interaction 3) all variants within combined regions from multiple genes responsible for coding the same protein domain (i.e. protein families). A conventional collapsing analysis using gene coordinates was also undertaken for comparison. We used UK10K sequence data and investigated associations between regions of variants and lipid traits using the sequence kernel association test (SKAT).
   Results
   We observed no strong evidence of association between regions of variants based on Pfam domain definitions and lipid traits. Quantile-Quantile plots illustrated that the overall distributions of p-values from the protein domain analyses were comparable to that of a conventional gene-based approach. Deviations from this distribution suggested that collapsing by either protein domain or gene definitions may be favourable depending on the trait analysed.
   Conclusion
   We have collapsed rare variants together using protein domain and family coordinates to present an alternative approach over collapsing across conventionally used gene-based regions. Although no strong evidence of association was detected in these analyses, future studies may still find value in adopting these approaches to detect previously unidentified association signals.

TI Genetics of Coronary Artery Disease in Taiwan: A Cardiometabochip Study
   by the Taichi Consortium
SO PLOS ONE
AB By means of a combination of genome-wide and follow-up studies, recent large-scale association studies of populations of European descent have now identified over 46 loci associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). As part of the TAICHI Consortium, we have collected and genotyped 8556 subjects from Taiwan, comprising 5423 controls and 3133 cases with coronary artery disease, for 9087 CAD SNPs using the CardioMetaboChip. We applied penalized logistic regression to ascertain the top SNPs that contribute together to CAD susceptibility in Taiwan. We observed that the 9p21 locus contributes to CAD at the level of genome-wide significance (rs1537372, with the presence of C, the major allele, the effect estimate is -0.216, standard error 0.033, p value 5.8x10(-10)). In contrast to a previous report, we propose that the 9p21 locus is a single genetic contribution to CAD in Taiwan because: 1) the penalized logistic regression and the follow-up conditional analysis suggested that rs1537372 accounts for all of the CAD association in 9p21, and 2) the high linkage disequilibrium observed for all associated SNPs in 9p21. We also observed evidence for the following loci at a false discovery rate > 5%: SH2B3, ADAMTS7, PHACTR1, GGCX, HTRA1, COL4A1, and LARP6-LRRC49. We also took advantage of the fact that penalized methods are an efficient approach to search for gene-by-gene interactions, and observed that two-way interactions between the PHACTR1 and ADAMTS7 loci and between the SH2B3 and COL4A1 loci contribute to CAD risk. Both the similarities and differences between the significance of these loci when compared with significance of loci in studies of populations of European descent underscore the fact that further genetic association of studies in additional populations will provide clues to identify the genetic architecture of CAD across all populations worldwide.

TI Transcriptome Analysis of CD4+T Cells in Coeliac Disease Reveals Imprint
   of BACH2 and IFN gamma Regulation
SO PLOS ONE
AB Genetic studies have to date identified 43 genome wide significant coeliac disease susceptibility (CD) loci comprising over 70 candidate genes. However, how altered regulation of such disease associated genes contributes to CD pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Recently there has been considerable emphasis on characterising cell type specific and stimulus dependent genetic variants. Therefore in this study we used RNA sequencing to profile over 70 transcriptomes of CD4+ T cells, a cell type crucial for CD pathogenesis, in both stimulated and resting samples from individuals with CD and unaffected controls. We identified extensive transcriptional changes across all conditions, with the previously established CD gene IFN gamma the most strongly up-regulated gene (log2 fold change 4.6; P-adjusted = 2.40x10(-11)) in CD4+ T cells from CD patients compared to controls. We show a significant correlation of differentially expressed genes with genetic studies of the disease to date (P-adjusted = 0.002), and 21 CD candidate susceptibility genes are differentially expressed under one or more of the conditions used in this study. Pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of immune related processes. Co-expression network analysis identified several modules of coordinately expressed CD genes. Two modules were particularly highly enriched for differentially expressed genes (P<2.2x10(-16)) and highlighted IFN gamma and the genetically associated transcription factor BACH2 which showed significantly reduced expression in coeliac samples (log2FC - 1.75; P-adjusted = 3.6x10(-3)) as key regulatory genes in CD. Genes regulated by BACH2 were very significantly over-represented among our differentially expressed genes (P<2.2x10(-16)) indicating that reduced expression of this master regulator of T cell differentiation promotes a pro-inflammatory response and strongly corroborates genetic evidence that BACH2 plays an important role in CD pathogenesis.

TI The Genetic Structure of Marijuana and Hemp
SO PLOS ONE
AB Despite its cultivation as a source of food, fibre and medicine, and its global status as the most used illicit drug, the genus Cannabis has an inconclusive taxonomic organization and evolutionary history. Drug types of Cannabis (marijuana), which contain high amounts of the psychoactive cannabinoid Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), are used for medical purposes and as a recreational drug. Hemp types are grown for the production of seed and fibre, and contain low amounts of THC. Two species or gene pools (C. sativa and C. indica) are widely used in describing the pedigree or appearance of cultivated Cannabis plants. Using 14,031 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 81 marijuana and 43 hemp samples, we show that marijuana and hemp are significantly differentiated at a genome-wide level, demonstrating that the distinction between these populations is not limited to genes underlying THC production. We find a moderate correlation between the genetic structure of marijuana strains and their reported C. sativa and C. indica ancestry and show that marijuana strain names often do not reflect a meaningful genetic identity. We also provide evidence that hemp is genetically more similar to C. indica type marijuana than to C. sativa strains.
