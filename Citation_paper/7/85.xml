Multipotent bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to inhibit the function of various immune cells by undefined paracrine mediators <italic>in vitro</italic>. Yet, the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived molecules has not been tested in immunological conditions <italic>in vivo.</italic> Herein, we report that the administration of MSC-derived molecules in two clinically relevant forms-intravenous bolus of conditioned medium (MSC-CM) or extracorporeal perfusion with a bioreactor containing MSCs (MSC-EB)-can provide a significant survival benefit in rats undergoing FHF. We observed a cell mass-dependent reduction in mortality that was abolished at high cell numbers indicating a therapeutic window. Histopathological analysis of liver tissue after MSC-CM treatment showed dramatic reduction of panlobular leukocytic infiltrates, hepatocellular death and bile duct duplication. Furthermore, we demonstrate using computed tomography of adoptively transferred leukocytes that MSC-CM functionally diverts immune cells from the injured organ indicating that altered leukocyte migration by MSC-CM therapy may account for the absence of immune cells in liver tissue. Preliminary analysis of the MSC secretome using a protein array screen revealed a large fraction of chemotactic cytokines, or chemokines. When MSC-CM was fractionated based on heparin binding affinity, a known ligand for all chemokines, only the heparin-bound eluent reversed FHF indicating that the active components of MSC-CM reside in this fraction. These data provide the first experimental evidence of the medicinal use of MSC-derived molecules in the treatment of an inflammatory condition and support the role of chemokines and altered leukocyte migration as a novel therapeutic modality for FHF.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>BP was supported by a National Science Foundation predoctoral fellowship.

The immunomodulatory function of MSCs was first reported after it was observed that they could evade immunosurveillance after cell transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000941-Liechty1">[5]</xref>. This ability of MSCs to alter an immune response has been exploited for therapeutic purposes as demonstrated by the case of a patient suffering from steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease who was successfully treated by the infusion of haploidentical MSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000941-LeBlanc1">[6]</xref>. I<italic>n vitro</italic> studies have subsequently shown that MSCs actively inhibit the function of several immune cells through secreted cytokines, growth factors and enzymatic action, although controversy exists on the identity of the responsible mediators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000941-Aggarwal1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000941-Zhang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000941-Meisel1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000941-Beyth1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000941-Maitra1">[11]</xref>. The fortification of the soluble microenvironment by MSCs can also affect non-hematopoietic cells as well. MSCs used for cellular cardiomyoplasty after an ischemic event revealed that MSC-derived soluble molecules inhibited hypoxia-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes during the acute phase of injury resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000941-Gnecchi1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000941-Gnecchi2">[13]</xref>. Taken together, these studies indicate that MSCs can independently affect immune and tissue cells by paracrine means.</p><p>On this basis, we hypothesized that the paracrine function of MSCs may be of therapeutic value when used in the setting of acute organ failure, wherein parenchymal cell loss is integrated with a local and systemic inflammatory response. Here, we report a significant survival benefit in the treatment of FHF after intravenous delivery of MSC biomolecules in the form of bolus injections of conditioned medium (MSC-CM) or a MSC-based extracorporeal bioreactor (MSC-EB). The survival benefit of MSC-CM was a function of the cell mass used for media conditioning and was found to have an optimum. Histological analysis of liver tissue after MSC-CM treatment showed a remarkable reduction in infiltrating leukocytes as well protection of hepatobiliary pathological changes. In addition, we show that MSC-CM actively promotes the emigration of adoptively transferred leukocytes from the injured liver. Finally, we performed a proteomic screen of the MSC secretome and detected high levels of potent chemotactic cytokines. Fractionation of MSC-CM based on affinity to heparin sulfate, a known ligand for all chemokines, revealed that the therapeutic activity of MSC-CM was restricted to the heparin bound fraction, further supporting the role of chemokines as responsible mediators.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MSC-derived components reverse FHF</title><p>We first assessed various MSC treatment modalities such as cell transplantation, delivery of cellular lysates or conditioned medium to assess the most efficacious therapy.

No significant benefit was seen after the intravenous infusion of 2×10<sup>6</sup> human MSCs 24 hours post-induction, which is most likely due to poor engraftment, entrapment in the alveolar capillary bed and/or immune rejection of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000941-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

Specifically, we have shown that an intravenous bolus of MSC-CM during active disease can reverse organ failure. The efficacy of MSC-CM was found to be a function of the cell mass from which media were conditioned suggesting important pharmacological aspects of this treatment. Treatment with a MSC-EB, which combined both the secretory and metabolic functions of MSCs in a single device, provided the greatest benefit in survival and potentially illustrates a platform to study stem cell function and the bone marrow microenvironment <italic>ex vivo</italic>. These results are significant because we have identified a non-hepatic source of human cells with minimal metabolic demands that can be expanded to clinical scale for liver assist devices and shown that MSC treatment can cross species barriers.</p><p>Histological evaluation of liver tissue after MSC-CM treatment provided initial insight into the cellular targets of therapy. A striking reduction in mononuclear leukocytes was seen post-treatment, suggesting that MSC-CM may inhibit the ability of immune cells to invade and/or function within the injured tissue. Using SPECT imaging of adoptively transferred leukocytes, we provide evidence showing altered immune cell migration after MSC-CM treatment supporting our hypothesis that MSC-CM modulated the immune response to organ injury. Interestingly, it appears that MSC-CM did not divert leukocyte trafficking from the injured site initially, but rather induced a selective emigration of homed leukocytes out of the organ. In addition, we observed prevention of hepatocyte apoptosis and inhibition of bile duct duplication after MSC-CM treatment. Further investigation is needed to determine if these are direct or indirect effects of MSC-CM as well as the temporal sequence of histological changes to evaluate which processes are the primary targets of MSC-CM and which are merely secondary effects.</p><p>Proteomic analysis of MSC-CM revealed a broad spectrum of molecules involved in immunomodulation and liver regeneration. Powered by our knowledge that MSC-CM specifically alters leukocyte migration, we first looked at chemotactic cytokines as potential mediators of the therapeutic effect of MSC-CM. Approximately 30% of MSC-CM was composed of relatively high levels of potent chemokines that, when fractionated based on heparin binding affinity, correlated with the therapeutic activity of MSC-CM. We are currently testing individual chemokines and combinations thereof to demonstrate a casual relationship. Moreover, since any positively charged molecule can ionically interact with heparin sulfate, we cannot rule out other heparin binding compounds such hepatocyte growth factor within the screen of MSC-CM.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe the first use of the secreted and metabolic functions of MSCs to derive a new class of immunotherapeutics. Whether this strategy of MSC-CM or MSC-EB therapy is a relevant means of treatment for other organ failure and inflammatory conditions should be experimentally explored.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO unless otherwise stated.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Human MSCs were isolated from commercially available bone marrow aspirates (Clonetics-Poietics, Walkersville, MD) and grown and characterized as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000941-Parekkadan1">[15]</xref>.

A total volume of 500 µl containing cells, cellular lysates, vehicle (PBS) only or 900 µl of conditioned medium was infused in the penile vein 24 hours after induction of FHF using the same anaesthesia protocol described for the cannulation procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Liver Failure Induction and Extracorporeal Bioreactor Support</title><p>The induction of fulminant hepatic failure and extracorporeal device operation is previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000941-Shinoda1">[2]</xref>. Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 280 and 370 grams were anaesthetized using intraperitoneal injections of ketamine and xylazine at 110 and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively. The left carotid artery and right jugular vein were cannulated and the animal was placed in a metabolic cage. Twenty-four hours later, 1.2 g/kg Gal-N freshly dissolved in physiological saline and adjusted to pH 7.3 with 1 N NaOH was injected i.p., followed by a second equal injection 12 hours later. Twenty-four hours after the first injection of Gal-N, the arterial and venous lines were connected to an extracorporeal circuit. Plasma was separated using a plasma separator (MicroKros, pore size 0.2 micron). Plasma was perfused through the polycarbonate, flat-plate bioreactor and subsequently reunited with the cellular components of the blood and returned to the animal. The extracorporeal bioreactor was operated for 10 hours. Animals that died during reactor operation and failed to receive adequate treatment (MSC-EB, N = 3 and Fibroblast-EB, N = 2) were censored from analysis. Animal survival was monitored every 12 hours. Plasma or whole blood was analyzed for liver injury biomarkers using a microfluidic metabolic assay (Picollo, Abaxis, Union City, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Liver Histology</title><p>Liver tissue was harvested from rats induced with a sub-lethal regimen of Gal-N (0.6 g/kg), 36 hours after treatment with MSC-CM. Tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned to 6-µm thickness, and stained with hematoylin and eosin.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Adoptive transfer of radiolabeled leukocytes</title><p>Leukocytes were isolated from whole rat blood by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl erythrocyte lysis. Cells were pelleted, washed once with PBS and resuspended in 0.9% saline containing the In<sup>111</sup> oxine isotope (GE Healthcare Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ). Cells were labeled at 92% efficiency with high viability. Approximately 15×10<sup>6</sup> cells were infused into the penile vein of Gal-N injured (0.6 g/kg) directly after treatment with vehicle or MSC-CM. SPECT images were captured using a M.CAM gamma camera setup (Siemens Medical Systems, Malvern, PA) at 0, 3 and 24 hours after leukocyte infusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Protein array of MSC supernatants</title><p>Supernatants were prepared by collecting serum-free medium after 24 hour culture of approximately 2×10<sup>6</sup> MSCs.
