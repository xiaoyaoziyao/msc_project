<abstract>
<p>Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are capable of homing to and repair damaged myocardial tissues. Apoptosis of BMSCs in response to various pathological stimuli leads to the attenuation of healing ability of BMSCs. Plenty of evidence has shown that elevated homocysteine level is a novel independent risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. The present study was aimed to investigate whether homocysteine may induce apoptosis of BMSCs and its underlying mechanisms. Here we uncovered that homocysteine significantly inhibited the cellular viability of BMSCs. Furthermore, TUNEL, AO/EB, Hoechst 333342 and Live/Death staining demonstrated the apoptotic morphological appearance of BMSCs after homocysteine treatment. A distinct increase of ROS level was also observed in homocysteine-treated BMSCs. The blockage of ROS by DMTU and NAC prevented the apoptosis of BMSCs induced by homocysteine, indicating ROS was involved in the apoptosis of BMSCs. Moreover, homocysteine also caused the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential of BMSCs. Furthermore, apoptotic appearance and mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization in homocysteine-treated BMSCs was significantly reversed by JNK inhibitor but not p38 MAPK and ERK inhibitors. Western blot also confirmed that p-JNK was significantly activated after exposing BMSCs to homocysteine. Homocysteine treatment caused a significant reduction of BMSCs-secreted VEGF and IGF-1 in the culture medium. Collectively, elevated homocysteine induced the apoptosis of BMSCs via ROS-induced the activation of JNK signal, which provides more insight into the molecular mechanisms of hyperhomocysteinemia-related cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past decades, cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality all over the word. Though the therapeutic advances have improved the survival of patients with cardiovascular diseases in clinics, the loss of cardiac cells due to apoptosis or necrosis in injured hearts can not be reversed. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have emerged as a novel therapeutic approach for cardiovascular diseases. BMSCs are found in the bone marrow, adipocytes, cord blood, peripheral blood, and fetal liver and lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Anker1">[1]</xref>, and have previously been regarded to play only a supportive role in hematopoietic homeostasis in bone marrow by secreting hematopoietic cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Bianco1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Majumdar1">[3]</xref>. Lately, increasing evidence uncovered that BMSCs are capable to differentiate into multiple cell lineages such as cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Barry1">[4]</xref>. Especially, after stimulated by inflammatory and cytokines such as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), BMSCs was shown to enter the circulating blood and then migrate to the injured hearts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Ponte1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Kortesidis1">[6]</xref>, which enable BMSCs to regenerate the myocardium by transdifferentiation, neovascularization and paracrine actions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Tang1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Gnecchi1">[9]</xref>. Nevertheless, some pathological stimuli such as hypoxia, ischemia, inflammation or acidosis commonly led to the dysfunction or apoptosis of BMSCs, which servers as a new reason of cardiovascular conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Gnecchi1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Stamm1">[11]</xref>. Several studies have displayed only modest or even low levels of local retention, survival, and differentiation of BMSCs into cardiac cells under ischemic and inflammatory injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Toma1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Wisel1">[15]</xref>. On the contrary, preconditioning of BMSCs with hypoxia or some chemicals enhanced its resistance to these damaged factors and protected BMSCs against apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Wisel1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Kim1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>As a novel important independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, hyperhomocysteinemia is strongly associated with coronary heart disease, heart infarction, stroke, atherothrombosis, peripheral vascular disease, etc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Falk1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Wald1">[18]</xref>. Elevated plasma homocysteine level induces apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, promotes proliferation of endothelial cells and activates inflammatory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Sipkens1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Danese1">[21]</xref>. Even though a large body of experimental studies demonstrated that hyperhomocystemia is a new pathogen of cardiovascular diseases, but there is, so far, no evidence of the effects of elevated homocysteine level on the proliferation and apoptosis of rat BMSCs. The present study was aimed to investigate the proapoptotic actions of homocysteine on BMSCs and explore its potential mechanisms.</p>

<title>Effects of Homocysteine on the Morphology and Viability of BMSCs</title>
<p>Firstly, we determine if homocysteine can result in the morphological changes of BMSCs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g001">Figure 1a</xref>, exposure of BMSCs to homocysteine 100, 300 and 1000 µM for 24 h caused obvious cellular morphological changes such as cellular shrinkage. Then, the influence of homocysteine on the cellular viability of BMSCs was assessed by MTT assay. As illuminated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g001">Figure 1b</xref>, pretreatment with homocysteine 100, 300 and 1000 µM for 24 h exerted remarkably inhibitory effects on the cellular viability of BMSCs (p&lt;0.05). The cellular viability of BMSCs were significantly decreased by homocysteine 100, 300 and 1000 µM to 85.59±4.69%, 82.82±4.08% and 69.27±9.97 after treatment for 24 h, respectively, but it was not altered by homocysteine 30 µM after treatment for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). Though the cellular viability of BMSCs was decreased by homocysteine, MTT can not represent the apoptosis of BMSCs induced by homocysteine. Thus, in order to confirm that homocysteine causes BMSCs apoptosis, AO/EB, Hoechest33342 and Live/Death staining were employed in this study.</p>

<title>Homocysteine Induced the Apoptosis of BMSCs</title>
<p>As displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, AO/EB double staining demonstrated that treatment with homocysteine 100 and 300 µM for 24 h induced apoptosis of BMSCs characterized by the distinctive red-orange fluorescence. Hoechest33342 staining also showed that BMSCs after exposing to different concentrations of homocysteine for 24 h displayed apoptotic morphological changes such as nucleus condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). Likewise, Live/Dead staining also showed that the percentage of staining-positive BMSCs was significantly increased from 5.5% to 28.3% and 48.7% after incubation with homocysteine 100 and 300 µM for 24 h, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g002">Figure 2c, e</xref>). We also performed TUNEL assay to observe if homocysteine induced BMSCs apoptosis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g002">Figure 2d</xref>, treatment with homocysteine 100 and 30 0µM for 24 h increased the positive apoptotic cell percentage from 2.3% to 19.8% and 41.4% in BMSCs, respectively (p&lt;0.05, n = 3 independent experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g002">Figure 2f</xref>). These studies suggest that homocysteine plays a proapoptotic role in BMSCs.</p>

<title>Homocysteine Enhanced ROS and Depolarized Mitochondrial Membrane Potential of BMSCs</title>
<p>It is well documented that reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in apoptosis of many cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Chandra1">[24]</xref>. Oxidative stresses caused by ROS are shown to initiate or promote apoptosis via oxidizing mitochondrial membrane phospholipids and depolarizing mitochondrial membrane potential which produces more ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Chandra1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Papa1">[25]</xref>. We therefore investigated the influences of homocysteine on the production of ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential by DCFH-DA staining and JC-1 staining, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, DCFH-DA staining showed that both the intensity of green inflorescence and the percentage of ROS-positive cells were significantly increased in the presence of homocysteine 300 µM for 24 h. Moreover, treatment of BMSCs with homocysteine for 24 h was able to cause the obvious depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). These indicate that ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in homocysteine-induced BMSCs apoptosis.</p>

<title>ROS was Involved in Homocysteine-induced Apoptosis of BMSCs</title>
<p>To confirm whether ROS is required for homocysteine-induced apoptosis of BMSCs, we employed two specific antioxidants DMTU and NAC. As displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g004">Figure 4a</xref>, the increase of ROS in BMSCs was obviously increased by homocysteine 300 µM after treatment for 24 h, which can be effectively reversed by individual pretreatment with DMTU and NAC. AO/EB double staining also showed that DMTU and NAC can reverse homocysteine-induced apoptosis of BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). Moreover, the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential induced by homocysteine was effectively reserved after pretreatment with DMTU and NAC for 24 h, indicating ROS-mediated mitochondrial membrane depolarization takes part in homocysteine-induced the impairment of BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g004">Figure 4c</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of MAPK Inhibitors on Homocysteine-induced Apoptosis of BMSCs</title>
<p>A large body of evidence has shown that MAPK signal pathway is involved in ROS-mediated cellular apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Shen1">[26]</xref>. However, whether MAPK signal pathway also plays a critical role in homocysteine-induced BMSCs apoptosis remain unknown. Here, we found that the specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (10 µM) could reverse homocysteine-induced BMSCs apoptosis featured by the inhibition of mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization and nucleus damage, without the impact on intracellular ROS level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Neither p38 MAKP inhibitor SB203580 (5 µM) nor ERK inhibitor PD98059 (25 µM) is able to reverse homocysteine-induced apoptotic morphological changes. These results indicate that JNK signal pathway is required for homocysteine-induced BMSCs apoptosis.</p>

<p>To confirm that JNK pathway contributed to homocysteine-induced BMSCs apoptosis, western blot was utilized to detect the expression of JNK, p38 and ERK1/2, as well as p-p53, caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2 proteins in BMSCs with or without homocysteine 300 µM treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g006">Figure 6a</xref> showed that homocysteine 300 µM can increase phosphorylated JNK expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063561-g006">Figure 6a</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We uncovered for the first time that homocysteine, a novel important independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases leads to apoptosis of BMSCs via ROS-mediating JNK pathway. Our study provides new insight into the mechanism underlying homocysteine-related BMSCs apoptosis.</p>
<p>BMSCs, not as previously considered, only played a regulatory role in hematopoietic niches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Anker1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Majumdar1">[3]</xref>. Recently studies uncovered that BMSCs also have the ability to differentiate into multiple lineages such as cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, neuron, and adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Barry1">[4]</xref>. More importantly, BMSCs in the bone marrow or peripheral blood was shown to migrate to the heart tissues, and then repair the damaged myocardium by releasing many cellular factors including VEGF-1, IGF-1, etc which may prevent heart against ischemia, oxidant stress, inflammatory injury, and also stimulate cardiac stem cells proliferation and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Crisostomo1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Korbling1">[29]</xref>. On the contrary, BMSCs dysfunction or apoptosis will exaggerate cardiovascular diseases due to the decreased mobilization and recruitment of BMSCs to injured myocardial tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Wisel1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Kim1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Elevated plasma level of homocysteine has long been known as a new risk factor for cardiovascular diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Tsai1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Malinowska1">[30]</xref>. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been shown to cause endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis, promote vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, increase platelet aggregation and accelerate thrombin formation through free radical formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Suhara1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Guthikonda1">[32]</xref>. Moreover, lots of studies also reported that hyperhomocysteinemia caused the reduction of myocardium contractility, the disruption of cardiac electrical activity, and the apoptosis or necrosis of cardiomyocytes, which is at least partially responsible for its toxic effects on hearts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Sipkens1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Cai2">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Cai5">[36]</xref>. In the light of the important role of BMSCs in maintaining and repairing cardiovascular functions, we hypothesized that homocysteine-induced apoptosis of BMSCs serve as a novel mechanism underlying hyperhomocysteinemia-related cardiovascular diseases, and the present study was therefore undertaken to determine whether increased homocysteine level is capable to induce BMSCs apoptosis.</p>
<p>In this study, we uncovered that elevated homocysteine level led to an increase of apoptosis of BMSCs characterized by cellular shrinkage, nuclei condensation and fragmentation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. Increased apoptosis of BMSCs will subsequently decrease the ability of BMSCs to repair the damaged hearts. Plenty of evidence has confirmed that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative stresses play a key role in the induction of apoptosis under both physiological and pathological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Chandra1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Papa1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Kowaltowski1">[37]</xref>. Increased ROS is responsible for the disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis and the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential which plays a critical role in maintaining cellular energy and metabolism balance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Kowaltowski1">[37]</xref>. The dysfunction of the mitochondria will trigger cellular apoptosis by causing the release cytochrome c that triggers caspase activation. In agreement, our study also revealed that exposure to homocysteine can increase intracellular ROS level and in turn cause the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential in BMSCs. To determine that ROS is required for homocysteine-induced apoptotic changes of BMSCs, two antioxidants DMTU and NAC were used to inhibit intracellular ROS accumulation induced by homocysteine. The results demonstrated that both DMTU and NAC can reverse the apoptosis of BMSCs induced by homocysteine. In addition, the inhibition of intracellular ROS with antioxidants also attenuated homocysteine-induced depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating ROS-mediate mitochondrial damage contributes to the apoptosis of BMSCs.</p>
<p>The MAPK signaling p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK has been positively implicated in the induction of apoptosis in response to oxidant stress signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Shen1">[26]</xref>. Especially, the activated p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK were frequently observed involved in ROS-mediated cellular apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Kim2">[38]</xref>. Recent studies also reported that ROS-mediated activation of p38 and JNK induce the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, which results in mitochondrial apoptotic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Kang1">[39]</xref>. In this study, we further investigated the role of MAPK signaling in ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic cell death triggered by homocysteine. The results showed that the blockage of JNK with its specific inhibitor can abrogate homocysteine-induced mitochondrial apoptotic cell death, but p38 MAPK and ERK specific inhibitors did not impact homocysteine-induced apoptosis of BMSCs. It suggests that the activation of JNK is involved in homocysteine-induced apoptotic morphological changes. We also detected the expression of caspase-3, p53 and Bcl-2 to confirm if homocysteine leads to the apoptosis of BMSCs. The results showed that homocysteine treatment caused an increase of cleave caspase-3 protein and decrease of Bcl-2 protein in BMSCs, indicating the proapoptotic role of homocysteine in BMSCs.</p>
<p>The concentration of homocysteine that we used in the cultured cells is higher than plasma homocysteine level under physiological condition, which can not be avoided since the metabolism of homocysteine was considerably upregulated in the cells in culture as described in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Chavarria1">[40]</xref>. Actually, the same or higher level of homocysteine has been widely used in a variety of previous investigations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Zhang1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063561-Chang1">[43]</xref>. Moreover, a high concentration of homocysteine is required to mimics the long-term effects of slight or middle increase of homocysteine in human bodies.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Taken together, we uncovered that increased homocysteine level enhanced intracellular ROS production and caused the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, and in turn led to the apoptosis of BMSCs via activating JNK signal. These findings lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of hyperhomocysteinemia-associated cardiovascular diseases.</p>
