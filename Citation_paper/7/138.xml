      <abstract>
        <p>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is regulated by oncogenic growth factor signals and plays a pivotal role in controlling cellular metabolism, growth and survival. Everolimus (RAD001) is an allosteric mTOR inhibitor that has shown marked efficacy in certain cancers but is unable to completely inhibit mTOR activity. ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors such as NVP-BEZ235 can block rapamycin-insensitive mTOR readouts and have entered clinical development as anti-cancer agents. Here, we show the degree to which RAD001 and BEZ235 can be synergistically combined to inhibit mTOR pathway activation, cell proliferation and tumor growth, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. RAD001 and BEZ235 synergized in cancer lines representing different lineages and genetic backgrounds. Strong synergy is seen in neuronal, renal, breast, lung, and haematopoietic cancer cells harboring abnormalities in PTEN, VHL, LKB1, Her2, or KRAS. Critically, in the presence of RAD001, the mTOR-4EBP1 pathway and tumorigenesis can be fully inhibited using lower doses of BEZ235. This is relevant since RAD001 is relatively well tolerated in patients while the toxicity profiles of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors are currently unknown.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of cell growth, proliferation and cellular metabolism, and is activated downstream of several oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Amplification and activating mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, deletions and loss of function mutations in <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>LKB1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> can all constitutively activate mTOR and its downstream signaling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Guertin1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Shaw1">[2]</xref>. mTOR functions as part of at least two multi-protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Both of these complexes have been shown to have important roles in tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Guertin2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Hsieh1">[4]</xref>. While mTORC1 promotes cell growth by phosphorylating certain substrates including S6K1 and 4EBP1, mTORC2 is thought to promote cell survival primarily via the phosphorylation of Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Wullschleger1">[5]</xref>. The high frequency of somatic and germline mutations resulting in mTOR pathway activation makes pharmacological inhibition of mTOR a promising therapeutic avenue for a variety of human cancers. Two main classes of mTOR inhibitors have been developed: allosteric inhibitors, typified by rapamycin and its derivatives (rapalogues); and ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Dancey1">[6]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Vilar1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Rapamycin (sirolimus) and its derivatives such as RAD001 (everolimus) or CCI-779 (temsirolimus) function along with their intracellular receptor FKBP12 as highly selective allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1. Binding of rapamycin to FKBP12 allows the complex to bind to mTOR which results in a conformational change in mTORC1 and inhibition of substrate phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Yip1">[9]</xref>. Rapamycin-FKBP12 does not bind mTORC2 but prolonged rapamycin treatment has been shown to interfere with mTORC2 assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Sarbassov1">[10]</xref>. RAD001 inhibits proliferation in a wide variety of tumor cell lines both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and has received FDA-approval for the treatment of a subset of cancer types including advanced renal carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine cancers, and cancers associated with hereditary tuberous sclerosis, including subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and angiomyolipomas of the kidney.</p>
      <p>ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors directly target the mTOR kinase pocket. Two classes of inhibitors are in clinical development. BEZ235 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Maira1">[11]</xref> and PI-103 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Fan1">[12]</xref> are typical dual kinase inhibitors of mTOR and PI3K, while Ku-0063794, WYE-354, PP242, Torin1 and AZD8055 represent mTOR-selective kinase inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Dancey1">[6]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Vilar1">[8]</xref>. ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors of either class can target the catalytic site of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, and have revealed the existence of rapamycin-insensitive mTORC1 outputs such as the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 T37/46 or the induction of autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Choo1">[13]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Yu1">[18]</xref>. Such catalytic mTOR inhibitors show broad preclinical antitumor activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and are currently undergoing clinical evaluation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Dancey1">[6]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Vilar1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We previously observed that RAD001 and the catalytic mTOR inhibitor Ku-0063794 can act synergistically to target rapamycin-insensitive mTORC1 outputs such as cap-dependent translation and autophagy in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Nyfeler1">[16]</xref>. Xu and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Xu1">[19]</xref> and Thomas and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Thomas1">[20]</xref> have reported that the combination of RAD001 and BEZ235 has synergistic anticancer activity in non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. In the current study, we show that the synergistic combination of RAD001 and BEZ235 is not restricted to these two tumor types, but rather inhibits mTOR signaling, cell viability and tumorigenesis broadly in several different cancer lines, representing various lineages and genetic backgrounds. In the presence of RAD001, low doses of BEZ235 resulted in anticancer activity and gene expression changes very similar to those seen with high doses of BEZ235 as single agent. These data show that RAD001 enhances the potency of BEZ235 in a profoundly synergistic manner which is of clinical relevance given the need for effective therapeutic agents at the lowest dose possible.</p>

SK-BR-3 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A (ATCC # 30-2007) complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell viability was determined by measuring cellular ATP content using the CellTiter Glo luminescence assay (Promega). One day before drug addition, 1000 cells were plated into 384-well plates (Greiner) in 30 ¬µl growth media. Cells were then incubated for 72 h with various concentrations of drugs or combinations before CellTiter Glo reagent was added to each well and luminescence recorded on an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Luminescence values were used to calculate the inhibition of cell viability relative to DMSO-treated cells (0% inhibition).</p>

Subsequently, 20 ¬µl compound-containing growth media was added to each well. Each treatment was tested in triplicate and compared to cells treated with an equivalent volume of DMSO as control. Electric impedance was measured in 15-minute intervals from the time of plating until the end of the experiment. Cell index values, which is a dimensionless parameter derived as a relative change in measured electrical impedance to represent numbers of attached cells, were calculated from the electric impedance and plotted using the RTCA software provided by the vendor.</p>

        <title>RAD001 and BEZ235 synergistically inhibit mTOR signaling and tumorigenesis</title>
        <p>We chose the PTEN null glioblastoma U-87 MG cell line as a first model to explore the combination of RAD001 and BEZ235, and monitored mTOR pathway inhibition by western blot analysis. As single agent, 20 nM RAD001 completely inhibited S6K1 T389 phosphorylation with minimal effects on 4EBP1 T37/46 phosphorylation, while 250 nM BEZ235 robustly inhibited both S6K1 T389 and 4EBP1 T37/46 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This is in line with the finding that ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors can block rapamycin-insensitive mTOR outputs such as 4EBP1 T37/46 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Choo1">[13]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Yu1">[18]</xref>. The low dose of 20 nM BEZ235 only inhibited S6K1 T389 phosphorylation but showed a robust effect on 4EBP1 T37/46 phosphorylation when combined with 20 nM RAD001, similar to the high dose of 250 nM BEZ235 as single agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This synergy was confirmed by testing RAD001 and BEZ235 in a 10√ó10 dose matrix using a phospho-4EBP1 T37/46 high-content assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, left column and lowest row reflect single agent activities of BEZ235 and RAD001, respectively). With increasing amounts of RAD001, lower doses of BEZ235 were required to inhibit 4EBP1 T37/46 phosphorylation. The interaction of RAD001 and BEZ235 was synergistic and excess inhibition scores over Loewe additivity were observed for 3.1‚Äì50 nM BEZ235 when combined with more than 0.2 nM RAD001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

        <p>To determine whether the synergistic inhibition of mTOR signaling led to reduced cell viability, the combination of RAD001 and BEZ235 was tested in a 3-day assay using CellTiter Glo as read out. As single agents, the highest doses of 150 nM RAD001 and 200 nM BEZ235 reduced cell viability 38% and 64%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The combination of 150 nM RAD001 and 200 nM BEZ235 did not have a significant additive effect and reduced cell viability 70%, similar to 200 nM BEZ235 as single agent. However, as observed for 4EBP1 T37/46 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), lower doses of BEZ235 were required to reduce cell viability when combined with RAD001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and synergistic values were observed in the Loewe additivity model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Since BEZ235 has antagonistic activity against both PI3K and mTOR kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Maira1">[11]</xref>, we tested if RAD001 could inhibit cell viability in a synergistic manner if combined with an mTOR-selective kinase inhibitor such as Ku-0063794 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-GarciaMartinez1">[15]</xref>. Like for BEZ235, lower doses of Ku-0063794 were required to reduce cell viability when combined with RAD001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), and over 20% excess inhibition over Loewe additivity were observed for doses of 556 nM up to 5000 nM Ku-0063794 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

Low doses of either 1.2 nM RAD001 or 20 nM BEZ235 clearly inhibited cell proliferation, but as single agent only the high dose of 500 nM BEZ235 was able to regress the cell index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The combination of the low doses of 1.2 nM RAD001 and 20 nM BEZ235 resulted in an almost identical growth curve as the high dose of 500 nM BEZ235, indicating a regression of cell numbers. In line with the induction of cell death, 500 nM BEZ235 as well as the combination of 1.2 nM RAD001 and 20 nM BEZ235 resulted in PARP cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). To determine whether the activity of the combination was likely achieved through pathway regulation, gene expression changes induced by RAD001 and BEZ235, either as single agents or in combination, were analyzed through gene expression profiling. Relative gene expression changes were computed for each treatment condition and then evaluated by hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). While 5 nM RAD001 and 20 nM BEZ235 resulted in few gene expression changes as single agents, the combination of 5 nM RAD001 and 20 nM BEZ235 up-regulated 373 genes and down-regulated 429 genes more than two-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048548.s002">Table S2</xref>). These gene expression changes correlated well with the effects of the high dose of 500 nM BEZ235 (Pearson's R‚Ää=‚Ää0.88) with a significant overlap of 694 genes (Fisher's p-value&lt;10<sup>‚àí16</sup>). At the pathway level (GO biological processes), the combination of RAD001 and BEZ235 predominantly regulated cell cycle-related pathways (data not shown). These results suggest that the combination of RAD001 and a low dose of BEZ235 can induce cell death in SK-BR-3 cells with gene expression changes that resemble those seen with the high dose of BEZ235 alone.</p>

      <p>Inhibition of oncogenic signaling with targeted small molecule inhibitors is a powerful therapeutic approach to treat molecularly-driven tumors. Such inhibitors can be efficacious as single agents, but improved anti-tumor activity can often be achieved by combining with other cancer therapeutics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Zimmermann1">[22]</xref>. For example, enhanced anti-tumor activity was reported by inhibiting two parallel oncogenic pathways by combining PI3K and MEK inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Engelman1">[24]</xref>. Another example is the combination of allosteric and ATP-competitive inhibitors against Bcr-Abl which maximizes target inhibition and reduces the appearance of resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Zhang1">[25]</xref>. Two previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Xu1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Thomas1">[20]</xref> and this current study illustrate that RAD001 and BEZ235 can be combined to synergistically inhibit mTOR signaling and tumor growth. Our observations suggest that lower doses of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors can achieve full target inhibition when combined with an allosteric mTOR inhibitor such as RAD001.</p>

Our new data shows that the combination with RAD001 does not enhance the maximal efficacy of BEZ235 but results in a consistent increase in its potency <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is supported by the microarray analysis showing that the combination of RAD001 and a low dose of BEZ235 results in gene expression changes very similar to the response to a high dose of BEZ235 as a single agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This suggests that the combination with RAD001 allows BEZ235 to reach its inhibitory activity at a lower concentration.</p>
      <p>We hypothesize that the binding of the FKBP12-RAD001 complex changes the conformation of mTORC1 in a way that its catalytic domain has an altered affinity for ATP-competitive inhibitors or is more accessible. Alternatively, binding of FKBP12-RAD001 might reduce the number of fully functional mTORC1 molecules thereby lowering the required dose to fully inhibit the remaining mTORC1 activity. The synergistic effect of RAD001 and BEZ235 is likely due to the action of both drugs on mTOR resulting in maximal kinase inhibition since synergy was also observed with the mTOR-selective kinase inhibitor Ku-0063794 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-GarciaMartinez1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Xu1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Thomas1">[20]</xref>. In support of this, the combination of RAD001 and BEZ235 synergistically inhibited 4EBP1 T37/46 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048548-g001">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>), a read out very proximal to mTORC1. Importantly, the synergistic effects of RAD001 and BEZ235 were observed in several different cancer models representing different lineages and genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the synergistic effects are ubiquitous.</p>
      <p>While RAD001 is relatively well tolerated in patients, its efficacy in the clinic is restricted to certain tumor indications. One potential caveat is the inability of rapalogues to inhibit mTORC2 or the rapamycin-insensitive outputs downstream of mTORC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Choo1">[13]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048548-Yu1">[18]</xref>. BEZ235 and other ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors are able to fully suppress all known mTORC1 and mTORC2 functions but their clinical toxicity profiles are currently unknown. By combining RAD001 with a low dose of BEZ235, this study opens the possibility for effective target inhibition at lower doses. It will be interesting to see if this synergy can be translated into the clinic and if the interaction of allosteric and ATP-competitive inhibitors is a phenomenon which can be applied more broadly to other targeted therapies.</p>
