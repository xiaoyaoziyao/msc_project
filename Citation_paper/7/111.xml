<abstract>
<p>Targeting the PI3K pathway has achieved limited success in cancer therapy. One reason for the disappointing activity of drugs that interfere with molecules that are important player in this pathway is the induction of multiple feedback loops that have been only partially understood. To understand these limitations and develop improved treatment strategies, we comprehensively characterized molecular mechanisms of PI3K pathway signaling in bladder cancer cell lines upon using small molecule inhibitors and RNAi technologies against all key molecules and protein complexes within the pathway and analyzed functional and molecular consequences. When targeting either mTORC1, mTOR, AKT or PI3K, only S6K1 phosphorylation was affected in most cell lines examined. Dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 required combined inhibition of PI3K and mTORC1, independent from AKT, and resulted in a robust reduction in cell viability. Long-term inhibition of PI3K however resulted in a PDK1-dependent, PIP3 and mTORC2 independent rephosphorylation of AKT. AKT rephosphorylation could also be induced by mTOR or PDK1 inhibition. Combining PI3K/mTOR inhibitors with AKT or PDK1 inhibitors suppressed this rephosphorylation, induced apoptosis, decreased colony formation, cell viability and growth of tumor xenografts. Our findings reveal novel molecular mechanisms that explain the requirement for simultaneous targeting of PI3K, AKT and mTORC1 to achieve effective tumor growth inhibition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Frequent hyperactivation and deregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ AKT/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in cancer has made it one of the most investigated therapeutic targets in tumor therapy. Class IA PI3Ks, consisting of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit, with the isoforms p110α, p110β, p110γ and p110δ, phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol-4, 5 bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2) to phosphatidylinositol- 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). This reaction is reversed by the protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref002">2</xref>]). PIP3 initiates further signaling cascades by recruiting molecules such as AKT and PDK1 via their pleckstrin homology domains. AKT, a serine-threonine kinase, is functionally activated by phosphorylation at two distinct amino acid residues, threonine 308 and serine 473, by PDK1 and mTORC2, respectively. mTORC2 is a protein complex including the kinase mTOR and rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref003">3</xref>]. Phosphorylated AKT in turn has the potential to regulate multiple downstream effectors and signaling pathways that are involved for example in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>One downstream effector is the mTORC1 protein complex, which also contains the kinase mTOR, together with regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), mLST8, Deptor and proline rich AKT substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref003">3</xref>]. Two important mTORC1 substrates are ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1). Phosphorylated S6K1 promotes the translation of 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNAs while phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 prevents its binding to eIF4E and increases cap-dependent translation, thus controlling cellular protein synthesis and cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref005">5</xref>]. In this process, phosphorylation of the aminoacid residues Thr37/46, Ser65 and Thr70 in 4E-BP1 are essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The activity of mTORC1 has multiple levels of contro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref007">7</xref>]. Raptor recruits substrates, including S6K1 and 4E-BP1, via their Tor signaling (TOS) motifs. It thus acts as a scaffolding molecule and directs the catalytic activy of mTORC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref008">8</xref>]. AKT can stimulate mTORC1 activity by GTP-bound Rheb by regulating its GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity via phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref007">7</xref>]. Activation of mTORC1 is further regulated by PRAS40 by competitive binding of its own TOS motif to Raptor. This inhibition can be reversed by PRAS40 phosphorylation at distinct sites by AKT and mTOR.</p>
<p>The first agents to target the PI3K pathway were rapamycin analogues (rapalogs), which bind to the protein FKBP-12 that complexes with mTOR, and thus allosterically inhibit mTORC1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref009">9</xref>]. These drugs have shown potential for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, mantle cell lymphoma and neuroendocrine tumors which has fueled the development of additional classes of PI3K pathway inhibitors targeting all or specific PI3K isoforms, AKT, mTOR, or both PI3K and mTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref011">11</xref>]. However, success in clinical trials has been lacking so far, with FDA approval granted only for the use of a PI3K δ inhibitor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref012">12</xref>]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibitors of the PI3K pathway can induce signaling feedback loops limiting their anti-tumor effects. For instance, rapalogs lead to increased AKT and ERK phosphorylation whereas dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors lead to overexpression of different receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref013">13</xref>]. Also, adaptive signaling responses after PI3K<bold>α i</bold>nhibition that increase PIP3 synthesis and AKT phosphorylation or enable SGK1-mediated mTORC1 activation have been recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref015">15</xref>]. Successful therapeutic targeting of PI3K signaling thus requires a thorough understanding of the biochemical effects of PI3K pathway inhibition as well as effective drug combination strategies to overcome feedback loops limiting efficacy.</p>
<p>The PI3K pathway is overactive in around 72% of metastatic urothelial bladder cancer patients, making it an attractive target for therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref016">16</xref>]. Currently, the average survival of these patients is only 12–14 months due to limited progress in therapy development since more than three decades, with PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy only recently approved as second line therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref018">18</xref>]. Clinical trials with rapalogs and other target therapies in bladder cancer have also demonstrated limited efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref022">22</xref>]. Our previous investigations have revealed that inhibition of both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 is necessary to efficiently suppress bladder cancer cell growth and proliferation. Rapalogs and AKT inhibitors, however, result in only S6K1 but not 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation, with a limited anti-proliferative effect. On the other hand, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors achieve dephosphorylation of both S6K1 and 4E-BP1, prohibiting cell cycle progression, but induce rephosphorylation of AKT after long term treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref024">24</xref>]. In this study, by using different types of PI3K pathway inhibitors and knockdown of selected molecules in the pathway we demonstrate that parallel inhibition of mTORC1 and PI3K is crucial for 4E-BP1 dephosphorlyation, independently of AKT signaling. Furthermore, we describe a novel PI3K/PDK-1 dependent but PIP3 independent feedback loop resulting in AKT rephosphorylation upon long term PI3K inhibition that might limit therapy efficacy. This feedback loop can be overcome by parallel inhibition of PI3K/AKT and mTORC1 to efficiently block PI3K signaling, induction of apoptosis and tumor growth in bladder cancer.</p>

<title>PI3K/mTOR inhibitors control S6K1 and 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation and cell viability</title>
<p>Understanding regulation of 4E-BP1 is essential for targeting the PI3K signaling pathway for tumor therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref023">23</xref>]. We extended previous data, showing that the mTORC1 inhibitor Everolimus (RAD001) robustly reduced S6K1 phosphorylation level. However, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at Thr37/46 was not or only partially affected at high concentration and Ser65 phosphorylation level of 4E-BP1 was only downregulated at high concentration in the non-responding cell lines 253J and 647V <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190854.s001">S1A Fig</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref028">28</xref>]. Cell viability was affected by 20 to 50% <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190854.g001">Fig 1E</xref>. We next tested the effects of PI3K inhibition on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation using the pan-PI3K inhibitors PIK-90 and NVP-BKM120 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref030">30</xref>]. These inhibitors dose-dependently diminished AKT phosphorylation at concentrations above 50–100 nM, accompanied by a parallel reduction in S6K1 phosphorylation and 10–50% effects on cell viability <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190854.g001">Fig 1A, 1B and 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190854.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>. 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation was observed only at higher non-specific concentrations. When using the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, which targets the kinase activities of both PI3K (IC50 4–75 nM) as well as mTOR (IC50 20 nM), dephosphorylation of S6K1 was achieved with 5 Nm <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190854.s003">S3A Fig</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref031">31</xref>].

<p>To determine whether mTORC1 or mTORC2 contributes to the observed effect, expression of either Raptor or Rictor was suppressed by specific siRNAs in combination with PIK-90.

<p>We then combined NVP-BEZ235 with the PDK1 inhibitor GSK2334470 to examine whether PDK-1 is responsible for the AKT rephosphorylation <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190854.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190854.s005">S5B Fig</xref>. GSK2334470 monotherapy resulted in AKT dephosphorylation at Thr 308 within one hour of treatment but a hyperphosphorylation at both Thr 308 and Ser 473 was observed as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref033">33</xref>]. However, combining GSK2334470 with NVP-BEZ235 successfully suppressed this rephosphorylation of AKT.</p>
<p>Recruitment of PDK1 to the cell membrane depends on generation of PIP3. In order to test PIP3 level, we used a previously validated ELISA based quantification of PIP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref015">15</xref>]. The PIP3/PIP2 ratio decreased by 95% after 1 hour of and was not restored 24 hours after NVP-BEZ235 treatment <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190854.g003">Fig 3C</xref> indicating that PIP3 is not essential for the PDK-1 dependent rephosphorylation of AKT.</p>
<p>To further examine the role of PI3K or mTOR on inducing rephosphorylation of AKT Thr308, we first treated cells with a combination of PIK-90 and GSK233470 that successfully suppressed AKT rephosphorylation <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190854.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190854.s005">S5C Fig</xref>.

INK128 treatment caused dephosphorylation of S6K1 and AKT at predominantly Ser 473 within 1 hour. However, at 24 hours AKT was rephosphorylated at both Ser and Thr residues. The Thr308 rephosphorylation could only be partially suppressed by a combination of PDK1 and mTOR inhibitors. When using NVP-BEZ235, no dephosphorylation of AKT but only of S6K1 was observed at 1 hour. Interestingly, AKT became hyperphosphorylated after long-term treatment, which could not be prevented by additional PDK1 inhibition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Understanding the complexity of the PI3K signaling pathway is a crucial prerequisite for designing therapies that overcome the present limitations in clinical application. One of the challenges is to understand the cellular response to a specific drug in a tumor entity in order to understand what kind of feedback loops as cellular rescue mechanisms are induced after treatment.</p>
<p>We have previously demonstrated that various classes of inhibitors against molecules in the PI3K pathway differ in their effects on S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation level. Understanding the regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is imperative since its inhibition is required to mediate an effective reduction in cell growth and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref035">35</xref>]. Our previous results and the present study demonstrate that the inhibition of either PI3K, AKT, mTORC1 or mTOR alone is insufficient to reduce 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in most cell lines examined, whereas dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors successfully suppress 4E-BP1 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref024">24</xref>]. Regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by parallel inactivation of both PI3K and mTOR is supported by the concentration dependency of this effect with PI3K inhibitors, PIK-90 and BKM-120, the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 as well as a combination of PIK90 and the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001. We extended these data by combining the PI3K inhibitor PIK-90 with either mTOR shRNA, Raptor or Rictor siRNA. These data indicate that concomitant inhibition of PI3K and mTORC1, but not mTORC2, results in 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation. Furthermore, AKT inhibition failed to affect 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, alone or in combination with Raptor silencing.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that the lack of 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation observed with allosteric mTORC1 inhibitors like rapalogs can be overcome by using ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref036">36</xref>]. Using INK128 as an example of this class of mTOR inhibitors, we show here that only at non-specific doses that besides mTORC1 additionally inhibit PI3K-AKT induce inhibitory effects on 4E-BP1. Raptor regulates the catalytic activity of mTOR by controlling the recognition and recruitment of substrates via their TOS motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref038">38</xref>]. Moreover, Raptor-free mTOR is capable of phosphorylating S6K1 but not 4E-BP1, providing a basis for the differential regulation of these two substrates by mTORC1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref039">39</xref>]. Our results support this notion and indicate that the regulation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR relies on the gatekeeper function of Raptor. However, silencing either Raptor or mTOR expression alone did not reduce 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and required additional PI3K inhibition. Hence, PI3K may influence Raptor function, directly or indirectly. Of note, the combined inhibition of Raptor and PI3K dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 more completely than inhibition of mTOR and PI3K. Taken together, we postulate that formation of the mTORC1 protein complex rather than regulation of mTOR kinase activity might be controlled by PI3K activity by a mechanism that is independent from the PI3K/AKT axis and which is a crucial step in the control of 4E-BP1 activation. Interestingly, dephosphorylation of S6K1 was observed using inhibitors of PI3K, AKT, PDK1 and also mTOR or mTORC1. This indicates that S6K1 is regulated by mTORC1 and that in the context of bladder cancer, inhibitors directed against upstream elements of the pathway do not activate feedback elements such as GSK1 that can rescue mTORC1 activity as described in other tumor entities[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref014">14</xref>]. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism for the regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in bladder cancer, which is mediated by PI3K and mTORC1 but is not dependent on activity of AKT <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190854.g006">Fig 6A</xref>.</p>

<p>From a translational perspective, we have also demonstrated that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors result in a greater reduction in cell viability as compared to either PI3K, AKT or mTORC1 inhibitors alone <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190854.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190854.s004">S4B Fig</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref024">24</xref>]. Previous reports investigating PI3K pathway inhibition in bladder cancer have demonstrated that cells possessing activating mutations in PIK3CA are selectively sensitive to PI3K or AKT inhibition, while TSC1 or mTOR mutations contribute to sensitivity to rapalogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref042">42</xref>]. Thus, monotherapy with those inhibitors is therefore only suitable for a highly selected patient population and final parameter for stratification have not been validated to date. We therefore investigated combination therapies to improve the efficacy in patients. The panel of cell lines included in our study possesses diverse molecular alterations in FGFR3, RAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, TSC1 and mTOR that are capable of influencing response to PI3K pathway inhibition and are very frequent in bladder cancer specimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref044">44</xref>]. Our results indicate that bladder cancer cells are sensitive to dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors regardless of their genetic background. Furthermore, this response is greater than that achieved with PI3K, AKT, mTOR or PDK1 inhibitors alone.</p>
<p>Despite the promising effects of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in cell lines, a recent clinical trial failed to demonstrate clinical benefit with NVP-BEZ235 as second line therapy in bladder cancer patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref045">45</xref>]. In this trial, stable disease or partial response were observed in 3 out of 20 patients. NVP-BEZ235 also demonstrated an unfavorable toxicity profile with 10 patients experiencing grade 3–4 adverse effects. A similar pattern of clinical efficacy and toxicity has been demonstrated in clinical trials with other tumor entities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>This failure may be explained in part by our observation that the efficacy of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors is limited by a feedback activation of AKT over time. It has previously been described that the p110β isoform results in a PIP3 dependent compensatory AKT phosphorylation following selective p110α inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref015">15</xref>]. We demonstrate here a novel feedback activation of AKT that occurs despite suppression of all PI3K isoforms, requires additional suppression of PDK1 activity and occurs independently of PIP3 synthesis, revealing an additional level of adaptive signaling after PI3K inhibition. Similar to previously published data, PDK1 inhibition alone by GSK2334470 was insufficient to control AKT dephosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref014">14</xref>]. Our results indicate that this requires additional inhibition of PI3K <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190854.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190854.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190854.s005">S5</xref> Figs. We could also observe previously described AKT rephosphorylation following treatment with mTOR kinase inhibitors that is proposed to depend on feedback activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and formation of PIP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref047">47</xref>]. In agreement with published results, this rephosphorylation could be partially suppressed by additional PDK1 inhibition for one hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref033">33</xref>]. However, at 24 hours this combination was insufficient to suppress AKT phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that this is due to persistence of PI3K activity and demonstrate a tight interplay between mTOR, PI3K and PDK1 that can induce AKT rephosphorylation surprisingly also independently of PIP3. The key molecule for maintaining phosphorylated AKT despite concurrent mTOR and PDK1 inhibition seems to be PI3K. This suggests a novel link between PI3K and AKT, independent of PIP3 dependent PDK1 regulation of AKT phosphorylation <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190854.g006">Fig 6B</xref>. Previously described PIP3 independent mechanisms of PDK1 mediated regulation of AKT might play a role in this process and raise the intriguing possibility that PI3K controls these processes by regulating protein complex formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0190854.ref048">48</xref>]. Hence, if AKT should not be targeted directly, for sustained dephosphorylation of AKT both PI3K and PDK1 must be simultaneously inhibited. These compensatory signaling mechanisms might operate to ensure the persistence of activated AKT to enable or maintain cell proliferation in the presence of inhibitory signals.</p>
<p>AKT hyperphosphorylation resulting from dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors was suppressed by a combination treatment with AKT or PDK1 inhibitors. This combination was synergistic and resulted in apoptosis induction, reduced colony formation ability and decreased tumor growth, as compared to dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition alone <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190854.g006">Fig 6C</xref>. The combination therapy also demonstrated DRI values greater than 1, which might permit a reduction in the dose of NVP-BEZ235 to avoid its dose-dependent toxicities. The combined inhibition of PI3K, AKT and mTOR ensures the dephosphorylation of the essential downstream targets S6K1, 4E-BP1 and AKT and is required for an effective and sustained reduction in tumor growth. This pre-clinical study provides an explanation for the limitations of the efficacy of targeting the PI3K pathway in the clinic. We also present a novel treatment regimen that might benefit a broad range of patients and could limit dose-dependent toxicities.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The PI3K signaling pathway is frequently altered in cancer and thus provides an attractive target for cancer therapy. However, inhibitors against this pathway showed very disappointing results in clinical trials. We present a comprehensive analysis of functional and biochemical effects using different classes of inhibitors to understand limitations and improve therapy designs used to date. Our results demonstrate that PI3K/mTORC1 regulate 4E-BP1 phosphorylation independent from AKT. Long-term inhibition of PI3K results in PDK1 mediated rephosphorylation of AKT. Simultaneous targeting of PI3K, AKT and mTOR is required for effective tumor suppression by promoting sustained AKT, S6K1 and 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation and induction of apoptosis. Since this therapy acts synergistic it might reduce adverse effects as well as improve patient response.</p>
