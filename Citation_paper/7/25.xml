<abstract>
<p>Adult females of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> are facultative blood sucking insects and vectors of Dengue and yellow fever viruses. Insect dispersal plays a central role in disease transmission and the extremely high energy demand posed by flight is accomplished by a very efficient oxidative phosphorylation process, which take place within flight muscle mitochondria. These organelles play a central role in energy metabolism, interconnecting nutrient oxidation to ATP synthesis, but also represent an important site of cellular superoxide production. Given the importance of mitochondria to cell physiology, and the potential contributions of this organelle for <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> biology and vectorial capacity, here, we conducted a systematic assessment of mitochondrial physiology in flight muscle of young adult <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> fed exclusively with sugar. This was carried out by determining the activities of mitochondrial enzymes, the substrate preferences to sustain respiration, the mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency and capacity, in both mitochondria-enriched preparations and mechanically permeabilized flight muscle in both sexes. We also determined the substrates preferences to promote mitochondrial superoxide generation and the main sites where it is produced within this organelle. We observed that respiration in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mitochondria was essentially driven by complex I and glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase substrates, which promoted distinct mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities, but with preserved efficiencies. Respiration mediated by proline oxidation in female mitochondria was strikingly higher than in males. Mitochondrial superoxide production was essentially mediated through proline and glycerol 3 phosphate oxidation, which took place at sites other than complex I. Finally, differences in mitochondrial superoxide production among sexes were only observed in male oxidizing glycerol 3 phosphate, exhibiting higher rates than in female. Together, these data represent a significant step towards the understanding of fundamental mitochondrial processes in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, with potential implications for its physiology and vectorial capacity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> female mosquitoes are facultative blood sucking insects and this unusual dietary source is absolutely essential not only to trigger the oogenesis process, but also to transmit pathogens, such as the viruses that cause Dengue and yellow fever. Collectively, these diseases afflict nearly 400 million individuals each year globally and increasing concern on public health has prompted policies directing vectors control in endemic areas [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The adult individuals of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> exhibit remarkable sexual dimorphism, where males can clearly be distinguished from the females by a number of morphological and behavioral features [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These sexual differences can also be extended to other aspects of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> biology, such as gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], hemocyte counts, and pathogen-induced immune response [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Dispersal of adult <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> individuals plays a central ecological and medical role and field studies pointed out that a wide range of distances are covered by this insect [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Insect flight is accomplished by the contractile activity of flight muscle, which has an extremely high energy demand, and represents one of the most metabolic active tissues found in nature. The metabolic provision to power flight is diverse and the substrates required for this purpose depend on the species, flight duration, diet and aging [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, in honeybees carbohydrates seems to be the sole energy source to sustain flight activity [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], whereas in locusts, carbohydrates are oxidized only at the initial periods of flight, being further replaced by lipids [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Beyond these substrates, proline was also reported to play a key energetic role during flight activity in many insect species [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, the high rates of proline oxidation observed in blood sucking insects would represent an important adaptation to blood feeding habit [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Also, hemolymph levels of proline are quite high in many blood feeding insect vectors of neglected tropical diseases (NTD), representing the most abundant aminoacid found in that fluid [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another important energetic substrate in flight muscle is glycerol 3 phosphate (G3P), which connects glycolysis and the ubiquinone reduction, channeling electrons from cytosol directly into the mitochondrial electron transport system [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. G3P oxidation is not only directly involved on the re-oxidation of cytosolic NADH produced during glycolysis in insect flight muscle [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], but also on the generation of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Since the so-called "sarcosomes" were defined as mitochondria in insect flight muscle [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], a number of studies have demonstrated the structural and functional properties of these organelles in that tissue [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, despite the dominance of insects as a major taxonomic group in number of species [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], studies devoted to explore mitochondrial physiology in this important group remain largely underrepresented in the literature (only about 1.8% of all mitochondrial studies found to date in Pubmed). In this sense, a brief survey over the literature searching the respiratory activities of flight muscle mitochondria in different insect species was compiled in <xref rid="pone.0120600.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We can observe that mitochondrial respiratory rates during phosphorylating conditions varies greatly among insect species and substrates, in such a way that complex I substrates contribute more importantly to oxygen consumption in some species (<italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Popillia</italic>, <italic>Manduca</italic>), while G3P oxidation plays a prominent role in respiration in others (<italic>Magicicada</italic>, <italic>Calliphora</italic>, <italic>Locusta</italic> and <italic>Bombus</italic>). With exception of the bumblebee, all NADH-dependent respiratory rates were expressively higher in insects when compared to vertebrate heart and skeletal muscle. Similarly, G3P-mediated respiration in insect flight muscle mitochondria were in general higher than in vertebrate muscle mitochondria, with respiratory rates of <italic>Manduca</italic> and <italic>Popillia</italic> similar to vertebrate skeletal muscle, with the highest respiration observed in <italic>Locusta</italic> (5.6 times higher than in <italic>Popillia</italic>). Thus, high respiratory rates of insect flight muscle mitochondria agrees with the concept of intense oxidative metabolism in flight muscle which is essential to provide the huge energy demand posed by flight. In fact, most of the ATP required to sustain muscle contraction and flight activity are essentially provided by a highly efficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process within flight muscle mitochondria. These organelles play a central role in energy and redox metabolism, interconnecting the energy transduction, by means of carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids oxidation, to ATP synthesis. The electron flow at the inner membrane is channeled to ubiquinone by distinct sites, which are further transferred to complex III, cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase and finally to molecular oxygen by the electron transport system (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The energy released by electron flow is partially conserved as a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, known as the protonmotive force (pmf), which is utilized to allow ATP generation by the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase complex activity. Mitochondrial function is also directly involved on cellular redox balance, representing an important source of the so-called reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contributes to a number of redox-dependent signaling cascades [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The mechanisms involved on mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ROS generation are complex and highly regulated, and the contribution of mitochondrial physiology to basic aspects of insect biology has previously been appraised [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Interestingly, recent evidence pointed out that proline oxidation promotes mitochondrial ROS formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight muscle, which occurs essentially at levels of complex I and II [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Particularly relevant in the context of NTD insect vectors, recent evidence demonstrate the involvement of mitochondrial processes mediating the innate immune response against pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>

<p>Previous investigations of mitochondrial physiology in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle revealed that both respiration and ADP phosphorylation were induced by tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, in DDT-sensitive reactions [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Our group has shown that in females of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, flight muscle mitochondrial oxygen consumption and hydrogen peroxide generation were transiently reduced along the blood digestion cycle [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interestingly, these effects were parallel to reduced cytochrome levels and activation of mitochondrial fusion. Therefore, in an effort to understand fundamental aspects of mitochondrial physiology in this important NTD insect vector, we carried out here a systematic functional assessment of this organelle in flight muscle of young adult <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> fed exclusively with sugar. This was accomplished by examining the activities of tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport system enzymes, the contribution of different substrates on respiration and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation, the mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency and capacity, the sites of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation, as well as the differences observed in all these parameters between the sexes. The data presented here indicate that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mitochondria utilize preferentially complex I and glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) substrates to sustain respiration, presenting distinct mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities among these substrates, but with preserved efficiency. In addition, the contribution of proline oxidation to respiration in female mitochondria was strikingly higher than in males. Mitochondrial superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup>) production is essentially mediated through proline and G3P oxidation, which takes place at distinct electron transport system points other than complex I site I<sub>F</sub>. Finally, sexual differences on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation were only observed when using G3P as substrate, with male mitochondria exhibiting higher rates of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> formation than females. Therefore, the set of data described here represent a significant step towards the understanding of mitochondrial functional processes in this important insect NTD vector, with potential implications for dispersal, reproduction, survival, aging, insecticide resistance and pathogen transmission.</p>

<p>Mitochondria isolation from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle was carried out by using a method previously established by our group with minor modifications [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. About 120 mosquitoes were immobilized by chilling on ice, dissected to obtain the thoraxes, and then gently homogenized in a 15 mL Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder in a Teflon pestle with 10 mL of ice-cold isolation medium (250 mM sucrose, 5 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EGTA, 1% (w/v) fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4).

<title>Enzymatic activities</title>
<p>Enzyme activities were determined in mitochondrial preparations following methods described in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] with modifications by incubating 1.7 mg of mitochondrial preparation in 0.1 mL of hypotonic buffer (25 mM potassium phosphate and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.2) and subsequently subjected to three freeze-thawing cycles. The enzyme activities were measured at room temperature, in 1 mL of 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 (complex I-III) or hypotonic buffer (complex IV), using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer model visible 2450 (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). All enzyme activities in this study were determined using samples corresponding to about 80 μg of mitochondrial protein and at least three separate cohorts of insects. NADH:Cyt<sub>c</sub> oxido-reductase activity was measured as the increase in absorbance at 550 nm due to the ferricytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μM cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, 200 μM NADH, 1 mM KCN and followed by a sample of freeze-thawed mitochondria and the absorbance was monitored at 550 nm for about 10 minutes. Rotenone (0.5 μM) was added to inhibit complex I activity, which was considered as the rotenone-sensitive rate of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction (ε = 18.7 mM<sup>−1</sup> · cm<sup>−1</sup>). Proline:Cyt<sub>c</sub> oxido-reductase was measured in the same conditions described for NADH:Cyt<sub>c</sub> oxido-reductase activity, but using 25 mM of proline as substrate and 2.5 μg/mL antimycin A to inhibit complex III, instead of rotenone. G3P:Cyt<sub>c</sub> oxido-reductase was measured in the same conditions described for NADH:Cyt<sub>c</sub> oxido-reductase activity, but using 20 mM of <italic>sn</italic>-glycerol 3 phosphate as substrate and 2.5 μg/mL antimycin A to inhibit complex III, instead of rotenone. Palmitoylcarnitine (PC):Cyt<sub>c</sub> oxido-reductase was measured in the same conditions described for NADH:Cyt<sub>c</sub> oxido-reductase activity, but using 10 μM of palmitoylcarnitine as substrate and 2.5 μg/mL antimycin A to inhibit complex III, instead of rotenone. Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase activity was measured by following the decrease in absorbance due to the oxidation of ferrocytochrome <italic>c</italic> (ε = 18.7 mM<sup>−1</sup> · cm<sup>−1</sup>). The reaction was initiated by the addition of freeze-thawed mitochondria and the reduction in absorbance was monitored at 550 nm.

Citrate synthase (CS) activity was determined spectrophotometrically [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] by incubating a sample corresponding to 17 μg of protein from freeze-thawed mitochondria, in 75 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.03 mM acetyl-CoA and 0.25 mM DTNB. The rate of reduced coenzyme A (CoASH) production was determined using the thiol reagent 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), which has an absorption maximum at 412 nm.

<p>The respiratory activity of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria was analyzed in a two-channel titration injection respirometer (Oxygraph-2k, Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) at 27.5°C. Aliquots corresponding about 200 μg of protein from freshly isolated mitochondria were transferred to the respirometer chambers containing the "respiration buffer" in a final volume of 2.2 mL and allowed to equilibrate for about 15 minutes, with continuous stirring set up at 750 rpm. Then, the oxygen concentrations and the rates of oxygen consumption were simultaneously recorded in real time in both respirometer chambers by using the DatLab 4.0 software (Oroboros Inc., Austria). The routine of electron transport system activities in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mitochondria was carried out by following the high resolution respirometry (HRR) analyses coupled to substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor titration (SUIT) protocols established in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. HRR-SUIT analyses were conducted using three distinct oxidizable substrate combinations as following: pyruvate + proline (Pyr+pro), <italic>sn</italic>-glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P), and palmitoylcarnitine + malate (PC+Mal) as indicated in different colors fonts in <xref rid="pone.0120600.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. The routine was started by the addition of substrates to final concentrations of 10 mM Pyr + 10 mM pro, 20 mM G3P, or 10 μM PC + 10 mM Mal. When using G3P, 0.5 μM rotenone was added before substrates addition in order to avoid electron backflow from glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) to complex I. ATP synthesis coupled to oxygen consumption through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) was promoted by the addition of 1 mM ADP followed by a second shot reaching a final ADP concentration of 2 mM. The substrates concentration utilized in this work to induce ADP-stimulated respiration were established based on previous experiments showing that, in these conditions, oxygen consumption was maximum (data not shown). Then, 10 μM cytochrome <italic>c</italic> were added to each respirometer chamber and the absence of a significant stimulatory effect on respiration was used as a quality control test for integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The maximum non-coupled respiration was induced by stepwise titration of carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) from 0.5 to 3 μM. The contribution of complexes I and III on electron flow were determined by the addition of 0.5 μM rotenone and 2.5 μg/mL antimycin A, respectively. All the routine experiments were carried out in a range of oxygen concentration from 240 nmol/mL to about 100 nmol/mL. Typical traces of oxygen consumption by isolated mitochondria are shown in <xref rid="pone.0120600.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref> The contribution of four different dehydrogenases of the electron transport system to respiration was assessed in isolated mitochondria, by calculating the inhibitory effect of complex I (rotenone) and complex III (antimycin a) using different substrates, as following: complex I-mediated respiration was calculated as the FCCP-uncoupled pyr+pro-induced oxygen consumption rates, subtracted by the rotenone-insensitive rates. Respiration linked to proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) was determined as the rotenone-insensitive rates using pyr+pro as substrates, subtracted by the antimycin-resistant respiration. G3PDH-dependent respiration was calculated as the G3P-induced oxygen consumption rates with FCCP, subtracted by the antimycin-insensitive rates. Electron transfer flavoprotein:quinone oxidoreductase (ETF:QOR)-linked respiration was calculated as the rotenone-insensitive rates using PC+Mal as substrates, subtracted by the antimycin-resistant respiration, whereas the complex I-dependent respiration in this substrate combination was calculated as the PC+Mal-induced oxygen consumption rates with FCCP, subtracted by rotenone-insensitive rates.</p>

Briefly, adult mosquitoes (5–7 days old), were immobilized by chilling on ice onto a pre-cooled Petri dish and then dissected to obtain the thoraces. To determine the respiratory capacities, the flight muscle were accessible by cracking the thoraces using fine forceps and then a single thorax was immediately transferred into the O2k chamber containing 2.2 mL of the "respiration buffer" (120 mM KCl, 5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3 mM Hepes, 1 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.2% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) supplemented with 280 U/mL of catalase. Respirometry analyses were performed at 27.5° C, using DatLab 4.0 software (Oroboros Inc., Austria), with continuous stirring at 750 rpm and all experiments started by registering the endogenous substrate supported respiration, following the HRR-SUIT protocols established in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In order to prevent limitations in oxygen diffusion and artificial hypoxic conditions, we carried out all experiments with whole flight muscle in an environment enriched with oxygen within the O2k chamber (O<sub>2</sub> concentrations maintained between 400 and 520 nmol/mL), as recommended by the literature [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Experiments started by injecting a suitable amount of oxygen-enriched gaseous mixture (70% O<sub>2</sub> and 30% N<sub>2</sub> mol/mol) into the O2k-chamber to reach an oxygen concentration of about 500 nmol/mL. To avoid substantial drops in oxygen levels and the risk of bubble formation within the oxygraph chamber during the experiments, we injected small volumes (μL) of a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stock solution (200 mM) into the O2k-chamber. The routine of electron transport system activities in flight muscle tissue was the same utilized for isolated mitochondria and was carried out using either 10 mM Pyr+pro or 20 mM G3P as substrates. The concentrations of substrates and OXPHOS modulators were established based on the data obtained for isolated mitochondria.

Briefly, 0.17 mg of mitochondrial preparations were incubated in the presence of 1.0 unit/mL horseradish peroxidase (Sigma Co., USA) on “respiration buffer” and the same substrates concentrations described for respirometry above.

Typical amplex red fluorescence traces are shown in <xref rid="pone.0120600.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig.</xref> Standard curves of reagent-grade H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Merck, Germany) were performed in the presence of each pharmacological OXPHOS modulator as well as of 0.17 mg of mitochondrial protein. To assess the topology of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation sites, we utilized classical electron transport system inhibitors aiming the manipulation of the redox states of specific sites within mitochondria. Then, mitochondria were incubated with the four different substrates investigated for respirometry plus ADP, oligomycin and FCCP (5 μM) and the effects of sequential addition of rotenone and antimycin A on the amplex red fluorescence rates were registered. Specific contribution of site I<sub>F</sub> of complex I to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production using pyr+pro as substrates was assessed and calculated by subtracting the rates induced by 0.5 μM rotenone from their respective rates of FCCP. Although this rotenone concentration was established by its ability to block NADH-induced cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction in submitochondrial particles of <italic>Aedes</italic> flight muscle mitochondria and substantiated by its capacity to inhibit respiration driven by pyr + pro or PC+Mal, it is possible that the contribution of site I<sub>F</sub> of complex I to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production would be affected by higher levels of rotenone. The remaining sites of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation promoted by pyr+pro comprised ProDH and other dehydrogenases [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] that were not assigned in this work, and calculated by subtracting the rates of amplex red fluorescence induced by antimycin a by their respective rates obtained by rotenone.

<title>b) Cytochrome c is essentially reduced by means of NADH and G3P oxidation</title>
<p>Our first approach to investigate mitochondrial physiology in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle was determine the activities of six distinct electron transport system enzyme complexes and citrate synthase (CS). Since several substrates are utilized as electrons sources to reduce ubiquinone, as the common intermediate electron acceptor in many organisms (see the substrates depicted in different colors on <xref rid="pone.0120600.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and ref [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]), we assessed the activities of four different electron transport system branches coupled to cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction using NADH, G3P, proline, and PC as substrates, as well as the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase activity. <xref rid="pone.0120600.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the absolute and CS-normalized electron transport system complex activities found in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mitochondria from both sexes. We observed that cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase activity exhibited the highest levels compared to all other electron transport system enzymes, whereas PC oxidation was unable to promote cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction. This strongly indicates that lipids are not suitable substrates to support respiration in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle, as previously suggested [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. CS activities were high and compatible with values obtained for other insects [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The electron transport system enzymatic profile normalized by CS followed a pattern very close to the absolute activity values, with G3P and NADH as the main substrates to allow cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase exhibiting the highest activity. These data demonstrate that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria utilize complex I and G3P dehydrogenase (G3PDH) as the main electron fueling sites to reduce cytochrome <italic>c</italic>.

<title>c) Pyuvate+proline and G3P are the main substrates to fuel flight muscle mitochondrial oxygen consumption</title>
<p><xref rid="pone.0120600.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the compiled published data on respiration induced by complex I (NADH-dependent) and G3PDH (G3P-dependent) from flight muscle of seven different insect species, and vertebrate heart and skeletal muscle during phosphorylating conditions (ADP). A closer look on these data reveal very interesting patterns, such as the extremely high respiratory rates of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitochondria when use complex I substrates [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], as well as when <italic>Locusta</italic> use G3P [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], pointing out the preferential substrates use to fuel flight activity. Curiously, our previous data on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> indicated that this insect utilized almost equally complex I (using pyr+pro) and G3PDH (G3P-dependent) substrates to fuel oxygen consumption [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Considering complex I substrates, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle respiratory rates were markedly lower compared to most insect species, resembling the rates observed in bumblebee [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and vertebrate mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Thus, in order to improve our understanding of mitochondrial respiratory capacities and substrates dependences in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria, we utilized HRR-SUIT protocols for this purpose [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p>
<p><xref rid="pone.0120600.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref> shows representative oxygen flux traces of flight muscle mitochondria of both <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> females and males during typical HRR-SUIT experiments. The routine described in the methods section was applied to assess the contribution of three different substrates combinations: 10 mM Pyr+Pro; 20 mM G3P, 10 μM PC + 5 mM Mal on oxygen fluxes in isolated mitochondria from females (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and males (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>) of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. When mitochondria from females (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) were incubated only with substrates ("Leak") the respiratory rates were in general low. This metabolic state is defined by a non-phosphorylating respiratory condition that is essentially limited by the magnitude of the protonmotive force (pmf), and the respiratory rates are compensated by the proton leak, relieving the inhibitory effect of high pmf on the oxygen flux. The highest oxygen fluxes on both phosphorylating (ADP) and uncoupled (FCCP) metabolic states in female mitochondria were obtained when using Pyr+Pro as substrates, followed by G3P, and PC+Mal. Interestingly, the high respiratory rates induced by Pyr+pro may explain the complete depletion of glycogen stores in fat body and flight muscle after flight to exhaustion [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. On the other hand, the low rates of oxygen fluxes induced by PC+Mal strongly indicates that fatty acid oxidation is not a major pathway to provide the energy required to sustain <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight activity, which is in contrast to other insect species [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The limited capacity of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria to use fatty acid oxidation to sustain respiration shown in Tables <xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> is in line with the undetectable capacity of PC to promote cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). It is long known that Dipteran insects, the order which belong <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and other mosquitoes, utilize mostly carbohydrate (glucose) and aminoacid (proline) as substrates to sustain flight activity, exhibiting respiratory quotients close to unity [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Indeed, glycogen stores were depleted in the fat body and flight muscle of <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes after flight to exhaustion, despite the fat deposits remained stable [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Later, it was demonstrated that particulate fractions of <italic>Aedes</italic> flight muscle were unable to oxidize -hydroxybutyrate [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. More recently, a comprehensive study demonstrated that <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes were unable to use ketone bodies, as well as octanoate and octanoylcarnitine to sustain respiration [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Interestingly, comparisons of fatty acid oxidation of these mitochondria with those from locust and mammalian muscle revealed that octanoylcarnitine oxidation is fairly high in these latter two, but completely absent in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Also, despite carnitine play a key role in allowing fatty acid oxidation in flight muscle of some insects [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], its presence and metabolism cannot be directly assumed as a proxy of fatty acid oxidation capacity. A good example in this regard is the blowfly <italic>Phormia regina</italic>, which is unable to oxidize fatty acids to sustain respiration [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], but exhibit high levels of carnitine as well as an active acetyl carnitine transferase [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Unexpectedly, carnitine in this insect revealed to be important for pyruvate metabolism by allowing acetylcarnitine formation from pyruvate decarboxylation, which prevent CoA and ATP depletion [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In this sense, we think that limited fatty acid oxidation in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria is not related to CoA depletion, since most experiments conducted here (with the exception of <xref rid="pone.0120600.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were carried out in the presence of malate, which generates oxaloacetate and then allow CoA recycling by promoting CS reaction. Therefore, the low contribution of fatty acid to respiration in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mitochondria is not related to a specific substrate, co-factors depletion or the availability/utilization of other fatty acids. Rather, our data strength the general trend observed in all Dipteran insects that fatty acid oxidation would play a minor (if any) role on respiration in flight muscle mitochondria of these particular group of insects.</p>

<p>Proline oxidation plays a key energetic role to sustain flight activity in many insect species [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] including <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Indeed, in <xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> we demonstrate that at least 90% of electrons are directed to electron transport system through complex I activity when <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria utilize Pyr+Pro as substrates, based on the inhibitory effect of rotenone during uncoupled state. It is important to consider that part of these electrons are also derived from mitochondrial proline metabolism since the oxidation of this aminoacid occurs at four distinct sites (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) with the first one catalyzed by ProDH, channeling the electrons directly to ubiquinone and then to molecular oxygen by the electron transport system. The other three steps occur at Δ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase and the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, which are all coupled to NADH generation [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Complex I also was the major route of electrons entry at the electron transport system when using PC+Mal as substrates, but with a strikingly reduced contribution to respiration in absolute values when compared to Pyr+Pro (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, complex I at Pyr+pro <italic>vs</italic>. complex I at PC+Mal). Finally, similar trends on substrate dependence of respiratory rates were observed in flight muscle mitochondria from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> males, with complex I, using pyr+pro as substrates, and G3PDH the major sites of electron entry at the electron transport system (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig.</xref>). Remarkably, the contribution of ProDH to respiration in male mitochondria was lower than in females, suggesting that metabolism of this aminoacid is distinct among sexes. The sexual differences related to mitochondrial physiology, and the respiration driven by proline oxidation will be addressed later in this manuscript.</p>

<title>d) Mitochondrial physiology in A. aegypti flight muscle can be studied in situ without organelle isolation</title>
<p>We next investigated the possibility to study mitochondrial physiology <italic>in situ</italic> using whole flight muscle from individual <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> insects, instead of isolated mitochondria. Similar approaches have also been applied to study flight muscle mitochondria in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and revealed the enormous potential of this methodology to investigate mitochondrial function in a more physiological way. This approach has a number of advantages, allowing: <italic>i)</italic> the study of mitochondrial function in the natural cellular environment; <italic>ii)</italic> the preservation of contacts between mitochondria and other organelles; <italic>iii)</italic> the assessment of mitochondrial oxygen consumption using reduced number of insects, and <italic>iv)</italic> the bypass of time-consuming and stressful methods employed to obtain enriched mitochondrial preparations. For this sake, we developed a procedure (see <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">methods</xref> section) to measure <italic>in situ</italic> substrate-induced oxygen consumption rates on whole <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle, based on the literature [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. During our first experiments, we observed that physical permeabilization of flight muscle, provided by the magnetic stirring of the respirometer, was enough to allow free access of substrates and OXPHOS inhibitors on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle, without affecting mitochondrial structure (data not shown). In order to avoid respiratory limitation in flight muscle bundles due to restricted oxygen diffusion, we maintained the oxygen tension of about 450 nmol/mL during all measurements [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. <xref rid="pone.0120600.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref> show two representative HRR-SUIT oxygen flux traces of a single <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> thorax from female (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig.</xref>) or male (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig.</xref>) using Pyr+Pro as substrates. Interestingly, the effects of all OXPHOS modulators on oxygen consumption observed on isolated mitochondria (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref>) were replicated using permeabilized flight muscle, in both sexes using Pyr+Pro (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref>) or G3P as substrates (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>). We then investigated the respiratory pattern of permeabilized flight muscle using only these two substrates, since they induced the highest cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction and respiratory rates in isolated mitochondria (Tables <xref rid="pone.0120600.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Figs. <xref rid="pone.0120600.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A</xref>). We assessed the quality of our measurements in terms of structural intactness of mitochondria, by evaluating the effects of two compounds on oxygen fluxes: <italic>i)</italic> ADP, which would reflect the OXPHOS functionality, and <italic>ii)</italic> cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, which increase the respiratory rates when the structure of mitochondrial outer membrane is compromised [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In <xref rid="pone.0120600.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, we observed that when female flight muscles were incubated only with substrates ("Leak" condition) the respiratory rates induced by G3P were significantly higher when compared to Pyr+Pro (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), following the same pattern with isolated mitochondria (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, "Leak" at G3P <italic>vs</italic>. Pyr+Pro). "Leak" respiratory rates were also significantly higher in male flight muscle when using G3P compared to Pyr+Pro (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Also, ADP significantly increased the respiratory rates, regardless the substrate and sex, and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> caused no significant change on oxygen fluxes, indicating the preserved structure of mitochondria in permeabilized flight muscle (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> Figs). The respiratory rates during phosphorylating (ADP) and uncoupled (FCCP) conditions were significantly higher (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) when using Pyr+pro as substrates than with G3P (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, maximum respiration (uncoupled by FCCP) induced by G3P correspond to only 43.7% of Pyr+Pro respiratory rates, strengthening the preference of these substrates to sustain the high energy demands posed by flight. We also observed that under ADP phosphorylation, the respiratory rates of permeabilized flight muscle using Pyr+Pro and G3P represented 88.3% and 88% of uncoupled oxygen consumption, respectively, indicating that ATP synthesis in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle demand a large proportion of the maximum respiratory capacity regardless the substrate. Rotenone and antimycin-insensitive oxygen consumption rates represented 11.4% and 3.4%, respectively, of uncoupled respiration, indicating that at least 88% of the electrons in this substrate combination are channeled to the electron transport system by complex I. Indeed, Figs. <xref rid="pone.0120600.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B</xref> shows that the contribution of different dehydrogenases on the maximum respiratory rates in permeabilized muscle, which is essentially maintained by complex I, using Pyr+pro, and G3PDH activities in both sexes (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>: females &gt; 94%; <xref rid="pone.0120600.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig.</xref>: males &gt; 98% of total), whereas the direct contribution of ProDH to respiration plays a minor role (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>: females &gt; 5.3%; <xref rid="pone.0120600.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig.</xref>: males &gt; 1.4% of total). Similarly to what we found on isolated mitochondria, proline oxidation coupled to respiration was more prominent in females than in males, strengthening the concept that females were more adapted to utilize this aminoacid to sustain respiration [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Finally, a comparison of respiratory data obtained for whole flight muscle and isolated mitochondria for both sexes using Pyr+pro or G3P (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig.</xref>) revealed the striking proportionality of oxygen fluxes obtained in both approaches, clearly indicating that mitochondrial physiology in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle can be assessed <italic>in situ</italic> without organelle isolation.</p>

<title>e) Flight muscle exhibit similar mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiencies and distinct capacities among substrates</title>
<p>Mitochondrial ATP production is determined by their bioenergetic efficiency (defined as the ATP produced in mitochondria per molecule of nutrient) and their ATP synthesis capacity (defined as the rate of ATP produced in mitochondria per unit of time), which are both regulated by the cellular energy demand and supply. Assuming that insect flight plays a central ecological role to reproduction and dispersal, representing one of the most energy demanding processes in Animal Kingdom [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], flight muscle high respiratory capacity must be tightly coupled to ATP synthesis. In this regard, one can speculate that efficiency and capacity of mitochondrial ATP production would vary among different substrates, being regulated by <italic>i)</italic> the substrate transport to mitochondria; <italic>ii)</italic> the oxidation potential provided by the mitochondrial dehydrogenases and the electron transport system complexes and <italic>iii)</italic> the degree of electron transport system coupling to OXPHOS.</p>
<p>Comparative analyses of respiration among insects indicate that oxygen consumption in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle is in general lower than any other insect species, regardless the substrate utilized and sex. For example, Pyr+pro (NADH-dependent)-supported oxygen consumption rates in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle were about 12% and 84% lower than in <italic>Bombus</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively (Tables <xref rid="pone.0120600.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). In addition, G3P-induced respiration in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> was 77% and 58% lower than <italic>Locusta</italic> and <italic>Magicicada</italic> flight muscle mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates, respectively (Tables <xref rid="pone.0120600.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Conceivably, the dispersal potential of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> would be limited by their lower flight muscle aerobic capacity, when compared to other insect species. Supporting this idea, a recent study demonstrated that butterfly species with long-distance fly behavior had much higher aerobic capacity, presenting high cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase activity and content, and also with larger and more numerous mitochondria than shorter-distance flyers [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. We thus assumed that in a condition with high energy-demand, such as in active insect flight muscle, respiratory rates coupled to ATP synthesis (defined as the respiratory rate induced by ADP, or OXPHOS) would be close to the maximum respiratory rates provided by uncoupling, varying in a proportional way. Therefore, calculating the OXPHOS values and correlating them with their respective maximum uncoupled respiratory rates values would give us an insight of both mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity (OXPHOS) and efficiency (slope). Based on these assumptions, we calculated the OXPHOS respiratory rates (by subtracting the ADP oxygen fluxes by their respective leak rates), and the maximum uncoupled respiratory rates (calculated by subtracting the FCCP respiratory rates by the residual oxygen consumption after antimycin A) induced by different substrates in both isolated mitochondria and permeabilized flight muscle from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> females and males and then carried out correlation analyses of these values. Similar approaches were described in the literature to investigate the effect of hypoxia on mitochondrial physiology in permeabilized human skeletal muscle fibers during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. <xref rid="pone.0120600.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig.</xref> shows the correlation analyses carried out for female (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A–C Fig.</xref>) and male (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7D–F Fig.</xref>) isolated mitochondria using Pyr+Pro (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A and S7D Fig.</xref>), G3P (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7B and S7E Fig.</xref>) and PC+Mal (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7C and S7F Fig.</xref>) as substrates. We observed that in all cases, there is a linear correlation between the OXPHOS and maximum uncoupled respiratory rates, which varied in a direct proportion, indicating preserved coupling between these two distinct mitochondrial metabolic states regardless the substrate utilized and sex. We also conducted the same analyses on permeabilized flight muscle of both sexes using Pyr+Pro (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7G and S7I Fig.</xref>) and G3P (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7H and S7J Fig.</xref>) and a pattern very similar to that of isolated mitochondria was observed. A closer look on these data revealed interesting features of mitochondrial functionality in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle. <xref rid="pone.0120600.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the compiled bioenergetic efficiency (slope) and capacity (OXPHOS) values of female mitochondria for all comparisons among the substrates and preparations. First, the bioenergetic capacities are remarkably distinct among the substrates (as previously shown in Tables <xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>), from the lowest values with PC+Mal to the highest with Pyr+Pro, indicating that the extent of substrate oxidation play a central role to bioenergetic capacity. Second, the bioenergetic efficiency, determined as the slope of correlation analyses, is high, ranging from 0.46 (G3P) to 0.74 (Pyr+Pro) both in permeabilized flight muscle (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). These data suggest that bioenergetic capacity among the substrates is essentially driven by their potential to be oxidized by the mitochondrial dehydrogenases and the electron transport system complex activities, and not by the degree of mitochondrial inner membrane permeability, since the bioenergetic efficiency (slope) is roughly preserved. In males, a very similar pattern of bioenergetic efficiency and capacity among substrates and preparations was achieved (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7D-F, S7I, S7J Fig.</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). The biological significance of these findings is that, regardless the sexual differences of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, substrates oxidation provided by mitochondrial dehydrogenases and the electron transport system activity define the bioenergetic capacity, but not efficiency as the degree of mitochondrial inner membrane permeability is preserved. Also, these data strongly suggest that proline and glucose metabolism represent the main energy-providing pathways to sustain flight in this insect [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p>

<title>f) Mitochondrial metabolic preference towards proline oxidation in females</title>
<p>We next investigated whether mitochondrial oxygen consumption would be distinct among sexes in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle. Previous reports have already addressed the sex-associated mitochondrial structural and functional differences in a variety of organisms and tissues [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Although some reports support the concept of sex-associated differences in mitochondrial function [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], consensus about a general trend is lacking. For example, despite the levels of antioxidant defenses in rats are reduced, and redox imbalance markers are higher in males [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], mitochondrial functional parameters were quite similar in three mice tissues regardless the sex [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> males, the rate of mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation is significantly lower than in females, which is consistent with higher antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase, Mn-SOD and Cu/Zn-SOD) in males [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In addition, OXPHOS efficiency and proton leak were higher in females compared to males, indicating that mitochondrial functional differences among sexes may reflect the increased energy demand posed by sex-specific activities, such as reproduction in females. In <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle, we observed a general trend of lower respiratory rates in males compared to females, in all substrates tested (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, significantly reduced respiratory rates in males were only observed when using Pyr+pro (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and 3D</xref>) and G3P (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Respiratory rates of male isolated mitochondria using Pyr+pro were about 38% lower than in females, while in G3P and PC+Mal these rates were about 22% lower compared to females. Interestingly, we observed that respiratory rates of female permeabilized flight muscle were significantly higher than in males, using both Pyr+pro (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) or G3P (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) as substrates.</p>

<p>A closer look on the data shown in <xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> reveal that the contribution of proline oxidation to respiration was strikingly higher in females. The respiratory rates induced by Pyr+pro in both isolated mitochondria (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and permeabilized flight muscle (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) were significantly higher in females than in males (2.06 and 3.5 times higher than males, respectively). In addition, the rotenone-resistant respiration was higher in females (2.2 and 2.7 times higher than males, respectively) in both preparations (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and 3D</xref>). Indeed, assignment of mitochondrial dehydrogenases that provide electrons to the electron transport system (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) indicated that respiration associated to ProDH activity was 3.4 times higher in female isolated mitochondria compared to males (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). This effect was specific to the respiration associated to ProDH since there were no apparent differences among the sexes in all three other sites of electron transport system (complex I, G3PDH and ETF:QOR)(<xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,4C,4D and 4E</xref>). A very similar trend was observed when the contribution of different dehydrogenases was assessed on permeabilized flight muscle (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F-H</xref>). Noteworthy is the specifically high contribution of proline oxidation to respiration in female mitochondria (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>), which was about 4.6 times higher than in males. Since blood feeding habit in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is restricted to females, it seems that proline metabolism would play a key role in female physiology, as the increment of respiratory rates induced by this aminoacid is higher in obligatory blood feeding Diptera when compared to other facultative blood-suckers and even to non hematophagous insects [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Increased contribution of proline oxidation to respiration observed in obligatory blood-sucking insects occurs in detriment of pyruvate and G3P oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], suggesting a trend that a continuous source of dietary protein provided by the blood may have adapted flight muscle mitochondria to utilize proline as the main source of electrons to sustain respiration. In fact, flight-induced reductions in proline levels in the hemolymph and thorax of male <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> were much less pronounced than observed in females [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], indicating that oxidation of this aminoacid in flight muscle is more intense in females. Conceivably, proline transport across inner mitochondrial membrane in males would be limited, directly affecting respiration, since there were no changes in proline-induced cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction among sexes (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In this sense, although in the present work mitochondrial function was assessed only in sugar fed insects, it seems possible that substrates preferences may change after blood ingestion, due to the higher protein content in this dietary source. The relatively high respiratory rates induced by G3P in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C and 4H</xref>) suggest increased dependence of this tissue to glucose utilization, as in insect´s flight muscle the cytosolic isoform of G3PDH is largely responsible for the re-oxidation of extramitochondrial glycolysis-derived NADH instead of classical lactate dehydrogenase [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. However, despite the advantages of assessing mitochondrial physiology on permeabilized flight muscle, we are aware about the potential limitations with this approach in terms of the respiratory capacities among sexes, since a clear sexual size dimorphism exists in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). In this regard, correlating the uncoupled respiratory rates of whole flight muscle from individual insects of both sexes using Pyr+pro as substrates, by their respective whole body weight, gives a linear positive relationship (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig.</xref>). This indicates that permeabilized flight muscle respiration varies in a direct proportion with the insect mass, regardless the sex. Since body weight in females is higher than in males (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), this could explain the differences in respiratory rates observed in permeabilized flight muscle among sexes. We think that this would be the case for the sexual comparisons of absolute values observed for most metabolic states in permeabilized flight muscle (Figs. <xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">4F, and 4H</xref>), but not for the ProDH-dependent respiration (Figs. <xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">3D</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). Indeed, the sexual differences in respiratory rates provided specifically by ProDH (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>, females 4.6 times higher than males) overpass the predicted sexual difference in respiratory rates due only to the weight (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>, females 1.7 times higher than males). Therefore, we conclude that there is a clear preference towards proline oxidation in female flight muscle mitochondria compared to males. The biological significance of these data is that specific reduced proline oxidation and respiratory rates observed in male flight muscle may explain their limited flight capacity in nature when compared to females [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].</p>

<title>g) An unique mitochondrial redox feature: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production is essentially driven by pyruvate+proline and G3P oxidation, with equivalent contribution among these substrates</title>
<p>The contribution of mitochondria to cell physiology goes far beyond their classical role in energy metabolism, directly participating in cell signaling, apoptosis, and on redox homeostasis, representing an important source of ROS. Indeed, superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup>) is the primary ROS produced in at least ten different sites in mitochondria (see purple arrows in <xref rid="pone.0120600.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and refs [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]). Few studies were dedicated to understand the contribution of mitochondria to cellular ROS production in insects, despite their implication in a myriad of biological processes in these organisms including aging [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], development [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], hypoxia tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], muscular and neuronal function [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], ecdysteroid synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], as well as on immune response [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Regarding the mechanisms involved on mitochondrial ROS generation in insects, early work conducted in <italic>Musca domestica</italic> flight muscle demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) generation was mostly supported by G3P (16-times higher) than Pyr+pro oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Later, Miwa and co-workers have showed that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight muscle mitochondria H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation occurred mainly by G3PDH and the center <italic>o</italic> of complex III (12-times higher), followed by complex I ROS generation to the mitochondrial matrix side (see <xref rid="pone.0120600.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> of ref [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). Recent evidence also point out that mitochondrial proline oxidation through ProDH contributes to indirect O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> production particularly at complexes I and II [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Given the relevance of mitochondrial redox metabolism on insect physiology, in <xref rid="pone.0120600.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> we compiled the mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production data available on insects and compared with vertebrate muscle mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Interestingly, general trends can be pointed out here, such as: <italic>i)</italic> the rates of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation supported by G3P were strikingly higher than by complex I substrates, regardless the species; <italic>ii)</italic> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rates by G3P in insects are much higher than in vertebrate skeletal muscle, but close to the rates reported for heart mitochondria. Considering that reported respiratory rates induced by G3P in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are 52,7% lower than those produced by Pyr+pro oxidation (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), while H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rates by G3P are 567% higher than by complex I (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), it seems plausible that electron flow through G3PDH is more "leaky" than by complex I, resulting in increased O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> formation at both sides of mitochondrial inner membrane [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. In fact, the contribution of different substrates to mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation has been investigated for decades and the intrinsic complexity of the system makes the determination of absolute values highly variable, depending on many parameters such as the organism model, the experimental conditions, substrates transport and oxidation, the ΔѰ<sub>m</sub> magnitude, and mitochondrial dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>].</p>

<p>Our group have previously shown that blood feeding promoted not only mitochondrial fusion in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle, but also a drastic reduction in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase activity, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We speculated that functional and structural mitochondrial remodeling upon blood feeding would avoid the interaction of mitochondrial-derived ROS with blood derived products, such as heme and iron, which could lead to redox imbalance and eventually tissue damage [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Thus, in order to gain a deeper insight on the contribution of mitochondria to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> redox metabolism, we assessed the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production on isolated flight muscle mitochondria. <xref rid="pone.0120600.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig.</xref> show representative fluorimetric traces of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation by male and female mitochondria from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle using Pyr+pro as substrates. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation rates during phosphorylating conditions proceeded stably, which were boosted after F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase inhibition by oligomycin, and subsequently reduced by OXPHOS uncoupling promoted by the proton ionophore FCCP. Then, for Pyr+pro and PC+Mal, complex I inhibitor rotenone was added, causing small increases on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation rates, which were further increased upon complex III inhibition by antimycin A, and resulting in the maximal rates of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. When using G3P as substrate, experiments started by the addition of 0.5 μM rotenone. <xref rid="pone.0120600.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> shows that mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation rates in both sexes were in general 20–80% higher during non-phosphorylating conditions (oligomycin) than after uncoupling by FCCP. However, these differences were only significant when using G3P (on both sexes) or PC+Mal (only females), indicating their higher dependence on ΔѰ<sub>m</sub> to generate O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup>. This contrasts to data obtained with mice skeletal muscle mitochondria oxidizing long chain fatty acids, which revealed to be only slightly affected by reductions in the ΔѰ<sub>m</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rates in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle induced by Pyr+pro or G3P during non-phosphorylating (oligomycin) conditions were indistinguishable among each other, and significantly higher than with PC+Mal (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Indeed, a comprehensive investigation in different rat tissues revealed that fatty acid oxidation plays a major role in mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production only in kidney and liver [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. These data indicate that fatty acid oxidation plays a minor role on cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), respiration (Tables <xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Figs., Figs. <xref rid="pone.0120600.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7C, S7F</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">4D, 4E</xref>) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>) in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria. Comparative analyses between Tables <xref rid="pone.0120600.t006" ref-type="table">6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.t007" ref-type="table">7</xref> show that NADH-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mitochondria is higher than any other organism (about 49% and 464% higher than <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Musca</italic>, respectively). Considering that the respiratory rates mediated by complex I substrates in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle were lower than in other insects species (Tables <xref rid="pone.0120600.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>), we suggest that redox reactions that provide NADH to complex I such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, might be involved in controlling both respiration and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation. On the other hand, mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation rates in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> using G3P were strikingly lower when compared to other insects (80% and 72% lower than <italic>Calliphora</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively) and even to vertebrate mitochondria (28% and 75% lower than skeletal muscle and heart, respectively). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitochondria, G3P-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was 7.6 times higher than with Pyr+Pro (see <xref rid="pone.0120600.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> on ref [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]), and was also less ΔѰ<sub>m</sub> dependent than complex I [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, as previously pointed out (Tables <xref rid="pone.0120600.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>), G3P-induced respiration in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> was lower than all insect species and even vertebrates (44% and 81% lower than <italic>Popillia</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively). A plausible explanation for these data is that mitochondrial G3PDH activity in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> may be lower than in any other organism, which would limit electrons entry at the electron transport system and keeping both oxygen consumption and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rates reduced. Together, we conclude that Pyr+pro and G3P are the main substrates that drive mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria, which were both equivalent in terms of their capacity to generate ROS (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>).

This approach has some advantages in terms of assessing mitochondrial redox metabolism, since uncoupling keep the electron transport system enzymes in a state that would not be inhibited by their products, as well as to consume NAD(P)H, which lowers the transhydrogenase activity and then the pool of reduced glutathione. A general trend observed is that inhibition of complex I by rotenone caused only slight increases (about 25%) on Pyr+pro-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation, regardless the sex. It is known that complex I produce O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> at I<sub>F</sub> and I<sub>Q</sub> sites [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], which are stimulated by increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio and high protonmotive force (pmf), respectively. Since O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> generation at site I<sub>Q</sub> requires high pmf to allow reverse electron transfer to complex I, and in <xref rid="pone.0120600.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> all measurements were conducted in the presence of FCCP, we conclude that induction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation caused by rotenone can only be accounted by the I<sub>F</sub> site of complex I. Significant increases in rotenone-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation were only achieved in female mitochondria when using PC+Mal as substrates (57% higher than FCCP) (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). Notwithstanding, Pyr+Pro and G3P H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rates in the presence of rotenone were indistinguishable, but significantly higher than in PC+Mal in both sexes. When antimycin A, which inhibits center <italic>i</italic> of complex III, was added subsequently to rotenone, a strong induction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation was achieved (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). However, this increase was not homogeneous among substrates, since the absolute rates of mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in this condition varied from 769 pmol H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/min/mg protein using Pyr+pro to about 173 pmol H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/min/mg protein by PC+Mal. Since the electron entry at electron transport system by complex I is inhibited by rotenone, we reasoned that the only available electron sources would be through alternative dehydrogenases such as G3PDH, ProDH and ETF:QOR. In this sense, we observed that after antimycin A, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation rates induced by Pyr+pro increased about 170% over the rates produced by rotenone alone, indicating that redox reactions involved in mitochondrial proline oxidation, through ProDH and other dehydrogenases [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], play a major role in mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria. Antimycin A also caused a drastic increase on G3P-mediated mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation (about 111% higher than rotenone in both sexes) (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>), which could be assigned to G3PDH and other dehydrogenases as well [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Finally, inhibition of complex III when mitochondria oxidize PC+Mal also increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation rates in about 38% compared to the rates on rotenone in both sexes, although with absolute values significantly lower than obtained by Pyr+pro and G3P. These data are in full agreement with the literature showing that inhibition of complex III in skeletal muscle mitochondria respiring PC increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation rates about 6 times compared to rates induced by rotenone [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>].</p>

<p>Mitochondrial proline oxidation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight muscle mediates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production essentially by means electron leak at sites II<sub>F</sub> (∼70%) and I<sub>F</sub>, with no direct contribution by either ProDH and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activities [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Since proline metabolism play a central energetic role to sustain flight activity in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], mitochondrial oxidation of this aminoacid may have important implications not only to cellular redox homeostasis but also to insect physiology. The huge increase on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rates provided by antimycin A takes place essentially at ProDH and/or other dehydrogenases, but not at site I<sub>F</sub> as rotenone was present during this assay (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Therefore, based on the literature [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], it seems plausible that site II<sub>F</sub> would play a significant role in providing electrons to allow O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> production in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria when oxidizing proline or G3P. Regarding H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation driven by fatty acid oxidation, the increases provided by complex III inhibition occurs by ETF:QOR+other dehydrogenases but also at site I<sub>F</sub> in similar proportion, specifically in females (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, blue bars). Notwithstanding, in male mitochondria (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation at site I<sub>F</sub> is significantly lower than at ETF:QOR+other dehydrogenases sites, which is in agreement with data obtained for skeletal muscle oxidizing PC [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Indeed, the small contribution of fatty acid oxidation to O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> formation can be just a consequence of reduced metabolism of this nutrient, based on the very low cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase activity induced by PC in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mitochondria (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the major sites of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> production in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria during proline and G3P oxidation takes place at distinct points other than site I<sub>F</sub>.</p>
<p>Finally, we must consider the potential limitations in determining the sites of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> generation in our experimental approach since <italic>i)</italic> the use of electron transport system inhibitors does not allow the measurements of native H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rates relative to different substrates and sexes [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; <italic>ii)</italic> as a consequence, we cannot assign precisely the sites of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> formation, since in the presence of rotenone and antimycin A, electrons coming from substrate oxidation leak at many different sites [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Also, we are aware that changes in NADPH levels and matrix manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) activity may represent important sources of interference in our measurements. However, we don´t think these are the cases, since: <italic>i)</italic> all determinations were carried out based on standard curves built with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of each pharmacological OXPHOS modulator and 0.17 mg of mitochondrial protein, which, in principle, would correct for eventual changes in NADPH levels; <italic>ii)</italic> changes on mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> production by OXPHOS modulators affect targets upstream of SOD2 and it is unlikely that the pattern of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production observed in our experiments (<xref rid="pone.0120600.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig.</xref>) would be resulted from changes on SOD2 activity. Despite these limitations, the partial assignment of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> production sites in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mitochondria contribute to a broader knowledge of mitochondrial redox metabolism in this organism, with potential physiological implications.</p>

Whether altered mitochondrial redox metabolism directly participates in the aging process or acts indirectly through ROS-dependent signaling pathways in the physiological changes of senescence it is still a debatable issue. In this sense, considering the "mitochondrial free radical theory of aging", one should predict that the long lived group would have reduced levels of mitochondrial ROS generation, oxidative molecular damage, cell and tissue dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Based in this information, we then compared the rates of mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in both sexes of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle, using Pyr+pro, G3P or PC+Mal as substrates. We can observe in <xref rid="pone.0120600.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> that there were no significant differences among sexes on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria using Pyr+pro (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) or PC+Mal (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). However, in <xref rid="pone.0120600.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> we observed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation rates induced by G3P were significantly higher in male mitochondria than in females, in most mitochondrial metabolic states, with exception of the G3P+ADP. The significantly higher rates of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation were observed in non-phosphorylating state in the presence of oligomycin (28% higher than in females), in uncoupled state (FCCP) (68% higher than in females), and after inhibition by complex III by antimycin A (43% higher than females). Despite G3P-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation represent, by far, the dominant sources of ROS in mitochondria from distinct insect species (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), Pyr+pro and G3P oxidation are the substrates that give, equally, the highest rates of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in both sexes of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Interestingly, increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in male mitochondria (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) associates to reduced male lifespan, compared to females [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Indeed, preliminary observations from our group indicate that insects from our colony exhibited remarkable differences in longevity among sexes, where female average life span (females = 34 days <italic>vs</italic>. males = 19 days), as well as maximum life span (females = 56 days <italic>vs</italic>. males = 42 days) were significantly higher compared to males (data not shown). Regarding the topology of mitochondrial electron leak, the only significant difference observed among sexes (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) was that females exhibited higher O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> generation mediated by site I<sub>F</sub>, when PC+Mal compared to male H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation under the same conditions.

<title>j) Conclusion and final remarks</title>
<p>A summary of the metabolic pathways operating in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> flight muscle mitochondria described in this work is schematically depicted in <xref rid="pone.0120600.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. Complex I (light green) and G3PDH (red) represent the main sites of electron supply to electron transport system, followed by ProDH (dark green) and in a less extent ETF:QOR (blue), that contribute to respiration and O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> formation. Given the key role of proline oxidation to flight activity, as well as on mitochondrial energy and redox metabolism, as demonstrated in the present work, we postulate that most of the electrons that are transferred to electron transport system through complex I originates from oxidation of this aminoacid. Interestingly, proline levels in the hemolymph of sugar-fed females are about twice of males, and their levels are halved upon 30 minutes of induced flight, only in females [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This indicates that mechanisms devoted to sustain high levels of proline in the hemolymph, as well as its utilization to support flight, are more efficient in females than in males [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Noteworthy, we know that floral nectars are utilized as a dietary source for both <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> sexes in nature, which are enriched in carbohydrates and poor in aminoacids [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Therefore, even in a low aminoacid food source, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> females preserve the pathways to keep high proline levels, given the key importance of this aminoacid to energy and redox metabolism. Since mitochondrial transport of proline [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] and pyruvate [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] are dependent of ΔѰ<sub>m</sub>, it seems unlikely that reduced proline oxidation observed in male mitochondria would be related to low ΔѰ<sub>m</sub>, as complex I-dependent respiration is roughly similar among sexes (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A and 4F</xref>), despite strikingly lower ProDH-dependent respiration in males (<xref rid="pone.0120600.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B and 4G</xref>). In addition, there were no sexual differences in terms of proline-mediated cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mitochondria (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As the molecular entity that mediate mitochondrial proline transport remains elusive, we postulate that reduced proline oxidation in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> male mitochondria is a result of reduced transport of this aminoacid compared to females (orange box in <xref rid="pone.0120600.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). The biological significance of improved mitochondrial proline transport in females could be to keep proline as preferential substrate to sustain flight activity, sparing glucose and lipids to support oogenesis/embryogenesis after blood intake. Thus activation of metabolic pathways directed to keep high hemolymph proline levels in females, regardless the dietary source, would represent a female-specific pre-adaption to allow flight muscle respiration. The contribution of different substrates to O<sub>2</sub><sup>•¯</sup> production were also proportional to their utilization, with the highest values obtained by Pyr+pro and G3P (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>), due to electron leak taking place at ProDH, G3PDH and other dehydrogenases sites (<xref rid="pone.0120600.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120600.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<p>Despite the key role of mitochondria to cell physiology, and the growing need to understand basic aspects of NTD insect vectors biology aiming the development of potential new control strategies, few studies have investigated mitochondrial functionality in this group of organisms [<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0120600.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120600.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].
