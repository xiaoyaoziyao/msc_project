<title>Aims</title>
<p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown dramatic clinical benefits in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, resistance remains a serious problem in clinical practice. The present study analyzed mTOR-associated signaling-pathway differences between the EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cell lines and investigated the feasibility of targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitor in EGFR TKI resistant NSCLC cells.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We selected four different types of EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells: PC9, PC9GR, H1650 and H1975 cells as models to detect mTOR-associated signaling-pathway differences by western blot and Immunoprecipitation and evaluated the antiproliferative effect and cell cycle arrest of ku-0063794 by MTT method and flow cytometry.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>In the present study, we observed that mTORC2-associated Akt ser473-FOXO1 signaling pathway in a basal state was highly activated in resistant cells. <italic>In vitro</italic> mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities assays showed that EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines had higher mTORC2 kinase activity, whereas sensitive cells had higher mTORC1 kinase activity in the basal state. The ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor ku-0063794 showed dramatic antiproliferative effects and G1-cell cycle arrest in both sensitive and resistant cells. Ku-0063794 at the IC<sub>50</sub> concentration effectively inhibited both mTOR and p70S6K phosphorylation levels; the latter is an mTORC1 substrate and did not upregulate Akt ser473 phosphorylation which would be induced by rapamycin and resulted in partial inhibition of FOXO1 phosphorylation. We also observed that EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant clinical NSCLC tumor specimens had higher total and phosphorylated p70S6K expression levels.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our results indicate mTORC2-associated signaling-pathway was hyperactivated in EGFR TKI-resistant cells and targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitors is likely a good strategy for patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who develop EGFR TKI resistance; the potential specific roles of mTORC2 in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells were still unknown and should be further investigated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway plays a central role in the development and progression of lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Araujo1">[1]</xref>. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib are effective clinical therapies for patients with advanced NSCLC who have EGFR-activated mutations, compared with standard first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Inoue1">[2]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Mok1">[4]</xref>. However, despite these dramatic benefits of EGFR TKIs, all of these patients inevitably develop resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib, usually 6â€“12 months after initiation of TKI treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Costa1">[5]</xref>. Several mechanisms, including a T790M mutation in the EGFR, MET amplification, and overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), induce acquired resistance to reversible EGFR-TKIs for NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Shih1">[6]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Yamada1">[8]</xref>. A means of overcoming TKI resistance remains a challenge in clinical practice. Generally, strategies to overcome resistance consider the resistance mechanism itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Turke1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Riely1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Bean1">[10]</xref>, whereas an alternative strategy is to identify new molecules or mechanisms that overcome the resistance, such as mTOR.</p>
<p>mTOR is a conserved serine/threonine kinase that occurs in mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Guertin1">[11]</xref>. It integrates signals from growth factors, nutrient supply, and energy status to activate cell growth, and is upregulated in various cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Wullschleger1">[12]</xref>. Therefore, studies targeting mTOR for cancer therapy have received attention in recent years. However, the clinical response to rapamycin and its analogues has been feeble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Sabatini1">[13]</xref>. Many studies have demonstrated the mechanisms of its poor response both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Soria1">[14]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-OReilly1">[16]</xref>. Our previous report also showed that all NSCLC cell lines in our lab are resistant to RAD001 (a rapamycin analogue) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Dong1">[17]</xref>. In fact, rapamycin only partially inhibits mTORC1 functions and instead induces Akt ser473 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-OReilly1">[16]</xref> and does not inhibit mTORC2 at all <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Choo1">[18]</xref>. More recent studies have indicated that mTORC2 regulates cell survival and cytoskeletal organization by regulating phosphorylation of its substrates, Akt hydrophobic motif (HM) site (ser473) and PKCÎ± HM site (ser657) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Jacinto1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Ikenoue1">[20]</xref>. mTORC2 kinase activity increases in some tumors; thus, targeting mTORC2 could inhibit cancer cell growth and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Masri1">[21]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Guertin3">[23]</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that mTORC2 plays an important role in cell growth and proliferation and that targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitors would produce better anti-tumor effects after TKI-acquired resistance.</p>
<p>We first analyzed differences in the mTOR-associated signaling pathways between EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells in a basal state <italic>in vitro</italic>. Then, we assayed mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities <italic>in vitro</italic>. Finally, we evaluated the antiproliferative effects and cell cycle arrest of ku-0063794 and analyzed the expression of total and phosphorylated p70S6K in tumor specimens.</p>

<title>Cell Lines</title>
<p>The human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines PC9, H1650, and H1975 (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were kindly provided by Dr. Tony Mok, Chinese University of Hong Kong. PC9 cells harbor an EGFR exon 19-frame deletion and are highly sensitive to EGFR TKI. H1650 cells harbor an EGFR exon 19-frame deletion and are resistant to EGFR TKI. H1975 cells carry the EGFR L858R-T790M mutation and are resistant to EGFR TKI. PC9GR acquired gefitinib resistance by chronic exposure of PC9 cells to medium with increasing gefitinib concentrations. Briefly, PC9 cells were exposed to 10 nM gefitinib in medium containing 10% FBS, and the concentration was increased in a stepwise manner. Cells that were able to grow in 1 ÂµM gefitinib were obtained 6 months after the initial exposure.</p>

<title>Akt ser473-FOXO1 Signaling Pathway in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC Cells was Highly Activated in the Basal State</title>
<p>Understanding mTOR-associated signaling-pathway differences between EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells is critical for targeting mTOR to overcome patient resistance after TKI treatment. However, knowledge of the differences in signaling pathways between EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells is lacking. Here, we first selected four different NSCLC cell lines that harbor different EGFR mutants, and that differ in sensitivity to TKIs, as cell models for analysis of the signaling-pathway differences in a basal state by western blot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, the total and phosphorylated mTOR, Raptor, and Rictor proteins had higher basal expression levels in all four NSCLC cell lines. Then, we detected differences in the mTORC2-associated signaling pathway by determining the phosphorylation status of Akt ser473 and FOXO1. Interestingly, we found that EGFR TKI-resistant cell lines especially H1650 cells (harboring the EGFR deletion in 19 exon and resistant to TKI) had higher p-Akt ser473 levels than did TKI-sensitive cells (PC9 cells) and p-Akt ser473 expression level in PC9GR cells (gefitinib-acquired resistant cell line) was also quite high. This result was consistent with a report that PC9GR cells have reduced phosphatase and tensin homolog expression, which led to upregulation of p-Akt ser473 levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Yamamoto1">[30]</xref>. FOXO1 phosphorylation status, which is positively regulated by the Akt HM site (ser473) phosphorylation status and inhibits cell apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Guertin4">[31]</xref>, was almost consistent with the p-Akt ser473 levels in the four cell lines. We also detected the expression of phosphorylated and total p70S6K which is the substrate of mTORC1 and found that all four cell lines had higher p70S6K phosphorylation levels. Taken together, our data indicated that EGFR mutant NSCLC cells had higher basal expression levels of mTOR, Rictor and Raptor and mTORC2-associated Akt ser473-FOXO1 signaling pathway was hyperactivated in resistant cells.</p>

<title>EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC Cell Lines had Higher mTORC2 Kinase Activity, whereas Sensitive Cells had Higher mTORC1 Kinase Activity in the Basal State</title>
<p>Based on the above results, we hypothesized that EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant cells have different mTORC2 kinase activity. We then assayed the mTORC2 kinase activity in the four NSCLC cell lines by immunoprecipitation. First, we used the specific Rictor antibody to pull down mTORC2 into the immunoprecipitate. SDS-PAGE silver staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) showed that the immunoprecipitations were successful which were also verified by western blot of the immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069104.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Akt ser473 was one of the identified substrates of mTORC2 and several papers used it as an surrogate to represent mTORC2 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Masri1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Sarbassov1">[24]</xref>. So, we used the inactive recombinant protein, Akt1/PKBÎ±, as a substrate to react with the immunoprecipitate <italic>in vitro</italic>, and then detected the p-Akt ser473. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, although cell lysate protein concentration in the H1650 cell immunoprecipitate was lower than that of the other three cell lines, mTORC2 kinase activity was the highest. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, we could also see that mTORC2 kinase activity in PC9 cells was the lowest, and that in PC9GR and H1975 cells had intermediate kinase activity. These results were almost consistent with the p-Akt ser473 levels mentioned above.

From the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g002">Fig. 2B and 2D</xref>, we could also see that in the same cells when mTORC2 kinase activity was upregulated the mTORC1 kinase activity would be downregulated indicating that whether mTORC1 and mTORC2 exist in dynamic equilibrium. Taken together, our results showed that although both EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells had higher mTORC1 and mTORC2 expression in the basal state, EGFR TKI-resistant cells had higher mTORC2 kinase activity, whereas EGFR TKI-sensitive cells had higher mTORC1 kinase activity.</p>

<p>Because ku-0063794 exhibited dramatic antitumor effects, we further analyzed its antiproliferative activity at the IC<sub>50</sub> concentration by western blot. First, we detected mTOR phosphorylation status after treatment with ku-0063794 at the IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations in all four cell lines, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Then we further analyzed the phosphorylation status of mTOR signaling pathway associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Through the protein quantitative labwork software, we analyzed the ratio of phosphorylated protein over total protein in the basal state and after treatment with ku-0063794 at the IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations in all four cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g004">Fig. 4A and 4B</xref>, ku-0063794 effectively inhibited mTOR phosphorylation status and then strongly inhibited phosphorylation of p70S6K which is a substrate of mTORC1. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, we could also see that ku-0063794 at the IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations did not markedly increase p-Akt ser473 expression especially in PC9 and PC9GR cells which could be induced by rapamycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-OReilly1">[16]</xref>. Actually, the ratios of p-Akt ser473/t-Akt in H1650 and H1975 cells decreased resulting in the reduced ratios of p-FOXO1/t-FOXO1 in these cells compared to that in the basal state. Thus, ku-0063794, as a novel ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, showed marked antiproliferative effects and induced G1 cell cycle arrest both in EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>Analyses of Clinical EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant Lung Adenocarcinoma Tissues Showed Higher Total and Phosphorylated p70S6K Expression in Both Sensitive and Resistant Cancers</title>
<p>Since ku-0063794 at the IC<sub>50</sub> concentration effectively inhibited p70S6K phosphorylation levels in both sensitive and resistant NSCLC cells, these results indicated that ku-0063794 may exert greater antitumor effects in tumors that express high levels of total or phosphorylated p70S6K. We examined tumor specimens from gefitinib- or erlotinib-treated patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). All patients had a partial clinical tumor response to gefitinib or erlotinib treatment and subsequently developed clinical drug resistance. We evaluated the expression of total and phosphorylated p70S6K in five patients by immunohistochemistry; one with paired specimens obtained before and after geftinib treatment, two with drug-sensitive specimens, and two with drug-resistant specimens. We detected the status of the T790M mutation and MET amplification in all drug resistant specimens. Both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumor specimens had higher total p70S6K expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g005">Fig. 5B and 5C</xref>). We also found higher phosphorylated p70S6K expression in these tumors. These findings suggest that both drug-sensitive and -resistant cancers had higher total and phosphorylated p70S6K expression, and that p70S6K may be a good predictor of a response to ku-0063794.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>EGFR signaling pathways are involved in the development and progression of lung cancer. Binding of EGFR to its EGF ligand leads to dimerization and initiates a series of downstream signaling cascades through the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1, Erk, and STAT3 pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Pines1">[35]</xref>. Previous studies have demonstrated that the signaling patterns activated by EGFR mutants differ from those of ligand-activated wild-type EGFR, and that EGFR-sensitive mutants resulting from EGFR signaling constitutively activate and escape negative regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Choi1">[36]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Shtiegman1">[39]</xref>. EGFR-sensitive mutations have became the curative effect predictors for TKIs, and the dramatic clinical benefits of TKIs are largely based on a deep understanding of EGFR-sensitive mutant signaling pathways. Therefore, understanding changes in signaling pathways after patients develop resistance to EGFR TKIs is quite important to overcome resistance. Several TKI resistance mechanisms have been demonstrated in recent years, including the T790M mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Yun1">[40]</xref>, MET amplification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Turke1">[7]</xref>, and HGF overexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Yamada1">[8]</xref>. Most current strategies for overcoming TKI-acquired resistance involve targeting the resistance mechanism itself. For example, the second generation of irreversible TKIs such as BIBW 2992 for patients with a T790M mutation and MET inhibitors combined with EGFR TKIs for MET amplification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Turke1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Riely1">[9]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Bean1">[10]</xref>. Here, we provided a new perspective to seek new molecular targets for overcoming resistance by systematically analyzing signaling pathway differences between EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our data showed that mTORC2-associated Akt ser473-FOXO1 signaling pathway was highly activated in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells in the basal state and <italic>in vitro</italic> mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities verified these results.(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g002">2</xref>). These results indicate that targeting mTOR including mTORC2 could achieve better antitumor effects.</p>
<p>mTOR is a central controller of cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenesis; however, current mTOR inhibitors, such as RAD001, show only modest clinical activity against pretreated NSCLC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Soria1">[14]</xref>. Indeed, rapamycin targeted only a subset of the intracellular activities of mTORC1. Rapamycin allosterically inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity by binding the FKBP12 cellular protein distal to the kinase active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Guertin2">[15]</xref>. In some cases, mTORC1 is sensitive to rapamycin and completely inhibits mTORC1-mediated S6K1 phosphorylation. As reported previously, rapamycin induces Akt ser473 phosphorylation which reduces its antitumor effect through Akt ser473-FOXO1 signaling pathway due to relief of feedback of S6K-IRS-PI3K signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-OReilly1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-AbdelnourBerchtold1">[41]</xref>. Actually, Akt thr308 phosphorylation is positively regulated by PI3K-PDK1 and Akt ser473 phosphorylation is positively controlled by mTORC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Ikenoue1">[20]</xref>, suggesting that whether inhibition of mTORC1 would promote mTORC2 kinase activity. Our data indicate a dynamic balance between mTORC1 and mTORC2 which should be further confirmed in the next studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g002">Fig. 2B and 2D</xref>) and explain why RAD001 mediated effects are feeble in all NSCLC cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>. The results suggest that both mTORC1 and mTORC2 should be targeted.</p>
<p>The novel ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., Torin1, PP242, ku-0063794, and WAY-600), which inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, exert marked effects on protein synthesis, cell growth, and cell proliferation, and strongly promote autophagy in various cancer cell types <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-GarciaMartinez1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Foster1">[42]</xref>. These mTOR inhibitors are still in the early stage of evaluation; thus, their therapeutic potential for cancer remains uncertain. Indeed, novel mTOR inhibitors, such as Torin1 and PP242, have antiproliferative effects that are mediated mainly by complete inhibition of mTORC1, but not mTORC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Thoreen1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Feldman1">[44]</xref>. Our previous paper and the paper from La Monica have both shown that EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells were insensitive to everolimus (RAD001), and everolimus could synergize with gefitinib which provided another alternative strategy to overcome EGFR TKI resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Dong1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-LaMonica1">[45]</xref>. In our study, we found that targeting mTOR with ku-0063794 also produced better antitumor effects and reduced G1 cell cycle arrest in both sensitive and resistant cells through MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis which should be further strengthened by colony formation capacity (CFC) assays in the future; we did not find significant G1-cell cycle arrest although cell proliferation was inhibited in H1975 cells by ku-0063794 which maybe primarily due to other forms of cell death like apoptosis or autophagy. Indicators of apoptosis and/or autophagy would be further investigated in the future (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>); the following antiproliferative effects of targeting mTOR indicated that ku-0063794 not only inhibited p70S6K phosphorylation levels but also partially inhibited FOXO1 phosphorylation levels and did not upregulate Akt ser473 phosphorylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069104-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Taken together, our data and those from a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Breuleux1">[46]</xref> suggest that the lack of an increase in Akt ser473 phosphorylation levels may have been due to inhibition of mTORC2; thus promoting antitumor effects. Actually, the potential specific roles of mTORC2 in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells were still unknown and should be further studied in the next studies. In addition, we found that EGFR TKI-resistant cells had higher Akt ser473 phosphorylation. As reported previously, Akt inhibitor perifosine have shown better antiproliferative effects in Relapsed/Refractory Waldenstromâ€™s Macroglobulinemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Ghobrial1">[47]</xref> and Jeong et al also reported that Akt inhibitor and mTORC1 inhibitor synergistically increased cell death in NSCLC cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069104-Jeong1">[48]</xref>. All of these suggest that Akt inhibitors may be another good alternative treatment for TKI insensitive tumors. We also evaluated the expression of total and phosphorylated p70S6K in clinical EGFR TKI-sensitive and -resistant lung adenocarcinoma tumor tissues and found that p70S6K may be a good marker for selection of patients for whom ku-0063794 therapy is appropriate.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, we demonstrated that EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines had different activation of mTOR-associated signaling pathways in the basal state and mTORC2-associated Akt ser473-FOXO1 signaling pathway was highly activated in resistant cells. <italic>In vitro</italic> mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities verified these results and showed that mTORC1 and mTORC2 maybe exist in a dynamic balance. Our study also showed that ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor ku-0063794 had dramatic antiproliferative effects and G1-cell cycle arrest in both sensitive and resistant cells. Our results indicate mTORC2-associated signaling-pathway was hyperactivated in EGFR TKI-resistant cells and targeting mTOR with specific mTOR inhibitors is likely a good strategy for patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who develop EGFR TKI resistance; the potential specific roles of mTORC2 in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells were still unknown and should be further investigated; and that expression of total or phosphorylated p70S6K may be a predictor of the response to mTOR inhibitors.</p>
