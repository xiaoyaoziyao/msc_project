<abstract>
<p>Fibronectin (FN) is a high molecular weight extracellular matrix protein that functions in cell adhesion, growth, migration, and embryonic development. However, little is known about the role of FN during viral infection. In the present study, we found significantly higher levels of FN in sera, and liver tissues from hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients relative to healthy individuals. HBV expression enhanced FN mRNA and protein levels in the hepatic cell lines Huh7 and HepG2. HBV infection of susceptible HepG2-sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide cells also increased FN expression. We also found that transcriptional factor specificity protein 1 was involved in the induction of FN by HBV. Knockdown of FN expression significantly inhibited HBV DNA replication and protein synthesis through activating endogenous IFN-α production. In addition, FN interacted with the transforming growth factor β-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein complex and attenuated interferon signaling by inhibiting TAK1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65 was found to be inhibited by FN. We also observed that FN promoted HBV enhancers to support HBV expression. These results suggest novel functions of endogenous FN involved in immune evasion and maintenance of HBV replication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic, non-cytopathic virus that can cause both acute and chronic infections of the liver and lead to development of hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref001">1</xref>]. Approximately one-third of the world’s population has serological evidence of past or present infection with HBV, and 240 million people are chronic HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers with 500,000 to 1.2 million deaths per year caused by HBV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref004">4</xref>]. To date, the immunomodulator IFN-α is one of the few antiviral agents licensed for the treatment of chronic HBV infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Fibronectin (FN) exists as a protein dimer, consisting of two nearly identical polypeptide chains linked by a pair of C-terminal disulfide bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref006">6</xref>]. Each FN monomer has a molecular weight of 230–250 kDa and contains three types of modules: type I, II, and III. Two types of FN are present in vertebrates: soluble plasma FN is a major protein component of blood plasma (approximately 300 μg/ml) and is produced in the liver by hepatocytes; insoluble cellular FN is a major component of the extracellular matrix that binds to the membrane-spanning receptor proteins, integrins. Similar to integrins, FN binds extracellular matrix components such as collagen, fibrin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. FN is secreted by various cells, primarily fibroblasts, as a soluble protein dimer and is then assembled into an insoluble matrix in a complex cell-mediated process. FN plays a major role in cell adhesion, growth, migration, and differentiation, as well as wound healing and embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref007">7</xref>]. Altered FN expression, degradation, and organization has been associated with a number of pathologies, including cancer and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Type I IFN (mainly IFNα/β) are expressed in response to the stimulation of pattern recognition receptors produced by viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref009">9</xref>]. Depending on TLRs, the IFN signal pathway can be classified as TLR-dependent and TLR-independent signal pathway. In the TLR-dependent signal pathway, viral DNA was sensed by TLR9 and then recruits MyD88, IRAKs and activation of TRAF6, an ubiquitin E3 ligase. On the one hand, TRAF6 ubiquitination activates IRF7 mediated IFN production; on the other hand, TRAF6 interacts with TAK1-TAB complex to activate the phosphorylation of TAK1 and then induces the activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 to induce type I IFN production, respectively[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that FN can facilitate the entry of gammaretrovirus, influenza A virus, and rhabdovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref015">15</xref>]. Regarding HBV, FN was found to bind HBsAg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref017">17</xref>], is capable of accelerating HBV infection in primary cultured fetal hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref018">18</xref>], and may be important for HBV propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref019">19</xref>]. In addition, HBV X antigen up-regulates FN expression and is co-expressed with FN mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref020">20</xref>]. All these studies imply that FN may play a role during HBV replication and expression, but the detailed molecular mechanisms by which FN affects HBV replication remain unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on the mechanisms underlying the essential role of FN in HBV replication and expression and identified two previously unrecognized functions of endogenous FN during HBV replication. Firstly, HBV upregulated the expression of FN in both clinical samples and cultured cells. In turn, the increased FN antagonized the endogenous interferon pathway, leading to enhanced HBV DNA replication and protein synthesis. Secondly, FN promoted HBV replication and expression by strengthening the recruitment of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF-4α) to HBV enhancer II (EII). Our results reveal the importance of liver-specific host factors that contribute to HBV maintenance.</p>

<title>Clinical Samples and Human Subjects</title>
<p>Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 50 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) admitted to Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University (33 males and 17 females, with a mean age of 48.1±11.6 years). Matched for sex and age, 50 healthy individuals (27 males and 23 females with a mean age of 43.5±10.5 years) with no history of liver disease and negative for virus infection were randomly selected as controls from the local blood donation center. Liver tissues were obtained from 15 patients with CHB admitted to Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University (10 males and 5 females with a mean age of 52.1±12.9 years). Matched for sex and age, 15 healthy individuals (12 males and 3 females with a mean age of 49.1±8.39 years) negative for virus infection were randomly selected as controls. All clinical samples were collected from September 6, 2014 to September 23, 2014. Whole study (including the collection of blood and tissue sample) was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, in accordance with its guidelines for the protection of human subjects.

<title>FN Expression Is Increased by HBV in Various Cell Types</title>
<p>High levels of FN expression were detected in HBV patients, so we next determined whether or not endogenous FN expression in cell culture was influenced by HBV.

<p>Several transcriptional factors such as activating protein 1 (AP1), AP2, polyomavirus enhancer A binding protein 2 (PEA2), activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), and Sp1 are important regulatory elements within the FN promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref030">30</xref>]. In order to identify the cis-regulatory elements in the FN promoter that are responsive to HBV, truncation reporter plasmids and mutant reporter plasmids were constructed, as the binding sites of these factors were mutated in the FN promoter. We found that only mutation of Sp1 binding sites had significant effects on the induction of the FN promoter by HBV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), whereas AP1, AP2 and ATF2 also have mild influence. ChIP assays were then performed to test the Sp1 binding activity on the corresponding region within the FN promoter. The results showed that binding of Sp1 on the FN promoter was significantly strengthened by HBV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

<p>A stable FN knockdown cell line (FN-KD) and a negative control knockdown stable cell line (NC-KD) were constructed to confirm the effect of FN on HBV replication using a lentiviral vector expressing FN-specific shRNA or irrelevant shRNA. We then performed MTT assays to measure cell viability to determine whether or not the changes in FN expression affected cell growth. As expected, over-expression or knockdown of FN did not significantly change Huh7 cell viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152721.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We next sought to examine HBV replication and expression in stable FN knockdown cells. Consistent with the above results, significantly lower levels of HBeAg, HBsAg, and HBV DNA were detected in stable FN knockdown cells compared with control cells. In addition, HBV expression and replication were rescued when FN was restored by transfection of pFN into stable FN knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The knockdown and over-expression efficiency of FN were determined by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Our results showed that the knockdown of FN has more significant effect on viral replication than the over-expression of FN due to relatively high basal FN expression in hepatocytes. In order to avoid off-target effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref031">31</xref>], seed sequence-matched controls were designed to detect FN depletion and the influences on HBV expression and replication, and we found that these controls did not reduce FN or HBV expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). To further clarify the increase of HBV antigen levels in culture medium is come from the elevated expression of viral genes or the enhanced efficiency of antigen secretion, the intracellular HBsAg level was determined and variation was consistent with the secreted HBsAg and HBV DNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152721.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). So it is clear that FN enhance the viral genes expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HBV expression and replication is FN dependent.</p>

<title>FN Inhibits the Expression of IFN-α and IFN-Stimulated Genes</title>
<p>As our above results suggest that FN enhances HBV replication and expression, we then set out to determine the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. IFN-α is an antiviral agents used for the treatment of chronic HBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref033">33</xref>], so we determined whether FN could influence production of endogenous IFN-α. NC-KD and FN-KD cells were mock infected or Sendai virus (SeV, MOI = 1) infected and then expression of IFN-α and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), the direct antiviral effectors such as oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) 2, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), myxovirus (influenza) resistance A protein (MxA), were measured by qRT-PCR. We found that IFN-α, OAS2, MxA, and PKR mRNA levels were induced dramatically in FN-KD cells compared with NC-KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In addition, protein expression of OAS2, MxA, and PKR were also significantly higher in FN-KD cells than in NC-KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In order to confirm that the results are valid and not due to a selective event during the selection of the stable cell lines, NC-KD cells were treated with si-FN or si-NC and followed by SeV or mock infection. And similar results were observed as in stable knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). To prove that it is FN-mediated down-regulation of IFN-α and ISGs that are responsible for the increase of HBV, HBV DNA was detected and compared in the presence or absence of IFN. The inhibition effect on HBV DNA by FN depletion was decrease by 40% in the presence of siRNA-IFNAR1 contrasted with 90% in the siRNA-NC group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Similar results were observed when luciferase reporter assays were performed for IFN-α2 promoter activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). These data demonstrate that FN indeed has an inhibitory effect on the production of endogenous IFN-α and downstream ISGs.</p>

<p>As the schematic diagram of the FN protein structure reveals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref035">35</xref>], FN has many repeated domains primarily classified as module I, module II, and module III. Additional domains A, B, and variable region (V) only exist in infants or in some special tissues and conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref037">37</xref>]. In order to determine which FN domain associates with the TAK1-TAB complex, five truncated segments of FN (D1–D5) were constructed as indicated in the sketch map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Co-IP assays were performed to determine the association between each of the five FN segments (D1–D5) and the TAK1-TAB complex. We found that the FN WT and D5 was associated with TAK1, TAB1, TAB2, and TAB3 and that there was very little association between D1,D2,D3,D4 and the TAK1-TAB complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to confirm that D5 was a functional domain, a GFP control, wild-type FN, or each of the five FN mutants were transfected along with the IFN-α2 promoter into HEK293 cells, followed by mock infection or SeV infection. Cells were then harvested and luciferase activity measured. The results showed that IFN-α2 promoter activities were significantly inhibited by WT FN or D5 but only moderately affected by D1, D2, D3, or D4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that FN is indeed associated with the TAK1-TAB complex and the main binding part located at the C-terminal domain, D5. We then determined the effect of FN on TAK1 phosphorylation to further explore the biological significance of the above results. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g006">Fig 6F</xref> shows, TAK1 phosphorylation induced by viral infection was significantly enhanced by the depletion of FN.</p>
<p>As FN interacts with both HBsAg and the TAK1-TAB complex, there may be competition between HBsAg and TAB3 for the same FN binding site. In order to clarify this point, GFP control or Flag-HBV large surface protein (HBL) was co-transfected along with pFN and myc-TAB3 into HEK293 cells. Co-IP assays were then performed to determine protein interactions. We found that HBL strengthens the association between FN and TAB3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152721.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), indicating that there was no competition between HBsAg and TAB3.</p>
<p>Current knowledge of FN are focused on the extracellular type. The role of intracellular FN remains largely unknown. Whether the extracellular FN interacts with TAK1-TAB complex indirectly through transmembrane protein or the intracellular FN interacts with TAK1-TAB complex directly needs to be clarified. In order to confirm whether the intracellular FN exists, Huh7 cells were thoroughly digested with trypsin proteinase to degrade the extracellular FN[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref040">40</xref>], the cells were then examined for the expression of FN. As <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152721.s004">S4A Fig</xref> shows, there was surely intracellular FN existence in the cells although the expression level is lower than the extracellular FN. We also discovered that the FN-TAK1 interaction increased in the presence of HBV expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152721.s004">S4B Fig</xref>) which is consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g006">Fig 6B</xref>.

<p>As NF-κB is the key regulator downstream the TAK1-TAB complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref012">12</xref>], we next explore whether NF-κB mediates the suppression of IFN-α by FN. First, the inhibition effect on NF-κB pathway by BAY-11, an NF-κB inhibitor, was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). And then the results showed that IFN-α activation by the knockdown of FN was suppressed by BAY-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), suggesting that NF-κB in involved in the inhibition of IFN-α expression by FN. In addition, the effect of FN on NF-κB activity was investigated using a luciferase reporter assay. The result in showed that FN significantly suppressed the activity of NF-κB elicited by Sev stimulation in Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65 but not p50 was found to be inhibited by FN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Taken together, FN inhibits IFN-α production through decreasing the nuclear transport of NF-κB/p65.</p>

<title>FN Strengthens HBV Enhancer Activity</title>
<p>In addition to the IFN pathway, we also tested whether or not FN regulates liver-specific transcriptional factors that support HBV replication. HBV promoter reporter constructs EI and EII were transfected into Huh7 cells along with pFN. Results from the luciferase activity assays indicated that FN activated both HBV EI and EII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). After screening the effects of FN on the expression of seven transcriptional factors (HNF-4α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), farnesoid X receptor α (FXRα), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1), estrogen-related receptor (ERR)β, and ERRγ) which are known to support HBV transcription, we found that only HNF-4α was regulated by FN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152721.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, wild-type HBV EI and EII, and HNF-4α-mutant EI and EII constructs (EI HNF-4α-Mut and EII HNF-4α-Mut) were co-transfected into Huh7 cells along with shNC or shFN. Subsequent luciferase activity assays showed that knockdown of FN reduced the activity of both wild-type EI and EI HNF-4α-Mut significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of FN only inhibited the activity of wild-type EII but not EII HNF-4α-Mut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). These data suggest that FN may selectively enhance HNF-4α-mediated HBV EII activity.</p>
<p>We then examined HNF-4α expression by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis before and after the knockdown of FN to verify our previous results. We found that knockdown of FN reduced HNF-4α mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). In addition, NC-KD cells and FN-KD cells were transfected with pHBV, and ChIP assays were then performed to test the binding capability of HNF-4α to HBV EI and EII. The results showed that binding of HNF-4α to HBV EII decreased significantly in FN-KD cells compared with NC-KD cells. In contrast, binding of HNF-4α to HBV EI showed scarcely any change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). These results demonstrate that FN promotes HNF-4α-mediated HBV EII, but not EI, activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are few studies regarding the relationship between FN and HBV, but it is suggested that human liver sinusoid FN binds to HBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref016">16</xref>]. In addition, asialoglycoprotein receptor, FN, and HBsAg were found to bind to each other. Both asialoglycoprotein receptor and FN could promote the binding of HBsAg to several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref017">17</xref>]. Other studies found that FN accelerates HBV infection in primary cultured fetal hepatocytes in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref018">18</xref>], and that protease cleavage or anti-sense oligonucleotide treatment indicate that FN is important for HBV propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref034">34</xref>]. These previous studies indicate that FN may be involved in HBV expression and replication; however, a detailed mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we found novel roles for FN in facilitating HBV expression and replication. Firstly, HBV upregulated FN expression in both clinical samples and cultured cells. The increased FN then antagonized the endogenous IFN pathway, leading to enhanced viral protein synthesis and HBV DNA replication. Secondly, FN promoted HBV replication and expression by strengthening the recruitment of HNF-4α to HBV EII. Our results reveal the important contributions of host factors to HBV maintenance.</p>
<p>Considering that FN expression is elevated in HBV patients, we used different types of hepatic cell cultures to verify whether the up-regulation of FN was induced by HBV. HBV enhanced FN expression at both mRNA and protein levels <italic>in vitro</italic>, as similar as in HBV patients. Although the induction of FN was only about 2 to 3 folds, it has important physiological significance as FN is one of the most abundant proteins in the hepatocytes and serum[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we constructed a stable FN-KD cell line to investigate the role of FN in HBV replication. HBV expression and replication declined in FN-KD cells, and HBeAg, HBsAg, and HBV DNA were rescued by exogenous FN. Interestingly, the rescued level of HBsAg was significantly higher than that of HBeAg and HBV DNA when compared with their corresponding controls. The HBsAg synthesis pathway is separated from the viral replication pathway, although it is synthesized from the same viral genome as HBV DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref041">41</xref>]. This may explain why the rescued HBsAg level is not entirely in accordance with HBeAg or HBV DNA.</p>
<p>Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a small satellite RNA virus of HBV and propagates only when coexisting with HBV. Viral hepatitis D is considered as one of the most severe forms of human viral hepatitis. Although some efforts were made, the mechanisms and therapies for HVD infection remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref043">43</xref>]. HDV markers may reflect the infection of HBV to a certain extent. In previous reports, seven days post HDV infected with Huh7, HepG2, Hepa1–6 and AML-12 cells expressed NTCP, HDAg can be evidently detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref044">44</xref>]. In Human NTCP transgenic mice, HDV RNA reached peak level around 6 day post infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref045">45</xref>]. The time of FN induction was day 9 post HBV infected HepG2-NTCP cells and it is comparable to the reported observation of HDV which may indicate the induction of FN was followed the production of HBV and HDV.</p>
<p>IFN-α remains one of the most effective compounds in HBV therapy even though HBV is considered an immune-resistant virus. Previous study showed that HBV could inhibit the innate responses in HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref046">46</xref>]. In the present study, we identified a previously undescribed role for FN in facilitating HBV expression and replication by hampering the production of IFN-α and ISGs. The liver is not only an immune organ but also plays a role in immune tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref047">47</xref>], and we found that FN inhibits IFN-α and ISG production. In addition, the adaptor proteins in the IFN pathway, the TAK1-TAB complex, were found to interact with FN, and TAK1 phosphorylation was inhibited by FN. According to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g005">Fig 5D, FN</xref> did not significantly influence IFN-α promoter activity without virus infection. Similarly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, the interaction between FN and the TAK-TAB complex was much weaker before virus incubation, suggesting that HBV promotes the expression of FN and triggers the interaction between FN and the TAK1-TAB complex to maintain its expression and replication.</p>
<p>We found that the C-terminal domain of the FN functional domain had the strongest interaction with TAB3 in the TAK1-TAB complex. The other segments also had some interaction with the TAK1-TAB complex, possibly due to the peculiar structure of FN. Cellular FN has many repeating domains with many similarities and only few significant differences among the domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref049">49</xref>], and it has also been suggested that more than one domain of FN binds to heparin and fibrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>As a general rule, host cells can sense the viral infection and activate innate/adaptive immue response. However, some virus including HBV do not trigger a strong immune response nor induce an obvious production of type I IFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref051">51</xref>]. Previous studies have showed that HBV inhibits antiviral immunity, induces immune tolerance as well as inhibits type I IFN production and signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref052">52</xref>]. Besides, HBV protein components can impair type I IFN transcription in different ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref053">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref055">55</xref>].Because of these reasons, we used Sendai virus as an alternative agonist to stimulate IFN-α production to study the mechanism of FN in interfering IFN signaling.</p>
<p>In addition to inhibition of IFN-α production, HBV EI and EII were also activated by FN to facilitate HBV expression and replication. Interestingly, FN selectively influenced the HNF-4α binding capacity to HBV EII but not HBV EI. This result may be partly attributed to the fact that there is only one transcriptional factor (HNF-4α) binding site in the 1660–1680 bp region in HBV EII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref056">56</xref>], but there are a few transcription factor (HNF-4α, PPARα, and RXRα) binding sites in the HBV EI 990–1020 bp region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152721.ref057">57</xref>]. These other transcriptional factors may have an alternative role, which necessitates further investigation.</p>
<p>In the present study, we uncovered the mechanisms by which FN facilitates HBV replication. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g009">Fig 9</xref>, HBV increased FN expression through activation of Sp1. In turn, the induced FN facilitates HBV expression and replication through two distinct mechanisms. On the one hand, FN binds to the TAK1-TAB complex, inhibits TAK1 phosphorylation and reduces the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 to decrease IFN-α production; on the other hand, FN increases HNF-4α-mediated HBV EII activity. Together with those of previous studies, our results suggest that FN may be a potential and attractive target for HBV therapy.</p>
