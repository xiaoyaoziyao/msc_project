            <title>Background</title>
            <p>Therapies directed at augmenting regulatory T cell (Treg) activities <italic>in vivo</italic> as a systemic treatment for autoimmune disorders and transplantation may be associated with significant off-target effects, including a generalized immunosuppression that may compromise beneficial immune responses to infections and cancer cells. Adoptive cellular therapies using purified expanded Tregs represents an attractive alternative to systemic treatments, with results from animal studies noting increased therapeutic potency of antigen-specific Tregs over polyclonal populations. However, current methodologies are limited in terms of the capacity to isolate and expand a sufficient quantity of endogenous antigen-specific Tregs for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, FOXP3+ Tregs fall largely within the CD4+ T cell subset and are thus routinely MHC class II-specific, whereas class I-specific Tregs may function optimally <italic>in vivo</italic> by facilitating direct tissue recognition.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec>
            <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
            <p>To overcome these limitations, we have developed a novel means for generating large numbers of antigen-specific Tregs involving lentiviral T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer into <italic>in vitro</italic> expanded polyclonal natural Treg populations. Tregs redirected with a high-avidity class I-specific TCR were capable of recognizing the melanoma antigen tyrosinase in the context of HLA-A*0201 and could be further enriched during the expansion process by antigen-specific reactivation with peptide loaded artificial antigen presenting cells. These <italic>in vitro</italic> expanded Tregs continued to express FOXP3 and functional TCRs, and maintained the capacity to suppress conventional T cell responses directed against tyrosinase, as well as bystander T cell responses. Using this methodology in a model tumor system, murine Tregs designed to express the tyrosinase TCR effectively blocked antigen-specific effector T cell (Teff) activity as determined by tumor cell growth and luciferase reporter-based imaging.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec>
            <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
            <p>These results support the feasibility of class I-restricted TCR transfer as a promising strategy to redirect the functional properties of Tregs and provide for a more efficacious adoptive cell therapy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Natural regulatory T cells (nTregs), defined by expression of the transcription factors FOXP3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Fontenot1">[1]</xref> and more recently Eos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Pan1">[2]</xref>, play a critical role in maintaining immune tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Chatenoud1">[3]</xref>. Recent interest has been directed at this population as a means for providing cellular therapy in settings of both autoimmunity and transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Brusko1">[4]</xref>. In comparison, relatively non-specific therapies such as anti-CD3, anti-thymocyte globulin, cytokines, and adhesion molecule based agents are associated with significant non-specific immunological effects and side-effects. Despite these limitations, important mechanistic findings have emerged from these immune therapies. First, short term modulation of T cells can elicit long-term effects on immune tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Chatenoud2">[5]</xref>. Second, many of these agents thought to provide long-lived efficacy are considered to do so through promoting Treg subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-StClair1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Treg transfers have been shown to effectively prevent or even reverse disease, which is especially interesting in settings of autoimmunity where such disorders are thought to result from the genetic absence or loss of Tregs from the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Sakaguchi1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Williams1">[8]</xref>. A growing list of potential mechanisms of action for Tregs includes both cell-cell contact dependent and independent mechanisms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Tang1">[9]</xref>). From these numerous pathways, a common theme has emerged that Tregs function by multiple mechanisms at the site of antigen presentation; both in draining lymphoid tissue and at the site of inflammation, to create a regulatory milieu that promotes bystander suppression and infectious tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Thornton1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Qin1">[11]</xref>. In other words, activated Tregs are capable of suppressing cells recognizing common, as well as unrelated antigens in the local microenvironment and function to direct the development of activated conventional T cells (Tconv) toward a tolerant state. Discovering of the importance of Tregs in maintaining immune tolerance has opened a potentially new means of therapeutic intervention in immunology – namely, adoptive Treg therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Riley1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The concept of adoptive cell transfer initially emerged in the mid-1950s as a means to manipulate immune responses in the field of cancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Mitchison1">[13]</xref>. Cellular therapies have also been employed in patients with HIV using co-stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Levine1">[14]</xref>, as well as in the reconstitution of T cells following autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Porter1">[15]</xref>. While these treatments were designed to augment immune responses or stem cell recovery, a related approach involving transfer of T cells, specifically Tregs, has been employed to modify the immune response in autoimmune settings. The transfer of T cells from tolerized mice can prevent and/or reverse autoimmune disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Alyanakian1">[16]</xref>. The efficacy of transferred Tregs as a therapeutic modality has been demonstrated in animal models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Scalapino1">[17]</xref>, multiple sclerosis (MS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Kohm1">[18]</xref>, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Mottet1">[19]</xref>, oophoritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Setiady1">[20]</xref>, and type 1 diabetes (T1D) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Bluestone1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Masteller1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Tang2">[23]</xref>, among others.</p>
      <p>Although the therapeutic potential for Treg-based therapies is now well-established in animal models, to date adoptive Treg therapy has not been directly applied to suppress autoimmunity in humans. A number of challenges exist that need to be overcome in order to employ these cells in clinical settings, including the need for robust methods to isolate and expand this rare population. We recently described a clinically-relevant FACS-based isolation and <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion procedure for generating Tregs from patients with T1D using the markers CD4, CD25 (IL-2 receptor α-chain), and CD127 (IL-7 receptor α-chain) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Putnam1">[24]</xref>. This approach was based on the observation that CD127 is inversely correlated with FOXP3 expression in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Liu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Seddiki1">[26]</xref>. Utilizing this method, we demonstrated that isolation of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>lo/−</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>T cell fraction yields an enriched population of Tregs that can be stably expanded <italic>in vitro</italic> without the need for additional selective agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Liu1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As previously discussed, numerous examples exist that antigen-specific Tregs are more effective in several autoimmune syndromes when compared to polyclonal populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Bluestone1">[21]</xref>. With this, a major challenge in antigen-specific Treg therapy in humans lies in the isolation of sufficient quantities of antigen-specific T cells - a challenge that is not easily overcome in humans where sampling is largely limited to peripheral blood. Limited but appreciable progress has recently been made to address this need including the development of reagents allowing for specific labeling of known antigen-specific T cells (e.g., peptide-MHC multimer staining of autoreactive cells); however, this approach is limited by several factors including the frequency of antigen-specific T cells in the periphery and the limited availability of appropriate peptide-MHC multimers. Adaptive Treg, such as those of the T<sub>R</sub>1- or T<sub>H</sub>3-type, can be generated from Tconv cell populations by culture under selective growth media conditions (e.g., rapamycin, retinoic acid, TGF-β or IL-10) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Battaglia1">[27]</xref>. Other efforts to overcome limited cell numbers have focused on delivering the transcription factor FOXP3 to Tconv cell populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Allan1">[28]</xref>. However, both of these approaches to generate <italic>de novo</italic> Tregs are not without limitations. Specifically, adaptive Treg populations often lack the epigenetic profile of nTregs (i.e., they are often methylated at the <italic>FOXP3</italic>-Treg specific demethylation region (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Huehn1">[29]</xref>), bringing their stability <italic>in vivo</italic> into question. In the case of <italic>FOXP3</italic> gene transfer, expression of the transcription factor is required for Treg development, however transfer of <italic>FOXP3</italic> to Tconv cells does not recapitulate the full repertoire of transcripts and functional characteristics of nTregs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Hill1">[30]</xref>. Therefore, the approach we took was to initiate efforts with a fully mature polyclonal nTreg population isolated from peripheral blood and redirect cell specificity by viral TCR gene transfer. This approach has been employed previously as a cancer immunotherapy studies which showed that TCR α and β-chains could be introduced into CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in order to create a tumor-directed Teff cell population that upon adoptive transfer destroyed pre-existing tumor mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Tahara1">[31]</xref>. This approach has been shown to augment the therapeutic profile of mouse Tregs in an arthritis model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Wright1">[32]</xref>, as well as redirect human Tregs using a chimeric immunoreceptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Hombach1">[33]</xref>. In this study, we demonstrate that the specificity of polyclonal human natural Tregs can be redirected by lentiviral TCR gene transfer. Moreover, we demonstrate in a proof-of-principal study that CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs can be engineered with class I-specific TCRs capable of suppressing immunity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

         <title>Generation of a lentiviral expression vector expressing a tumor-specific TCR</title>
         <p>To express <italic>de novo</italic> TCRs in Tregs, we first generated an expression vector employing a previously characterized tumor-reactive TCR (TyrTCR) that recognizes the melanoma antigen tyrosinase in the context of the MHC class I molecule HLA-A*0201 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Roszkowski1">[34]</xref>. The multicystronic expression vector allowed for equimolar TCR α and β chains by the inclusion of a T2A element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Szymczak1">[35]</xref> followed by an IRES element and eGFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). This receptor functions independently of the co-receptor; allowing for productive TCR signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Roszkowski1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Nishimura1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Roszkowski2">[37]</xref>. Lentiviral transduction of Jurkat T cells was detected by flow cytometric analysis based on GFP reporter and tyrosinase-specific TCR Vβ12 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). Signaling by the introduced TCR was further validated by upregulation of CD69 and production of IL-2 following stimulation with artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC, K562 cell line expressing HLA-A2, CD80, and CD83) and tyrosinase peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g001"><bold>Figure 1C,D</bold></xref>).</p>

               <p>(<italic>A</italic>) The tyrosinase TCR expression vector consists of a pSICO backbone, which has been modified to express the TCR α and β receptors derived from a CD4<sup>+</sup> tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (clone TIL I383I). The resulting construct drives TCR-α and TCR-β proteins under the MND promoter from a single 2A peptide-linked tricistronic lentiviral vector followed by an eGFP reporter. (<italic>B</italic>) Human Jurkat T cells were transduced with the lentiviral construct by spin infection and sorted for the tyrosinase reactive TCR 72 h post-transduction. Sorted and Vβ12<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>+</sup> or mock transduced cells were then tested for their capacity to respond to their cognate peptide presented by artificial APCs (aAPCs). These K562-derived aAPCs present peptide in the context of human HLA-A*0201 along with the costimulatory/adaptor molecules CD80 and CD83.

         <title>Stability and functional capacity of TCR-redirected primary human CD4 T cells</title>
         <p>Given our ability to express a functional TCR in Jurkat T cells, we next sought to validate expression in primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Freshly isolated human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were activated for 48 hr with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28-coated beads prior to transduction with lentivirus expressing the TyrTCR. GFP and TCR Vβ12 co-expressing cells were isolated by fluorescence-based cell sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). Expression of surface TCR was stable following <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>) and the TyrTCR-transduced cells responded specifically to tyrosinase peptide in a dose-responsive fashion. No proliferation was observed from the native GFP<sup>−</sup>Vβ12<sup>+</sup> sorted population stimulated with tyrosinase peptide or from the GFP<sup>+</sup>Vβ12<sup>+</sup> T cell population incubated with an irrelevant HLA-A*201-restricted control peptide (MART-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g002"><bold>Figure 2C,D</bold></xref>). Cytokine production (IFN-γ, IL-10) by TyrTCR-transduced cells was also detected following co-culture with a melanoma tumor cell line expressing tyrosinase naturally processed and presented in the context of HLA-A*0201 (data not shown). The successful <italic>de novo</italic> expression of a functional TCR in primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells facilitated the subsequent targeting of this receptor to Tregs.</p>

         <title>Generation of engineered human Treg and Tconv cells</title>
         <p>We recently described a clinically-relevant FACS-based isolation and <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion procedure for generating Tregs enriched in FOXP3 expression in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Liu1">[25]</xref>. Utilizing this method, we demonstrated that isolation of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>lo/−</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells yielded a highly enriched population of Tregs that are greater than 90–95% FOXP3<sup>+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Putnam1">[24]</xref>. Subsequent studies suggested that the inclusion of CD45RA as a positive selection marker resulted in greater enrichment of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T cells and maximum stability following <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Hoffmann1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Hoffmann2">[39]</xref> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011726.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). The purity and stability of this sorted population was further validated by assessing FOXP3 protein and FOXP3 promoter methylation status following <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion. Prior reports have suggested that only <italic>bona-fide</italic> nTregs remain demethylated at the <italic>FOXP3</italic> gene Treg-specific demethylation region (TSDR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Floess1">[40]</xref>. CD45RA<sup>+</sup> Tregs were determined to be FOXP3<sup>+</sup> by FACS (mean+SD, 92.3+9.6%, N = 8) and demethylated at the TSDR (91.0+15.3%) following a 14 day expansion period, demonstrating the specific expansion of the nTreg subset (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011726.s001">Figure S1G</xref></bold>).</p>
         <p>Next, the polyclonal population of purified nTregs was infected with lentivirus expressing a GFP reporter following activation as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. High levels of GFP expression were detected following <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion with no significant reduction in expansion capacity or suppressive function (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011726.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>). Given the high efficiency of transgene expression in Tregs, we subsequently transduced a population of purified naïve Tregs and Tconv cells with a lentiviral TyrTCR construct. Freshly sorted cells were activated for 48 hr <italic>in vitro</italic> prior to a single infection with lentivirus encoding the TyrTCR. Surface TCR and tetramer staining, along with GFP reporter expression were analyzed by flow cytometry at day nine of the <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion period. Initial transduction of Tregs resulted in a degree of heterogeneity in the level of TCR and GFP reporter expression. Flow cytometric analysis indicated 20.7±16.6% of cells expressed eGFP, whereas 13.2±14.5% of cells were GFP<sup>+</sup>Vβ12<sup>+</sup> following nine days of <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion (<italic>N</italic> = 10). Surface expression of TCR Vβ12 might not indicate functional receptor expression, given the possibility for heterologous pairing with endogenous TCR α and β chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Govers1">[41]</xref>. To further validate proper surface expression, HLA-A*201-tyrosinase tetramer staining of transduced Tregs revealed 33.5% of cells were GFP<sup>+</sup>TyrTCR tetramer<sup>+</sup>, whereas 16.8% of Tconv cells were GFP<sup>+</sup>TyrTCR tetramer<sup>+</sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011726.s003">Figure S3B</xref></bold>).</p>
         <p>We observed that increasing lentiviral titer led to only modest increases in the number of cells expressing functional receptors (data not shown). Therefore, we sought to enrich antigen-specific T cells while limiting non-specific growth, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Maus1">[42]</xref>. At day nine, cells expressing the TyrTCR were restimulated with aAPCs and tyrosinase peptide. This antigen-specific activation led to enrichment of the transduced cells with 66.1% of Treg and 50.3% of Tconv cells expressing both GFP and the TyrTCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g003"><bold>Figure 3A,B</bold></xref>). Mock transduced cells were restimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 coated beads. The expansion capacity of TyrTCR Tregs expanded on aAPC and peptide was dependent upon the initial transduction efficiency (<italic>N</italic> = 3; median 480-fold, range 240 to 1088-fold). Of note, we were able to obtain &gt;5200-fold expansion of TyrTCR<sup>+</sup> Tregs yielding 1.18×10<sup>9</sup> cells (89.3% eGFP<sup>+</sup>, 91.7% FOXP3<sup>+</sup>), from an initial blood volume of 80 ml by extending the culture to day 20 (data not shown).</p>

As a population, Tregs expressing the TyrTCR expressed comparable levels of FOXP3 (95.6±2.0) in comparison to mock Tregs (93.6±2.3; <italic>N</italic> = 8, <italic>P</italic> = not significant). It is interesting to note that Tconv cells expanded poorly under our Treg growth conditions and tended to upregulate FOXP3 protein as determined by FACS (33.8±17.9 vs 35.9±22.8 for mock and TyrTCR, respectively, <italic>N</italic> = 3). Despite this induction of FOXP3 protein, epigenetic analysis of the <italic>FOXP3</italic>-TSDR indicated the absence of <italic>bona-fide</italic> Tregs (0.02% and 2.81% demethylated for mock and TyrTCR Tconv cells, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g003"><bold>Figure 3C,D</bold></xref>).

         <p>The therapeutic efficacy of Tregs depends on their capacity to suppress an array of T cell responses in a bystander fashion, as well as antigen-specific fashion. In order to address this issue, we tested the capacity of TyrTCR-transduced Tregs to suppress proliferation of hemagglutinin (HA) peptide-reactive Teff cells. To generate human HA-reactive Teff cells, we labeled PBMCs from a HLA-DR*0401 individual with CFSE and stimulated with HA peptide<sub>(306–318)</sub> to induce expansion of endogenous HA-specific T cells. Following 14 day expansion, CFSE-diluted cells (&gt;13% HLA-DR*0401 HA-tetramer<sup>+</sup>; data not shown) were used as responding Teff cells in subsequent assays. For suppression assays, TyrTCR Tregs were stimulated in the context of HLA-A*0201, while the responding Teff cells were stimulated in the context of HLA class II DR*0401 APCs incubated with HA peptide<sub>(306–318)</sub>. To test the specific activation requirements of Tregs in mediating bystander suppression, TyrTCR-transduced Tregs were stimulated with tyrosinase peptide or the irrelevant HLA-A*0201 restricted MART-1 peptide. This analysis indicated that TyrTCR-transduced Tregs were indeed capable of suppressing HA-reactive Teff cell proliferation in a bystander fashion and demonstrated that TyrTCR cells maintained optimal potency when activated specifically through the introduced TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>). This was particularly apparent at lower and more physiological ratios of Tregs to Teff cells (i.e. <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>∶1, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>∶1, and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub>∶1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>). Despite this increased potency, we observed some antigen non-specific suppression by TyrTCR Tregs <italic>in vitro</italic> (particularly at higher Treg to Teff cell ratios, i.e. 1∶1), suggesting that Tregs may not be fully rested following the activation received during the <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion protocol. We also analyzed the ability of TyrTCR Tregs to influence cytokine production (e.g. IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-10) when co-incubated with a tumor infiltrating cell line (TIL1235) and peptide pulsed APCs. Consistent with our prior investigations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Putnam1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Brusko2">[44]</xref>, TyrTCR transduced Tregs suppressed effector T cell cytokine production in a dose-responsive fashion for IFN-γ and IL-2. Interestingly, the reciprocal cytokine production profile was seen for IL-10, wherein co-cultures with TyrTCR Tregs, but not mock Tregs produced the highest levels of this immunoregulatory cytokine (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011726.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>). While <italic>in vitro</italic> suppressive activity is an important indication of Treg function, it does not reflect the full activity of Tregs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, we sought to test whether TCR-transduced Tregs were capable of suppressing T cell-mediated tissue damage <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

         <p>We monitored the expansion and distribution of TyrTCR-expressing Teff cells using an <italic>in vivo</italic> luciferase reporter in treatment groups receiving TyrTregs, mock-vector transduced Tregs, or mock-vector transduced Teff cells. Imaging during the experimental time-course revealed broad TyrTCR Teff cell distribution and tumor infiltration in mice receiving either polyclonal Tregs or Teff cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>). In contrast, TyrTCR Teff cell expansion was restricted in mice receiving antigen-specific TyrTCR Tregs. This was most apparent at day eight post transfer with 5.6×10<sup>5</sup>, 3.1×10<sup>6</sup>, and 3.9×10<sup>6</sup>photons/sec/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr detected for TyrTCR Treg, polyclonal Treg, and Teff cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g005"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>).

         <p>TyrTCR-redirected Teff cells are highly effective at facilitating tumor regression upon transfer. We tested the capacity of antigen-specific Tregs to block tumor immunity in mice receiving TyrTCR Tregs, polyclonal Tregs, or control Teff cells. Mice receiving TyrTCR-redirected Tregs effectively blocked TyrTCR Teff cell-mediated tumor rejection as determined by tumor size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011726-g005"><bold>Figure 5E</bold></xref>). In contrast, a partial suppressive effect was observed in mice treated with polyclonal Tregs, with near complete tumor rejection observed in mice receiving Teff cells alone. These data argue that TCR-redirected Tregs are indeed capable of suppressing Teff cell responses <italic>in vivo</italic>, and further demonstrate that antigen-specific Tregs are more potent than polyclonal Tregs in limiting Teff-cell mediated tissue destruction.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we describe a novel method to generate therapeutically relevant numbers of antigen-specific human Tregs. These TCR-redirected Tregs can be selectively enriched <italic>in vitro</italic> by reactivation with APCs and peptide to reach clinically viable cell numbers (i.e., in the range of 10<sup>9</sup> cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Riley1">[12]</xref>. Lentiviral infected Tregs expand with similar kinetics to mock-infected Tregs and maintain the phenotypic and functional characteristics of nTregs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Specifically, antigen-specific Tregs suppressed Teff cells recognizing a common antigen (tyrosinase), in addition to bystander Teff cell responses. Importantly, the suppressive phenotype of human Tregs expressing the TyrTCR was recapitulated <italic>in vivo</italic> using murine Tregs and antigen-specific Teff cells.</p>
      <p>Recent studies suggest that Tregs may exert direct tissue protective effects, in addition to their ability to limit Teff cell responses. Mechanistically, Tregs are thought to accomplish this through enzymatic pathways that reduce oxidative stress and produce anti-inflammatory byproducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Borsellino1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Deaglio1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Brusko3">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Yan1">[48]</xref>. Here we show that Tregs can be directed to recognize MHC class I-restricted antigens allowing direct tissue recognition by transfer of a high-avidity TCR. This capability allows Treg activity to be directed to specific tissue microenvironments and target tissues deficient in APCs expressing MHC class II molecules. While not specifically addressed here, the use of TCR gene transfer to Tregs should facilitate studies addressing the optimal affinity of receptors as well as the lineage stability of Tregs in humanized animal model systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Brehm1">[49]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This technology opens up avenues for additional transgenes to be transferred in addition to the TCR as therapeutic gene cassettes. This approach could extend the function of engineered Tregs beyond that of even native Tregs. For example, the desired TCRs may be expressed along with a combination of immunoregulatory cytokines (IL-10 or TGF-β), chemokine receptors or tissue-homing receptors, or even tissue regenerative growth factors if necessary.</p>
      <p>The use of viral gene transfer in Treg therapy settings confers the ability to address several important safety concerns. First, while a high purity of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs was detected following our expansion procedure, the concern remains that an autoreactive TCR could potentially be expressed in a contaminating Teff cell or a Treg cell that has lost regulatory function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Zhou1">[50]</xref>. Our approach could reinforce the regulatory program by the expression of FOXP3, or other regulatory genes in our expression cassette. Second, our system allows for the inclusion of inducible suicide genes or depletion markers should situations involving leukemia or pan-immunosuppression result.</p>
      <p>One potential concern with this approach is the possibility for mismatched pairing of the introduced α and β TCR chains with the endogenous TCR subunits, resulting in reduced surface expression and biological activity. Mismatched pairing of receptors could potentially also generate harmful reactivities when expressed in effector T cell subsets. Cohen and colleagues previously addressed this issue by adding a single cysteine on each receptor chain to promote the formation of an inter-chain disulfide bond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Cohen1">[51]</xref>. These cysteine-modified receptors retain their function and lead to preferential pairing, thus interfering with heterologous chain pairing between introduced and endogenous receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Cohen1">[51]</xref>. Strategies such as codon optimization of TCR α and β chains have also been used to optimize <italic>de novo</italic> TCR expression over the endogenous receptors (reviewed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Thomas1">[52]</xref>). The tyrosinase TCR used in our animal model experiments incorporated many of these modifications resulting in improved pairing and <italic>in vivo</italic> function.</p>
      <p>In summary, novel gene therapy approaches, in concert with the previously outlined cellular therapeutics may offer new opportunities to generate antigen-specific tolerance by targeting the regulatory properties of Tregs to specific antigen targest. Prior studies employing adoptive cell therapy in the cancer setting imply that large numbers of transferred cells may be required in order to elicit a therapeutic effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Riley1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011726-Paulos1">[53]</xref>. Here we demonstrated a strategy to efficiently generate therapeutic numbers of antigen-specific Tregs from low starting peripheral blood volumes. Applications of this strategy to engineer Tregs capable of recognizing autoantigens targeted in T1D are currently underway, with the goal of developing robust and targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and transplantation.</p>
