<abstract>
<p>Regulatory T cells (Tregs) obtain immunosuppressive capacity by the upregulation of <italic>forkhead box protein 3</italic> (<italic>Foxp3</italic>), and persistent expression of this transcription factor is required to maintain their immune regulatory function and ensure immune homeostasis. Stable <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression is achieved through epigenetic modification of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR), an evolutionarily conserved non-coding element within the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene locus. Here, we present molecular data suggesting that TSDR enhancer activity is restricted to T cells and cannot be induced in other immune cells such as macrophages or B cells. Since NF-κB signaling has been reported to be instrumental to induce <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression during Treg development, we analyzed how NF-κB factors are involved in the molecular regulation of the TSDR. Unexpectedly, we neither observed transcriptional activity of a previously postulated NF-κB binding site within the TSDR nor did the entire TSDR show any transcriptional responsiveness to NF-κB activation at all. Finally, the NF-κB subunit c-Rel revealed to be dispensable for epigenetic imprinting of sustained <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression by TSDR demethylation. In conclusion, we show that NF-κB signaling is not substantially involved in TSDR-mediated stabilization of <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression in Tregs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are cellular mediators of immunological tolerance as they possess the capacity to suppress various types of immune responses against self and non-self antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Sakaguchi1">[1]</xref>. The transcription factor <italic>forkhead box protein 3</italic> (<italic>Foxp3</italic>) is specifically expressed in Tregs and is essential for the development of their immunosuppressive properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Fontenot1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Gavin1">[3]</xref>. After induction during Treg development, continued expression of <italic>Foxp3</italic> is imperative for the maintenance of the cells’ suppressive phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Williams1">[4]</xref>. Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs bear a curative potential and are considered for various therapeutic applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Leslie1">[5]</xref>, however, instability of <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression and concomitant acquirement of proinflammatory properties are major obstacles. Stable <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression is accompanied by epigenetic modulation of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR), a CpG-rich, non-coding sequence within the first intron of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Huehn1">[6]</xref>. The TSDR is demethylated only in Tregs stably expressing <italic>Foxp3</italic> but is fully methylated in CD4<sup>+</sup> conventional T cells (Tconv) and in <italic>in vitro</italic> generated Tregs only transiently expressing <italic>Foxp3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Floess1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, transcriptional enhancer activity of the TSDR in an <italic>in vitro</italic> reporter assay is essentially determined by its methylation status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky2">[10]</xref>. It is completely inactive in its methylated state, but as soon as the TSDR is demethylated transcription factors such as Ets-1 and Creb can bind to the TSDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Kim1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Mouly1">[11]</xref> and switch on its transcriptional activity, most likely in cooperation with other transcription factors that have been demonstrated to occupy the TSDR, e.g. Stat-5 and Runx1/3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Haiqi1">[12]</xref>. Despite the critical role of the TSDR for stabilization of <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression, the molecular players participating in its transcriptional regulation are only incompletely understood. Elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms may open up new approaches to modulate stability of <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression, which is of outmost importance for the therapeutic application of Tregs in clinical settings.</p>
<p>Recently, NF-κB transcription factors, which are important, inducible regulators of innate and adaptive immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hayden1">[13]</xref>, have been shown to be involved in Treg development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hsieh1">[14]</xref>. In mammals, the NF-κB protein family consists of five members: p65 (RelA), c-Rel, RelB, p50 and p52, all of which share a structural motif known as Rel homology domain that is critical for homo- or hetero-dimerization and DNA binding. Without an appropriate stimulus, NF-κB proteins are trapped in the cytoplasm by inhibitors of NF-κB (IκB) proteins, which shield the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB, thereby preventing their translocation into the nucleus. Similarly, p100 and p105, which are the unprocessed precursor proteins of p52 and p50, respectively, function as IκB (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hayden2">[15]</xref>). In T cells, ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex induces the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, which integrates the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-SchulzeLuehrmann1">[16]</xref>. The two catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ, in cooperation with the scaffold protein IKKγ, can mediate IκB phosphorylation, which is followed by ubiquitination and degradation of IκB, thus releasing NF-κB proteins and permitting nuclear localization of transcriptionally active p65/p50 and p50/c-Rel heterodimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hayden2">[15]</xref>. IKKβ-mediated IκBα degradation is regarded as the central step in canonical NF-κB activation in T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hayden2">[15]</xref>. In contrast, IKKα activity is crucial for the activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, which targets activation of p52/RelB heterodimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Sun1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Many of the TCR/NF-κB signaling mediators contribute to normal Treg development, namely IKKβ, protein kinase C-θ and components of the CBM (Carma-1/Bcl-10/Malt-1; Card [caspase-recruitment domain]-Maguk [membrane-associated guanylate kinase] protein-1, B cell lymphoma-10, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene-1) complex, which functions upstream of IKKβ activation, as well as IκBα, the NF-κB subunit c-Rel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-SchmidtSupprian1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Guckel1">[27]</xref> and the atypical IκB protein IkB<sub>NS</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Schuster1">[28]</xref>. Importantly, it was shown that NF-κB can directly target <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Long1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Schuster1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Grigoriadis1">[31]</xref>, and c-Rel binding to the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter as well as to the recently described pioneer element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Zheng1">[30]</xref> is crucial for initiating <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression during Treg development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hori1">[32]</xref>. However, the contribution of NF-κB to the transcriptional regulation of the TSDR is discussed more controversially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hori1">[32]</xref>. c-Rel binding to the TSDR could be detected in primary Tconv <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Long1">[25]</xref>, and we have recently reported a potential NF-κB binding site within the TSDR that is critical for full TSDR enhancer activity and that is identical to the NF-κB binding site postulated by Long <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Long1">[25]</xref>. In contrast, Ruan <italic>et al</italic>. detected binding of c-Rel and p65 exclusively to the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter in TCR-stimulated T cells, whereas no binding to the TSDR could be observed in the same cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Ruan1">[29]</xref>. Therefore, the contribution of NF-κB to the transcriptional regulation of the TSDR remains obscure and it is not clear whether NF-κB is required for the stabilization of <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression.</p>
<p>In the present study, we could demonstrate that the transcriptional enhancer activity of the TSDR is entirely dependent on T cell-specific signals and is not inducible in other immune cells. Moreover, blocking NF-κB signaling pathways did not significantly influence TSDR enhancer activity, indicating that the TSDR functions in an NF-κB-independent manner. Finally, stable <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression and epigenetic modifications of the TSDR were observed in c-Rel-deficient Tregs. In summary, these data suggest that NF-κB factors are largely dispensable for TSDR-mediated stabilization of <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression and epigenetic remodeling of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> locus.</p>

<title>TSDR Enhancer Activity Requires T cell-specific Signals</title>
<p>Compelling evidence suggests that the TSDR acts as a transcriptional stabilizer of <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression in Tregs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Huehn1">[6]</xref>. In combination with a promoter, the TSDR possesses transcriptional enhancer activity in luciferase reporter assays, which have therefore been a common approach to analyze its transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Long1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Zheng1">[30]</xref>. In the present literature, TSDR enhancer activity has been demonstrated in T cell lines as well as in primary T cells, and this was dependent on the activation of several transcription factors that have usually been triggered by the application of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (PMA/iono) mimicking the TCR stimulus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Haiqi1">[12]</xref>). However, it is not known whether the TSDR can be activated in non-T cells. In order to determine whether other cell types can deliver the molecular requirements to stimulate TSDR activity, we assessed TSDR enhancer activity in the B lymphoma cell line A20 and the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and performed luciferase reporter assays using plasmids encoding luciferase under the control of the TSDR and a promoter. Initially, we tested TSDR enhancer activity in combination with the endogenous <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter. Although the TSDR-<italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter construct was sufficient to drive luciferase expression in the T lymphoma cell line RLM-11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky2">[10]</xref>, weak (A20) or no (RAW 264.7) luciferase activity was observed in A20 and RAW 264.7 cells upon stimulation with PMA/iono (data not shown). We therefore repeated luciferase assays using plasmids integrating the SV40 promoter in combination with the TSDR and measured transcriptional activity in RLM-11 cells, A20 cells and RAW 264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The SV40 promoter was transcriptionally active in all cells and gave rise to increased luciferase activities as compared to empty vector controls upon PMA/iono stimulation (A20 and RLM-11) or interferon-γ (IFN-γ)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (RAW 264.7). As expected, the TSDR was able to augment this activity in RLM-11 cells. In contrast, A20 and RAW 264.7 cells displayed no enhanced luciferase activity in the presence of the TSDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). However, A20 and RAW 264.7 cells showed increased luciferase activity when reporter vectors containing an SV40 enhancer were used. Viewed as a whole, these data implicate that the TSDR depends on T cell-specific signals and cannot be activated in other immune cell types.</p>

<title>A Postulated NF-κB Binding Site within the TSDR is not Responsive to NF-κB Activation in T cells</title>
<p>Comprehensive research has provided evidence that intrinsic NF-κB signaling is crucial for the development of thymus-derived Tregs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hsieh1">[14]</xref>. Several analyses indicate that NF-κB directly participates in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hsieh1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hori1">[32]</xref>. In this study, investigations focused on the role of NF-κB signaling in the regulation of TSDR enhancer activity.</p>
<p>First, we aimed to confirm the activation of NF-κB transcription factors in RLM-11 cells, which we intended to use for subsequent luciferase experiments. To this end, RLM-11 cells were stimulated with PMA/iono for increasing time periods and subcellular localization of NF-κB was analyzed by Western blotting. Expression of NF-κB proteins p105 and c-Rel increased in the cytoplasm upon stimulation and the activated subunits p50, p65 and c-Rel translocated to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g002">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0088318.s001">S1</xref>). Similar results have been obtained in a time course of NF-κB activation in primary murine CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Schuster1">[28]</xref>, indicating similar kinetics of NF-κB activation in RLM-11 cells and primary T cells. Next, transcriptional activity of NF-κB was tested by means of a luciferase assay using the NF-κB-responsive element (NF-κB-RE), a sequence of five repetitive NF-κB binding sites, which drives luciferase expression upon NF-κB activation with the help of a minimal promoter element (TATA box). Upon transfection of RLM-11 cells, PMA/iono stimulation potently induced activation of the NF-κB-RE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>). Thus, in accordance with NF-κB nuclear translocation, NF-κB is transcriptionally active in RLM-11 cells.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) RLM-11 cells were stimulated with PMA/iono for indicated time periods and applied to subcellular fractionation. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. p44/42 and lamin B served as loading and purity controls for cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively. (<bold>B</bold>) A luciferase reporter plasmid integrating the NF-κB-RE was transfected into RLM-11 cells and dual luciferase assays were performed in triplicates as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Mean luciferase activity is shown as fold increase to unstimulated control. Results are representative of four independent experiments.

(<bold>D</bold>) A tandem of five repetitive sequences of the putative NF-κB binding site was inserted into the pCpGL luciferase reporter plasmid upstream of the <italic>EF</italic> promoter (tandem-EFPro).

<p>A putative binding site for NF-κB within the TSDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>) had been described previously to be critically required for the transcriptional enhancer activity of the TSDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Long1">[25]</xref>. However, a final proof that NF-κB binds to this critical site in order to promote TSDR enhancer activity is lacking so far. In order to test whether this sequence comprises NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activity, five repetitive sequences of this putative NF-κB binding site (tandem) were introduced into a luciferase construct containing the <italic>human elongation factor 1</italic> (<italic>EF</italic>) promoter and luciferase assays were performed in RLM-11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>). Despite strongly enhanced <italic>EF</italic> promoter activity when combined with the full TSDR, repetitive sequences of the putative NF-κB binding site alone were not sufficient to enhance <italic>EF</italic> promoter activity, suggesting that this sequence does not function as a transcriptional responder of NF-κB activation.</p>

<title>Activation of NF-κB Signaling Mediators is Largely Dispensable for TSDR Enhancer Activity</title>
<p>NF-κB binding to the TSDR has been observed by chromatin immunoprecipitations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Long1">[25]</xref> and thus, it was still possible that NF-κB signaling was important to obtain full TSDR transcriptional activity mediated by yet unidentified NF-κB binding sites. To address the general impact of NF-κB signaling on the TSDR, functional involvement of IκB kinases (IKK) was analyzed. To this end, TSDR enhancer activity was measured in a luciferase assay in RLM-11 cells in which kinase dead (KD) mutants of IKKα or IKKβ were overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>). Wild-type (WT) IKKs served as controls and functionality of the IKK-KD mutants was proven with luciferase constructs carrying the NF-κB-RE. Whereas overexpression of IKKα-KD or IKKβ-KD drastically reduced transcriptional activity of the NF-κB-RE, no comparable effect was observed for the TSDR albeit overexpression of IKKβ-KD moderately reduced TSDR enhancer activity to about 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>). Furthermore, combined overexpression of IKKα-KD and IKKβ-KD had no synergistic capacity to further minimize TSDR enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>).

To this end, luciferase activity of the TSDR was tested in RLM-11 cells that had been co-transfected with IKK-CA or an empty vector as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). Functionality of IKK-CA was verified in a luciferase assay using the NF-κB-RE, giving rise to a more than 600-fold increase of luciferase activity upon overexpression of IKKβ-CA.

<p>Kinase activity of IKKβ is required to phosphorylate IκBα to target it for degradation. However, it has been shown that IKK additionally phosphorylates other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hayden2">[15]</xref>. As IKKβ moderately influenced TSDR activity, the role of canonical NF-κB signaling in the regulation of TSDR activity was further investigated. For this purpose, luciferase assays were performed in RLM-11 cells overexpressing a phosphorylation- and degradation-resistant mutant form of IκBα, the degradation of which is usually regarded to be a central step during canonical NF-κB signaling. This mutant containing serine-to-alanine changes at amino acid residues 32 and 36 is commonly referred to as NF-κB super-repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-DiDonato1">[34]</xref>. Luciferase activities of the TSDR-<italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter construct and the NF-κB-RE were measured in the presence or absence of the super-repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Overexpression of the super-repressor drastically reduced activity of the NF-κB-RE down to levels that were similar to those of unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast, transcriptional enhancer activity of the TSDR was unaffected upon overexpression of the super-repressor at various time points after stimulation, indicating that degradation of IκBα was not required to stimulate full TSDR enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088318-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0088318.s002">S2</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Stable <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression is indispensable for the maintenance of the established transcriptional program and suppressive capacity of Tregs. In Tregs, <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression is epigenetically imprinted and occurs via demethylation of a highly conserved CpG-rich region within the <italic>Foxp3</italic> locus, designated TSDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Floess1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Toker1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Toker2">[38]</xref>. Since the demethylated TSDR presents an epigenetic mark, which is unique to Tregs, it can clearly distinguish these cells from other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Baron1">[39]</xref>. On a functional level, the TSDR stabilizes <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression and thereby determines Treg lineage stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Huehn1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Miyao1">[40]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms that control TSDR activity are only incompletely understood. Here, we could show that the transcriptional enhancer activity of the TSDR is entirely dependent on T cell-specific signals and can neither be induced in B cells nor macrophages. Furthermore, NF-κB signaling pathways did not significantly influence TSDR activity, suggesting that NF-κB factors are largely dispensable for TSDR-mediated stabilization of <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression.</p>
<p>Various studies have demonstrated that the TSDR accommodates transcriptional enhancer activity in human and murine primary and immortalized T cells and, importantly, that methylation of the TSDR completely abrogates this transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Kim1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Zheng1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Ohkura1">[41]</xref>. On the contrary, forced demethylation of the TSDR by the application of the demethylating drug 5-azacytidine could artificially induce stable <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression in Tconv <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky1">[7]</xref>. Interestingly, this is also true for some non-CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells: <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression was observed in primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells lacking DNA methyltransferase-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Josefowicz1">[42]</xref>, and both, natural killer cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene expression when activated and cultured in the presence of 5-azacytidine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Kim1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Zorn1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>These non-CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells share essential signaling molecules with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including the ζ-chain and the IL-2 receptor β-chain CD122 as well as the downstream transcription factors Creb and Stat-5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Vivier1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Boyman1">[45]</xref>, which were shown to bind to and transactivate the TSDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Kim1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Yao1">[46]</xref>. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that these signaling pathways are key control elements of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> locus in Tregs and that solely the methylation status of the TSDR prevents <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and natural killer cells.</p>
<p>However, the methylation status of the TSDR was not the only determinant controlling <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene activity. We could provide evidence that the transcriptional activity of the TSDR also depends on cell-type-specific signaling pathways. Whereas the TSDR can be activated in T cell lines such as RLM-11 (this study) or EL-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Zheng1">[30]</xref>, TSDR activity could not be detected in B cell or macrophage cell lines upon stimulation with PMA/iono or LPS/IFN-γ. Hence, even though the TSDR was fully demethylated in the luciferase reporter assays in the present study, PMA/iono is only capable of stimulating TSDR activity in T cells, but not in B cells or macrophages, indicating that mere triggering of calcium influx (ionomycin) and protein kinase C activity (PMA) is not sufficient to activate the TSDR. Rather, B cells and macrophages seem to lack expression of essential signaling mediators or transcription factors that are required to promote full TSDR activity. Hence, the dependency on T-cell-specific signaling pathways may ensure that (stable) <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression is permitted only in T cells.</p>
<p>In recent years numerous studies have focused on the identification of transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Haiqi1">[12]</xref>. Among them the NF-κB family of transcription factors has been shown to be crucial for Treg development. The NF-κB signaling pathway is considered to transduce signals emanating from the TCR in order to induce <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression during thymic Treg development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hsieh1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hori1">[32]</xref> and direct binding of NF-κB to the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene locus has frequently been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Long1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Schuster1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Ruan1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Eckerstorfer1">[47]</xref>. The aim of this study was to test the influence of the NF-κB signaling pathway on the enhancer activity of the TSDR and thus on the maintenance of <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression. In agreement with previous publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hayden2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Schuster1">[28]</xref>, we observed efficient nuclear localization of canonical NF-κB subunits upon T cell stimulation. However, the previously postulated NF-κB binding site within the TSDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky2">[10]</xref> was not transcriptionally responsive to cell stimulation and NF-κB activation, implying that NF-κB did not regulate this site. Hence, it remains unclear which factor binds to and regulates this critical site.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it was still conceivable that NF-κB was able to bind to other sites within the TSDR. We therefore assessed the overall influence of NF-κB signaling on TSDR enhancer activity. Canonical NF-κB signaling is regarded to be strictly dependent on IKKβ-mediated degradation of IκBα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Hayden2">[15]</xref>. In this study, by using mutated versions of these key proteins, we could demonstrate that complete abrogation of NF-κB signaling did not considerably impair TSDR enhancer activity. Even though the lack of IKKβ kinase activity slightly weakened TSDR enhancer activity, the super-repressor did not show any such effect suggesting that IKKβ did not act via the classical NF-κB pathway. Instead, cross-reactivity of IKKβ to other signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Oeckinghaus1">[48]</xref> might have influenced TSDR enhancer activity. In a similar experiment, Long <italic>et al.</italic> showed that upon overexpression of the super-repressor in Jurkat cells (a human T cell line) TSDR enhancer activity is significantly reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Long1">[25]</xref>. However, in their experiment the super-repressor also represses activity of the transcriptionally active <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter. The <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter construct used in our study does not have transcriptional activity on its own <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Polansky2">[10]</xref>. For this reason, we believe that in the study by Long <italic>et al</italic>. the observed reduction of the TSDR enhancer activity might be mediated by a compromised activity of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter, whereas in our system we primarily examine effects on the TSDR. This interpretation is in line with the findings that c-Rel binds to the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter but not to the TSDR in TGFβ-induced and <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated Tregs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Ruan1">[29]</xref>. In conclusion, the data presented in this study argue that the classical NF-κB signaling pathway is not involved in the control of TSDR enhancer activity but may regulate other regulatory elements of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene locus, such as the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter or the pioneer element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Zheng1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>The NF-κB subunit c-Rel has been shown to have the most drastic impact on Treg development of all NF-κB family members. c-Rel<sup>−/−</sup> Tregs (the few that do develop in c-Rel<sup>−/−</sup> mice) express normal levels of <italic>Foxp3</italic> (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Visekruna1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Isomura1">[35]</xref>) and exhibit normal Treg transcriptional signature and suppressive capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Isomura1">[35]</xref>, indicating that an essential function of c-Rel emerges in developing Tregs, but not in mature Tregs. In accordance with this notion, we here show that c-Rel<sup>−/−</sup> Tregs displayed stable <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression and a demethylated TSDR. Interestingly, c-Rel has the capacity to induce chromatin remodeling as it has been shown for the <italic>Il2</italic> locus and as it has been proposed for the <italic>Foxp3</italic> pioneer element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Zheng1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Rao1">[36]</xref>. However, our data suggest that in developing Tregs c-Rel is not involved in TSDR demethylation. So far it is not known whether c-Rel or any other NF-κB subunit possess the ability to differentiate between methylated and unmethylated DNA, but as c-Rel has been detected to occupy the TSDR in Jurkat cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Long1">[25]</xref> harboring a fully methylated TSDR (unpublished data), binding of c-Rel to the TSDR most likely does not require DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>Viewed as a whole, the data presented in this study suggest that TSDR enhancer activity and its epigenetic fixation are controlled in a T cell-specific, but NF-κB-independent manner. The biological function of NF-κB binding to the TSDR as well as the identification of signaling pathways that ensure TSDR-mediated stability of <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression remain to be identified.</p>

Genomic DNA was subjected to bisulfite conversion using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research). The murine TSDR was amplified by PCR containing 100 ng of bisulfite-converted genomic DNA, HotStar Taq PCR buffer (Qiagen), 1 U HotStar Taq DNA polymerase, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.38 µM each of TSDR-for (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAGGGGGTTTTAATATTTATGAGG</named-content>) and TSDR-rev (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CCTAAACTTAACCAAATTTTTCTACCA</named-content>) primer in a final volume of 25 µl (Cycle: 95°C for 15 min; 45×95°C for 30 sec, 57°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min; 72°C for 7 min). The PCR product was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The pyrosequencing procedure was performed on a Pyromark Q96 ID (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, including 40 µl of the PCR product, Pyromark Gold Q96 reagents (Qiagen), Pyromark buffers (Qiagen), Streptavidin Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and the sequencing primers TSDR1 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AACCAAATTTTTCTACCATTA</named-content>), TSDR2 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAAACAAATAATCTACCCC</named-content>) or TSDR3 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AATAAACCCAAATAAAATAATATAAAT</named-content>). The methylation rate was determined by the Pyromark Q96 software. A rate was excluded if the quality criteria (Pyromark Q96 standard settings) failed for that CpG motif. The methylation rate was translated into a color code as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088318-Floess1">[9]</xref>.</p>

Normalization of the measured mean grey values per area for the cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins was achieved by using the p44/42 and laminB signals, respectively. The resulting relative values were plotted against the indicated time points after stimulation.</p>

<p><bold>Degradation of IκBα is not required for TSDR enhancer activity during the early phase of stimulation.</bold> Luciferase plasmids integrating either the NF κB RE or TSDR-FoxPro were co-transfected with either an empty vector (EV) or with a vector encoding the super-repressor (SR), a non-degradable form of IκBα, into RLM 11 cells. Cells were harvested 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after stimulation with PMA/iono. Dual luciferase assays were performed and luciferase activities are shown as percent of the 6 hour empty vector control. Standard deviations of performed triplicates are shown. One representative out of three independent experiments is depicted.</p>
