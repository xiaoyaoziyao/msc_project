<abstract>
<p>mTOR is a central integrator of metabolic and immunological stimuli, dictating immune cell activation, proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate that within a clonal population of activated T cells, there exist both mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells exhibiting highly divergent metabolic and immunologic functions. By taking advantage of the role of mTOR activation in controlling cellular size, we demonstrate that upon antigen recognition, mTOR<sup>hi</sup> CD4+ T cells are destined to become highly glycolytic effector cells. Conversely, mTOR<sup>lo</sup> T cells preferentially develop into long-lived cells that express high levels of Bcl-2, CD25, and CD62L. Furthermore, mTOR<sup>lo</sup> T cells have a greater propensity to differentiate into suppressive Foxp3+ T regulatory cells, and this paradigm was also observed in human CD4+ T cells. Overall, these studies provide the opportunity to track the development of effector and memory T cells from naïve precursors, as well as facilitate the interrogation of immunologic and metabolic programs that inform these fates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a central integrator of environment cues and intracellular stress signals, dictating the course of cellular growth, proliferation and differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The mTOR kinase forms two distinct signaling complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, with distinct upstream activators and discrete downstream targets [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. mTORC1, characterized by the scaffolding proteins Raptor and PRAS40 along with mLST8 and Deptor, is canonically activated upon stimulation of PI3-kinase [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This occurs in part through the phosphorylation and inactivation of the mTORC1-inhibitory proteins TSC1/2 [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These events result in the phosphorylation of the canonical mTORC1 substrates S6 kinase and 4EBP1, causing enhanced translation of mRNA transcripts with TOP or TOP-like motifs, increased mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhanced expression of the critical metabolic transcription factors Myc and HIF-1α [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. mTORC1 activity plays a critical role in regulating cell size, particularly in promoting the increase in cell size upon activation [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>In T cells, the kinase activity of mTOR has been shown to be modulated by numerous immunological stimuli including TCR ligation, co-stimulation/co-inhibition, cytokine/chemokine exposure, and adhesion molecule engagement [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Indeed, mTOR has emerged as an important integrator of cues from the immune microenvironment to guide T cell effector and memory differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the case of CD4+ T cells, pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signaling or genetic deletion of the mTOR gene results in a severe defect in the ability of a naïve CD4+ T cell to adopt an effector phenotype following activation [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Instead, CD4+ T cells activated in the absence of mTOR signaling adopt a default Foxp3+ regulatory cell phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast, studies utilizing CD4+ T cells lacking components of either the mTORC1 or mTORC2 complex have revealed that mTORC1 signaling is required for the development of IFN-gamma producing Th1 cells and IL-17 producing Th17 cells, while mTORC2 is required for the development of IL-4 producing Th2 cells [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition to regulating CD4+ T cell effector differentiation, mTOR has been shown to play a central role in regulating the development of long-lived memory CD8+ T cells [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
<p>The data derived from knockout mice and pharmacologic inhibitors suggests that the differential activation of mTOR signaling during an immune response plays an important role in dictating fate decisions for activated T cells. To this end, we sought to identify cells based on their level of mTOR activity and then track their fate. In this study, we demonstrate that cell size can be used as a surrogate indicator of mTOR activity in recently activated T cells, allowing for the isolation of mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> populations with divergent differentiation, metabolic and survival potential. CD4+ mTOR<sup>hi</sup> T cells preferentially develop into short-lived, terminally differentiated effector cells with a robust metabolic phenotype and large proliferative capacity. Alternatively, mTOR<sup>lo</sup> CD4+ T cells are less proliferative, less glycolytic, and demonstrate a long lived phenotype. We also find that enriched within this population of mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells, are suppressive Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, and this finding was recapitulated in human CD4+ T cells.</p>

<title>Cell size indicates mTOR activity in recently activated CD4+ T cells</title>
<p>Following TCR stimulation and appropriate co-stimulation, naïve CD4+ T cells dramatically increase in size after 24 hours (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). The cellular processes that regulate cell size are in part controlled by mTOR activity [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To determine if mTOR regulates the size of activated T cells, we stimulated T cells in the presence of mTOR kinase inhibitor, PP242 [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. TCR-induced blastogenesis is significantly inhibited by the addition PP242 (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). Furthermore, T cell activation induces mTORC1 activity as indicated by phosphorylation of ribosomal-S6 at S235/236 and S6 Kinase at T389 (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). As expected, phosphorylation of these proteins is diminished with addition of PP242. We consistently find that mTORC1 activity is markedly enriched in the T cells that have increased size (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). The increase in size and mTORC1 activity is best observed after 15 hours of stimulation (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.</bold>). Thus, there is a direct correlation of cellular size with mTORC1 activity upon activation of a clonal population of naïve T cells.</p>

<p>To further examine the relationship of mTORC1 activity with cellular size, we examined TCR-induced blastogenesis in Raptor deficient T cells (T-Raptor<sup>–/–</sup>), which have dramatically reduced mTORC1 activity. After 24 hours of stimulation, the vast majority (80%) of the T-Raptor<sup>–/—</sup>T cells remain small in size compared with ~30% of the WT T cells <bold>(<xref rid="pone.0121710.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>)</bold>. Consistent with the role of mTORC1 in regulating T cell size, the largest cells (labeled ‘Big’) detected after stimulation of WT T cells display the highest mTORC1 activity, while the smallest cells (labeled ‘Small’) demonstrate the lowest mTORC1 activity (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). Likewise, WT cells with the highest mTORC1 activity (labeled ‘pS6+’) are the largest in size (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). Examination of cell size at the 45<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> percentiles reveals a graded effect of mTORC1 activity on cell size, whereby regardless of size percentile, mTORC1 activity is consistently highest in the largest cells (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>). The largest difference in mTORC1 activity is most evident in the 10% smallest and largest size percentiles (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>). Thus, we chose to utilize the 10% size cut off in all following experiments to demonstrate the most robust differences between activated cellular populations. This idea was validated by assessing size of WT, T-Raptor<sup>–/–</sup>, and T-TSC2<sup>–/–</sup>(T-TSC2<sup>–/—</sup>T cells have hyperactive mTORC1 activity) OT-II+ splenocytes after stimulation with OVA<sup>323–339</sup> peptide. Again, we observed that over half of the activated T-Raptor<sup>–/—</sup>CD4+ T cells are detected in the gate set from the 10% smallest activated WT cells, while less than 3% of T-TSC2<sup>–/—</sup>are detected in the same gating strategy (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>). Based on these results, we propose that cell size can be used as a surrogate indicator of mTORC1 activity in recently stimulated T cells, allowing for easy identification and tracking of both mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells from an initially monoclonal culture of naïve T cells.</p>
<p>We propose that for an individual cell, antigen recognition (Signal 1) will occur in the context of differential mTORC1 activation depending upon accessory signals (Signal 2) from the environment. However, it was critical to demonstrate that the differential activation of mTORC1 was not simply due to lack of antigen recognition. That is, we wanted to ensure that even the cells with decreased mTOR activity still received full antigen receptor engagement.</p>
<p>To this end, WT, T-Raptor<sup>–/—</sup>and T-TSC2<sup>–/—</sup>OT-II<sup>+</sup> splenocytes were stimulated with OVA<sup>323–339</sup> peptide for 24 hours. As expected, this led to differential activation of mTORC1, whereby T-TSC2<sup>–/—</sup>T cells have increased activity while T-Raptor<sup>–/—</sup>T cells have diminished activity compared to WT cells (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). Notably, there was robust and roughly equivalent upregulation of CD69 and downregulation of CD62L in T cells from all 3 genotypes (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). That is, diminished or enhanced mTORC1 activity did not affect antigen-induced activation. Next, we wanted to demonstrate that such was also the case for the small (mTOR<sup>lo</sup>) and big (mTOR<sup>hi</sup>) populations of WT cells. Splenocytes from 5c.c7 Rag<sup>–/—</sup>TCR transgenic mice were stimulated with Pigeon Cytochrome C (PCC) peptide. Upon stimulation, there is robust activation as indicated by CD69 upregulation (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Starting from this clonotypic population of naïve T cells, we observe that there emerges a heterogeneous population of antigen experienced cells that differ dramatically in size. Importantly, this difference in cell size was not due to a lack of activation as both large and small cells express high levels of the early T cell activation marker CD69, and demonstrate robust downregulation of CD62L relative to naïve T cells (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). We did note, however, that the levels of CD69 and CD62L were slightly decreased in the T-Raptor<sup>–/—</sup>and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells when compared to WT and mTOR<sup>hi</sup> T cells (<xref rid="pone.0121710.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and 2C</xref>). The significance of this finding is unclear.</p>

<title>mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> CD4+ T cells display differential proliferative, metabolic and survival fates</title>
<p>In light of the relationship we observed between cell size and mTOR activity in recently activated CD4+ T cells, we sought to track the fate of T cells with differing levels of mTOR activity, as indicated by cell size, following antigen recognition. To this end, naïve 5c.c7 TCR transgenic Rag<sup>–/—</sup>splenocytes were stimulated with PCC peptide for 24 hours. To ensure that only stimulated CD4+ T cell were included in future analysis, cells were stained for CD4 and the mTOR independent early activation marker CD69, then sorted into CD4+CD69+ FSC/SSC “big” mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and CD4+CD69+ FSC/SSC “small” mTOR<sup>lo</sup> populations (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). To further confirm the relationship of mTORC1 activity with cell size, sorted cells were immediately assessed for mTORC1 activity. As expected, the largest population (labeled ‘Big’) cells demonstrate the highest phosphorylated S6 (pS6) expression (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). At the time of sorting, the process of cellular division had not yet been initiated, with ~90% of both the mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> populations still in G<sub>0</sub> stage of the cell cycle as indicated by propidium iodide staining (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>.</bold>). After the sort, cells were cultured in media supplemented with 1ng/ml IL-2. Sorted mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells rapidly form large homotypic aggregates in culture after 4 hours post sorting, which did not occur in sorted mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cultures (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). Twenty four hours after culture, sorted mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells were treated with tritiated (<sup>3</sup>H-) thymidine to monitor proliferation and cultured for an additional 16 hours. Sorted mTOR<sup>hi</sup> CD4+ T cells exhibit a much higher rate of proliferation than sorted mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells, as indicated by <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine uptake (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>).

<p>mTOR plays an important role in the regulation of cellular metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As such, we next assessed the metabolic profile of the cells. Sorted mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells are highly metabolically active, exhibiting a significantly higher Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR)—an indirect indicator of glycolysis—than their mTOR<sup>lo</sup> counterparts (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>)</bold>. In addition, the mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells initially demonstrate a higher Oxygen Consumption rate (OCR) compared to mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref></bold>). This higher rate of metabolic activity observed in the sorted mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells is accompanied by an increase in mitochondria content (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref></bold>). The higher ECAR observed in sorted mTOR<sup>hi</sup> CD4+ T cells is consistent with the role of mTOR in promoting glycolysis [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Further, the decreased ECAR observed in the small, mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells phenocopies the metabolic profile of rapamycin treated CD4+ T cells (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>.</bold>). Thus, within a clonal population of T cells stimulated with their cognate antigen, those cells with high levels of mTORC1 activity demonstrate increased proliferation and metabolic activity when compared to those cells with relatively low mTORC1 activity.</p>
<p>We have shown that sorted mTOR<sup>lo</sup> CD4+ T cells exhibit a markedly decreased glycolytic metabolic profile than sorted mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells. However, sorted mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells possess increased Spare Respiratory Capacity (SRC) when compared to mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells from the same culture (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref></bold>). A similar finding was also observed for CD4+ T cell stimulated in the presence of rapamycin (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>.</bold>). SRC is calculated as the differential between a cell’s basal rate of oxygen consumption and the maximal rate of oxygen consumption. SRC is a metric indicating how close a cell is currently functioning to its maximal metabolic potential. Rapidly proliferating cells, such as terminally differentiated effector T cells and tumor cells, display a very low SRC [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Conversely, long-lived cells, such as stem cells and memory T cells have been shown to have a large SRC [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This correlation between longevity and SRC is thought to be due to the need for long-lived cells to survive periods of metabolic stress, which would prove fatal to more terminally differentiated cell types. In light of the previously described association between SRC and longevity, we assayed the <italic>in vitro</italic> survival of sorted mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> CD4+ T cells. From a clonal population of activated T cells, the mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells undergo increased apoptosis compared to sorted mTOR<sup>lo</sup> counterparts when cultured in media supplemented with IL-2 for 5 days after sorting (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref></bold>). The increased survival observed in the mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells was accompanied by significantly higher expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 at both a transcriptional (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref></bold>) and protein <bold>(<xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref></bold>) level.</p>

<sec id="sec017">
<title>mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells express increased levels of CD25</title>
<p>While mTORC1 activity is reduced in the sorted small cells compared to big cell counterparts, Bcl-2 levels are highest in small, mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells. Many factors have been shown to control Bcl-2 expression in CD4+ T cells, including cytokine receptor signaling [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To this end, we tested for expression of the high affinity IL-2 receptor CD25 in our sorted populations. Interestingly, CD25 expression at the transcript and protein level was higher on the mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells (<xref rid="pone.0121710.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A and 4B</xref>). To determine if this phenotype was graded across a spectrum of cell size, we analyzed CD69+ T cells from 4 distinctly sized populations: the 10% smallest (Q1: mTOR<sup>lo</sup>), 10% largest (Q4: mTOR<sup>hi</sup>) populations as previously assessed, in addition to the next 25% smallest (Q2) or largest (Q3) groups of cells (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). These studies revealed that CD25 protein and transcript levels, CD62L protein expression, and Bcl-2 transcript levels are inversely related to cell size and hence mTORC1 activity (<xref rid="pone.0121710.g004" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4D and 4E</xref> <bold>and</bold> <xref rid="pone.0121710.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A</xref>). Thus, from a metabolic and survival perspective, antigen recognition in the setting of strong mTORC1 activation generates cells with increased glycolytic flux that are destined to be short-lived. Alternatively, antigen recognition in the context of decreased mTORC1 activation leads to the generation of long-lived cells with increased SRC, increased Bcl-2 and increased CD25 (IL-2Ra) expression.</p>

<title>Short-lived, metabolically active, mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells demonstrate an effector phenotype</title>

<p>Upon antigen recognition, mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells demonstrate metabolic programs consistent with long-lived cells. However, we have previously demonstrated that TCR engagement in the absence of mTOR induces the generation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, others have shown that T cell activation in the presence of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin promotes the generation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, we wondered if a sub-population of the mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells might be Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the mTOR<sup>lo</sup> population was enriched for Foxp3+ T cells (<xref rid="pone.0121710.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C and 5D</xref>). That is, under normally activating culture conditions (antigen activation followed by IL-2 addition), 9.4% of the mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells express Foxp3, while only 0.16% of the mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells expressed Foxp3 (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). This difference was also observed and was amplified when TGF-ß was added to the cultures (22.8% versus 4.3%). Foxp3 expression is upregulated in every division of activated mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells after culture in IL-2, and a graded decrease in Foxp3 expression is observed in each population of increased cell size/mTORC1 activity (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>.</bold>). The preferential induction of Foxp3 expression in sorted mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells is not limited to cultures derived from homogeneous Rag<sup>–/—</sup>TCR transgenic splenocytes, but can also be observed in cultures generated from anti-CD3 stimulated polyclonal WT CD4+ T cells (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>.)</bold>. Not unexpectedly, the mTOR<sup>lo</sup> CD4+ T cells cultured in IL-2 alone were better able to suppress the proliferation of activated CD4+ T cells compared to their cultured mTOR<sup>hi</sup> counterparts (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>). This enhanced suppression was most likely due to the increase of Foxp3+ T cells generated from the mTOR<sup>lo</sup> sorted population compared to the mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>.</bold>). The ability of the mTOR<sup>lo</sup> T cells to suppress responder T cells was markedly diminished when the responders and suppressors were separated in a transwell, indicating that the suppression is primarily contact dependent (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>A question remained if Foxp3+ T cells were generated <italic>de novo</italic> from the activated mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells, or if the enhanced generation of Foxp3+ T cells observed in the sorted mTOR<sup>lo</sup> populations was simply a consequence of sorting on a high frequency of already established natural Tregs. In order to answer this question, we utilized mice which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the Foxp3 promoter (Foxp3<sup>GFP+</sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Splenocytes from WT Foxp3<sup>GFP+</sup> mice were stimulated with 0.1ug/ml anti-CD3 for 20 hrs. Activated (CD69+) CD4+ GFP—cells were sorted from the 10% biggest ‘mTOR<sup>hi</sup>’ and smallest ‘mTOR<sup>lo</sup>’ populations (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>.</bold>). This approach ensured that all GFP+ natural Tregs would be removed from our sorted populations. Phenotypic assessment of sorted mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> populations 72 hrs after culture in IL-2 revealed that suppressive Foxp3+ T cells were generated <italic>de novo</italic> from the <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulated splenocytes (<xref rid="pone.0121710.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B–C Fig</xref><bold>.</bold>). These observations were consistent with our previous results demonstrating that mTOR<sup>lo</sup> CD4+ T cells have a greater propensity to differentiate into Foxp3+ T cells (<xref rid="pone.0121710.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C–5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data thus far suggests that under normally activating conditions, the recognition of antigen in the context of low mTOR activation promotes the <italic>de novo</italic> generation of regulatory T cells. Nonetheless, we could still detect a small percentage of Foxp3+ T cells which displayed high mTOR activity. Therefore, we sought to further phenotype the Foxp3+ T cells generated from the sorted mTOR<sup>lo</sup> and mTOR<sup>hi</sup> populations. First, Foxp3+ T cells derived from either mTOR<sup>lo</sup> and mTOR<sup>hi</sup> populations have higher expression of the known T-regulatory cell markers, CD25, CTLA-4, and GITR when compared to Foxp3 negative counterparts (<xref rid="pone.0121710.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A and 6B</xref>).

<title>Divergent phenotypic properties of mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> Foxp3+ regulatory T cells</title>
<p>Our data are consistent with previous findings that diminished mTOR activity in T cells promotes the generation of regulatory T cells [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, we also find a small, but distinct population of Foxp3+ T cells generated from mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells. Interestingly, one of the most common techniques to generate regulatory T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> is to induce robust activation in the presence of high concentrations of TGF-ß [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In fact, stimulation under these conditions results in robust mTOR activation (<bold>Figs.</bold> <xref rid="pone.0121710.g007" ref-type="fig">7A</xref> <bold>and</bold> <xref rid="pone.0121710.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>). That is, while strong TCR engagement in the presence of TGF-ß promotes the generation of Foxp3+ T cells, it also results in robust mTORC1 activation. Given the highly divergent metabolic profiles and survival potentials of sorted mTOR<sup>lo</sup> and mTOR<sup>hi</sup> conventional CD4+ T cells, we wanted to determine if Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells generated in the presence of high or low mTOR activity during TCR stimulation demonstrate similar metabolic and survival potentials. To this end, WT splenocytes were stimulated with 1ug/ml anti-CD3 and 1ng/ml IL-2 in the presence or absence of either 10ng/ml TGF-ß or 500nM rapamycin. Anti-CD3 was washed out at 24 hrs, and the cultures were expanded in media supplemented with IL-2 alone, IL-2 + TGF-ß, or IL-2 + rapamycin for 72 hrs before harvest for flow-cytometric analysis. As expected, the Foxp3+ T cells from the rapamycin treated cultures had reduced mTORC1 activity (mTOR<sup>lo</sup>) compared to the Foxp3+ T cells generated in the presence of TGF-ß (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>). As was the case for the mTOR<sup>hi</sup> CD4+ sorted T cell populations, CD4+ T cells cultured with TGF-ß demonstrate enhanced ECAR compared to the cells activated in the rapamycin treated conditions (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>), but reduced expression of Bcl-2 (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref></bold>). These data suggest that culture in TGF-ß promotes an ‘effector’ phenotype with increased glycolysis but diminished survival. Activation of T cells in the presence of rapamycin or TGF-ß enhanced Foxp3+ T reg generation compared to untreated, activated cells (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref></bold>), and we further assessed the phenotype of Foxp3+ cells generated from these culture conditions (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref></bold>). Notably, phenotypic analysis of the Foxp3+ cells generated from the rapamycin versus TGF-ß culture conditions recapitulated the results observed from the sorted mTOR<sup>lo</sup> and mTOR<sup>hi</sup> Foxp3+ populations. Foxp3+ T cells generated in the presence of rapamycin have enhanced expression of CD25, GITR, CD71, and Bcl-2 compared to Foxp3+ T cells derived from TGF-ß cultures (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref></bold>). Alternatively, Foxp3+ cells generated in the presence of TGF-ß have enhanced CTLA4 and CD39 expression compared to those generated in rapamycin (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref></bold>). These data suggest that regulatory T cells generated in the presence of robust mTOR activity (by culture in high concentrations of TGF-ß) have differential survival potential and are metabolically distinct from those generated in the setting of low mTOR activity.</p>

<title>Differential fates of mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> human CD4+ T cells</title>
<p>Next, we wanted to determine if we could use cell size/mTOR activity to track the fate of TCR-activated human T cells.

Similar to our observations employing murine T cells, mTORC1 activation correlates with cellular size in activated human CD4+ T cells (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have observed that within a clonal population of newly activated T cells there exists significant heterogeneity of mTORC1 activity. This heterogeneity leads to cells with differential metabolic programs, survival potential and ultimately phenotypic fate. Our data demonstrate that cell size can be utilized as a surrogate indicator of mTOR activity in recently stimulated CD4+ T cells. This observation provides a simple tool allowing for the isolation of T cell populations with distinct metabolic, proliferative, immunologic and survival potential from a heterogeneous population of activated cells.</p>
<p>We demonstrate a direct correlation between the level of mTOR activity upon antigen recognition by CD4+ T cells and the regulation of metabolism and survival. In part, this appears to be mediated by differential expression of anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family facilitated by expression of pro-survival cytokine receptor CD25. While mTOR activity is strongly induced by many pro-survival growth factors such as IL-2 [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], long term cellular survival necessitates the adoption of a quiescent metabolic and proliferative phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For example, T cells lacking the ability to enter a state of quiescence due to genetic deletion of the mTOR inhibitor TSC1 are incapable of long term survival <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A unique metabolic feature of long-lived stem cells and memory T cells is the presence of an increased SRC [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Indeed, our data demonstrate that the mTOR<sup>lo</sup> T cells possess both a greater SRC (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref></bold>), and survival potential than mTOR<sup>hi</sup> T cells (<xref rid="pone.0121710.g003" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3I–3K</xref>). In this context, it is interesting to note that decreased mTOR activity has not only been associated with increased cellular survival but also with increased longevity at the level of the whole organism [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
<p>We postulate that there are many factors that contribute to the heterogeneous activation of mTORC1 upon antigen recognition. For example, TCR signal strength has been shown to be important for the polarization of effector lineages in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While TCR avidity was the same in our clonal population of 5c.c7 T cells, the observed modulation in mTORC1 signaling may be due to competition for peptide on the APCs, the relative activation status of a particular APC, the relative upregulation and encounter with inhibitory ligands and even the local exposure to various activating and inhibitory cytokines. Indeed, mTOR is activated by and thus integrates multiple inputs from the immune microenvironment, which in turn influence the fate of an individual cell’s encounter with antigen [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated the differences in metabolic function between effector and memory CD8+ T cells [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. That is, effector CD8+ T cells are shown to be highly glycolytic while memory CD8+ T cells are less glycolytic and demonstrate increased SRC. Likewise, several studies have demonstrated the ability of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to promote the generation of CD8+ memory T cells [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our current studies employing CD4+ T cells are supported by these previous observations. Our ability to track cells based on the level of mTOR activation has enabled us to link mTOR activity with the metabolic and survival programs necessary to support effector versus memory cells. Thus, we speculate that this system could also distinguish distinct CD8+ T cell populations.</p>
<p>The pharmacologic inhibition or the genetic deletion of mTOR leads to the generation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells under otherwise normally activating conditions [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Consistent with these reports, we observed that under activating conditions, Foxp3+ T cells were enriched within the population of mTOR<sup>lo</sup> CD4 cells. Furthermore, these data are consistent with previous works demonstrating that low doses of peptide can promote Foxp3+ T regulatory cell generation even in the absence of exogenous TGF-ß [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Indeed, we have observed that peptide concentrations that promote T regulatory cell generation fail to induce robust mTOR activation (data not shown). Alternatively, a common technique for generating Foxp3+ regulatory T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> is to robustly stimulate T cells with either high doses of peptide or anti-CD3 in the presence of exogenous TGF-ß [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Under such conditions we observe high mTOR activity (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g007" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0121710.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref></bold>). T cells generated in TGF-ß culture conditions have differential metabolic and survival potentials than T cells generated in the presence of rapamycin (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>). Furthermore, Foxp3+ T cells generated from rapamycin versus TGF-ß cultures have distinct phenotypes (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref></bold>). These data lead us to propose that Foxp3+ regulatory T cell fate/ function may be determined by level of mTOR activity. We suggest that Foxp3+ mTOR<sup>hi</sup> cells resemble short-lived “effector regulatory” T cells characterized by increased glycolysis, increased CTLA-4 and CD39 expression, and decreased Bcl-2. Alternatively, we propose that mTOR<sup>lo</sup> Foxp3+ cells behave more like long-lived “memory regulatory” cells characterized by decreased glycolytic flux, but enhanced CD25, GITR and Bcl-2 expression. Such a model is consistent with recently published reports describing effector and central regulatory T cell populations [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, this distinction might help reconcile seemingly conflicting reports in the literature regarding the necessity of mTOR inhibition versus mTOR activation in T regulatory cell [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Interestingly, the ability to distinguish subsets of regulatory T cells based on size/mTOR activity was recapitulated in human cells CD4+ T cells as well (<bold><xref rid="pone.0121710.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Overall, our ability to track the fate of mTOR<sup>hi</sup> and mTOR<sup>lo</sup> cells following the activation of naïve T cells reveals a new mTOR/metabolism-centric model of T cell activation [<xref rid="pone.0121710.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this model, within a clonal population of T cells, the level of mTOR activation, in part through the upregulation of selective metabolic programs, helps to determine the effector versus memory fate of T cells upon antigen recognition. We believe that this new perspective helps to better define the fate and function of memory CD4+ T cells. Likewise, our model posits the existence of distinct subsets of regulatory T cells.</p>
