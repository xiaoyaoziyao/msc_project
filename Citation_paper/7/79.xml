          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that transplantation of adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) can improve cardiac function in animal models of myocardial infarction (MI). However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect are not fully understood. In this study, we characterized the paracrine effect of transplanted ADSC and investigated its relative importance versus direct differentiation in ADSC transplantation mediated cardiac repair.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>MI was experimentally induced in mice by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Either human ADSC, conditioned medium (CM) collected from the same amount of ADSC or control medium was injected into the peri-infarct region immediately after MI. Compared with the control group, both ADSC and ADSC-CM significantly reduced myocardial infarct size and improved cardiac function. The therapeutic efficacy of ADSC was moderately superior to ADSC-CM. ADSC-CM significantly reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the infarct border zone, to a similar degree with ADSC treatment. ADSC enhanced angiogenesis in the infarct border zone, but to a stronger degree than that seen in the ADSC-CM treatment. ADSC was able to differentiate to endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell in post-MI heart; these ADSC-derived vascular cells amount to about 9% of the enhanced angiogenesis. No cardiomyocyte differentiated from ADSC was found.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>ADSC-CM is sufficient to improve cardiac function of infarcted hearts. The therapeutic function of ADSC transplantation is mainly induced by paracrine-mediated cardioprotection and angiogenesis, while ADSC differentiation contributes a minor benefit by being involved in angiogenesis.</p>
          <p><italic>Highlights</italic> 1 ADSC-CM is sufficient to exert a therapeutic potential. 2. ADSC was able to differentiate to vascular cells but not cardiomyocyte. 3. ADSC derived vascular cells amount to about 9% of the enhanced angiogenesis. 4. Paracrine effect is the major mechanism of ADSC therapeutic function for MI.</p>

        <bold>Introduction</bold>
      </title>
      <p>Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of human death worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Tongers1">[1]</xref>. Acute and chronic loss of cardiomyocytes of the heart is a main contributor for the poor cardiac function that culminates in heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Christoffels1">[2]</xref>. But the adult myocardium has very limited potential of self-regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Bergmann1">[3]</xref>. Therefore, myocardium protection and regeneration are considered as important means of heart disease treatment. Stem cell transplantation has become a new strategy for the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Segers1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seem to be highly advantageous for cellular therapy since they are safe, multipotent, and immune-privileged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Williams1">[5]</xref>. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC) emerged as a preferable cell source to treat MI, due to its advantages over other MSC types: easy accessibility, minimal morbidity upon harvest, clinically relevant abundance without expansion, stronger proliferative capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Valina1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Wang1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Growing evidence indicates that ADSC transplantation improves cardiac function of post-MI heart via direct differentiation and paracrine effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Bai1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Madonna1">[9]</xref>. Ideally, new myocardium can be build by direct differentiation of ADSC into cardiac cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Li1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-PlanatBenard1">[11]</xref>, and ADSC paracrine factors can induce cytoprotection and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Gnecchi1">[12]</xref>. However, 1) the evidence to support the therapeutic role of paracrine mechanism in animal model of MI is lacking; 2) The capacity of ADSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes and vascular cells in infarcted hearts has been controversial; 3) The relative contribution of paracrine effect versus direct differentiation in the ADSC mediated beneficial effect is unclear.</p>
      <p>Our study was designed to evaluate the capacity of ADSC conditioned medium in the prevention of heart failure, and compare its therapeutic effect with ADSC transplantation in the MI mice. We also defined the differentiation capacity of ADSC towards cardiac and vascular lineages, and further assessed the relative contribution of paracrine effect versus direct differentiation in ADSC induced cardioprotection.</p>

        <title>1. Human adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) culture and lentiviral transfection of green fluorescent protein (GFP)</title>
        <p>Human ADSCs were isolated by using a modified protocol, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Bai1">[8]</xref>. Human abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from 11 healthy adults (20–30 year-old, female) during liposuction. The tissue was obtained per a tissue acquisition protocol approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Third Military Medical University (Permit Number: 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-vanPoll1">[13]</xref>). All the tissue donors involved have provided written informed consent, and the consent procedure was developed and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee. Adipose tissue was minced and incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C on a shaker with 0.1% collagenase I (Worthington) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 2 mM calcium chloride. The digested tissue was sequentially filtered through 100 µm and 40 µm filters (BD) and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant containing adipocytes and debris was discarded.</p>
        <p>ADSCs were re-suspended in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM)/F12 (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and then cultured at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. ADSCs of passage 3 were used for experiments.</p>
        <p>To track the ADSCs after transplantation in heart tissue, ADSCs were genetically labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Lentiviral vector encoding GFP gene (purchased from Genechem Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was used with an MOI of 10∶1. An infection cocktail containing lentiviral supernatant, 5 mg/mL polybrene, and 10% FBS in DMEM/F12 with 2.5×10<sup>5</sup> target ADSCs were cultured in 60 mm dishes for 24 hours. To enrich the genetically modified ADSCs, the GFP+ ADSCs were sorted with FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) after the lentiviral transfection. The purified GFP<sup>+</sup> ADSCs (&gt;99% purity) were then expanded in culture for use.</p>

      <sec id="s2b">
        <title>2. Flow cytometry</title>
        <p>To analyze the cell surface phenotype, ADSCs at passage 3 were fixed for 10 minutes in 1% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and stained with primary antibodies at room temperature for 30 minutes. The primary antibodies include anti-human CD34-PE, CD90-FITC, CD73-PE, CD44-FITC, CD105-PE and CD45-FITC. Isotype-matched mouse IgGs were used as controls. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD FACSCalibur). Data analysis was performed with Flowjo software.</p>

        <p>The multi-lineage differentiation potential of ADSCs before and after lentiviral-GFP transfection was investigated as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Bai1">[8]</xref>. Briefly, lipogenic differentiation was assessed by incubating ADSCs for 3 weeks in adipogenic medium containing low-glucose DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 µM L-ascorbate acid, 1 µM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 100 µM indomethacin, and 10 µg/ml human recombinant insulin. Cells from the control group were cultured in low-glucose DMEM plus 10% FBS (control medium). Adipogenesis was assessed by incubating cells with Oil Red O solution to stain neutral lipids in the cytoplasm. Osteogenic differentiation was performed by incubating ADSCs for 3 weeks in osteogenic medium containing high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1 µM dexamethasone, 200 µM L-ascorbic acid, and 10 mM β-glycerol phosphate. Cells in the control group were cultured in high-glucose DMEM plus 10% FBS. To assess mineralization, calcium deposits in cultures were stained with Alizarin Red S and then observed under a phase-contrast microscope. All the media were changed every 3 days. All the materials and reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich unless indicated otherwise.</p>

By calculation, about 3.4±0.7% of the total capillaries were found to be of human ADSC origin. Because of an overall 64.3% increase of capillary density in ADSC treated mice compared to control MI mice treated with DMEM, ADSC differentiation amounted to about 9% of the enhanced angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059020-g006"><bold>Figure 6D</bold></xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we demonstrated that ADSC-CM treatment is sufficient to improve cardiac function post-MI mice, through reducing cardiomyoycte apoptosis and enhancing angiogenesis. ADSC transplantation exerts a moderately superior therapeutic potential to ADSC-CM injection. Transplanted ADSC is able to differentiate into endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, which contributes to about 9% of the ADSC mediated angiogenesis. Thus, ADSC induced beneficial effect is predominantly mediated by paracrine mechanism, of which direct differentiation plays a minor role.</p>
      <p>As a suitable cell type for treating heart disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Rehman1">[25]</xref>, ADSC transplantation improves cardiac function in the post-MI hearts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Bai1">[8]</xref>. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of ADSCs on cardiac injury are not fully understood, although it is known that its two major actions include direct differentiation and paracrine effect.</p>
      <p>Recent studies showed that conditioned medium (CM) of human ADSCs exerts therapeutic effects on murine ischemic stroke models, mainly by increasing endothelial cell proliferation and reducing neural cell apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Cho1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Egashira1">[27]</xref>. However, whether CM of human ADSCs is sufficient to treat MI injury in animal models is unknown. We, for the first time, demonstrated that intramyocardial injection of ADSC-CM is able to reduce infarct size and improve cardiac function in infarcted mice. We further demonstrated that ADSC-CM promotes cardiomyocyte survival and angiogenesis <italic>in vivo,</italic> which echoes a previous <italic>in vitro</italic> finding that ADSC-CM promotes endothelial cell survival and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Deveza1">[23]</xref>. Our data thus provide direct evidence for the therapeutic potential of ADSC paracrine action in animal MI models.</p>
      <p>The differentiation potential of transplanted ADSCs in the ischemic heart by transforming into the cardiac lineages has been controversial. Some reports show that ADSC possesses a capacity to transdifferentiate to cardiomyocyte, endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell after transplantation into the heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Wang1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-BayesGenis1">[28]</xref>. Other reports show an opposite finding of no specific differentiation of human ADSC to those cell lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Mazo1">[29]</xref>. In the present study, we demonstrated that some surviving ADSCs differentiated into endothelial and smooth muscle cells after transplantation. These ADSC-differentiated vascular cells contributed to angiogenesis and were incorporated in the heart vasculature, which confirmed the plasticity of ADSCs toward endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-PlanatBenard2">[30]</xref> and ADSCs induced angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Valina1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Miranville1">[31]</xref>. On the other hand, no newly-formed cardiomyocyte derived from ADSC was found in our experiments, which disagrees with a recent <italic>in vivo</italic> study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Yang1">[32]</xref> but is in agreement with the finding that ADSC do not undergo cardiomyogenesis in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system co-cultured with NRVMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Ramkisoensing1">[33]</xref>. We only used markers tropomyosin and α-actinin for identifying new cardiomyocytes, which is a limitation of the present study and might account for the discrepancy between our finding and some previous studies.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the relative roles of direct differentiation versus paracrine mechanism in the use of ADSC treatment for cardiac repair are inconclusive. We carefully compared the therapeutic effect of ADSCs and CM collected from the same amount of ADSCs. As a result, ADSC transplantation induced a moderately stronger beneficial effect on infarct size and cardiac function than ADSC-CM injection. This might be ascribed to the stronger angiogenesis in ADSC treated infarcted hearts than ADSC-CM treated ones, giving the fact that both treatments exerted a similar anti-apoptotic effect on cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, ADSC direct differentiation into vascular cells, although significant, explains only 9% of the enhanced angiogenesis as compared to control, and about 20% of the surplus angiogenesis as compared to ADSC-CM. The discrepancy of proangiogenic effects between the two groups may be due to the fact that surviving ADSCs continue to secrete cytokines after transplantation but a single induction of ADSC-CM injection exerts only a transient effect. Besides, transplanted ADSCs are subjected to hypoxic stress, which increases the production of several of the stem cell paracine factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Gnecchi1">[12]</xref>. A previous study reported that direct differentiation contributes 20–50% of the beneficial effect of cardiac stem cell transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Chimenti1">[34]</xref>. Our ratios are even lower than those of cardiac stem cells, which may be due to the different properties of the different stem cell types especially the stronger cardiomyogenic capacity of cardiac stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Li1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present experiment, each animal in ADSC-CM group was administrated with single injection of 50 µL concentrated ASDC-CM collected from 1×10<sup>5</sup> ADSCs (20-fold concentrated), as the same injection volume and frequency of the ADSC transplantation. It is speculated that the beneficial effects of ADSC-CM can be optimized by using a higher concentration (100-fold for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Egashira1">[27]</xref>) and (or) increasing the injection frequency. Low survival rate, low differentiation efficacy and potential tumorigenicity of implanted cells could undermine the efficacy of the stem cell-based treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Tongers1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Chacko1">[35]</xref>. The strategy of using CM of stem cells may be a feasible approach to overcome these limitations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Cho1">[26]</xref>, thus it is promising to translate stem cell-secreted paracrine products into better therapeutic strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Ratajczak1">[36]</xref>. The paracrine products include cytokines/growth factors and recently reported microvesicles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Ratajczak1">[36]</xref>. Various cytokines/growth factors, such as VEGF, HGF, IGF-1, sfrp2, can regulate cell apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, and mobilization of endogenous cardiac stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Deuse1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Mirotsou1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Tang1">[39]</xref>. Biologically active microvesicles, which carry RNA or microRNA, may inhibit cell apoptosis and target organs for repair purposes in various experimental models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Ratajczak1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059020-Biancone1">[40]</xref>.It is important to identify the specific factors involved in the ADSC-CM mediated cardiaoprotective effect. To use those identified critical factors among stem cell secretory products might be a meaningful treatment strategy for clinical applications.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the enhanced reconstruction in micro-vasculatures brought by transplanted ADSCs could be the alternatives of how cell therapy has a great promise to treat patients, despite the cell engraftment after transplantation was limited in long-term observation.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, ADSC transplantation increases myocardial viability, enhances angiogenesis, ameliorates infarct size and improves cardiac function in MI mice. This therapeutic effect is predominantly mediated by a paracrine mechanism, while direct differentiation plays a minor role by contributing to angiogenesis.</p>
