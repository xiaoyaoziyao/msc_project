<abstract>
<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates its DNA genome through reverse transcription of a viral RNA pregenome. We report herein that the interferon (IFN) stimulated exoribonuclease gene of 20 KD (ISG20) inhibits HBV replication through degradation of HBV RNA. ISG20 expression was observed at basal level and was highly upregulated upon IFN treatment in hepatocytes, and knock down of ISG20 resulted in elevation of HBV replication and attenuation of IFN-mediated antiviral effect. The sequence element conferring the susceptibility of HBV RNA to ISG20-mediated RNA degradation was mapped at the HBV RNA terminal redundant region containing epsilon (ε) stem-loop. Furthermore, ISG20-induced HBV RNA degradation relies on its ribonuclease activity, as the enzymatic inactive form ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> was unable to promote HBV RNA decay. Interestingly, ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> retained antiviral activity against HBV DNA replication by preventing pgRNA encapsidation, resulting from a consequence of ISG20-ε interaction. This interaction was further characterized by <italic>in vitro</italic> electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ISG20 was able to bind HBV ε directly in absence of any other cellular proteins, indicating a direct ε RNA binding capability of ISG20; however, cofactor(s) may be required for ISG20 to efficiently degrade ε. In addition, the lower stem portion of ε is the major ISG20 binding site, and the removal of 4 base pairs from the bottom portion of ε abrogated the sensitivity of HBV RNA to ISG20, suggesting that the specificity of ISG20-ε interaction relies on both RNA structure and sequence. Furthermore, the C-terminal Exonuclease III (ExoIII) domain of ISG20 was determined to be responsible for interacting with ε, as the deletion of ExoIII abolished <italic>in vitro</italic> ISG20-ε binding and intracellular HBV RNA degradation. Taken together, our study sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of IFN-mediated HBV inhibition and the antiviral mechanism of ISG20 in general.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>HBV is a DNA virus but replicates its DNA <italic>via</italic> retrotranscription of a viral RNA pregenome. ISG20, an antiviral RNase induced by interferons, inhibits the replication of many RNA viruses but the underlying molecular antiviral mechanism remains elusive. Since all the known viruses, except for prions, have RNA products in their life cycles, ISG20 can be a broad spectrum antiviral protein; but in order to distinguish viral RNA from host RNA, ISG20 may have evolved to recognize virus-specific signals as its antiviral target. We demonstrated herein that ISG20 selectively binds to a unique stem-loop structure called epsilon (ε) in all HBV RNA species and degrades viral RNA to inhibit HBV replication. Because ε is the HBV pregenomic RNA packaging signal and reverse transcription priming site, the binding of ISG20 to ε, even in the absence of ribonuclease activity, results in antiviral effect to prevent DNA replication due to preventing viral polymerase binding to pgRNA. We also determined the structure and sequence requirements of ε RNA and ISG20 protein for ISG20-ε binding and antiviral activity. Such information will aid the function study of ISG20 against viral pathogens in host innate defense, and ISG20 has potentials to be developed into a therapeutic agent for viral diseases including hepatitis B.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a significant health threat to humans, leading to the elevated rate of severe liver diseases, such as fulminant hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, primary hepatocellular carcinoma, and other clinical complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>HBV is the prototype member of <italic>hepadnaviridae</italic> family which contains a number of DNA viruses replicating their genome through reverse transcription of a viral RNA intermediate in hepatocytes. After cell infection mediated by the viral receptor, called sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref002">2</xref>], the 3.2kb relaxed circular (rc) viral DNA genome in the virion enters the nucleus and transforms into a nucleosome-decorated covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA minichromosome. Using cccDNA as transcription template, five viral mRNAs are transcribed from different transcription initiation sites but all terminated at a same polyadenylation site, which are, 3.5~3.6 kb precore mRNA, 3.5 kb pregenomic (pg) RNA, 2.4 and 2.1 kb surface (envelope) mRNA, and 0.7kb X mRNA. Besides serving as the template for translation of viral core protein and polymerase (pol), the pgRNA is also the template for reverse transcription. The pol recognizes a stem loop structure (epsilon, ε) at the 5’ terminus of pgRNA to recruit core proteins to encapsidate pol/pgRNA complex into nucleocapsid, where the reverse transcription takes place to yield progeny viral rcDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref003">3</xref>]. Considering the importance of viral RNA in HBV life cycle, it is conceivable that HBV RNA reduction will result in a suppression of both viral DNA replication and antigen production. Therefore, hijacking HBV RNA is believed to be an important antiviral strategy for host defense against HBV. In line with this, interferons are able to directly reduce HBV RNA through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref007">7</xref>]. In terms of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), the tripartite motif-containing protein 22 (TRIM22) and DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3 have been shown to inhibit HBV RNA transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref009">9</xref>], and the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) have been identified as host intrinsic antiviral factors against HBV through promoting the decay of HBV RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In search of ISGs that inhibit HBV replication, we have previously found that the 20 KDa interferon-stimulated gene product, referred to as ISG20, inhibited HBV replication primarily through reducing HBV RNA transcript levels in cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref004">4</xref>]. This protein, which has been shown to be induced by both type I and type II IFNs, belongs to DEDDh subgroup of the DEDD exonuclease superfamily. Sequence homologies are distributed at three distinct motifs termed as ExoI (a.a7-16), ExoII (a.a 86–101) and ExoIII (a.a 147–157) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref012">12</xref>]. ISG20 is a 3’ to 5’ exonuclease with the substrate preference of single-stranded RNA over double-stranded RNA or single-stranded DNA. Its enzymatic activity is mediated by the ExoII motif, as substitution of the Aspartic acid 94 (D94) in the ExoII motif to Glycine (D94G) completely abolishes its exonuclease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref013">13</xref>]. Cellular proteins may be involved in regulation of ISG20 in substrate recognition and/or binding in order to avoid any non-specific cell toxicity, however which remain to be identified.</p>
<p>ISG20 has been shown playing an important role in host antiviral innate immune defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref014">14</xref>]. It is a key ISG against alphavirus replication in host antiviral defense mediated via IFN-α/β signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref015">15</xref>]. Cells with overexpressed ISG20 are resistant to the infections of RNA viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza virus, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), hepatitis A and C virus (HAV and HCV), yellow fever virus, and HIV, but not to a DNA virus, adenovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In the context of HBV infection, it has been reported that ISG20 was highly induced during IFN-mediated suppression of viral replication in HBV transgenic mouse hepatocyte cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref019">19</xref>], and in the liver of acutely HBV infected Chimpanzee during viral clearance phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref020">20</xref>]. Interestingly, chronic hepatitis B patients who had good responses to IFN treatment showed significantly higher levels of ISG20 in their livers compared to either the patients who were non-responders to IFN treatment or the healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref021">21</xref>]. All the above findings suggest that ISG20 may play a role in suppressing HBV in response to host immune activation or IFN-based immunotherapy.</p>
<p>Therefore, we set out to further characterize the antiviral function and mechanism of ISG20 in innate control of HBV. We report herein that: 1) the endogenous ISG20 is a restriction factor for HBV replication and it can be upregulated by all three types of IFN to further inhibit HBV; 2) ISG20 inhibits HBV replication primarily by promoting viral RNA degradation; 3) ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation depends on its ribonuclease activity, but the enzymatically inactivated form retains antiviral activity against pgRNA encapsidation by competing with HBV pol for pgRNA binding; 4) ISG20 recognizes HBV RNA through directly binding to the lower stem region of epsilon and the binding domain on ISG20 is located in Exo III motif; 5) ISG20-epsilon binding is essential to ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation in cell cultures, and other cofactor(s) may be required for ISG20 to efficiently degrade the stem-loop region of HBV RNA. Our results thus have impacts on a better understanding of ISG20 biology and host-virus interaction, and may provide basis for host ribonuclease-based antiviral development.</p>

<p>ISG20 is an interferon inducible protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref016">16</xref>]. Firstly, we assessed the basal expression of ISG20 in cell cultures and its inducibility by IFN. Using Hela cells as a positive control, the basal level of ISG20 expression was detected in both HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells by Western blot, and its expression was significantly upregulated by IFN-α stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Furthermore, ISG20 can be highly induced by all three types of IFNs in both HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes (PHH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). According to a previous study on the transcriptional regulation of ISG20, a unique interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) in the TATA-less human ISG20 promoter confers IRF-1-mediated constitutive transcriptional activity of ISG20 gene and responsiveness to both type I and II interferons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref022">22</xref>]. The basal and cytokine-inducible expression of intrahepatic ISG20 indicates a potentially important role of ISG20 in host defense mechanisms against pathogen infections in hepatocytes.</p>

<title>Overexpression of ISG20 inhibits HBV replication in cell cultures</title>
<p>In an effort to determine the antiviral activity of ISG20 against HBV replication in hepatocytes, FLAG-tagged wild type ISG20 was co-transfected with pHBV1.3 (HBV precore mRNA and pgRNA transcription is controlled by viral enhancer II and core promoter (EnII/Cp)) or pCMVHBV (pgRNA transcription is governed by CMV-IE promoter) in HepG2 cells. HBV viral RNA and DNA were analyzed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. The result clearly demonstrated that ISG20 markedly inhibited HBV DNA replication (middle panel) primarily through reducing the steady state levels of 3.5kb viral pgRNA (top panel) which is the template for HBV DNA synthesis, and such effect is independent of promoter (HBV EnII/Cp or CMV-IE) used to transcribe the pgRNA. A similar antiviral effect of ISG20 was also observed in Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Furthermore, the ISG20-mediated pgRNA reduction is dose dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and not due to a possible cytotoxicity effect caused by ISG20 overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In addition, along with pgRNA reduction, the levels of 2.4 kb and 2.1 kb HBV surface mRNA, which share 100% sequence identity with the 3’ portion of pgRNA, were also reduced upon ISG20 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g002">Fig 2</xref>, top panels). The reduction of HBV 2.4/2.1 kb RNA by ISG20 was further confirmed by co-transfection of ISG20 and plasmid pLMS expressing HBV subgenomic surface mRNA in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).

<title>ISG20 reduces HBV RNA by promoting RNA degradation</title>
<p>Considering that HBV plasmid DNA is the viral transcription template in the transfection system, it is possible that ISG20 reduces HBV RNA through destabilizing the transfected HBV plasmid DNA, or by blocking the nuclear import of input plasmid. To test these possibilities, we recovered the HBV plasmid DNA from the transfected cells by Hirt DNA extraction, followed by Dpn I digestion and Southern blot analysis. The result showed that the levels of input HBV plasmid DNA recovered from whole cells were equal in the absence or presence of ISG20, as revealed by Dpn I-digested fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s004">S4A Fig</xref>, top panel). Furthermore, while ISG20 overexpression reduced HBV core DNA replication in cytoplasm, it did not affect the level of remaining cytoplasmic HBV plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s004">S4A Fig</xref>, middle panel), further confirming that ISG20 does not alter the stability and distribution of the input HBV plasmid. In addition, ISG20 transfection in HBV stable cell line HepDES19 cells also resulted in the reduction of HBV RNA, which were transcribed from the integrated HBV DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Collectively, these results clearly exclude any negative effect of ISG20 on the stability of HBV RNA transcription template, which is consistent with the reported inability of ISG20 to degrade double stranded DNA substrate <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Next, in order to determine whether ISG20-mediated down-regulation of HBV RNA <italic>via</italic> transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanism, we first assessed the potential effect of ISG20 on viral promoter activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, the luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that ISG20 did not significantly affect the activities of HBV Enhancer II/Core (EnII/Cp) promoter, S2 promoter, or CMV-IE promoter, but even enhanced HBV S1 promoter activity. Therefore, it is unlikely that ISG20 reduces HBV RNA through inhibiting viral promoter activity at the transcriptional level.</p>
<p>We then compared the decay kinetics of HBV RNA in the absence and presence of ISG20 overexpression. Briefly, ISG20 expression vector or control empty vector was transfected into the inducible HBV stable cell line HepDES19 cells in the absence of tetracycline (tet) to induce HBV pgRNA transcription and ISG20 expression; 36 h later, tet was added back to shut down the <italic>de novo</italic> pgRNA transcription from the transgene, and after that, the levels of HBV RNA at different time points were analyzed by Northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The representative Northern blot demonstrated that the levels of HBV RNA in HepDES19 cells overexpressing ISG20 at each time point were less than that in the control group, suggesting that ISG20 promotes HBV RNA degradation. This is consistent with the previous observations that ISG20 functions as the 3’-5’ riboexonuclease to degrade single-stranded viral RNA genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref016">16</xref>]. It is worth noting that not every HBV RNA-containing HepDES19 cells were transfected by ISG20, therefore, the actual effect of ISG20 on HBV RNA stability ought to be stronger than observed in this experiment. To further quantitatively validate the observed enhancement of HBV RNA degradation by ISG20, we transfected HepG2 cells with tetracycline-inducible HBV expression vector pTREHBVDES and plasmid pTet-off expressing the tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator (tTA), together with either control vector or ISG20 plasmid. In this way, both HBV RNA and ISG20 coexisted in same cells. Four days later, similarly to the above experiment in HepDES19 cells, tetracycline was added back to block new round of pgRNA transcription, and the time course HBV RNA level was quantified by qPCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, the regular half-life of intracellular HBV RNA was approximately 6 h, which is consistent with previous measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref023">23</xref>], but the decay kinetics of HBV RNA was much faster in cells transfected with ISG20, of which the HBV RNA half-life was much less than 3 h, suggesting that ISG20 promotes HBV RNA decay. Hence, we conclude that ISG20-mediated HBV RNA reduction is primarily through downregulation of HBV RNA stability.</p>

<title>Antiviral effect of endogenous ISG20 on HBV infection</title>
<p>There is a basal level of ISG20 expression in hepatocytes and that could be further induced by interferons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g001">Fig 1</xref>). It was therefore of interest to assess the antiviral activity of endogenous ISG20 against HBV infection under its basal and induced levels. Firstly, we performed the test in HBV stable cell line HepDES19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref024">24</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g004">Fig 4</xref>, knock down of ISG20 expression in the absence of IFN-α treatment resulted in a marked upregulation of the steady state levels of HBV total RNA, encapsidated pgRNA, and DNA (comparing lane 4 to lane l). The observed relatively greater upregulation of core DNA than viral RNA upon knock down of ISG20 might be due to the longer lifespan of DNA. When the cells were treated with IFN-α, ISG20 was upregulated, and viral RNA and DNA were reduced, in an IFN dose-dependent manner (lanes 1–3). It is worth to note that the IFN-elicited reduction of HBV RNA in HepDES19 cells was less profound than in HBV-transfected cells with ISG20 overexpression (compared <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g004">Fig 4</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Such difference might be due to the reported weak response of hepatoma cells to IFN treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref025">25</xref>], and/or the potential unknown negative regulator(s) of ISG20 co-induced by IFN. Nonetheless, in the cells treated with IFN-α and ISG20 siRNA, the levels of HBV RNA were restored to the untreated control level (comparing lanes 5 and 6 to lanes 1–3), suggesting that ISG20 plays a major role in IFN-mediated reduction of HBV RNA in HepDES19 cells. However, neither viral RNA nor DNA reached their levels in cells treated with ISG20 siRNA only (comparing lanes 5 and 6 to lane 4), indicating that other ISGs are involved in IFN-mediated suppression of HBV DNA replication at multiple steps.</p>

<p>Next, we assessed the antiviral function of ISG20 in an HBV <italic>in vitro</italic> infection system, specifically, the viral receptor NTCP reconstituted HepG2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref026">26</xref>]. The endogenous ISG20 in HepG2-NTCP12 cells was stably inhibited through lentiviral shRNA transduction. The obtained ISG20 knock down cell line and control knock down cell line were then infected with HBV and treated with or without IFN-α. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, the basal ISG20 expression was successfully knocked down in HepG2-NTCP12-shISG20 cells (comparing lane 3 to lane1), and IFN-α significantly upregulated ISG20 expression in the HepG2-NTCP12-shcontrol cells (comparing lane 2 to lane1), but only slightly induced ISG20 in the HepG2-NTCP12-shISG20 cells (comparing lane 4 to lane3). Then the outcomes of HBV infection were analyzed. The HBcAg immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that knock down of ISG20 resulted in a higher percentage of HBV positive cells when compared to control cells without or with IFN-α treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Because that the ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation will lead to an overall suppression of the entire HBV life cycle in the infection system, we infer that the increased percentage of core staining-positive cell number in HBV infected HepG2-NTCP-shISG20 cells is a combinational end effect of increased viral protein expression, DNA replication, and cccDNA synthesis, plus the possible higher virus spread rate. Since HBV RNA is a more convincing marker for HBV infection and the authentic antiviral target of ISG20, the qPCR assay of HBV total RNA from the infected cells further demonstrated that IFN-α is able to reduce HBV RNA in infected cells, and knocking down of ISG20 greatly favors HBV infection in both IFN-treated and untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Consistent with the observations in HepDES19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g004">Fig 4</xref>), inhibition of ISG20 significantly but partially abrogated the overall antiviral activity of IFN-α in HBV infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>), presumably due to the induction of other antiviral ISGs. Collectively, the above data suggested that ISG20 serves as a host intrinsic restriction factor to limit HBV infection under both basal expression and cytokine induction.</p>

<title>ISG20-mediated HBV RNA decay depends on its ribonuclease activity</title>

<p>Since HBV pgRNA encapsidation requires the dynamic interactions among three viral components, specifically the pgRNA, Pol, and core protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref027">27</xref>], it is possible that ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> might be antagonizing one or more of these three viral factors to block encapsidation. However, ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> did not inhibit capsid assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g006">Fig 6</xref>, 3rd panel from the top), and ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation does not rely on viral core or pol protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Based on these data, we hypothesized that ISG20 might physically bind to HBV RNA for degradation, and thus in the particular case of ISG20<sup>D94G</sup>, its association with pgRNA inhibited the binding of HBV polymerase to pgRNA and the subsequent pgRNA encapsidation.</p>

<title>ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> interacts with HBV RNA and competes Pol-pgRNA binding in cell cultures</title>

The HA Ab IP-Northern result demonstrated that ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> bound to HBV RNA in a dose dependent manner. In contrast, increased amount of ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> resulted in the decreased amount of HBV RNA associated with Pol, suggesting that ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> competes with HBV Pol for binding of pgRNA and thus inhibits HBV pgRNA encapsidation. It is assumed that the wildtype ISG20 may possess additional antiviral function as what ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> does in cells, but the inhibition of pgRNA encapsidation, if any, will likely be overwhelmed by its dominant primary effect on RNA degradation.</p>

<title>Mapping the ISG20 responsive elements in HBV RNA genome</title>
<p>The above data demonstrated that ISG20 interacts with HBV RNA. In order to map the ISG20-targeting sequences, we made use of a series of internal deletion clones and terminal deletion clones of the 3.5kb HBV RNA genome to express truncated RNAs and their sensitivities to ISG20-mediated RNA degradation were assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g009">Fig 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). Firstly, we found that all those pgRNA mutants with internal deletions (within nt 2009-3182/1-1574) were sensitive to ISG20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). Then the terminal redundancy (TR, nt 1820–1918, containing ε (nt 1849–1909)) mutants with deletion of either 5’ TR (Δ5TR) or 3’ TR (Δ3TR) from pgRNA were tested. Interestingly, while the single TR deleting pgRNA remained sensitive to ISG20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, lanes 1–4), the pgRNA mutant with both 5’ and 3’ TR removed (Δ5/3TR) became completely resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, lanes 5–6), indicating that one copy of the TR sequences is sufficient to confer the susceptibility of HBV pgRNA to ISG20-mediated RNA degradation. This is also consistent with the fact that ISG20 is also able to degrade HBV subgenomic RNAs which only contain the 3’ TR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

The solid dot indicates 5’ cap of mRNA; and the sawtooth line represents the polyA tail at the 3’ terminus of mRNA. The internal deletion clones (pg-IDs) are described in details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s008">S8 Fig</xref>. The terminal redundancy (TR) deletion clones contain truncations of HBV sequences (nt 1820–1918) at either 5’ or 3’ terminus of pgRNA coding sequences (pg-Δ5TR and pg-Δ3TR, respectively.), or both (pg-Δ5/3TR). The transcription of terminal truncated pgRNA is governed by CMV-IE promoter in the pCDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector. (B) Sensitivity of HBV RNA with TR deletion to ISG20-mediated RNA reduction.

<p>To further confirm that the HBV TR is the ISG20 responsive element, HBV core promoter activity reporter plasmids EnII/Cp-Luc with TR region inserted at the 5’ (EnII/Cp-TR-Luc), or 3’ (EnII/Cp-Luc-TR), or both 5’ and 3’ (EnII/Cp-TR-Luc-TR) non-translational region of luciferase gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g009">Fig 9C</xref>) were transfected into HepG2 cells with or without F-ISG20.

<title>ISG20 directly binds to epsilon of HBV TR sequence <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>HBV Pol recognizes and binds on a stem-loop structure in 5’ TR region of HBV pgRNA, called epsilon (ε), to initiate pgRNA encapsidation and reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref029">29</xref>]. Since ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation relies on TR sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g009">Fig 9</xref>) and ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> competes with Pol for HBV RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g008">Fig 8</xref>), it is therefore of immediate interest to investigate whether ISG20 also directly binds on HBV ε to exert its antiviral functions. To this end, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was employed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g010">Fig 10</xref>, purified recombinant His-tagged ISG20 proteins were incubated with 5’ radiolabeled HBV ε RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and the protein/RNA complexes were analyzed <italic>via</italic> the mobility shifting of the RNA in the native polyacrylamide gel. The proper folding of stem-loop structure of ε RNA was confirmed by recombinant Pol/ε complex formation as detected in the EMSA assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, in the absence of other cellular proteins, His-ISG20 could directly, dose-dependently bind on ε RNA, shown as the shift bands in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g010">Fig 10C</xref> (lanes 3, 5, 7), and the binding specificity between His-ISG20 and ε was confirmed by the His-antibody(Ab) /His-ISG20/ε super-complex formation detected as a super-shift in EMSA (lanes 4, 6, 8). Competition of ISG20 binding to the radiolabeled ε RNA by excess amount of cold ε probes indicated again that ISG20 specifically binds to HBV ε (lanes 9, 10, 11). It is of note that the incubation of ISG20 and ε RNA during EMSA was performed in protein/RNA binding buffer without manganese, an essential ion for the enzymatic activity of ISG20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref013">13</xref>], therefore the degradation of ε RNA, if any could occur, would not be observed in this binding assay.</p>

Interestingly, ISG20 bound to the lower stem with bulge sequence serving as loop, but not the upper stem-loop of ε in EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g011">Fig 11B</xref>), which indicates that ISG20 recognizes the lower stem and/or bulge of HBV ε as its binding site. To further determine the binding position within the lower stem and bulge region, the bulge sequences were mutated or the lower stem were truncated from the bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g011">Fig 11A</xref>), and used as probes in EMSA. Interestingly, we found that the loop (or bulge) sequence is not critical for ISG20 binding as long as the lower stem is intact; however the bottom 4 base-pairs of the stem is indispensable for ISG20 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g011">Fig 11C</xref>). To further confirm the requirement of these 4 base-pairs for ISG20 to carry out its biological functions, we disrupted the base pairing at the bottom of ε stem-loop in HBV 2.1 kb surface mRNA by removing 4 nucleotides from the 3’ end of ε coding sequence, and found that the mutant RNA became resistant to ISG20-mediated RNA degradation in cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g011">Fig 11D</xref>). Collectively, these findings imply that ISG20 recognizes sequence-specific secondary structure of HBV ε for RNA binding and degradation.</p>

<title>Exo III domain mediates the binding of ISG20 to ε</title>
<p>Since ISG20 is able to bind on its RNA substrate directly in the absence of any other cellular or viral proteins, it is therefore of interest to investigate which domain of ISG20 is responsible for RNA binding. Three distinct exonuclease motifs, namely Exo I (a.a7-16), Exo II (a.a 86–101) and Exo III (a.a 147–157), have been predicted in ISG20 protein sequence from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g012">Fig 12A</xref>). Based on that, the recombinant mutant ISG20 proteins with each Exo domain deletion or Exo II D94G mutation were tested for ε binding activity by EMSA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g012">Fig 12B and 12C</xref>, in comparison to wildtype ISG20, deletion of Exo I or Exo II did not reduce, but even increased the binding affinity of ISG20 with ε (lanes 2–4); however ISG20 with Exo III deletion completely lost the binding activity (lane 5), indicating that the Exo III is the functional binding domain of ISG20 for its RNA substrate. In addition, the enzymatically inactive D94G mutant retains its function for ε binding (lane 6), which is consistent with the observed association of ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> with HBV RNA and subsequent inhibition of pgRNA encapsidation in cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g008">8</xref>). It is worth noting that the ΔExo I and ΔExo II deletion mutants, as well as the ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> mutant, exhibited altered mobility compared to wildtype ISG20 in the gel shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g012">Fig 12C</xref>, lane 2 vs. lanes 3, 4, 6). While it is predictable that the faster mobility of ΔExo I:ε and ΔExo II:ε complexes is likely due to the protein’s lower molecular weight (MW), the lower shift of ISG20<sup>D94G</sup>:ε complex is probably because that such RNP complex exhibits a different structural conformation compared to the ISG20:ε complex.</p>

<p>Lastly, we set out to characterize the enzymatic activity of ISG20 against ε RNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. The previous biochemistry study has demonstrated that ISG20 catalyzes RNA degradation <italic>in vitro</italic> in a manganese-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref013">13</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g013">Fig 13</xref>, under the reaction condition that supports ISG20 ribonuclease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref013">13</xref>], a wide spectrum endoribonuclease RNase A efficiently degraded ε RNA as a positive control (panel A and B, lanes 1–3). However, ISG20 exhibited much less efficiency to degrade the full length ε RNA substrate (panel A and B, lanes 1, 4–5), and other two stem-loop subdomains (US+L, LS+B) (panel A, lanes 6–11), suggesting that ISG20 alone does not favor RNA with secondary structures for degradation. Such observation is consistent with a previous study showing that ISG20 operated poorly on double-stranded regions of RNA substrate <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref013">13</xref>]. In line with these, we found that ISG20 was able to catalyze the degradation of RNA substrate derived from the left arm of ε (panel B, lanes 6–8), which is lack of secondary structures. Furthermore, ISG20 efficiently degraded the single-stranded linear 30-mer poly(rA) oligo <italic>in vitro</italic> (panel B, lane 11), confirming that the recombinant ISG20 protein used in the assay was enzymatically active. As a control, RNase A was unable to degrade poly(rA) because it only cleaves RNA string at the 3´ end of pyrimidine (rC or U) residues (panel B, lane 10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref031">31</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, we report here that ISG20 functions as a 3’-5’ exoribonuclease to degrade HBV RNA, by which serves as an intrinsic host restriction factor for HBV infection. The selectivity of ISG20 for HBV RNA is determined by a unique viral ribonucleotide string that shapes a stem-loop structure (ε) which exists in all HBV RNA species. ISG20 directly binds to the lower stem of ε through the C-terminal Exo III domain, and such protein-RNA interaction, possibly with the assistance of a host cofactor(s), will lead to the major antiviral action of ISG20, which is the enzymatic activity dependent HBV RNA degradation. Subsequently, viral protein translation and DNA replication will be inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g014">Fig 14</xref>). In addition, under certain circumstance that the enzymatic activity of ISG20 could be inhibited (i.e. the ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> mutant), the binding of ISG20 to 5’ ε may remain antiviral by competing the binding of viral polymerase with ε and blocking the subsequent pgRNA encapsidation and reverse transcription.</p>

<p>It is well documented that, during acute HBV infection, the activation of host T-cell responses plays a pivotal role in clearing virus from hepatocytes <italic>via</italic> a noncytolytic mechanism, which is largely attributed to the antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines produced by the infiltrating immune cells, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref033">33</xref>]. To date, IFN-α is the only available immunotherapy for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref034">34</xref>]. Besides serving as an immunomodulatory agent to regulate the host adaptive immunity against HBV, the intracellular antiviral activity of IFN-α is mediated by an array of ISGs. In search of intrahepatic ISGs associated with immune clearance of HBV, a growing body of evidence implies that ISG20 may be involved in IFN mediated inhibition of HBV, including 1) the upregulation of ISG20 in HBV transgenic mouse hepatocyte cell lines in which the HBV replication was inhibited by IFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref019">19</xref>]; 2) the elevation of ISG20 level in viral clearance phase of an acutely HBV infected Chimpanzee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref035">35</xref>]; and 3) the upregulation of ISG20 in chronic hepatitis B patients who responded well to IFN-α therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref021">21</xref>]. Consistent with the above findings, we found that ISG20 can be highly induced in hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> by all three types of interferons, and it plays a significant role in IFN-α elicited antiviral effects on HBV infection and replication (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g005">5</xref>). Considering that HBV RNA are essential genetic components for viral replication and gene expression in its life cycle, upregulation of ISG20 expression by cytokines to eliminate HBV RNA is a very economical and efficient way in host defense mechanisms. In addition, our study also expands the antiviral spectrum of ISG20 to a DNA virus. Considering that current HBV therapy with nucleoside analogues is ineffective against viral protein expression and cannot efficiently promote HBeAg or HBsAg seroconversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref034">34</xref>], it is thus envisioned that the ISG20-based antiviral therapy could be developed in the future to reduce both viremia and antigenemia in CHB patients.</p>
<p>While its cellular function remains elusive, ISG20 has been previously shown to inhibit a number of RNA viruses, including VSV, influenza viruses, HIV-1, picornaviruses (EMCV, HAV), and flaviviruses (HCV, WNV, and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref037">37</xref>]. The previously reported antiviral effects of ISG20 on these RNA viruses are all dependent on its exonuclease activity, though the degradation of viral RNA directly catalyzed by ISG20 has not been experimentally confirmed. However, RNA degradation might not be the only mechanism of ISG20’s antiviral action. For instance, <italic>Zhou et al</italic> found that ISG20 did not promote the degradation of a replication-defective HCV RNA genome in Huh7.5 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref017">17</xref>]; and <italic>Qu et al</italic> observed that ISG20 inhibits Influenza A Virus replication through interaction with viral nucleoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref037">37</xref>]. Furthermore, not all the RNA viruses are susceptible to ISG20, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has shown resistance to ISG20 in cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref017">17</xref>], indicating that there is viral specific factor(s) to determine the antiviral specificity of ISG20. Here, we clearly demonstrated that ISG20 is able to promote HBV RNA degradation in cell cultures, and such effect is dependent on the protein’s exonuclease activity (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g006">6</xref>). During the preparation of this manuscript, Leong <italic>et al</italic> also reported that ISG20 inhibited HBV replication in cell cultures and in hydrodynamic injected mouse liver <italic>via</italic> exoribonuclease-dependent degradation of viral RNA, which is largely consistent with our results, but their study did not touch on the molecular mechanism for the selective targeting of HBV RNA by ISG20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref038">38</xref>]. In our study, we further mapped the sequence element responsible for ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation to ε region in HBV RNA genome (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g009">9</xref>), and confirmed the direct binding of ISG20 to ε in EMSA assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g010">Fig 10</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report revealing that the RNA sequence/structure-specific recognition is required for ISG20 to degrade its viral RNA substrate. Such characteristic of ISG20 makes it mechanistically distinct from RNase L, a well-known antiviral ISG that, upon activation, nonspecifically destroys both viral and cellular RNA in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref039">39</xref>]. In this regard, ISG20 represents a novel class of cellular antiviral ISGs, which is reminiscent of the sequence-specific antiviral RNAi system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref040">40</xref>], but ISG20 targets viral RNA directly without the help of small guide RNA.</p>
<p>HBV RNAs are typical mRNAs produced by host RNA polymerase II, all of which possess 5’ cap and a 3' poly (A) tail similar to cellular mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref041">41</xref>]. Despite of the sequence difference with host mRNA, the ε is a unique structure signature of HBV RNA, which serves as pgRNA packaging signal and the priming site for interacting with viral polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref042">42</xref>]. It is thus conceivable that ISG20 recognizes ε as a “non-self” target to initiate its antiviral function. In line with this, it has been recently reported that host innate sensor RIG-I binds to ε to trigger IFN-λ production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref043">43</xref>]. In addition, we further determined that the bottom 4bp of lower stem of ε is the minimal responsive element of ISG20, as the removal of such sequence from HBV RNA made ISG20 lose both the ε binding activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and HBV RNA reduction effect in cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g011">Fig 11</xref>). These sequence and structure information could serve as a consensus motif to predict ISG20-responsive RNA elements in other viruses, and perhaps host RNAs as well.</p>
<p>Despite acting as a host antiviral factor, the other potential functions of ISG20 in regulating host cellular function remain obscure. Since ISG20 targets viral mRNA for destabilization, it is plausible that they may also alter the stability of certain cellular mRNA to regulate host gene expression. For example, the observed enhancement of HBV S1 promoter activity by ISG20 may be due to the ISG20-mediated upregulation of host transcription factor(s) required for S1 promoter activity or downregulation of negative regulator(s) of S1 promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This notion is also supported by previous observations that ISG20-mediated antiviral effect on HCV was not through inhibition of HCV RNA stability or translation, indicating that ISG20 might degrade the mRNA of a host factor(s) essential for HCV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref017">17</xref>]. More interestingly, considering that ISG20 favors short RNAs with stem-loop structures for affinity binding, it is also possible that ISG20 potentially targets host microRNA (miRNA) precursors (pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref044">44</xref>] and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref045">45</xref>], which may contain ε-like stem-loop structures, to regulate miRNA processing and lncRNA stability, respectively. In addition, it is known that IFNs regulate cellular gene expression primarily at the mRNA level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref046">46</xref>], so it is possible that ISG20, as a IFN-inducible RNase, may partly mediate the action of IFN through altering the host mRNA stability. We are currently conducting RNA-seq analysis to search for potential host RNA substrates of ISG20.</p>
<p>ISG20 has three predicted exonuclease domains (Exo I-III) with Exo II being validated as the major enzymatic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref014">14</xref>]. We found that the catalytic site (D94) in Exo II of ISG20 was essential for HBV RNA reduction, but the ISG20<sup>D94G</sup> mutant retained RNA binding activity and inhibited HBV pgRNA encapsidation through competing the binding of HBV polymerase to ε (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g008">8</xref>). Although such antiviral effect may be just minor in the context of wildtype ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation, this serendipitous finding led us to discover the binding property of ISG20 with HBV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Interestingly, the minimal binding site on ε for ISG20 is located at the bottom 4bp of the stem-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g011">Fig 11</xref>), which is dispensable for HBV polymerase to bind ε [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref047">47</xref>], indicating that the inhibition of polymerase binding by ISG20 is due to ISG20/ε interaction-induced steric hindrance and/or conformational shift of ε. In addition, the domain of ISG20 for ε binding was mapped to the Exo III region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g012">Fig 12</xref>), suggesting that the substrate interaction and degradation domains of ISG20 are separated. This is consistent with the reported crystal structure analysis of ISG20, which predicted that the amino acid composition of Exo II is unfavorable for RNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref030">30</xref>]. However, no classical RNA binding motif was found in the Exo III domain or the entire ISG20 sequence by computational prediction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/protein/Q96AZ6" xlink:type="simple">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/protein/Q96AZ6</ext-link>). ISG20 has been shown to interact with host U1/2/3 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref048">48</xref>], which also have stem-loops, further indicating that ISG20 may possess a novel binding motif for such kind of double stranded RNA secondary structures including HBV ε.</p>
<p>We have previously identified the host zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) as a restriction factor of HBV by promoting HBV RNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref010">10</xref>]. ZAP exerts its antiviral activity against HBV with certain features similar to ISG20, specifically, both ZAP and ISG20 interact with HBV RNA for RNA degradation in a ε-dependent manner. Since ZAP does not possess nuclease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref049">49</xref>], our initial hypothesis was that ZAP might recruit ISG20 to ε for RNA degradation. However, co-immunoprecipitation assay did not reveal any detectable association between ZAP and ISG20 in the absence or presence of HBV RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006296.s010">S10 Fig</xref>), indicating that ZAP and ISG20 work independently to target HBV ε for their antiviral functions, and host cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to recognize the “non-self” HBV ε as an antiviral sensing signal.</p>
<p>It is worth to note that ISG20 is a 3’-5’ exoribonuclease and the ε locates near the 3’ end of all HBV RNAs and there is an additional 5’ copy in precore mRNA and pgRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref050">50</xref>], we therefore speculate that the binding of ISG20 to ε is an initial substrate sensing step, and RNA topology changes and/or ISG20 translocation may be requires for subsequent RNA degradation from 3’ end of HBV RNA. In addition, since ISG20 could single-handedly degrade poly(rA) oligo in the <italic>in vitro</italic> degradation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g013">Fig 13B</xref>), whether the poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is required to remove the poly(A) tail in ISG20-mediated HBV mRNA degradation reaction awaits further investigations. Interestingly, our <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA degradation assay demonstrated that ISG20 efficiently degrades single-stranded RNA but not the ε RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006296.g013">Fig 13</xref>), indicating that additional host factor(s), likely a RNA helicase, is required to unwind the double-stranded region of ε for ISG20 to catalyze RNA degradation. Therefore, we have embarked on the identification of cofactors in ISG20 degradesome complex by proteomic approach.</p>
<p>Taken together, the phenotypic and mechanistic characterizations of ISG20-mediated antiviral effect on HBV replication presented in current study not only shed light on ISG20 biology and virus-host interaction, but also provide insight into development of ribonuclease-based antiviral therapy for treatment of hepatitis B.</p>

<p>Expression vector pcDNA-3FHP was used to express 3×FLAG tagged HBV Pol (3F-HP) in TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) by following manufacturer’s instructions. The control IVT reaction was done with empty pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). One microliter of control or 3F-HP IVT sample was mixed with 1 μl of <sup>32</sup> P-radiolabeled ε RNA (100 ng/μl) and 18 μl of TMNK RNA binding buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 2 mM MgCl2, 15 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, and 4 mM DTT) which has been previously used for HBV pol:ε RNA binding reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006296.ref061">61</xref>]. Then 1% Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher), 4 μl of RNasin RNase inhibitors (Promega), and 6 μg of yeast tRNA were added and the binding reaction was incubated at 30°C for 1 h. The pol:ε binding complex was revealed by EMSA as described above.</p>

<title>ISG20 does not alter the levels of HBV RNA transcription template.</title>
<p>(A) ISG20 overexpression does not reduce the level of transfected HBV plasmid DNA. HepG2 cells in 12-well-plate were cotransfected with 0.8 μg of plasmid pHBV1.3 and 0.8 μg of control vector or plasmid F-ISG20. The cells were harvested at day 5 post transfection, total Hirt DNA was treated by Dpn I and subjected to HBV DNA Southern blot (top panel). During cytoplasmic HBV DNA extraction, DNase I digestion of input HBV plasmid DNA in cell lysates was omitted, and the recovered cytoplasmic DNA samples were treated with Dpn I to digest the bacteria-derived plasmid DNA with Dam methylation, but not the viral core DNA synthesized in eukaryotic cells. The Dpn I-restricted pHBV1.3 DNA fragments migrated at the bottom of the gel were revealed together with HBV core DNA by Southern blot using HBV probe (middle panel). Expression of ISG20 was detected by Western blot with antibodies against FLAG-tag. β-actin served as loading control. (B) Expression of ISG20 reduces HBV RNA in HBV stable cell line. Tetracycline inducible (tet-off) HBV stable cell line HepDES19 cells, which transcribes HBV RNA from the integrated HBV genome, were transfected with control vector or plasmid F-ISG20 in tet-free medium. Four days later, HBV RNA and ISG20 expression were analyzed by Northern and Western blot, respectively.</p>
