<title>Background</title>
<p>The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection could activate the immune system and induce extensive inflammatory response. As the most important inflammatory factor, interleukins are critical for anti-viral immunity. Here we investigated whether interleukin-34 (IL-34) play a role in HBV infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Principal findings</title>
<p>In this study, we first found that both serum IL-34 and IL-34 mRNA in PBMCs in chronic HBV patients was significantly decreased compared to the healthy controls. Furthermore, both IL-34 protein and mRNA levels were declined hepatoma cells expressing HBV. In addition, the clinical parameters analysis found that serum IL-34 was significantly associated with HBV DNA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0066), ALT (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0327), AST (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0435), TB (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0406), DB (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0368) and AFP (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0225). Correlation analysis also found that serum IL-34 negatively correlated with HBV DNA copies, ALT and AST. In vitro studies found that IL-34 treatment in HepAD38 and HepG2.2.15 cells markedly inhibited HBV DNA, total RNA, 3.5kb mRNA and HBc protein. In vivo studies further demonstrated IL-34 treatment in HBV transgenic mice exhibited greater inhibition on HBV DNA, total RNA, 3.5kb mRNA and HBc protein, suggesting the effect to IL-34 on HBV is likely due to host innate or adaptive immune response.</p>

<sec id="sec003">
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>Our study identified a novel interleukin, IL-34, which has anti-viral activity in HBV replication in hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest a rationale for the use of IL-34 in the HBV treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref001">1</xref>]. The HBV genome is a relaxed circular partially double-stranded DNA (rcDNA) of approximately 3200 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref002">2</xref>], which contains four open reading frames: preS/S, pol, PreCore/core and X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref003">3</xref>]. Mediated by Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) and other receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref004">4</xref>], HBV nucleocapside is released into the cytoplasm and then rcDNA is delivered into the nucleus. In nucleus, rcDNA reverted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which contains the complete genetic script of HBV to serve as the transcriptional template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref005">5</xref>]. cccDNA persistence within hepatocytes is the main reason for the failure of viral clearance and relapse of viral activity after antiviral treatment in clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref006">6</xref>]. There are two major therapy strategies which are applied for HBV treatment: direct acting antiviral drugs and immune modulatory agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref007">7</xref>]. However, none of current therapies could completely cure HBV infection and more effective therapies are needed for HBV treatment.</p>
<p>As a newly discovered member of interleukin family which shows no sequence similarity with macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref008">8</xref>], IL-34 has received much attention. In physiological condition, IL-34 promotes differentiation, proliferation and survival of mononuclear cells via strongly binding to CSF-1R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref009">9</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref010">10</xref>]. Dysregulation of the IL-34 is reported to be involved in many diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref011">11</xref>], rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref012">12</xref>], heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref013">13</xref>] and kidney diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref014">14</xref>]. In terms of virus infection, IL-34 could response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection through the inflammatory cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref015">15</xref>]. Meanwhile, IL-34 enhanced human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) production by microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref016">16</xref>], although the interventional studies in vivo are lacking. It also reported that IL-34 was upregulated in hepatitis C virus infection and inhibited the production of IFN-γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref017">17</xref>]. However, the understanding of the role of IL-34 during HBV infection remains elusive.</p>
<p>To assess the potential role of IL-34 in HBV infection, we investigated the expression and clinical significance of IL-34 in patients with chronic HBV infection. And further studies indicated that IL-34 may inhibit HBV replication both in <italic>vitro</italic> and in <italic>vivo</italic>. Those results improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which IL-34 regulates HBV replication.</p>

<title>Patients selection</title>
<p>With informed consent from patients, blood specimens were obtained from 79 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection including 42 hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg) positive and 37 HBeAg negative ones. All patients were hepatitis B virus s antigen (HBsAg) positive. Exclusion criteria: the patients with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [HIV-1], and HIV-2, and other causes of chronic liver damages. These patients were not suffering from any autoimmune disease. Clinicopathologic and outcomes data were collected retrospectively. 105 sex- and age-matched healthy Chinese volunteers were recruited as normal control subjects. The Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Chongqing Medical University approved the above protocol.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>HBV transgenic mice (HBV-Tg C57BL/6) were kindly provided by Prof. Ningshao Xia (Xia Men University, China). A 1.2-overlength copy of the HBV genome (serotype awy) was encoded in these animals. Mouse were bred and maintained under pathogen-free conditions at the Laboratory Animal Center of the Chongqing Medical University. For experiment they were matched for age (6–8 weeks), sex (male), serum HBV DNA and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) levels. The mice were randomly assigned to two groups of 6–7 individuals per group. RhIL-34 was diluted in 1 ml PBS contained 0.1% BSA and injected through the tail vein at a dose of 1ug/25g. The serum samples were collected via tail vein at the indicated time points after injection. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation to collect liver samples. The animal studies were carried out in accordance with the Chinese Council on Animal Care and approved by Chongqing Medical University. Laboratory Animal Center of the Chongqing Medical University approved the animal studies.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)</title>
<p>The absolute quantification of the HBV replicative intermediates and mouse serum and liver HBV DNA were detected using Fast Start Universal SYBR Green Master (Catalog no. 06924204001, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Serial dilutions of HBV DNA plasmids were used to standardize the results. IScript<sup>™</sup> cDNA Synthesis Kit was purchased from Bio-Rad (Catalog no. KR106-02, Bio-Rad, California, USA). Relative quantification of HBV total RNA and 3.5kb mRNA were conducted using Fast Start Universal SYBR Green Master and β-actin mRNA was used as an internal control. The fold change of target genes were calculated by using the 2-ΔΔCT method. The sequences of the experimental primers are as follows: HBV replicative intermediates: forward, <monospace>5’-CCTAGTAGTCAG TTATGTCAAC-3’</monospace>, reverse, <monospace>5’-TCTATAAGCTGGAGGAGTGCGA-3’</monospace>.

<title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title>
<p>Serum levels of IL-34 in chronic HBV infection patients were determined by IL-34 ELISA kits (Catalog no. JYM2045Hu, ColorfulGene Biological Technology, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec013">
<title>Southern blot</title>
<p>The HBV DNA replicative intermediates were separated by 0.9% agarose gels and denatured in alkali solution at room temperature for 30 min. And then the DNA was transferred on nylon membrane by capillary siphon method and fixed by UV cross-linking. After pre-hybridization at 42°C for 1 h, the membrane was hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe overnight at 42°C. The next day, the membrane was washed in 30 ml of 2 x SSC/0.1% SDS, 1 x SSC/0.1% SDS, 0.1 x SSC/0.1% SDS for 15 min, respectively. The membrane was blocked at 37°C for 30 min in blocking solution and incubated with anti-digoxin secondary antibody at 37°C for 30 min. The DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit (Catalog no. 11585614910, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was used in this experiment. The signal was collected by X-ray film.</p>

<title>IL-34 expression in HBV infection patients and HBV-expression cells</title>
<p>To explore whether IL-34 plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic HBV infection, we first determined the serum concentration of IL-34 in chronic HBV patients and healthy controls by using ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179605.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The level of serum IL-34 in chronic HBV patients (median: 145.00 pg/ml) were significantly decreased compared to those of healthy controls (median: 230.43 pg/ml), suggesting that IL-34 may play a potential role in HBV pathogenesis. To further confirm this hypothesis, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was isolated from blood samples of 29 pairs HBV patients and healthy controls and the levels of mRNA of IL-34 were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179605.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Consistently, IL-34 mRNA level in PBMCs decreased in chronic HBV patients relative to healthy controls. Those data indicated that IL-34 indeed plays a potential role in HBV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. In order to clarify the impact of disease progression on IL-34 levels, we divided HBV patients into two groups (With or Without cirrhosis) based on pathological findings and further compared the serum IL-34 levels between those two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179605.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). According to our results, cirrhosis status did not have significant effect on IL-34 expression.</p>

<p>To further investigate the association between HBV and IL-34, we analyzed the IL-34 mRNA level in HepAD38 and the corresponding cell culture mediums were collected to analyze the secretion levels of IL-34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179605.g001">Fig 1D–1H</xref>). HepAD38 is HBV stably expressing cells where HBV genome integrates host genome and the expression of HBV can be regulated by tetracycline. HBV expression is inhibited when tetracycline is present in HepAD38 cell culture medium. To certificate the HBV expression in HepAD38 cells were inhibited by tetracycline, HBV DNA in HepAD38 cells with or without tetracycline were detected by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179605.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The supernatants of HepAD38 without tetracycline (HBV replication) in 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days and 7 days were collected and then the HBV DNA or IL-34 secretion level were detected. With the increase of HBV copy number, the secretion level of IL-34 decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179605.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Both the mRNA and secretion level of IL-34 were down regulated in HepAD38 cells without tetracycline compared to cells with tetracycline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179605.g001">Fig 1G–1H</xref>).</p>
<p>The expression of IL-34 also examined in Huh-7 cells transiently transfected HBV expressing plasmid pCH9/3091.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main life cycle of HBV including infection, replication, assembly, maturation, and secretion. Based on the extensive research of virus-host interactions, several new agents which aimed to enhance the innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref019">19</xref>] are under development to cure HBV. Interleukins have an irreplaceable role in the immune system and widely involve in varieties of biological processes, such as antibody secretion, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production, cell proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>It is well-known that interleukins can affect the biological processes of many viruses. IL-22 do not have significant effect on lethal influenza infection but is beneficial to sublethal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref021">21</xref>]. IL-32 has a protective role in the immune response to RNA and DNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref022">22</xref>]. More importantly, IL-26 was identified to strongly enhance vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection and replication rates IL-23 could also inhibit human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and has no effect the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref023">23</xref>]. The above studies strongly indicated that interleukins, even the same one interleukin, plays different role in different virus infection and sometime exert completely different effect. In terms of HBV, IL-4 gene polymorphisms may affect the Korean infants’ response to the HBV vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref024">24</xref>]. And the level of IL-23 in monocyte-derived dendritic cells was associated with mortality of acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF) patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref025">25</xref>]. So far, there is no report about the relationship between HBV and IL-34. In this study, we identified that IL-34 was significantly decreased in the serum and PBMCs of chronic HBV patients compared to healthy control subjects.</p>
<p>PBMCs play a central role in immune system responses against microbial infections. A previously study has reported that the dysfunction of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) is related to the HBV chronic infection and tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref026">26</xref>]. Consistently, our data showed that the mRNA level of IL-34 in PBMCs of chronic HBV patients were obviously decreased compared to healthy subjects. This change would alter the immune response to HBV infection.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the function of IL-34 in HBV infection patients, we studied the role of IL-34 on HBV replication both in <italic>vitro</italic> and in <italic>vivo</italic>. There are complicated interactions between the host immune system and the virus when HBV infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref027">27</xref>]. It is recognized that host immune system responses to HBV invasion to suppress the virus. On the contrary, viruses also alter the immune regulatory effects to escape the recognition and favor their replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref028">28</xref>]. Based on the data in our study, the decreased IL-34 in HBV patients may benefit to HBV replication. In contrast with our study, Yu G, <italic>et al</italic>. reported that IL-34 elevated in influenza A virus infected patients and could be induced by IL-22 in the inflammatory cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref015">15</xref>]. Considering that IL-34 is recognized as a tissue-restricted ligand of CSF1R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref029">29</xref>] and HBV is a hepatotropic virus, the discrepancy between our study and other group may be resulted in from different functions of IL-34 in different tissues. The above findings suggest that IL-34 may play a complicated function on virus infection and could be involved in anti-virus response more than one pathway.</p>
<p>Some studies found that interleukins are involved in pathological processes by regulating microRNAs. IL-21 participates in HIV-1 control in <italic>vivo</italic> via inducing microRNA-29 (miR-29) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref030">30</xref>]. And IL-17A would be suppressed by miR-10b to participate the pathological processes of ankylosing spondylitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref031">31</xref>]. Moreover, IL-34 modulates HCC metastasis through microRNA-28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref032">32</xref>]. Therefore, microRNAs may serve as the potential mechanism which IL-34 regulates HBV replication.</p>
<p>As a non-cytolytic virus, HBV can affect host immunization in many ways which is benefit to its own replication. Virus protein HBx can be recruited to the cccDNA and is essential for the transcription of all viral RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref033">33</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref034">34</xref>] indicating the important role of HBx to initiate and maintain virus replication. Considering that HBx could downregulate the host antiviral protein APOBEC3G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref035">35</xref>] and induce degradation of talin-1 to stimulate HBV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0179605.ref036">36</xref>], HBV may regulate IL-34 via HBx. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between HBx and IL-34 and the potential underlining mechanism.</p>
<p>In summary, the current study enhances our understanding of the role of IL-34 in HBV infection. The decreased IL-34 may contribute to the HBV replication which is a potential target of HBV treatment. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanism of IL-34 to inhibit HBV replication.</p>
