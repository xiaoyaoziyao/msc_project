<abstract>
<p>PDK1 phosphorylates multiple substrates including Akt by PIP<sub>3</sub>-dependent mechanisms. In this report we provide evidence that in prostate cancer cells stimulated with activated α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin (α<sub>2</sub>M*) PDK1 phosphorylates Akt in the T-loop at Thr<sup>308</sup> by using Raptor in the mTORC1 complex as a scaffold protein. First we demonstrate that PDK1, Raptor, and mTOR co-immunoprecipitate. Silencing the expression, not only of PDK1, but also Raptor by RNAi nearly abolished Akt phosphorylation at Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> in Raptor-immunoprecipitates of α<sub>2</sub>M*-stimulated prostate cancer cells. Immunodepleting Raptor or PDK from cell lysates of cells treated with α<sub>2</sub>M* drastically reduced Akt phosphorylation at Thr<sup>308</sup>, which was recovered by adding the supernatant of Raptor- or PDK1-depleted cell lysates, respectively. Studies of insulin binding to its receptor on prostate cancer cells yielded similar results. We thus demonstrate that phosphorylating the T-loop Akt residue Thr<sup>308</sup> by PDK1 requires Raptor of the mTORC1 complex as a platform or scaffold protein.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tetrameric human α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin (α<sub>2</sub>M), a pan proteinase inhibitor, is expressed in most animal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Hart1">[1]</xref>. The protein is synthesized by many cells and is present in plasma at a concentration of 1–5 µM. Tumors and their associated stroma also produce this protein as well as various proteinases that react with α<sub>2</sub>M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra1">[2]</xref>. When α<sub>2</sub>M reacts with a proteinase, the so called “bait region” in each subunit is cleaved followed by the rupture of a β-cysteinyl γ-glutamyl thiolester accompanied by a large conformational change in the molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Feldman1">[3]</xref>. This exposes a receptor recognition site that is present in the carboxyl terminal domain of each subunit. Small nucleophiles such as methylamine or ammonia can directly rupture the thiolesters triggering a similar conformational change exposing the receptor recognition sites. These activated forms of α<sub>2</sub>M are designated α<sub>2</sub>M*. Although GRP78 (glucose regulated protein of M<sub>r</sub> ∼78,000) is primarily known as a resident endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, it appears on the cell surface of many types of malignant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra2">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra7">[9]</xref>. Binding of α<sub>2</sub>M* to tumor cell-surface GRP78 causes its autophosphorylation activating downstream pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling cascades including RAS/MAPK and PI 3-kinase/PDK1/Akt/mTORC1/mTORC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra2">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra11">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Activation of PI 3-kinase and subsequent production of PIP<sub>3</sub> is the major signaling event triggered by cell binding of growth factors and hormones. Our previous studies suggest that α<sub>2</sub>M* functions like a growth factor triggering PI 3-kinase activation and production of PIP<sub>3</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra2">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra8">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra10">[13]</xref>. Most of the physiological effects of PIP<sub>3</sub> in cells are mediated by AGC kinase family members that control cell proliferation, survival, and metabolic responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bayascas1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Biondi1">[19]</xref>. These include Akt (PKB) isoforms, S6-kinase (S6K), and PKC isoforms. PDK1 itself, a member of the AGC family, is the common upstream kinase phosphorylating and activating at least 23 AGC kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bayascas1">[15]</xref>. AGC kinases have a common mechanism of activation which involves the dual phosphorylation of two residues lying within two highly conserved motifs, the T-loop (Thr<sup>308</sup> for Akt1) and the hydrophobic motif (Ser<sup>473</sup> for Akt1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bayascas1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Biondi1">[19]</xref>. Phosphorylation of both is required for full activation of Akt. Phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> is indispensable for kinase activity whereas phosphorylation of Ser<sup>473</sup> enhances kinase activity by fivefold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Andjelkovi1">[20]</xref>. In the case of Akt, conformational change induced by PIP<sub>3</sub> binding to its PH domain promotes its phosphorylation by PDK1. PDK1 localizes at the plasma membrane through its COOH-terminal pH domain which binds to PIP<sub>3</sub> and facilitates the colocalization of Akt and PDK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bayascas1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Biondi1">[19]</xref>. In PDK1 mutants that cannot bind PIP<sub>3</sub>, Akt is not phosphorylated at Thr<sup>308</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-McManus1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bayascas2">[22]</xref>. Thus other mechanisms might operate to enable Akt and PDK1 to interact at the membrane including PDK1 binding to scaffolding components such as growth factor receptor-bound protein 14 (GRB14) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-KingCCNewton1">[23]</xref> or five repressor element under dual repression binding protein1 (FREUD1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Nakamura1">[24]</xref>. Lys<sup>63</sup> linked ubiquitylation of Akt by the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF6) ligase also facilitates its recruitment to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Yang1">[25]</xref>. The cellular distribution of PDK1 is dependent on distinct mechanisms including binding to soluble inositol phosphates that cause PDK1 localization in the cytosol, where many of its non-phosphoinositide-binding substrates reside <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Komander1">[26]</xref>. PDK1 also binds to mAKAPα forming a complex with ERK and RSK, which enables RSK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Michel1">[27]</xref>. PDK1 is observed in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Lim1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Other mechanistic studies have probed the role of the PIF-pocket in PDK1 activity. Activation of AGC kinases that do not possess a PH domain is triggered through phosphorylation of their hydrophobic (HF) motif by mTORC1, which promotes that interaction with a motif in the PDK1 catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bayascas1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Biondi1">[19]</xref>. PDK1 then phosphorylates the T-loop residues eliciting activation. Mutation of the PIF-pocket abolished activation of S6K and SGK1 isoforms but does not affect PDK1-mediated Akt<sup>308</sup> phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bayascas1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Biondi1">[19]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies using mutation of Ser<sup>473</sup> to alanine has no effect on phosphorylation of Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> and activation of Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Najafov1">[29]</xref>. The PDK1 inhibitor GSK2334470 inhibited T-loop phosphorylation of S6K and SGK, but was ineffective at suppressing Akt<sup>308</sup> phosphorylation and hence Akt activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Najafov2">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>mTOR plays an important role in cell metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Wang1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Yecies1">[35]</xref>. mTOR contains multiple HEAT repeats at the amino terminal half and a serine-threonine kinase domain in the carboxyl-terminal region, flanked by regulatory FAT and FATC regions. This structure provides the binding sites for multiple proteins that interact with mTOR, regulating its activity and subcellular localization. Scaffold proteins co-localize the molecules involved in the same signaling pathways and function as catalysts thereby activating different components in the signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Michel2">[36]</xref>. Post-translational modifications resulting from the activity of a kinase can facilitate interactions of the targeted molecule(s) with other proteins which enable to simultaneously localize two or more other proteins. Scaffold proteins are instrumental in ensuring specificity and efficiency in regulating positive and negative feedback loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Engstrm1">[37]</xref>. Activation of Akt via mTORC signaling is scaffold-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-BrachoValds1">[38]</xref>. The catalytically active mTOR subunit exists in two independent multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, with different regulatory properties and cellular activities. Assembly of these complexes is regulated by mTOR interacting proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Zoncu1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Yecies1">[35]</xref>. Some proteins interact constitutively with mTOR complexes, while others are transient partners regulated by phosphorylation or other factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Engstrm1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-BrachoValds1">[38]</xref>. The identity of mTORC1 and mTORC2 is defined by whether Raptor or Rictor, respectively are part of the complex. Raptor contains three HEAT repeats at the amino terminal domain and seven WD40 repeats in the carboxyl-terminal domain that recruit mTORC1 substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Hara1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recruiting PDK1 to muscle A kinase anchoring protein (mAKABα) facilitates activation and release of the downstream target RSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Michel2">[36]</xref>. Functions of PDK1 are also regulated by changes in its conformation, protein-protein interaction, and its subcellular localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bayascas1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Biondi1">[19]</xref>. Several proteins interact with PDK1 modulating its activity and subcellular localization as already noted above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Michel1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Michel2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Li1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Shen1">[43]</xref>. In addition to its function as a master kinase in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, PDK1 functions as an adaptor protein in several signaling events independent of its kinase activity such as enhancing the GEF activity of RalGDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Tian1">[44]</xref> and T-cell development by activating PKC and also acting as an adaptor in recruiting PKC and CARD11 to regulate IKK and NFκB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Lee1">[45]</xref>. Thus PDK1 may function in more diverse signaling pathways as a kinase, as a scaffold protein, and/or a kinase-independent regulatory protein. AKT is predominantly localized in cytoplasm and the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Feldman2">[46]</xref>. On growth factor stimulation a substantial translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane occurs. Recently studies demonstrate that mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Akt on Ser<sup>473</sup> takes place on the surface of the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Feldman2">[46]</xref>. Phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> and Ser<sup>473</sup> have been reported as either interdependent or independent of each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Feldman2">[46]</xref>, but in either case both PDK1 and mTORC2 must be in close spatial proximity for efficient phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr<sup>308</sup> and Ser<sup>473</sup>, respectively. Here we hypothesize that Raptor interacts physically with PDK1 in the mTORC1 signaling complex serving as a scaffolding protein which allows PDK1 to phosphorylate Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup>. We show that PDK1 co-immunoprecipitates with Raptor, and mTOR in α<sub>2</sub>M*-stimulated prostate cancer cells. Downregulation of Raptor or PDK1 by RNAi nearly abolishes α<sub>2</sub>M* -induced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup>. Immunodepletion of PDK1 or Raptor reduced Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> significantly. Addition of the supernatant of Raptor or PDK1 depleted cell lysates restored Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> phosphorylation. Thus, PIP<sub>3</sub> production is a necessary, but not sufficient event in activating Akt by phosphorylation at Thr<sup>308</sup>. Whether these results will apply to activation of other PH domain-containing AGC kinases by PDK1 remains to be determined, but seems likely.</p>

<title>Prostate cancer cell lines</title>
<p>We have used two human prostate cancer cell lines 1-LN and DU-145. The highly metastatic 1-LN cell line is derived from less metastatic PC-3 cells in nude mice and was a kind gift of Dr. Philip Walther (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-MisraUKPizzo1">[12]</xref>. DU-145 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in 6 or 12 well plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS 2 mM glutamine, 12.5 units/ml penicillin, 6.5 µg/ml streptomycin and 10 nM insulin (RPMI-S), in a humidified CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C. After reaching 90% confluency, the medium was aspirated and a fresh volume of RPMI-S medium and the cells were used for experiments described below.</p>

<title>Co-immunoprecipitation of PDK1 with Raptor and mTOR in prostate cancer cells stimulated with α<sub>2</sub>M*</title>
<p>Colocalization of interacting proteins has been widely studied by co-immunoprecipitation techniques. To test the hypothesis PDK1 is an interacting protein with Raptor in the mTOR signalosome, we first studied the colocalization of PDK1 with mTOR, and Raptor by co-immunoprecipitation in α<sub>2</sub>M*-stimulated cells. 1-LN cells were grown over night in RPMI-S media in 6 well plates (3×10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) at 37°C in a humidified CO<sub>2</sub> (5%) incubator. At about 90% confluency the medium was aspirated, cells washed 2x with cold HHBSS, a volume of RPMPI-S added and after 5 min of temperature equilibration; cells in respective were stimulated with either buffer or α<sub>2</sub>M* (50 pM/25 min) and incubated as above. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the media, and cells lysed in a volume of CHAPS lysis buffer B containing 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.3%, CHAPS and a Roche protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (1 tablet/10 ml) was added and cells lysed over ice for 15 min. The lysates were transferred to separate Eppendorf tubes, centrifuged (1000 rpm/5 min/4°C) and supernatants used for protein estimation and immunoprecipitation. Equal amounts of lysate proteins (200–250 µg) in separate experiments were used for immunoprecipitation with Raptor antibodies (1∶50, Santa Cruz Cat # SC81537). PDK1 antibodies (1∶50) and mTOR antibodies (1∶50) followed by the addition of 40 µl protein A agarose and contents incubated with rotation overnight at 4°C. Raptor, PDK1, mTOR immunoprecipitates were recovered by micro-centrifugation (2000 rpm/5 min/4°C) and washed twice with cold lysis buffer B. To each immunoprecipitate a volume of 4x sample buffer was added, tubes boiled for 5 min centrifuged, electrophoresed (4–20% or 10% acrylamide gels), transferred to Hybond-P membranes and the respective membranes immunoblotted with Raptor, PDK1, and mTOR antibodies. The protein bands on the membranes were visualized by ECF and STORM 860 Phosphorimager (GE Lifesciences). The specificity of antibodies employed here and in the experiments described below was determined by treating the cells with non-immunoantibodies and cell lysates processed as above under the experimental conditions, no reactivity of these controls was observed. The membranes were reprobed for protein-loading controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-MisraUKPizzo1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra12">[47]</xref>.

<title>The effect of silencing PDK1 or Raptor gene expression by RNAi on p-Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells stimulated with α<sub>2</sub>M*</title>
<p>In all the experiments described below, downregulation of PDK1 or Raptor expression was achieved by transfecting the cancer cells with the respective dsRNAs (100 nM/48 h). Downregulation of PDK1 or Raptor, as measured by Western blotting, was ∼65–70% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-MisraUKPizzo1">[12]</xref>. Prostate cancer cells grown overnight (1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/well 6 well plates) were treated as follows: (1) lipofectamine + buffer; (2) lipofectamine + α<sub>2</sub>M* (50 pM/25 min); (3) respective dsRNA (100 nM/48 h) then α<sub>2</sub>M* (50 pm/25 min); or (4) scrambled dsRNA (100 nM/48 h) then α<sub>2</sub>M*. We have used insulin (200 nM/15 min) as a positive control in these studies. The reactions were terminated by aspirating the medium, a volume of CHAPS lysis buffer added, cells lysed over ice for 15 min, centrifuged (1000 pm/5 min/4°C), supernatants transferred to new tubes and protein concentration determined. As desired, equal amounts of lysate proteins (200–250 µg) were immunoprecipitated with either anti-PDK1 or Raptor antibodies as described above. Phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> by PDK1 or Raptor immunoprecipitates was determined by kinase assays described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra4">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra5">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra7">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-MisraUKPizzo1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra12">[47]</xref>. Briefly, the respective immunoprecipitates were washed with CHAPS lysis buffer B, supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl; lysis buffer B and Tri•HCl (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and 1 mM benzamidine by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. To each immunoprecipitate 40 µl of kinase buffer containing 50 mM Tris•HCl (pH 7.5) 10 mM Mg Cl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine and 20 µg/ml leupeptin was added followed by the addition of 30 µM Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> kinase substrate (NH<sub>2</sub>-KTFCGTPEYLAPEVRR-COOH) to the respective tubes. The peptide (NH<sub>2</sub>- GGEEEELYFELVKKKK-COOH (ZAK2 peptide) served as the control. The reaction was initiated by adding 50 µM ATP and 5 µCi [<sup>33</sup>P]-γ-ATP in each tube and tubes incubated for 30 min at 30° in a shaking water bath. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 µl of 0.5 M EDTA in each tube.

<title>Determination of the effect of immunodepletion of Raptor and PDK1 in cell lysates of stimulated cells on Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> phosphorylation</title>
<p>In addition to down regulating the expression of Raptor and PDK1 respective by RNAis on α<sub>2</sub>M/insulin stimulated Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> phosphorylation by PDK1, we also studied the effect of immunodepleting Raptor and PDK1 on Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> phosphorylation. The 1-LN prostate cancer cells were grown and stimulated with α<sub>2</sub>M* (50 pM/25 min) or insulin (200 nM/15 min) as described above. The reaction was terminated by expirating the media and cells lysed in lysis buffer A containing 50 mM Tris•HCl (pH 7.5) 120 mM NaCl 0.1% NP40, 25 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine and leupeptin (10 µg/ml) as above. The lysates were centrifugated at 1000 rpm/5 min/4°C, supernatants collected and protein concentration determined. In separate experiments to deplete PDK1 and Raptor in cell lysates, to an equal amount of lysate protein was added anti-PDK1 or Raptor antibody and immunoprecipitation of PDK1 and Raptor was done as described above. Washed PDK1 and Raptor immunoprecipitates were used for the assay of Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> phosphorylation in absence or presence of cell lysates remaining after removal of PDK1 or Raptor, which was assessed by immunoblotting of PDK1 and Raptor and found to be negligible (data not shown).

<title>Raptor and PDK1 co-immunoprecipitate</title>
<p>Stimulation of 1-LN prostate cancer cells with α<sub>2</sub>M* causes a 2-3-fold increase in mTOR, Raptor, p-S6K, P-4EBP1, p-Akt<sup>Thr308</sup>, and p-Akt<sup>Ser473</sup> in a time and dose-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-MisraUKPizzo1">[12]</xref>.

<title>Inhibition of α<sub>2</sub>M*-induced Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> phosphorylation Raptor immunoprecipitates of prostate cancer cells transfected with dsRNA of PDK1 and Raptor, respectively</title>
<p>To further probe the proposed interaction of Raptor with PDK1 in the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> we silenced the expression of PDK1 or Raptor by RNAi and obtained Raptor immunoprecipitates from cells stimulated with α<sub>2</sub>M* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In prostate cancer cells transfected with PDK1 dsRNAi, PDK1 was reduced ∼65–70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and in cells transfected with Raptor dsRNA levels of Raptor were reduced by about the same degree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-MisraUKPizzo1">[12]</xref>. As expected, in prostate cancer cells stimulated with α<sub>2</sub>M*, silencing PDK1 gene expression significantly reduced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> as determined by Western blotting to detect p-Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> in cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These studies demonstrate that PDK1 is the Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> kinase. We have shown earlier that down regulation of Raptor by RNAi significantly reduced phosphorylation of S6K at Thr<sup>389</sup> and Thr<sup>229</sup> and 4EBP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-MisraUKPizzo1">[12]</xref>. S6K and 4EBP1 are direct down stream targets of mTORC1 which phosphorylates S6K at Thr<sup>389</sup> while PDK1 phosphorylates S6K at Thr<sup>229</sup>. Since down regulation of Raptor not only reduced phosphorylation of S6K at Thr<sup>389</sup> mediated by mTORC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-MisraUKPizzo1">[12]</xref>, but also phosphorylation of S6K at Thr<sup>229</sup> we suggest that Raptor plays a role in the kinase activity of PDK1. We thus next studied phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> by PDK1 employing kinase assays in Raptor immunoprecipitates of cells transfected Raptor RNAi and stimulated with α<sub>2</sub>M* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Silencing Raptor gene expression nearly abolished α<sub>2</sub>M*-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Thus co-immunoprecipitation studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and Raptor RNAi studies show that Raptor and PDK1 are interacting proteins in the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> and deficiency of either suppresses phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup>. Similar results were obtained on phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> in Raptor and PDK1 immunoprecipitates of 1-LN and DU-145 prostate cancer cells transfected with PDK1 and Raptor dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Insulin has been widely used to study mTOR signaling. We also compared the effect of down regulating PDK1 expression by RNAi on Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> phosphorylation in Raptor immunoprecipitates of 1-LN cells stimulated with insulin as well as α<sub>2</sub>M* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We show that stimulation of cells with insulin yielded comparable results. Prolonged activation of mTORC1 causes feedback inhibition of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling. However, in this study we employed 20 min incubation in all experiments. In this short time period it is unlikely that feedback inhibition of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling would occur and affect Akt<sup>T308</sup> phosphorylation by PDK1. Since Raptor does not possess kinase activity, Raptor and PDK1 immunoprecipitates of cell lysates should demonstrate the same ability to phosphorylate Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> as is found in the current study. These studies further support our hypothesis that Raptor in the mTORC1 complex is required for PDK1-mediated T-loop phosphorylation of Akt and suggest that like mTORC2, mTORC1 complex also participates in Akt activation.</p>

<title>Suppression of phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> in prostate cancer cells stimulated with α<sub>2</sub>M* and cell lysates immunodepleted of Raptor or PDK1, respectively</title>
<p>To further analyze the requirement of Raptor in Akt phosphorylation at Thr<sup>308</sup> by PDK1, we immunodepleted α<sub>2</sub>M*-stimulated 1-LN cell lysates of Raptor with anti-Raptor or PDK1 antibodies. We measured phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> by kinase assay in Raptor or PDK1 immunoprecipitate in absence or in presence of cell lysates depleted of Raptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) or PDK1 of cells stimulated with α<sub>2</sub>M* or insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

Addition of Raptor-depleted lysates to the reaction mixture resulted in several fold increase in Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This is largely because of PDK1 remaining in the Raptor-depleted cell lysates. Similar results were obtained in cells depleted of PDK1.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PDK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates members of the conserved AGC kinase family including Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> and is implicated in critical cellular processes including survival, metabolism, and tumorigenesis. Activation of PDK1 in cancer through genomic or epigenetic changes is often associated with more aggressive tumors and poor prognosis.</p>
<p>Activated α<sub>2</sub>M* binds to cell surface GRP78 and activates downstream pro-proliferative and anti-apoptosis signaling cascades including RAS/MAPK, PI 3-kinase, PDK1, Akt and mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra2">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra11">[14]</xref>.

Silencing Raptor or mTOR expression by RNAi equally decreases phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1, the direct downstream targets of mTORC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Kim1">[54]</xref>. Actively dividing cells transfected with Raptor RNAi show reductions in cell size and decreased S6K phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Kim1">[54]</xref>. Since Raptor is without any enzyme activity, Raptor appears to modulate mTORC1 function by serving as a platform for mTORC1 activity. The assembly of proteins into multiprotein complexes is an important mechanism that allows cells to carryout diverse functions that the individual proteins of the complex could not perform on their own. Using co-immunoprecipitation techniques it has been shown that Raptor forms a multiprotein complex of 4EBP1, S6K, mTOR, HERT, Akt and HSP90 in DU-145 cells and thereby it regulates telomerase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Sundin1">[55]</xref>. Akt co-exists with ERK1/2 in a multiprotein complex containing PDK1 and RSK in MK-PT cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Sinha1">[56]</xref>. TFII-I also is a binding partner of Akt in Neuro 2A cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Huang1">[57]</xref>. PDK1 is upstream of mTORC1-Raptor. PDK1 plays important role in the regulation of cellular responses in multiple organs by mediating PI 3-kinase signaling pathways through activating AGC kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bayascas1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Biondi1">[19]</xref>. PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> does not occur in either PDK1 null mice embryonic stem cells or tissue specific PDK1-knockdown mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Pearce1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Komander1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Mora2">[50]</xref>. Knockdown of PDK1 in pancreatic β cell in mice results in progressive hyperglycemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Okamoto1">[52]</xref>. In endothelial cell like Raptor, PDK1 maintains glucose homeostasis. Like Raptor, PDK1 knockout mice are embryonic lethal. Knock-in mice expressing a mutant of PDK1 incapable of binding to phosphoinositide were significantly smaller, insulin resistant, and hyperglycemic. Phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> in these mice was markedly reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bayascas2">[22]</xref>. The cellular responses elicited in Raptor and PDK1 deficient mice are quite similar. PDK1 is upstream of Raptor-mTORC1, therefore it is very likely Raptor plays an important role in PDK1-mediated signaling network.</p>
<p>Regulation of PDK1 activity occurs by several mechanisms including post-translational phosphorylation, which induces conformational changes stabilizing the protein, serving as anchors with respect to interaction with other proteins, or regulating the intracellular targeting of PDK1 to specific compartments such as cytoplasm, plasma membrane or the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bayascas1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Biondi1">[19]</xref>. PDK1 is constitutively active. However, PDK1 is activated in membrane rafts in response to growth factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Gao1">[58]</xref>. PDK1 exists as a dimer in cells and phosphorylation of the pH domain residue Thr<sup>513</sup> regulates PH domain dimer-monomer equilibrium thereby converting an inactive dimer to an active monomer. Membrane bound PDK1, self-activates via autophosphorylation resulting in phosphorylation of the activation loop residue Ser<sup>241</sup> and of PH domain residues Ser<sup>410</sup> and Thr<sup>513</sup>. Subsequently, the active PDK1 kinase can phosphoactivate plasma membrane targets or can dissociate from membrane and phosphorylate cytoplasmic targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Masters1">[59]</xref>. Dimerization of PDK1 may be due to the differential regulation of various pools of cytosolic PDK1. It is likely that active PDK1 monomers which dissociated from the plasma membrane may bind to Raptor and phosphorylate Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Ziemba1">[60]</xref>. Polyphosphoinositide PI (3,5) P2 is required for full activation and localization of mTORC1 by insulin and amino acids due to its interaction with WD40 domain of Raptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Bridges1">[61]</xref>.</p>
<p>The PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, inhibits phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> in mTOR immunoprecipitates of prostate cancer cells stimulated with α<sub>2</sub>M* <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-MisraUKPizzo1">[12]</xref>. Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> phosphorylation, therefore, is PIP<sub>3</sub>-dependent and should take place at the plasma membrane. We do not understand the precise mechanistic and subcellular location of Raptor-mediated phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> reported here. PDK1 in unstimulated cells is mostly cytosolic in occurrence, but stimulation with growth factors causes translocates to plasma membranes. PDK1 also may translocate to nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Kikani1">[62]</xref>. Akt is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and ER. After growth factor stimulation, a substantial translocation of Akt occurs. mTOR and Raptor are predominantly located in the ER and Golgi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Rosner1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Boulbs1">[64]</xref>. Recently studies demonstrate that mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Akt<sup>S473</sup> occurs on the surface of the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Boulbs1">[64]</xref>. Phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> and Ser<sup>473</sup> have been reported to be both interdependent or independent of each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Feldman2">[46]</xref>, but in either case both PDK1 and mTORC2 must be in close spatial proximity for efficient phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr<sup>308</sup> and Ser<sup>473</sup>, respectively. This view is substantiated by the presence of both p-Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> and p-Akt<sup>Ser473</sup> in Raptor immunoprecipitates of 1-LN cells stimulated with α<sub>2</sub>M* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088373-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We have recently demonstrated that in prostate cancer cells treated with a cAMP analogue, Raptor is a co-factor for PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Akt at Thr<sup>308</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Misra13">[65]</xref>. In this previous report, however, we did not study cell surface ligation by a characterized ligand to determine whether in receptor-mediated activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway, Raptor performs such a function.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in this study we employ co-immunoprecipitation, RNAi, and immunodepletion techniques to demonstrate that PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of Akt<sup>Thr308</sup> requires Raptor as a scaffold or co-factor in addition to the requirement for phosphoinositide participation in Akt activation. Thus PIP<sub>3</sub> generation is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement in PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Akt<sup>Thr308</sup>. A recent study suggests that physical association of PDK1 with Akt1 is sufficient for Akt phosphorylation in the T-loop, which is independent of PIP<sub>3</sub>/PIP<sub>2</sub> induced plasma membrane translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Ding1">[66]</xref>. Raptor is a cofactor in the mTORC1 complex without enzymatic activity, but studies suggest that it modulates mTORC1 activity and downstream signaling consequent to its direct/indirect phosphorylation by ERK1, ERK1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Carriere1">[67]</xref>, AMP-activated protein kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Gwinn1">[68]</xref>, and RSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0088373-Carriere2">[69]</xref>, respectively. Raptor may possibly modulate mTORC1 activity and downstream signaling by inducing conformational changes in mTORC1 and its interacting partners. Thus it would be reasonable to deduce that interaction of Raptor and PDK1 modulates T-loop phosphorylation of Akt1. These studies suggest that targeting Raptor may offer a promising approach for cancer therapeutics.
