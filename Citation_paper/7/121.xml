<title>Background</title>
<p>Current pathological diagnostics include the analysis of (epi-)genetic alterations as well as oncogenic pathways. Deregulated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling has been implicated in a variety of cancers including malignant gliomas and is considered a promising target in cancer treatment. Monitoring of mTORC1 activity before and during inhibitor therapy is essential. The aim of our study is to provide a recommendation and report on pitfalls in the use of phospho-specific antibodies against mTORC1-targets phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236; Ser240/244) and phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded material.</p>

<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods and Findings</title>
<p>Primary, established cell lines and brain tumor tissue from routine diagnostics were assessed by immunocyto-, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescent stainings and immunoblotting. For validation of results, immunoblotting experiments were performed. mTORC-pathway activation was pharmacologically inhibited by torin2 and rapamycin. Torin2 treatment led to a strong reduction of signal intensity and frequency of all tested antibodies. In contrast phospho-4EBP1 did not show considerable reduction in staining intensity after rapamycin treatment, while immunocytochemistry with both phospho-RPS6-specific antibodies showed a reduced signal compared to controls. Staining intensity of both phospho-RPS6-specific antibodies did not show considerable decrease in stability in a timeline from 0–230 minutes without tissue fixation, however we observed a strong decrease of staining intensity in phospho-4EBP1 after 30 minutes. Detection of phospho-signals was strongly dependent on tissue size and fixation gradient. mTORC1-signaling was significantly induced in glioblastomas although not restricted to cancer cells but also detectable in non-neoplastic cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While classical chemotherapeutic drugs are still the major backbone in cancer treatment, more and more targeted therapies enter clinical application. The concept of targeted therapy aims at interfering with individual key oncogenic drivers that can be exploited as specific drug targets. In cancer, few major oncogenic signaling pathways have been identified. One of these pathways is regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 functions as a protein kinase that controls protein biosynthesis thereby contributing to cell growth. Its activity is regulated by various stimuli (<xref rid="pone.0127123.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>)—activators include nutrient redundancy as well as signaling from growth factor receptors which causes an Akt-mediated relief of hamartin/tuberin (TSC1/2)-mediated mTORC1 inhibition. TSC1/2 are known tumor suppressors, loss of function mutations in these genes cause tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a fairly frequent tumor syndrome that includes the development of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>

<title>Overview of essential intracellular members of the mTORC1-pathway and respective targeted therapies.</title>
<p>Signaling from growth factor receptors such as EGFR or a nutrient rich environment leads to an activation of the mTOR-pathway, while nutrient depletion inhibits signaling. The mTORC1-complex consists of the mTOR-protein itself and the subunits raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR), mLST8 (mammalian lethal with sec thirteen 8) and PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt1 substrate 1). Activation of the pathway leads to phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 at phospho-sites Ser235/236 and Ser240/244 by the S6-kinase (S6K). Additionally, the translational repressor 4EBP1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein-1) is phosporylated at Thr37/Thr46, thereby relieving its translational inhibition and promoting translation especially of mRNAs with a TOP motif [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. First generation mTORC1-inhibitors are rapamycin and its derivatives temsirolimus and everolimus. Mechanistically these compounds bind the intracellular adaptor protein FKBP12 to form an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitory complex. 4EBP1 phosphorylation though mTORC1-dependent is largely resistant to the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin and its derivatives. Recently, ATP-competitive mTORC (2<sup>nd</sup> generation) inhibitors like torin1 and torin2 which are efficient in dephosphorylating 4EBP1 have been developed [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>

<p>Classical allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1 signaling derive from rapamycin, a drug isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus with fungicidal activity [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which has later been shown to act as an immunosuppressive and antitumor drug [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Clinical development focuses on the rapamycin derivatives everolimus (RAD-001) and temsirolimus (CCI-779) with improved pharmacokinetics that have been approved for some cancer entities including SEGAs (in the U.S.A), renal cell carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Allosteric mTORC1 inhibitors rely on the intracellular adaptor protein FKBP12 for their action (<xref rid="pone.0127123.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). So called 2nd generation mTORC1-inhibitors are characterized by their ability to interfere with the ATP-binding motif of the mTOR-protein in a competitive manner to inhibit signaling from both mTOR complexes (mTORC1&amp;2) as described for the potent mTORC-inhibitor torin2 [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While mTORC1 signaling is considered an important oncogenic pathway in gliomas, first clinical trials in glioblastoma (GBM) patients with rapamycin or its derivatives as monotherapy were rather sobering [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several reasons have been discussed and include insufficient target inhibition or primary resistance by activation of alternative signaling pathways. These challenges are met by the design and clinical testing of 2nd generation mTORC1 inhibitors and the quest for patient subgroups that benefit from mTORC1 inhibitor treatment indicating a potential need for predictive biomarkers and/or appropriate combinatorial treatments. Therefore, accurate monitoring of mTORC1 activity before and during mTORC1 inhibitor therapy is instrumental to pave the way of these drugs into the clinic. Currently, the large number of ongoing trials targeting the mTOR-pathway with mono- or combinatorial therapies in brain tumor patients highlights the biological relevance of mTOR and the hope that lies on its pathway’s inhibition (<xref rid="pone.0127123.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of selected clinical trials in brain tumor patients). Most of these clinical trials, however, do not explicitly point to the inclusion of biomarkers, and neglect a pre-screening to measure the extent of mTORC1 activation within the tumors of each individual tumor patient. Nevertheless, there is rising evidence that the mTOR-signaling pathway especially in case of recurrent GBM plays an important role in tumor relapse, as a recent study demonstrated a high rate of mutations of members of the mTOR-pathway after temozolomide treatment [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, not just in these patients in vivo testing of mTOR-signaling activity is strongly needed to generate a rationale for mTOR-targeted therapy.</p>

<p>The two best characterized phosphorylation targets of mTORC1 are 4EBP1 and S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). S6K1 phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) which is an essential component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. RPS6 phosphorylation influences cell growth and progresses in an ordered sequential fashion starting with Ser236 followed by Ser235, Ser240, and Ser244 [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While Ser240/244 phosphorylation is undetectable in S6 kinase knockout mice, Ser235/236 phosphorylation still occurs, most likely mediated by p90RSK in a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent fashion [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The molecular consequences of RPS6 phosphorylation are still the subject of ongoing research, so far no data about differential effects with regard to the phosphorylation sites of RPS6 (Ser235/236 vs. Ser 240/244) are available. 4EBP1 is a translational regulator and functions by sequestering eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) from the translation initiation machinery. Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 also occurs in an ordered fashion [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thr70 is phosphorylated first, followed by Thr37/46 and by Ser65. While Thr70 phosphorylation has no effect on 4EBP1 binding of eIF4E, it is the Thr37/46 phosphorylation that relieves its inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. mTORC1-mediated Thr37/46 phosphorylation of 4EBP1 seems to be largely resistant to allosteric mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin and its derivatives temsirolimus and everolimus.</p>
<p>In summary, phospho-4EBP1 as well as phospho-RPS6 are potentially suitable biomarkers for mTORC1-signaling in routine diagnostics.</p>
<p>Studies trying to identify patient subgroups which might profit from a targeted therapy by phospho-specific IHC have already been performed in different tumor subtypes [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], however, up to now none of these markers entered routine histo- or neuropathological diagnostics. Especially in case of GBM this might be related to the negative results of some clinical studies, which did not confirm a prognostic or even predictive role of the tested phospho-signals [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the detection of phosphoproteins in FFPE tissue is strongly dependent on the grade of dephosphorylation, as demonstrated for phospho-AKT, therefore reliable detection of phospho-signals in routinely collected specimens constitutes a great challenge for (neuro-)pathologists [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
<p>We hypothesize that mTORC1-signaling is detectable and upregulated in FFPE tissue specimens deriving from malignant brain tumors, while its detection might strongly depend on tissue processing including fixation time and tissue size. Additionally, we hypothesize that mTORC1-signaling is induced during tumor progression in glioma patients. Furthermore, as mTORC1-complex activation can be demonstrated by distinct phosphorylation sites of 4EBP1 and RPS6, we were asking which phosphorylation sites might be most reliable as biomarkers for mTORC1-activation for (I) pre-treatment patient stratification or (II) therapy monitoring.</p>
<p>In summary, we here present pitfalls and provide a recommendation for immunohistochemical assessment of mTORC1 signaling using phospho-specific antibodies against phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236), phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244), phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) in routine FFPE brain tumor specimens.</p>

<title>Tissue specimen and tissue processing</title>
<p>We analyzed FFPE tissue from archived brain tumors derived from the UCT tumor bank (Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, member of the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany). The use of patient material for this study was endorsed by the local ethics committee (Ethics committee UCT Frankfurt / Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Germany: project numbers: GS 4/09; SNO_01–12, GS 4/09; SNO-06-2014). All specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (formalin) including 3 samples of subependymal giant cell astocytomas. Besides whole mount sections of malignant brain tumors such as glioblastomas and brain metastases, We analyzed primary and secondary brain tumors spotted as tissue micro arrays (TMAs) into paraffin blocks, including brain metastases of: melanoma (n = 3), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC n = 5), breast carcinoma (n = 2), small cell lung cancer (SCLC n = 2), Colorectal carcinoma (n = 1). Primary malignant brain tumors: Anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 2), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (n = 3), medulloblastoma (n = 2), glioblastoma (n = 11). For statistical analyses we analysed FFPE TMAs of brain tumor patients (n = 15) which had a relapse during their clinical course and underwent tumor progression (<xref rid="pone.0127123.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Tissue included the following specimens: normal appearing grey matter (NAGM) tissue of surgical specimens (n = 7), diffuse astrocytomas (n = 4), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 7), anaplastic oligo-astrocytoma (n = 4), glioblastoma (GBM) (n = 15).</p>

Withdrawal of serum led to a considerable reduction of signal intensity and frequency in cultured tumor cells. To prove that the detected signal was dependent on mTOR-signaling, we used cells exposed to the specific inhibitors rapamycin and torin2 as controls. While the treatment of LNT-229 cells with torin2 almost led to eradication of the ICC signal, we observed a reduction of specific staining in rapamycin-treated cells only with the antibodies against phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236) and phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244) (Fig <xref rid="pone.0127123.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127123.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).

<p>4EBP1 phosphorylation states are associated with different states of electrophoretic mobility [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The biologically relevant Thr37/46 phosphorylation, however, is detectable in all mobility states. When cells are cultured in the presence of 10% FCS 4EBP1 is present in states of reduced electrophoretic mobility (slower migrating bands). Serum withdrawal increases the amount of higher mobility states (faster migrating bands), rapamycin in contrast to torin2 has only little effect in reducing 4EBP1 in its slower migrating states (<xref rid="pone.0127123.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). RPS6 protein amount is slightly increased when cells are cultured in medium containing 10% FCS. mTOR inhibitor treatment has no effect on the RPS6 protein amount (<xref rid="pone.0127123.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are known to depend on mTORC1-signaling, therefore archived tissue derived from SEGAs served as a positive control for the in vivo detection of phospho-specific IHC signal (<xref rid="pone.0127123.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). We detected a strong staining in tumor cells with all tested antibodies, while especially perivascular cells and most endothelial cells did not show any staining. No obvious staining gradient was detectable. To assess whether the age of the FFPE-tissue might be relevant for detection of mTORC1-induced phospho-signals we analyzed SEGAs resected in 2007, 2006 and 2004 (<xref rid="pone.0127123.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). The staining intensity with the antibodies against phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236) and phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244) was considerably reduced especially in case of the 10 year old block deriving from surgical material from 2004. Total protein level detection of 4EBP1 and RPS6 also showed a considerable reduction in case of the 10 year old block (<xref rid="pone.0127123.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

Exemplarily, we analyzed tumor specimens from malignant primary brain tumors such as GBMs and secondary brain tumors i.e. brain metastases. A heterogeneous expression pattern was observed throughout the different specimens. Besides strong signals in pleomorphic tumor cells of carcinomas and GBMs we also observed strong expression in medium-sized mononuclear cells in perivascular areas, in smaller, rod-like cells as well as in endothelial cells.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The establishment of biomarkers reflecting individual oncogenic driver genes or proteins is of paramount importance in modern pathological diagnostics as well as oncological translational research and treatment. The mTOR-pathway is considered a promising candidate for targeted therapies because its relevance and activation has been demonstrated in a variety of cancers and specific inhibitors that have been tested in humans are readily available [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. So far, potential biomarkers for mTORC1-signaling are RPS6 as well as 4EBP1. With regard to RPS6 and its phosphorylation at different sites, we included antibodies targeting both phosphorylations at the Ser235/236 and the Ser240/244 sites in our study. With regard to 4EBP1 we included the Thr37/46 phosphorylation site as this site phosphorylation interferes with the biological activity of 4EBP1 (i.e. binding of eIF4E) <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We found that phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236), phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244) and phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) can be strongly detected in SEGAs as well as in malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Therefore these phosphoproteins represent potential candidates for predictive biomarkers or indicators of therapy response after mTORC1-targeted therapy. However, the use of phospho-specific antibodies for mTORC1 pathway components in routine diagnostics harbors the danger of several unique pitfalls. Here we provide a recommendation for a standardized approach to reduce misinterpretation of results.</p>

<title>Suitability of phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236), phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244) and phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) as mTORC1 biomarkers in FFPE tissue</title>
<p>We were able to show, that phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236) and phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244) staining intensities were reduced after rapamycin treatment and therefore both markers might serve as suitable biomarkers to detect an inhibition of mTORC1-signaling after rapamycin treatment in FFPE material. In contrast, we did not find a reduction of phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) signals upon rapamycin treatment in FFPE material. Thus, phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) is not suited to indicate activation of sensitive signaling or to monitor effective target inhibition for 1<sup>st</sup> generation mTORC1 inhibitor therapy. In line with these findings, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments using myotubes showed the absence of an effect on phosphorylation of 4EBP1 after rapamycin treatment [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Future therapy strategies might include newly designed second generation mTORC1-inhibitors such as torin2, which are ATP-competitive and work independent of FKBP12 [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These inhibitors exceed classical competitive mTORC1 inhibitors in their therapeutic potential most markedly indicated by the degree of 4EBP1 dephosphorylation. Accordingly, we were able to show an almost complete reduction in the amount of phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) as well as reduced signal intensity for phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236) and phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244) in FFPE material after torin2 treatment. So far, there is no active clinical trial involving torin2, however <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results using several cancer cell lines gave promising results [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

<title>Time to formalin fixation as a limiting factor for the detection of phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236), phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244) and phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46)</title>
<p>Ideally, surgical specimens for neuropathological diagnostics are immediately fixed in formalin in the operation theatre. Sometimes, however, fixation of the removed tissue is delayed. In surgical pathology the fresh tissue specimen frequently undergoes a macroscopical analysis by the pathologist, which sometimes might take more than 30 minutes after removal of the specimen. We found that cell pellets of glioma cell lines showed a reduction of phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) signal already after 30 minutes at room temperature without media. In contrast, the staining signal for both antibodies against phospho-RPS6 remained stable over 60 minutes in cell pellets and even within all tested intervals up to 230 minutes after removal of the surgical specimens. The strong reduction of phospho-4EBP1 staining signal is most likely due to early dephosphorylation events in the tissue, because total protein counterparts of RPS6 and 4EBP1 remained stable throughout the tested timeline. In general, this might be strongly dependent on (I) the investigated protein, (II) tissue temperature and (III) tissue type due to organ-specific fixative diffusion [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, we recommend an immediate fixation of tissue, and if this is not possible tissue should be stored on ice to reduce potential phosphatase activity. When storing the specimen on ice one should take care that the specimen does not freeze which might lead to morphological misinterpretations due to freezing artifacts.</p>

<title>Tissue size is associated with a gradual reduction of phospho-signals for all tested antibodies</title>
<p>Fixation of tissue in formalin is a routine procedure successfully practiced since decades in (neuro-)pathology. However, although antibodies against routine antigens, e.g. against intermediate filaments GFAP or cytokeratins, are very robust in detecting their target in FFPE tissue, the time of penetration into the tissue of the fixative as well as the size of the tissue are crucial for successful detection of phospho-signals in FFPE material. We showed that larger pieces of tissue displayed a strong gradual reduction of staining intensity from the tissue border to the center and in addition we were able to show a strong reduction of staining intensity for all tested phospho-specific antibodies beyond 2 mm in a cell pellet generated from LNT-229 glioma cells, also here we observed a stable expression without a gradient for the RPS6 and 4EBP1 total proteins. These observations underline the importance for the use of defined tissue size to obtain homogenous staining results especially for phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236), phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244) and phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46). 4% formalin is known to penetrate 2–4 mm per 24 h into tissue [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], therefore a representative tissue sample should be cut not exceeding 4 mm in thickness before fixation with formalin. Best results showing almost no staining gradients derive from stereotactic brain biopsies which often do not exceed 2 mm in thickness (not shown). A decreasing phospho-staining gradient towards the tissue center indicates a potential underestimation of the actual degree of mTORC1 signaling and should therefore be taken into account whenever phospho-site specific stainings are evaluated. On the other hand a homogenous staining pattern across our mTORC1-antibody panel indicates adequate tissue processing.</p>

<title>mTORC1 activity is not only detectable in the tumor cells but also in endothelial and immune cell subsets</title>
<p>Many targeted therapies are directed against oncogenic pathways, that are active in neoplastic cells, as for instance EGFR-, MET- or sonic hedgehog (shh)–signaling. This implies that the oncogenic signaling is exclusively active in neoplastic cells. Here, we showed that enhanced mTORC1-activity is also found in endothelial cells as well as in tumor-associated microglial/macrophages, especially in primary brain tumors such as GBMs. mTOR-activity has been described not only in the context of oncogenic signaling but has also been observed in reactive brain tissue especially in astrocytes and microglia after traumatic brain injuries [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and stroke [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], while in case of glioma-activated microglia mTOR-inhibition polarized microglia to a M1-phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0127123.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These aspects are of major importance when considering mTOR-activity as a biomarker for neoplastic cells. So far, it is not clear whether mTOR-targeted therapy additionally modulates the microenvironment through inhibiting angiogenesis or modifying polarization of microglial cells towards a tumor-inhibiting M1-phenotype in humans. The analysis of mTORC1-activity in patient tissue should be performed with caution since a high number of tumors also show strong expression of phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236), phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244) and phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) on non-neoplastic cells in CNS tumors. The exact distribution of mTORC1-signaling in different primary as well as secondary brain tumors as well as the functional role of mTORC1-signaling in non-neoplastic cells strongly needs further investigation.</p>

<title>mTORC1 activity as a potential marker for tumor progression in glioma patients</title>
<p>So far, mTOR-targeted therapies are not in clinical use for first line therapy in glioma patients, nevertheless in case of tumor relapse or progression mTOR-targeted therapy regimens might become important therapeutic options. Therefore we investigated glioma patients who had a grade II or grade III glioma as a primary tumor to test whether mTORC1 signaling was induced during tumor progression to GBM. Our results show an induction of mTORC1-signaling in GBM specimens as compared to normal brain specimens. During the progression course from grade II or grade III to grade IV (GBM) we found a strong trend for mTORC1-signaling induction, which supports the notion of mTORC1-activation as a driver for tumor progression. Nevertheless further studies are needed to examine the role of mTORC1-signaling in response to therapeutic interventions such as radio- and chemotherapy especially in GBM patients.</p>
<p>Target expression and relevance besides sufficient pharmacokinetics are a prerequisite for a successful targeted therapy. We found that the mTOR-pathway was activated in both human low grade brain tumors such as SEGAs, diffuse gliomas and malignant primary and secondary brain tumors. mTORC1 signaling is widely considered a relevant oncogenic pathway. Therefore mTOR-targeted therapies might be a useful strategy for brain tumor patients. Immunohistochemical stainings with antibodies against phospho-proteins phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236), phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244) and phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) are suitable indicators for mTORC1-activity, however we recommend to follow our suggestions for tissue processing.</p>
<p>Finally only a panel of phospho-specific antibodies against phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236), phospho-RPS6 (Ser240/244) and phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) is adequate to gain reliable insights in mTORC1-activity in routine FFPE surgical specimens, especially when retrospectively or prospectively analyzing material of clinical trials.</p>
