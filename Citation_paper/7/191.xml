<abstract>
<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is transmitted between hepatocytes via classical cell entry but also uses direct cell-cell transfer to infect neighboring hepatocytes. Viral cell-cell transmission has been shown to play an important role in viral persistence allowing evasion from neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, the role of HCV cell-cell transmission for antiviral resistance is unknown. Aiming to address this question we investigated the phenotype of HCV strains exhibiting resistance to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in state-of-the-art model systems for cell-cell transmission and spread. Using HCV genotype 2 as a model virus, we show that cell-cell transmission is the main route of viral spread of DAA-resistant HCV. Cell-cell transmission of DAA-resistant viruses results in viral persistence and thus hampers viral eradication. We also show that blocking cell-cell transmission using host-targeting entry inhibitors (HTEIs) was highly effective in inhibiting viral dissemination of resistant genotype 2 viruses. Combining HTEIs with DAAs prevented antiviral resistance and led to rapid elimination of the virus in cell culture model. In conclusion, our work provides evidence that cell-cell transmission plays an important role in dissemination and maintenance of resistant variants in cell culture models. Blocking virus cell-cell transmission prevents emergence of drug resistance in persistent viral infection including resistance to HCV DAAs.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In spite of the rapid development of antiviral agents, antiviral resistance remains a challenge for the treatment of viral infections including hepatitis B and C virus (HBV, HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza. Virus spreads from infected cells to surrounding uninfected host cells to develop infection through cell-free and cell-cell transmission routes. Understanding the spread of resistant virus is important for the development of novel antiviral strategies to prevent and treat antiviral resistance. Here, we characterize the spread of resistant viruses and its impact for emergence and prevention of resistance using HCV as a model system. Our results show that cell-cell transmission is the main transmission route for antiviral resistant HCV strains and is crucial for the maintenance of infection. Monoclonal antibodies or small molecules targeting HCV entry factors are effective in inhibiting the spread of resistant HCV in cell culture models and thus should be evaluated clinically for prevention and treatment of HCV resistance. Combination of inhibitors targeting viral entry and clinically used direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) prevents antiviral resistance and leads to viral eradication in cell culture models. Collectively, the investigation provides a new strategy for prevention of viral resistance to antiviral agents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is accumulating evidence that viruses use different routes for transmission and spread in infected tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zhong1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Sattentau1">[2]</xref>. A well-characterized example is hepatitis C virus (HCV) that is transmitted between hepatocytes via classical cell entry using cell-free diffusion but also uses direct cell-cell transfer to infect neighboring cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Meredith1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Timpe1">[4]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

<title>Cell culture model systems for analysis of HCV dissemination and cell-cell transmission.</title>
<p>(A) Transmission pathways of HCV. HCV can disseminate through two routes of transmission: cell-free entry and cell-cell transmission. Cell-free entry is the classical pathway for initiation of HCV infection and requires a well-defined panel of host entry factors including SR-BI, CD81, CLDN1, OCLN and the EGFR signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lupberger1">[6]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Catanese1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Brimacombe1">[12]</xref>. Cell-free entry does not require cell-cell contact and is efficiently inhibited by neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Cell-cell transmission requires direct cell-cell contact and is resistant to nAbs present in HCV-infected patients. Cell-cell transmission is considered to play a key role for viral spread and maintenance of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Timpe1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Jones1">[31]</xref>. (B) HCV spread and dissemination assay. The HCV spread assay monitors viral spread in cell cultures using a low number of Huh7.5.1 cells containing replicating HCVcc, which expand over a time period of 14 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lupberger1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zahid1">[8]</xref>. In the absence of nAb or presence of control antibody the virus is transmitted by cell-cell and cell-free spread (upper panel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lupberger1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zahid1">[8]</xref>). Cell-free transmission can be blocked by anti-HCV nAbs allowing to study viral spread mediated by cell-cell transmission only (lower panel). (C) HCV cell-cell transmission assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lupberger1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zona1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Witteveldt1">[11]</xref>. The cell-cell transmission assay allows the investigation of cell-cell transmission and its inhibition by HTEIs. In this assay HCV<sup>+</sup> Huh7.5.1 producer cells containing replicating HCVcc (stained by an anti-NS5A antibody and indicated in red) are co-cultured with HCV<sup>−</sup> Huh7.5 GFP target cells (indicated in green) for 24 h in the presence of nAb blocking cell-free transmission. Flow cytometry is used to quantitate infected HCV<sup>+</sup> Huh7.5 GFP target cells (indicated by red and green), which are infected via cell-cell transmission and stained with anti-NS5A antibody.</p>

<p>Several host factors involved in cell-free viral entry have also been shown to contribute to cell-cell transmission. These include scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), CD81, tight junction proteins claudin-1 (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN) as well as host cell kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its signal transducer HRas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lupberger1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Brimacombe1">[12]</xref>. HCV envelope glycoproteins are also essential for this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Witteveldt1">[11]</xref>. However, whereas the majority of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the viral envelope fails to inhibit cell-cell transmission, several host-targeting entry inhibitors (HTEIs) have been shown to inhibit HCV cell-cell transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lupberger1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Brimacombe1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Antiviral resistance remains a major challenge for the treatment of chronic viral infections including HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza infection. Antiviral resistance to nucleos(t)ide analogs is a major cause of treatment failure in chronic HBV-infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Kwon1">[13]</xref>. Although the combination of antiretroviral drugs has markedly improved the effective control of the progression of HIV disease, the emergence of multidrug-resistant viruses still threatens their long-term efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Trono1">[14]</xref>. The recent introduction of a first-generation protease inhibitor to pegylated interferon-alfa/ribavirin (PEG-IFN-α/RBV) therapy has improved the outcome for HCV genotype 1-infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-McHutchison1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Poordad1">[16]</xref>, but a main limitation of these direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is their low genetic barrier for resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Rong1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lange1">[18]</xref>. Next generation viral protease inhibitors, NS5A and polymerase inhibitors are currently being evaluated in combination with PEG-IFN-α or other DAAs in IFN-free regimens, with or without RBV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Pawlotsky1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Liang1">[26]</xref> with sofosbuvir and simeprevir having received FDA approval. Although newly developed DAAs are very effective in the majority of previously untreated patients, antiviral resistance as well as differences in virological outcomes for different genotypes and subtypes have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Poordad2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Soriano1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Gottwein1">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, a significant number of patients with advanced liver disease and who are null or partial responders to previous therapy still do not achieve a sustained virological response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lange1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Jacobson1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Liang1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Hezode1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>The functional role of cell-cell transmission and spread in the emergence of antiviral resistance is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the role of cell-cell transmission in antiviral resistance using HCV genotype 2 infection as a model, and to explore cell-cell transmission as a target to prevent and treat DAA-resistance.</p>

<title>Cell-cell spread is the main route for transmission and dissemination of DAA-resistant viruses</title>
<p>The spread of DAA-resistant viruses has an important impact for the development of antiviral resistance, leading to viral breakthrough and treatment failure. However, the role of viral cell-cell transmission and spread for resistance is unknown. To address this question, we first generated DAA-resistant viruses by introducing well-characterized DAA-resistance mutations in NS3 (NS3-A156S, NS3-R155K and NS3-L36M/R155K) or NS5 region (NS5A-Y93H) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Pawlotsky2">[45]</xref>. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> of mutations increased the IC<sub>50</sub> of telaprevir, boceprevir and daclastavir up to 10-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004128.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004128.s009">Table S1</xref>), demonstrating that these DAA-resistant viruses are indeed able to escape inhibition by DAAs.</p>
<p>We then investigated the spread of DAA-resistant viruses using a recently developed state-of-the-art model for viral spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lupberger1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zahid1">[8]</xref> which is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g002">Figure 2A–B</xref>, both wild-type and DAA-resistant (A156S) viruses efficiently spread during the first 14 days after infection, despite the presence of anti-HCV nAb (AP33) efficiently blocking viral entry through cell-free transmission, with an increase of more than 2 log<sub>10</sub> in their viral load. Sequence analysis demonstrated that DAA-resistant virus (A156S) was indeed the predominant variant at day 14 in the experiments displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g001">Figure 1B, D and F</xref> (data not shown). Thus, given an inhibition of viral entry through cell-free transmission of more than 95% in the presence of nAb (AP33) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lupberger1">[6]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g002">Figure 2G</xref>), we conclude that cell-cell transmission represents the main transmission route for DAA-resistant viruses. We quantified the percentage of HCV positive cells at the end of the viral spread assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

Although cell-free HCV in the supernatant was efficiently neutralized by nAb (anti-HCV IgG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), the spread of wild-type and DAA-resistant HCV was still efficient in the presence of nAb (86%/WT, 82%/A156S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Given the minor effect of nAbs efficiently inhibiting cell-free transmission, these data confirm that cell-cell transmission is the major route of viral dissemination for both wild-type and DAA-resistant HCV.</p>

<p>To confirm that HTEIs inhibit viral spread by inhibition of cell-cell transmission of DAA-resistant HCV, we applied a well-established cell-cell transmission assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In this assay HCV producer cells are co-cultured with HCV target cells for 24 h in the presence of broadly nAbs (anti-HCV IgG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lupberger1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zahid1">[8]</xref> to inhibit cell-free viral entry. Since anti-HCV IgG inhibited up to 95% of HCV cell-free entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g002">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g003">3C</xref>), viral transmission thus occurs predominantly via cell-cell transfer in this assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g004">Figure 4A and 4C</xref> (left panels), HCVcc Jc1(2a/2a) NS3-A156S and Jc1(2a/2a) NS3-L36M/R155K are indeed efficiently transmitted through cell-cell transmission, and the extent of their spread through this route was similar to the wild-type strain (data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lupberger1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zahid1">[8]</xref>, demonstrating that DAA-resistant HCVcc are transmitted through cell-cell transfer and thus escape circulating neutralizing antibodies.

The limit of quantification (LOQ), indicated by a dashed line, was 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL. The experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated twice. Among the detected triplicate samples, one out of three was HCV RNA negative on day 27 (empty circle under the LOQ), two out of three negative on day 30 (empty circles under the LOQ), three out of three negative from day 37 on.

<p>In contrast, treatment using an HTEI such as CLDN1-specific mAb (OM-7D3-B3), which has been shown to inhibit HCV entry in a pan-genotypic activity without displaying any cytotoxic effect on hepatic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Fofana2">[32]</xref>, led to a slow but steady decrease of the viral load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). No viral rebound was observed during CLDN1-specific mAb treatment, demonstrating that CLDN1 as a target has a high genetic barrier to HCV resistance.

According to our previous study and reports from others, anti-CLDN1 mAb and simeprevir exhibit no toxicity to hepatoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic> at the concentrations used in this study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Fofana2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lenz1">[48]</xref>. Nevertheless, we performed additional experiments to exclude that toxic effects were responsible for decline in viral load and loss of virus. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004128-t002">Table 2</xref>, MTT-based cell viability assays at the end of the long-term experiments showed no differences between treated and untreated cells. These data confirm that the clearance of viral infection is indeed due to HTEI treatment and not related to adverse effects of the compounds during long-term treatment.</p>

<p>To further explore the development of viral resistance, we performed sequence analyses of viral variants at different time points (the start of treatment, 10 and 23 days after treatment). Whereas DAA-monotherapy resulted in the emergence of well-described NS3 resistance mutations 23 days after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g007">7</xref>), wild-type NS3 HCV remained the predominant strain in CLDN1-specific mAb alone as well as in combination of CLDN1-specific mAb and simeprevir treated cells. Although sequence analyses revealed some rarely occurring variants associated with low DAA resistance (e.g. NS3 I170T) in the presence of combination of CLDN1-specific mAb and simeprevir, these variants were cleared at the end of the treatment as indicated by undetectable viral RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These results demonstrate that the HTEI functionally prevents antiviral resistance to DAA by impairing the spread of resistant viruses in cell culture models.</p>

<p>To assess whether prevention of resistance is universal to HTEIs or compound-dependent, we performed side-by-side experiments using a well- characterized SR-BI-specific mAb NK-8H5-E3. This antibody has been shown to block efficiently cell-free viral entry and viral dissemination in cell culture models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zahid1">[8]</xref>, Although the combination of this SR-BI-specific mAb and simeprevir transiently decreased viral load and delayed viral rebound, it did not result in viral clearance as observed in CLDN1-specific mAb/simeprevir combination therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Sequence analysis in cells treated with anti-SR-BI mAb and simeprevir revealed emergence of variants conferring resistance to HCV protease inhibitors (NS3 Y56H) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Bartolini1">[49]</xref> (data now shown) and to SR-BI inhibitors (N415D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zhu1">[39]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004128.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Using direct sequencing we did not detect mutation G451R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Grove1">[50]</xref>, indicating that G451R is not emerging at high frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004128.s006">Figure S6</xref>). These data indicate that distinct HTEIs have different genetic barriers for antiviral resistance and that the CLDN1-specific mAb OM-7D3-B3 used in this study appears to have a higher genetic barrier than the SR-BI-specific mAb NK-8H5-E3. This SR-BI-specific antibody was less efficient in inhibiting HCV cell-cell transmission as compared to the CLDN1-specific mAb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004128.s007">Figures S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004128.s008">S8</xref>), further confirming that an efficient inhibition of HCV cell-cell transmission appears to be required to prevent emergence of DAA-resistant virus in cell culture models.</p>
<p>Finally, we also performed a long-term cell culture infection assay investigating a combination of two DAAs on HCV infection. We tested a highly potent NS5A inhibitor, daclatasvir, which has been shown to have potent pan-genotypic activity against HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Pawlotsky3">[51]</xref>, first alone and then in combination with simeprevir in the long-term HCV infection assay. In cell culture, a concentration of 0.1 nM has been shown to alter the subcellular localization and biochemical fractionation of its target NS5A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lee1">[52]</xref>. The concentration of daclatasvir (5 nM) used in the experiment resulted in a more than 10-fold decrease of viral load indicating that the dose is below the IC<sub>90</sub> in this experimental setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). However, during long-term treatment the viral load rebounded to the level of the untreated cells at day 31 with emergence of the DAA-resistant NS5A mutation, Y93H (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004128-t003">Table 3</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to the combination of an HTEI and a protease inhibitor simeprevir, the combination of daclatasvir and simeprevir (at concentrations &gt; IC<sub>90</sub>) failed to eradicate HCV genotype 2 infection in Huh7.5.1 cells and HCV load rebounded from day 45 on with emergence of DAA-resistant mutations in both NS3 and NS5A regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004128-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the development of DAAs has greatly improved the outcome of chronic hepatitis C patients, viral resistance to DAAs is still a challenge impeding treatment success. In this study, we demonstrate that HCV strains which are resistant to DAAs predominantly disseminate using cell-cell transmission and show that effective blockade of cell-cell transmission using HTEIs prevents viral resistance resulting in rapid virus elimination.</p>
<p>The ability of a virus to spread within a host is a key determinant of its persistence and virulence. While cell-free entry is important for initiation of infection by virions entering the liver through the bloodstream, HCV dissemination within the liver and establishment of chronic HCV infection may mainly occur by direct cell-cell transmission between adjacent hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Timpe1">[4]</xref>. Although differences in the ability of diverse HCV genotypes to spread via cell-free and cell-cell transmission have been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Meredith1">[3]</xref>, cell-cell transmission appears to serve as an important route of transmission for most genotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Meredith1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Brimacombe1">[12]</xref>. While cell-cell transmission has been shown to be relevant for viral evasion from host neutralizing antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lupberger1">[6]</xref>, our data indicate that the spread of DAA-resistant HCV through cell-cell transmission facilitates viral evasion and may contribute to treatment failure. Blocking cell-cell transmission improves antiviral activity of DAAs in cell culture models.</p>
<p>Functional results obtained in cell culture and animal models demonstrate strong evidence that cell-cell transmission also plays a relevant role in dissemination of several viruses including HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), measles virus or human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zhong1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Sattentau1">[2]</xref>. Indeed, cell-cell transmission has been described to spread resistance to antiretroviral drugs in HIV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Sigal1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Abela1">[54]</xref>. Discovery of a novel HBV entry factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Yan1">[55]</xref> will allow to investigate whether cell-cell transmission plays a role in HBV transmission. Thus, this study may provide a novel concept to prevent viral resistance in treatment of other viruses.</p>
<p>By interfering with cell-cell transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g004">Figure 4</xref>), HTEIs are able to prevent the development of antiviral resistance as shown by the absence of functional resistance in cells treated with a combination of DAA and HTEI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Most importantly, when added to a DAA, an HTEI allowed rapid and efficient viral clearance as shown by repeatedly confirmed absence of HCV RNA using a highly sensitive and clinically licensed commercial assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Since our data indicate that the main transmission route of DAA-resistant variants is direct cell-cell spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g003">Figure 3</xref>), we assume that the preventive effect of HTEIs is mainly due to their effect on this mode of transmission. Taken together, these data indicate that blocking viral cell-cell transmission enhances antiviral activity of DAAs and prevents DAA-resistance in cell culture models as shown for HCV genotype 2 infection as an example.</p>
<p>It has been discovered that cell-cell transmission of HIV is resistant to DAAs and may lead to therapy failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Sigal1">[53]</xref>. Here, we show that HCV cell-cell spread exists in the presence of DAAs in cell culture models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, our data demonstrate evidence that HTEIs have differences in their genetic barrier to resistance. Indeed, whereas treatment with CLDN1-specific OM-7D3-B3 mAb resulted in viral clearance without functional evidence for resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), SR-BI-specific NK-8H5-E3 mAb resulted in the development of resistant variants apparently escaping anti-SR-BI treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004128-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Resistance has been described for a small molecule SR-BI antagonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zhu1">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, a recent study elegantly demonstrated that HCV can lose SR-BI-dependence for cell-cell spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Catanese1">[10]</xref>. Together with the findings observed for SR-BI-specific mAb NK-8H5-E3, our data demonstrate that defined SR-BI-targeting compounds appear to have a lower genetic barrier for resistance than other HTEIs such as CLDN1-targeting compounds. This may be due to the fact that CLDN1 is an essential factor for cell-cell transmission whereas SR-BI may be bypassed by other entry factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Catanese1">[10]</xref>. Although accessory receptors CLDN6 and 9 have been suggested to confer partial escape from CLDN1-targeting agents for certain isolates in Huh7.5 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Haid1">[56]</xref>, escape could not be confirmed in primary human hepatocytes where expression of CLDN6 and 9 is very low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Fofana4">[57]</xref>.</p>
<p>A theoretical drawback of using HTEIs instead of DAAs as antivirals is their potential higher toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic> given these molecules target host factors and not viral factors. Nevertheless, it has to be pointed out that the development of several DAAs targeting HCV proteins had to be stopped due to adverse effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zeisel1">[5]</xref>. Moreover, it's worth noting that the majority of current drugs widely used for metabolic or inflammatory diseases or cancer, targets host proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zeisel1">[5]</xref>. The preliminary data obtained in this study suggest that the combination of HTEIs and DAAs does not result in detectable toxicity in cell-based assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004128-t002">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, HTEIs targeting SR-BI or EGFR have been shown to have an acceptable clinical safety profile in inflammatory disease and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Masson1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Cataldo1">[59]</xref>.</p>
<p>Collectively, our findings are not only relevant for the understanding of antiviral resistance but may also be of interest for the development of future HCV therapies. For null or partial responders and difficult-to-treat patients with co-morbidity or defined genotypes, there is an unmet medical need for improved antiviral regimens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Sarrazin1">[20]</xref>. Compared to the various combinations of DAAs of different classes which are currently evaluated in late stage clinical development and expected to receive regulatory approval soon, the combination of DAAs with an HTEI with a high genetic barrier provides a novel strategy for prevention of antiviral resistance in difficult-to-treat patients where viral breakthroughs drive therapy failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lange1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Liang1">[26]</xref> or future patients exhibiting multiresistance to various DAA combination therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Lange1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Liang1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Indeed, this hypothesis is supported by our results of long-term experiments in cell culture showing that the combination of an HTEI and a DAA cured persistent HCV genotype 2a infection. Since a similar NS3 protease/NS5A inhibitor DAA combination failed to clear HCV genotype 2a and 2b infection in an HCV animal model <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Shi1">[60]</xref> and viral resistance has been observed for DAAs in particular for genotype 2 and 3 in randomized clinical trials (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Liang1">[26]</xref>), our data suggest that the antiviral strategy described in this study may address limitations of DAAs in particular for non-genotype 1 infections. Since our proof-of-concept study is based on an HCV genotype 2a viral construct, future studies are needed to investigate its relevance for other genotypes.</p>
<p>In this regard it is of interest to note that small molecule HTEIs are currently investigated as monotherapy in randomized clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Sulkowski1">[61]</xref> (erlotinib: University of Strasbourg Hospitals, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01835938) and novel inhibitors of HCV cell-cell transmission are also in preclinical development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Tarr1">[62]</xref>. Our study provides evidence and directions for their future application in HCV treatment.</p>
<p>Finally, our results have implications for the treatment of other viral infections. As targeting the host is an emerging strategy to overcome resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Nathan1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Fofana5">[64]</xref>, blocking cell-cell transmission by HTEIs provides a novel perspective for fighting a wide range of viral infections including HIV, measles virus or HTLV-1 infection where cell-cell transmission has been suggested to play a role in transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Zhong1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Sattentau1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004128-Sigal1">[53]</xref>.</p>
