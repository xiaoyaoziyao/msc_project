<abstract>
<p>Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are in numerous cell therapy clinical trials, including for injured myocardium. Acquisition of cardiomyocyte characteristics by MSCs may improve cardiac regeneration but the mechanisms regulating this process are unclear. Here, we investigated whether the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 is involved in the activation of cardiac lineage genetic programs in MSCs. We employed our established co-culture model of MSCs with rat embryonic cardiomyocytes showing co-expression of cardiac markers on MSCs independent of cell fusion. Bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated from transgenic mice expressing GFP under the control of the cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter. After 5 days of co-culture, MSCs expressed cardiac specific genes, including Nkx2.5, atrial natriuretic factor and α-cardiac actin. The frequency of GFP+ cells was 7.6±1.9%, however, these cells retained the stromal cell phenotype, indicating, as expected, only partial differentiation. Global OCT4 expression increased 2.6±0.7-fold in co-cultured MSCs and of interest, 87±5% vs 79±4% of MSCs expressed OCT4 by flow cytometry in controls and after co-culture, respectively. Consistent with the latter observation, the GFP+ cells did not express nuclear OCT4 and showed a significant increase in OCT4 promoter methylation compared with undifferentiated MSCs (92% vs 45%), inferring that OCT4 is regulated by an epigenetic mechanism. We further showed that siRNA silencing of OCT4 in MSCs resulted in a reduced frequency of GFP+ cells in co-culture to less than 1%. Our data infer that OCT4 expression may have a direct effect on partial cardiomyocyte reprogramming of MSCs and suggest a new mechanism(s) associated with MSC multipotency and a requirement for crosstalk with the cardiac microenvironment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can be easily obtained from different tissue sources including bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue and umbilical cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref003">3</xref>]. Because of their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, angiogenic and anti-apoptotic effects, MSCs have been used to treat various diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref006">6</xref>]. Pre-clinical models of cardiac injury show that MCSs can facilitate myocardial repair and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref009">9</xref>]. Clinical trials data, however, indicate that transplantation of BM-derived cells results in a modest 2–3% absolute increase in left ventricular ejection fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref012">12</xref>]. A better understanding of possible mechanisms mediating cardiac regeneration will enable the use of different strategies to enhance the potency of MSCs and improve clinical outcomes. Paracrine action of MSCs, rather than direct regeneration by differentiation into cardiomyocytes, more likely explains the hemodynamic improvement as engraftment in the host myocardium is not required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref016">16</xref>]. Consistent with this notion, we found that BM-derived MSCs acquire cardiac specific markers but retain MSCs properties when co-cultured with rat embryonic cardiomyocytes (RECs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref017">17</xref>]. In addition, we showed that most donor cells express cardiac markers but retain the stromal phenotype when lodged in the hearts of mice subjected to experimental acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref018">18</xref>]. Although MSCs demonstrate varying degrees of cell lineage plasticity, cardiomyocyte reprogramming of MSCs is partial both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, further supporting a paracrine mechanism of action. The partial reprogramming that results from the interaction of MSCs with the cardiac microenvironment, however, may be an important additional mechanism to engender myocardial repair. In this regard, some reports have shown that cardiovascular lineage commitment of MSCs enhances their therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref021">21</xref>]. We also found that MSCs derived from the perivascular tissue of the umbilical cord (HUCPVCs) exhibit a greater degree of cardiomyocyte reprogramming than do BM-MSCs and provide improved cardiac function in an AMI model after intra-myocardial injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref022">22</xref>] but not when administered systemically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref015">15</xref>]. These data infer a link between partial cardiomyocyte reprogramming and cardiac regenerative potential, as HUCPVCs showed improved benefit compared with BM-MSCs only when donor cells located mainly in the infarct area. Thus, it is important to better understand the mechanisms mediating this partial reprogramming that underlie the interaction between MSCs and the cardiac microenvironment. Interestingly, we recently found that HUCPVCs present higher levels of stromal progenitors and exhibit enhanced OCT4 expression compared with BM-MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref023">23</xref>]. The biological characteristics of the neonatal origin of HUCPVC tissue may position OCT4 as a key factor in mediating MSCs multipotency.</p>
<p>OCT4 (Pou5f1) is a well-known transcription factor that regulates the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref025">25</xref>]. In addition, OCT4 is essential for nuclear reprogramming as it can induce the reprogramming of fibroblasts into ESC-like induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), either alone or in combination with other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref027">27</xref>]. Thus, OCT4 is considered the master pluripotency factor that controls other nuclear regulators of the pluripotency network, including NANOG and SOX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref028">28</xref>]. Greco et al. also found that MSCs express OCT4 and suggested a similar regulatory role for this factor, although its level of expression was significantly lower than in ESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref029">29</xref>]. Consistent with this notion, we recently showed that OCT4 promoter methylation is significantly higher in MSCs vs ESCs, suggesting a possible epigenetic mechanism for the limited plasticity of MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref023">23</xref>]. Whether OCT4 expression mediates MSC multipotency, however, has not been clearly demonstrated.</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the role of the pluripotency factor OCT4 in the partial cardiomyocyte reprogramming of MSCs using our established co-culture model with RECs. We found that OCT4 expression is directly related to the ability of MSCs to acquire a partial cardiomyocyte phenotype. Moreover, MSCs must first gain OCT4 (de-differentiate) before being able to commence cardiomyocyte reprogramming, a mechanism that resembles the reprogramming process of adult stem cells. This study provides a novel mechanism that further supports our previous data inferring a link between partial cardiomyocyte differentiation and the regeneration potential of MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref023">23</xref>].</p>

<title>Bone marrow-derived MSCs</title>
<p>Animal procedures conformed to the US National Institute of Health’s guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals with approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Ontario Cancer Institute and Universidad Favaloro/CONICET. B-a-Fvb mice were generated by using a transgenic vector containing a green florescent protein (GFP) coding sequence flanked by the full-length mouse α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref017">17</xref>]. Bone marrow MSCs were collected from the femur and tibia of individual adult B-a-Fvb mice. Mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll density gradient (Ficoll-Paque PLUS, GE Healthcare-Amersham Biosciences). Cells were suspended in MSC medium, consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium-low glucose (DMEM-LG) (Life technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic-antimitotic solution (Life technologies). Cells were plated at 20x10<sup>6</sup> cells/75 cm<sup>2</sup> and incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. When the adherent layer reached near confluence (70–80%), the cells were detached using 0.25% trypsin and 1 mM EDTA, and serially passaged at 4000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> every 5–7 days until fourth passage (P4) cells were obtained. Surface phenotype analysis and lineage differentiation into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes were done to confirm that cells displayed the properties consistent with the ISCT minimal requirements for the definition of MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref030">30</xref>].</p>

<title>Co-culture of BM-MSCs with rat embryonic cardiomyocytes (RECs)</title>
<p>Cardiomyocytes were isolated from rat embryos (day 20) and cultured on the basis of the procedures previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref017">17</xref>]. Briefly, ventricles were minced and digested using trypsin (0.08% w/v) and collagenase type 2 (0.035% w/v; both Worthington Biochemical Corporation). Pre-plating for 60 min was performed to eliminate contaminating fibroblasts. Nonadherent cells were collected and seeded on gelatin-coated plates (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM:F12 (1:1; Gibco) supplemented with 5% FBS and 10% horse serum (Gibco). After 48 h, fourth passage BM-MSCs were plated onto the primary RECs cultures and co-cultured for up to 5 days. This time frame for co-culture was chosen based on previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref017">17</xref>]. To determine cell fusion events, only male RECs were used in the co-culture experiments with BM-MSCs isolated from female mice. MSCs were also co-cultured with isolated embryonic rat lung, kidney, and liver cells.</p>

<title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. One microgram was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random primers and MultiScribe RT (High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems). Mouse specific primers were designed to detect the expression of pluripotency factors and cardiac specific markers in the co-culture system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189131.s002">S1 Table</xref>). RT-PCR reactions were performed to evaluate the primers design and specific amplification products were confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing (see supplementary material for methodology details). For quantitative RT-PCR, samples were assayed in triplicate using Power SYBR Green master mix on a 7900HT real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with the following conditions: 1 cycle for 10 min at 95°C, 40 cycles with 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 60 s, followed by a melting curve analysis. Results were analyzed using the Relative Quantification (ΔΔCt) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref031">31</xref>]. The threshold cycle (Ct) values were normalized against the reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The data were calculated using the formula 2-ΔΔCt and are presented as the fold change in gene expression normalized and relative to the untreated control.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Total cellular protein extracts were prepared from untreated MSCs and CD44<sup>+</sup>-sorted MSCs after the co-culture as described by Maniatis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref032">32</xref>]. Protein concentrations were determined using the micromethod of Bradford (Bio-Rad, CA). Samples (60 μg total protein) were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a HyBlot CL film (Denville Scientific, NJ, USA). Membranes were blocked using 1X PBST with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk for 1 h and hybridized overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. Membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-rat HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and were washed five times for 5 min with TBST buffer. Bound antibodies were visualized using ECL Plus Western Blotting detection system (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primary antibodies used were anti-OCT4 (1:800, Abcam, ab19857), anti-SOX2 (1:1500, Abcam, ab97959), anti-NANOG (1:800, Abcam, ab80892), and anti-β-Tubulin (1:1000, Abcam, ab6161).</p>

<p>BM-derived MSCs from B-a-Fvb mice were co-cultured with RECs as described above. After 5 days, cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS). Cells were stained with an anti-mouse CD44 antibody linked APC (1:50, eBioscience, 17–0441) for 30 min, which did not cross react with rat CD44 and was therefore used to distinguish mouse from rat cells in the co-culture system. For OCT4 expression analysis, cells were then washed and fixed/permeabilized using 4% paraformaldehyde and methanol. After permeabilization, cells were stained for OCT4 using anti-OCT4 (1:50, Abcam, ab19857) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100, Molecular Probes, A-21207). Flow cytometry was performed on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For cell sorting, cells were washed after CD44 staining and cell sorting was performed under sterile conditions using BD FACS Aria (University Health Network Flow Cytometry Facility). GFP detection was carried out with a 530/30 nM band pass filter and a 505 nM long pass filter. CD44-APC was detected with a 660/20 nM band pass filter and no long pass filter. Sorting was done at a pressure of 20 psi with a 100 μm nozzle and the cells were divided into three populations: (1) GFP+ and CD44+, (2) GFP- and CD44+ and (3), CD44-. The sorted GFP+/CD44+ and GFP-/CD44+ cells were centrifuged (1000 rpm, 10 min) and analyzed using immunostaining and bisulfite genomic sequencing as described below.</p>

<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>Immunostaining techniques were used to determine the frequency of cardiomyocyte differentiation (GFP+/Col IV+ cells) in the co-culture experiments. After 5 days of co-culture, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min, and then blocked with 5% FBS/PBS for 1 h. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4°C with a goat polyclonal anti-GFP-linked FITC antibody (1:100, Abcam) and a rabbit anti-mouse collagen type IV (1:100, BioDesign).</p>
<p>The secondary antibody for collagen type IV was an Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Molecular Probes). For immunostaining of sorted cells, cells were spun down on gelatin-coated slides using Cytospin 4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cardiac troponin T was stained by using a monoclonal antibody to cardiac troponin T (BioDesign). Collagen type IV was stained with a rabbit anti-mouse collagen type IV (BioDesign). In both cases, the secondary antibody used was linked with Alexa Fluor 555 (Molecular Probes). For OCT4 staining, cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies against OCT4 (1:250, Abcam, ab19857). After incubation, cells were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:250, Molecular Probes, A-21207). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (DAPI ProLong Gold, Invitrogen). Detection of fluorescent signals was performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fluoview FV1000, Olympus).</p>

<title>OCT4 silencing</title>
<p>The vector used for the stable siRNA transfection was the pSilencer 4.1 CMV that employs a CMV promoter and a puromicyn resistance gene as a mechanism to select for transfected cells (Life Technologies). To silence OCT4 expression, we used the following oligonucleotides <monospace>5′-GATCCGAGCACGAGTGGAAAGCAATTCAAGAGATTGCTTTCCACTCGTGCTCCTA-3</monospace>′ and 5<monospace>′-AGCTTAGGAGCACGAGTGGAAAGCAATCTCTTGAATTGCTTTCCACTCGTGCTCG-3′</monospace> that were annealed and cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pSilencer-4.1-CMV puro vector (siOCT4). The construction was confirmed by DNA sequencing. As the negative control, a plasmid encoding a scrambled hairpin siRNA (siScr) whose sequence is not found in the mouse database was used (Life Technologies). MSCs were transfected with the different siRNA constructs using Metafectene Easy+ (Biontex) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h post transfection, stable transfected cells were selected using puromycin (2.5 μg/ml).</p>

<p>The acquisition of cardiac specific gene expression in BM-MSCs was assessed by using mouse specific primers to avoid the need to separate cells in the co-culture. According with this, the expression of Nkx2.5, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and α-cardiac actin (CA) was detected in mouse heart samples but not in RECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). BM-MSCs only expressed these markers after 5 days of co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The expression of Nkx2.5 and ANF were significantly higher (7.40±0.78 and 5.73±0.51-fold, respectively) in co-cultured MSCs than in mouse heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The level of expression of CA in co-cultured MSCs was similar to that found in mouse heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The frequency of MSCs differentiating towards the cardiomyocyte lineage was calculated by comparing the number of GFP+ cells (MSCs with an active α-MHC promoter) with the number of collagen type IV+ cells (MSCs in the co-culture) using immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The percentage of MSCs undergoing cardiomyocyte differentiation was 7.6±1.9% after 5 days of co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), and was significantly higher than cell fusion events which occurred at a frequency of less than 1% in our co-culture system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189131.s004">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>When co-cultures were carried out with cells isolated from rat embryonic lung, kidney or liver tissue, BM-MSCs did not yield any GFP+ cells nor acquire the expression of cardiomyocyte specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>OCT4 expression changes in MSCs after co-culture with RECs</title>
<p>Changes in the expression of the pluripotency transcription factors OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG during the co-culture were evaluated by qRT-PCR analysis using mouse specific primers. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, assay conditions allowed the detection of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG gene expression in mice ESCs (positive control) but not in RECs. Interestingly, BM-MSCs basally expressed these stemness genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Immunocytochemistry analysis also showed that 83±9, 76±9 and 66±13% of BM-MSCs cultured under standard conditions were positive for the expression of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189131.s005">S3 Fig</xref>).

There was no significant difference in NANOG gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

<p>Of note, OCT4 expression increased in this differentiation model in contrast to its expected downregulation during the acquisition of a more differentiated phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref035">35</xref>]. However, both qRT-PCR and WB analyses were performed on the entire mixed population of MSCs. We therefore next determined the frequency of OCT4 expression in BM-MSCs before and after the co-culture using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g003">Fig 3</xref>). To distinguish mouse from rat cells in co-culture, cells were stained with an anti-mouse CD44 antibody which does not cross react with rat CD44. CD44 was expressed on all MSCs and absent on RECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). After 5 days of co-culture, the MSC population represented 20–25% of the total cell number, in agreement with the initial seeding ratio of 4 to 1 (RECs:MSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). OCT4 expression was evaluated by gating on the CD44+ population. Flow cytometry analysis showed that 87±5% vs 79±4% (p&lt;0.05) of MSCs expressed OCT4 at baseline and after the co-culture, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). Interestingly, the frequency of MSCs that lost OCT4 (8%) was similar to the frequency of MSCs partially differentiating into cardiomyocytes (GFP+ cells) in our co-culture system, suggesting that MSCs undergoing differentiation may have lost OCT4. This notion is in agreement with the concept that OCT4 expression is repressed in differentiating cells. To test this hypothesis, we used cell sorting to separate and characterize the GFP+/CD44+ cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g004">Fig 4</xref>). For all the experiments, we used a GFP+/CD44+ sorted population with a purity higher than 95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Immunocytochemistry analysis showed that GFP+/CD44+ cells co-expressed troponin T, a subunit of troponin which is essential for cardiac muscle contraction, and the stromal cell marker collagen type IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). These results demonstrate the acquisition of at least one cardiac marker with the retention of a stromal determinant, inferring that the differentiation process is partial in our co-culture system. In addition, detection of DNA synthesis by BrdU incorporation assay showed that GFP+/CD44+ cells underwent cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189131.s006">S4 Fig</xref>), a well-known characteristic of differentiating cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref036">36</xref>]. Notably, OCT4 was not expressed in MSCs undergoing cardiomyocyte differentiation (GFP+/CD44+), whereas undifferentiated cells (GFP-/CD44+) stained positive for nuclear OCT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Current evidence suggests that DNA methylation is the major epigenetic mechanism regulating OCT4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref037">37</xref>]. The methylation profile of the OCT4 promoter was assessed by bisulfite DNA sequencing studying a 533 bp region that contains 16 CpG sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189131.s007">S5 Fig</xref>). We found that the OCT4 promoter was hyper-methylated (&gt;90%) in partially differentiated cells (GFP+/CD44+), while the methylation in undifferentiated MSCs was close to 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). This epigenetic mechanism may explain OCT4 repression in differentiating MSCs. Overall, these data demonstrate that there is an up-regulation of OCT4 expression in MSCs during the co-culture and that the cells undergoing partial cardiomyocyte differentiation lose expression of this factor. Our observation suggests that MSCs may undergo a de-differentiation process (gain in OCT4 expression) before being able to partially differentiate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189131.s008">S6 Fig</xref>). In this way, OCT4 modulates the interaction of MSCs with the microenvironment. Accordingly, when GFP-/CD44+ sorted cells were co-cultured with RECs again for other 5 days, the percentage of GFP+ cells (MSCs with an active α-MHC promoter) observed was 12.2±2.3%, indicating that there are temporal differences in the progression of differentiation among MSCs. In contrast, GFP+/CD44+ sorted cells cultured in complete media for 12 days, lose expression of GFP (inactive α-MHC promoter) and troponin T, while maintaining expression of Type IV collagen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189131.s009">S7 Fig</xref>). Most of the cells lose expression of GFP during the first 6 days in complete culture media followed by a significant rise in the proliferation rate. These results infer that the cardiac microenvironment is required to maintain the partial differentiated phenotype.</p>

<title>OCT4 expression is required for partial cardiomyocyte differentiation of MSCs</title>
<p>Finally, we studied whether OCT4 expression is directly related to the differentiation process. To this end, we carried out co-culture experiments employing an OCT4-silenced MSC population. We used a plasmid vector to drive high level expression of a hairpin siRNA against OCT4 (siOCT4). MSCs transfected with the siOCT4 plasmid showed a significant decrease in OCT4 expression compared with scrambled siRNA negative control (siScr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Interestingly, OCT4 silencing also decreased the expression of SOX2 and NANOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), a result consistent with the role of OCT4 as an essential regulator of pluripotency. OCT4-silenced MSCs failed to express significant levels of cardiomyocyte genes when co-cultured with RECs for 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). In addition, the frequency of differentiating cells (GFP+) significantly dropped to 1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cell therapy with MSCs holds promise for cardiac regeneration. While current evidence supports the MSC-mediated improvement of cardiac function by release of soluble growth factors and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref016">16</xref>], the contribution of cardiomyocyte lineage commitment of MSCs at the injury site may also constitute a possible mechanism. In this regard, pre-conditioning of MSCs with different growth factors and cytokines before administration improves therapeutic efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref021">21</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that over 60% of donor cells lodging in the heart co-express cardiomyocyte and stromal markers in a mouse model of AMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref018">18</xref>]. Moreover, selective elimination of cardiovascular committed donor cells after transplantation of undifferentiated BM-MSCs decreases improvement in cardiac function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref020">20</xref>]. These data infer that the interaction of MSCs with the cardiac niche is important to engender cardiac repair, even though the role of partially differentiated subpopulations is still poorly understood. The present study was designed to explore mechanisms mediating the differentiation of MSCs into cardiomyocytes using a co-culture system with RECs. Our results demonstrated that: i) MSCs acquire cardiac markers but retain the stromal phenotype when co-cultured with RECs; ii) this partial cardiomyocyte differentiation is directed by RECs but not by other types of embryonic cells; iii) OCT4 expression is required for the differentiation process; iv) de-differentiation is a central step in this mechanism.</p>
<p>We previously showed that the ability of MSCs to differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes does not occur <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref022">22</xref>]. The cells of MSC origin exhibiting cardiac-specific gene expression neither generated spontaneous or evoked action potentials nor produced ionic currents typical of cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref017">17</xref>]. Other studies have also concluded that MSCs do not differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref039">39</xref>]. The extent of this differentiation, however, is similar to that acquired by most donor cells <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref018">18</xref>]. Here we found that co-culture with other embryonic cells failed to induce MSC cardiomyocyte differentiation, indicating that unspecified embryonic factors are unlikely to mediate this process. Thus, our co-culture with RECs provides a suitable <italic>in vitro</italic> model to identify molecules involved in the interaction of MSCs with the cardiac microenvironment. Labile short distance factors released by RECs may play a major role in directing MSC cardiomyocyte reprogramming as the frequency and extent of differentiation achieved using transwell membranes was similar to cell co-culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref022">22</xref>]. The identification of the specific mechanisms mediating this process remains elusive as they may include not only soluble cytokines and growth factors but also extracellular vesicles and intercellular transfer of mitochondria.</p>
<p>Previous reports have shown that MSCs express low levels of OCT4 at early passage and suggested that this pluripotency factor could be a marker of MSC differentiation potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref040">40</xref>]. Differences in the multipotency of MSCs isolated from different sources can be attributed to relatively slight changes in OCT4 expression, as the multipotency of MSCs may be epigenetically restricted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref023">23</xref>]. The loss of proliferation and differentiation potential with increasing donor age may also be related to limited OCT4 expression, as it occurs with extended passaging <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref041">41</xref>]. In contrast, ectopic expression of OCT4 enhances the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref043">43</xref>]. Moreover, OCT4 overexpression in human amnion mesenchymal cells improves their differentiation potential into cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref044">44</xref>]. In view of these data, it has been suggested that forced expression of OCT4 favors the maintenance of MSCs in the mesodermal lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref043">43</xref>]. Whether this occurs under more physiological conditions is uncertain as ectopic OCT4 expression usually increases more than 100-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref044">44</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that OCT4 expression increased by 2.6-fold in MSCs during the co-culture with RECs. This up-regulation arising from the interaction of MSCs and the cardiac microenvironment may mediate cardiomyocyte reprogramming. In fact, a two-fold increase in OCT4 expression was associated with differentiation of ESCs into primitive endoderm and mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref045">45</xref>]. After 5 days in co-culture, up to 8% of the MSCs acquired expression of cardiac markers. Of note, the frequency of OCT4+ MSCs in the co-culture decreased by a similar percentage. We further demonstrated that these partially differentiated cells lost OCT4 expression and proliferation potential. It is well-known that during differentiation, cells exhibit little proliferative activity. ESCs differentiate into a specific lineage by losing expression of pluripotent genes accompanied by the gradual activation of differentiation genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref035">35</xref>]. Moreover, increased DNA methylation of pluripotency-associated genes has been observed during ESCs differentiation, suggesting that this mechanism is important for repressing pluripotency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref046">46</xref>]. The same mechanism may also operate in MSCs. We found that the OCT4 promoter was hypermethylated in MSCs undergoing partial cardiomyocyte differentiation (GFP+/CD44+ cells). Nonetheless, these cells lose the expression of cardiac markers and start to proliferate when cultured in complete culture media, supporting the notion that this partial cardiomyocyte phenotype is maintained by an interaction with the cardiac microenvironment and may be analogous to the stem cell niche determining the fate of stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref047">47</xref>]. Specific signals from the microenvironment influence stem cell identity and may promote differentiation. The observation that MSCs acquired a partial cardiomyocyte phenotype under co-culture conditions which was lost upon withdrawal of cardiac microenvironmental stimuli, suggests that MSCs can return to their original identity. Partially differentiated cells may be more competent to revert to the starting fate than cells that have undergone stable differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref048">48</xref>]. We had previously proposed a link between partial cardiomyocyte differentiation and paracrine effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref022">22</xref>]. Thus, the release of soluble growth factors and cytokines may be influenced by the interaction of MSCs with the local environment to improve therapeutic potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Transdifferentiation was initially defined as the conversion of one differentiated cell type into another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref049">49</xref>]. This change in differentiation at the cellular level may occur either directly, without any reversion to immature phenotypes, or through a de-differentiation step before cell redifferentiation to a new mature phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref048">48</xref>]. Previous studies showed direct conversion of differentiated cells from one lineage into another, such as the conversion of fibroblasts to multilineage blood progenitors, functional cardiomyocytes or neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref052">52</xref>]. In all cases, the direct conversion involves a significant genomic reorganization achieved by forced differentiation through the expression of ectopic factors. MSCs were able to directly switch from osteogenically differentiated cells into adipogenically or chondrogenically differentiated cells showing true differentiation potential, as controversies such as progenitor cell contamination, cell fusion and other cellular artifacts were excluded by tracking cells with GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref053">53</xref>]. More recently however, Ullah et al. showed by single cell analysis that differentiation of MSC-derived adipocytes into osteogenically or chondrogenically differentiated cells occurs via de-differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref054">54</xref>]. Attempts to directly convert differentiated cells from one lineage to another resulted in a mixed culture, in which only some cells were able to differentiate. Moreover, single cell analysis ruled out direct cell-to-cell conversion and supported de-differentiation as an intermediate step during transdifferentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref054">54</xref>]. Similarly, it has been reported that de-differentiation is a necessary step for switching bone marrow-derived neurons to epithelial cells or vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref055">55</xref>]. Nevertheless, a deeper mechanistic understanding of MSC genetic reprogramming is needed. A previous study demonstrated that MSC-derived neurons can revert to a stromal phenotype upon withdrawal of extrinsic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref056">56</xref>]. Moreover, these de-differentiated MSCs may represent neural stem/progenitor cells as they exhibited enhanced cell survival and higher efficacy in neuronal differentiation compared with naïve MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref056">56</xref>]. More recently, the same was established after induction of osteogenic differentiation. De-differentiated osteogenic MSCs showed enhanced differentiation along the osteoblastic lineage, as well as increased cell survival and colony forming ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref057">57</xref>]. These cells also gained specific epigenetic changes with enhanced expression of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref057">57</xref>]. Of note, our study revealed that global OCT4 expression increased in MSCs after 5 days in co-culture while cells undergoing cardiomyocyte differentiation lost OCT4. It is logical to infer a net gain in OCT4 expression in undifferentiated MSCs. This undifferentiated population (GFP-/CD44+), however, was able to generate partially differentiated cardiomyocytes when co-cultured again for another 5 days. These data suggest that partial cardiomyocyte differentiation of MSCs involves a de-differentiation intermediate with increased OCT4 expression. For MSCs, a small minority of which comprise adult stem cells, de-differentiation may represent a relatively small step backwards. Differences in the timing of differentiation may be related to cell heterogeneity among the MSCs. For example, a subpopulation of early progenitor cells with enhanced expression of OCT4 present at early passage can be selected by serum deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref040">40</xref>]. This subpopulation may differentiate more easily and faster than other MSCs with reduced OCT4 levels. The latter may require a greater change to revert to a more progenitor-like cell. In both cases, the differentiation occurs in a stepwise fashion, resembling genetic reprogramming to pluripotency. Consequently, the plasticity of MSCs depends on their ability to de-differentiate to more primitive stem cells, which can then be reprogrammed to differentiate along another lineage in response to environmental signals. OCT4 may play a key role in this process. Ectopic expression of OCT4 in certain somatic cells has been associated with active de-differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189131.ref058">58</xref>]. We found that blocking OCT4 expression by siRNA significantly reduced the ability of MSCs to differentiate in our co-culture system. Our data suggest that OCT4 up-regulation is required and supports the notion that de-differentiation is an integral part of partial cardiomyocyte differentiation of MSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189131.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We showed that OCT4 expression mediates the partial cardiomyocyte differentiation of BM-MSCs upon co-culture with RECs. We found that activation of pluripotent genes in MSCs during co-culture is required, inferring that the differentiation process proceeds via de-differentiation-mediated reprogramming. De-differentiation redirects cell fate by reverting differentiated cells to an earlier, more primitive phenotype with extended differentiation potential. Thus, it is not surprising that a master regulator of pluripotency such as OCT4 may control this process. Other studies have shown that MSCs are able to differentiate after successive changes in induction media. It is noteworthy that our co-culture system resembles the cardiac microenvironment, hence our data represent the response of MSCs in a more physiological situation. Moreover, here we provide an OCT4-dependent mechanism that explains our previous data supporting the view that partial cardiomyocyte reprograming may be important to engender cardiac repair.</p>

<title>Determination of cell fusion events.</title>
<p>For cell fusion studies, co-culture experiments were done as described in Materials and Methods, except that RECs were only obtained from male embryos and BM-MSCs from female mice. After 5 days of co-culture, cells were fixed and subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for X and Y chromosomes. The probe for detection of Y chromosomes was rat specific (rat Y chromosome-Cy5, Cambio, UK). The probe for detection of X chromosomes was mouse specific (mouse X chromosome-Cy3, Cambio, UK). Visualization of cells with two X chromosomes (from female mice) and one Y chromosome (from male rats) were taken to have undergone a fusion event (XXY chromosomes). Nuclei were stained using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), which was used to quantify cell numbers.</p>

<title>Schematic diagram representing the changes in OCT4 expression during partial cardiomyocyte differentiation of MSCs.</title>
<p>MSCs constitute a heterogeneous population of cells with a small range of OCT4 expression, which is related to their proliferation and multipotency capacity. Upon co-culture with REC, MSCs de-differentiate with a gain in OCT4 expression before being able to partially transdifferentiate into cardiomyocytes. MSCs starting with a high level of OCT4 expression completes this process within 5 days of co-culture, whereas de-differentiation takes longer for MSCs with low OCT4. Consequently, differences in the timing of reprogramming into cardiomyocytes may be due to cell heterogeneity among the MSCs.</p>
