<abstract>
<p>Currently, there is no available therapy to eradicate hepatitis B virus (HBV) in chronically infected individuals. This is due to the difficulty in eliminating viral covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, which is central to the gene expression and replication of HBV. We developed an assay system for nuclear circular DNA using an integration-deficient lentiviral vector. This vector produced non-integrated circular DNA in nuclei of infected cells. We engineered this vector to encode firefly luciferase to monitor the lentiviral episome DNA. We screened 3,840 chemicals by this assay for luciferase-reducing activity and identified dicumarol, which is known to have anticoagulation activity. We confirmed that dicumarol reduced lentiviral episome DNA. Furthermore, dicumarol inhibited HBV replication in cell culture using NTCP-expressing HepG2 and primary human hepatocytes. Dicumarol reduced intracellular HBV RNA, DNA, supernatant HBV antigens and DNA. We also found that dicumarol reduced the cccDNA level in HBV infected cells, but did not affect HBV adsorption/entry. This is a novel assay system for screening inhibitors targeting nuclear cccDNA and is useful for finding new antiviral substances for HBV.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than 240 million people are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref001">1</xref>]. Although most infections in adulthood are transient, approximately 5%â€“10% of infected adults and over 90% of infected neonates fail to mount a sufficient immune response to clear the virus, and develop a lifelong chronic infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref002">2</xref>]. Every year, 0.6â€“1 million die from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection due to liver failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref004">4</xref>]. Prophylactic vaccines have been available for hepatitis B for almost 30 years, but the overall number of chronic infections remains high[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref005">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to cure CHB infection and prevent its direct consequences[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>HBV is a small, enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the hepadnaviridae family[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref007">7</xref>]. Additionally, HBV is classified into eight genotypes, namely A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref009">9</xref>]. Globally, HBV C and D are the most common. Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is a template for all transcription of HBV, including 3.5 kb of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and four viral mRNA, 3.5 kb of precore mRNA, 2.4 and 2.1 kb of surface mRNA, and 0.7 kb of X mRNA (HBx). The 3.5-kb precore mRNA contains all the open reading frames of viral proteins, but translates only the precore protein, which is further processed and secreted as the e antigen (HBeAg). pgRNA is a multifunctional transcript that encodes the viral polymerase (HBVpol) and core protein (HBc), and it serves as the template for HBV DNA synthesis. Following the binding of viral polymerase to pgRNA, the complex is packed into a nucleocapsid where polymerase-catalyzed reverse transcription yields minus-strand DNA, which is subsequently copied into plus-strand DNA to form the relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) of the progeny. Mature nucleocapsids are then packed with viral envelope proteins to egress as virion particles[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref011">11</xref>]. Therefore, cccDNA plays an essential role in the life cycle of HBV, and its elimination is necessary for curing hepatitis B[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref012">12</xref>]. Drugs currently approved for HBV treatment include interferon-alpha (IFN-Î±) and five nucleos(t)ide analogs, namely lamivudine (3TC), adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir. Each agent has its own advantages and drawbacks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref013">13</xref>]. For example, IFN-Î± is costly and poorly tolerated, and only a small proportion of patients with CHB respond to it. Nucleotide analogs can effectively block HBV replication by inhibiting reverse transcription, but drug resistance emerges after long-term treatment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref014">14</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref016">16</xref>]. However, the complete eradication of viral cccDNA from the nuclei of infected hepatocytes cannot be achieved by the aforementioned drugs. Thus, the development of new drugs that can eliminate established cccDNA from infected hepatocytes is clinically of interest.</p>
<p>In a previous study to identify small molecules that inhibit HBV cccDNA, a compound library was screened using cell lines with stable expression of HBV, which induces the expression of cccDNA-dependent HBeAg as a surrogate marker for cccDNA, and two structurally related compounds that act as cccDNA formation inhibitors by blocking rcDNA deproteinization[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref017">17</xref>]. To date, cells transgenic for 1.3-fold of the HBV genome, HBV-infected primary human hepatocytes (PXB)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref018">18</xref>], cells with stable expression of NTCP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref019">19</xref>], and transient transfection of plasmids, including 1.3-fold of the HBV genome, have been used to reproduce HBV cccDNA generation. However, inhibition of any of the steps in the HBV replication cycle may result in cccDNA reduction. We therefore aimed to develop a screening method focusing on nuclear circular DNA inhibition.</p>
<p>To produce nuclear circular DNA, we used a lentivirus. After infection of a lentivirus, viral genomic RNA is reverse-transcribed to double-stranded (ds) DNA in the cytoplasm. The linear dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus where it is integrated into the genome by integrase. In the absence of integrase, the dsDNA remains linear, or is converted to the circular form by homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref020">20</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref022">22</xref>]. We used a mutant lentivirus defective of integrase to produce non-replicating circular DNA (lentiviral episome DNA, LeDNA) in the nucleus. In addition, we used an engineered lentivirus encoding luciferase to monitor the level of LeDNA.</p>
<p>We screened 3,840 chemicals using the mutant lentivirus. Our screening led to the identification of dicumarol[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref023">23</xref>], which induced a decrease in luciferase activity and LeDNA. We further demonstrated that dicumarol inhibits HBV replication and impaired HBV cccDNA levels in cells, including primary human hepatocytes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to target cccDNA to identify a small molecule inhibitor of HBV.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The scheme for the LeDNA-dependent assay is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. Briefly, the defective lentivirus formed circular DNA by NHEJ and HR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212233.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). We made a lentivirus construct that encodes firefly luciferase but does not include any of the HBV sequence. After infection, 7.2 kb of linear lentiviral DNA with long terminal repeats (LTRs) at the 3â€² and 5â€² ends was converted into 7.2 kb of circular DNA by NHEJ or 6.6 kb of circular DNA by HR. This lentivirus has two advantages. First, only a few cell culture systems support HBV infection, but it takes at least 12 days to detect HBV replication. In contrast, lentiviruses can infect a wide range of cell lines and its gene expression can be detected before 16 h. Second, as replication of HBV takes place slowly at low levels, detection of replicated HBV DNA requires subtraction of the high background of adsorbed virion-containing genomic DNA. Lentiviruses are RNA viruses; therefore, input RNA does not interfere with intracellular LeDNA detection.</p>

<p>We infected HepG2 cells with the mutant lentivirus and investigated the infectivity by staining with a luciferase antibody. Based on the immunofluorescence, nearly 30% of the cells were infected with the mutant lentivirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). After infection, episomal DNA was extracted by the HIRT method[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref031">31</xref>]. Southern blotting detected three DNA species containing lentiviral sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To identify the nature of these species, extracted DNA was digested with BamHI. Linearization altered the mobility, and based on the size, three forms were identified. Using the intensity and size, the molar ratio of circular (I + II) and linear (III) DNA was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). We concluded that the lentivirus predominantly formed circular DNA. To further examine HR and NHEJ, we sequenced the 7.2- and 6.6-kbp DNA fragments. Two joined LTRs (7.2 kbp), and one LTR flanked by WPRE and Psi (6.6 kbp) were confirmed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212233.s003">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>As the episomal lentivirus DNA lacked a replication origin, its level was expected to decline as the cells proliferated. To confirm this, lentiviral DNA was monitored. At 2, 4, 6, and 8 dpi, cells were harvested to extract HIRT DNA. Southern blotting revealed that episomal DNA levels markedly decreased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Luciferase expression was similarly monitored and it decreased exponentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). On the other hand, LeDNA was maintained (half life &gt;9 days) when cell growth was arrested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212233.s004">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We screened 3,840 chemicals using luciferase activity as a readout. Cells were infected with the lentivirus and treated with chemicals, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. At the end of the cultivation, cells were harvested for luciferase activity and protein assay. Primary screening was performed using 10-drug mix and repeated at least 3 times. 10 of 10-drug mix exhibited enhanced luciferase activity, which were not analyzed further. 12 of 10-drug mix, which exhibited reduced luciferase activity, were further examined for each chemical as secondary screening. We identified 12 candidate inhibitors. We focused on one of the candidates, dicumarol, which exhibited lowest effective concentration. Dicumarol is known to possess anticoagulant activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Dicumarol exhibited cell toxicity at concentrations higher than 100 Î¼M (CC50 225 Î¼M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g002">Fig 2C</xref>); however, as strong luciferase inhibition was observed at 25â€“50 Î¼M (EC50 12 Î¼M). Because the therapeutic index (TI; EC50/CC50) was 0.05, this inhibition was not only due to toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Southern blotting revealed that dicumarol reduced LeDNA at 50 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). These results demonstrated that dicumarol can reduce the LeDNA level.</p>

<p>Next, we examined anti-HBV activity of dicumarol. NmcHepG2 cells were infected with genotype D HBV derived from Hep38.7-tet cells (Materials and Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We examined drug toxicity by amido black staining. To distinguish between non-specific adsorption of HBV inoculum and intracellular HBV replication, Myrcludex B peptide (MyrB) was used. MyrB, which is a preS1-derived peptide and competitive inhibitor of HBV entry, inhibits NTCP-mediated infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref032">32</xref>], whereas its mutant is incapable of blocking HBV entry. Dicumarol exhibited CC50 120 Î¼M, but very little toxicity was observed at lower concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

<p>Next, we examined the effects of dicumarol on HBV replication in primary human hepatocytes, PXB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Here, a known HBV inhibitor lamivudine (3TC), a reverse transcriptase inhibitor was used as positive control. 3TC inhibits the HBV DNA synthesis because HBV DNA synthesizes DNA solely by reverse transcription. Thus supernatant DNA level is strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Whereas, HBV RNA level (as determined by HBs PCR primer) level was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Similarly extracellular secretion of HBs and HBe was only partially inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). Dicumarol did not exhibit toxicity within the range of concentrations used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). On the other hand, dicumarol inhibited the release of Hbe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), HBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), and HBV DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g004">Fig 4E</xref>) in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, intracellular accumulation of HBV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) and DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g004">Fig 4G</xref>) was inhibited.

<p>We next investigated the effects of dicumarol on HBV cccDNA. We used Hep38.7 cells expressing HBV from the transgenic HBV genome. This cell line expresses HBV DNA upon removal of tetracycline in the culture medium. By Southern blotting analysis, 3 episomal HBV DNA species were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, no digestion). After digestion with EcoRI, which cleaves once in the type D HBV genome, these bands became 3.2 kbp, confirming these bands to be episomal HBV DNA. From their mobility on agarose gel, we identified cccDNA as the approximately 2.1-kbp band, as estimated by molecular marker positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Dicumarol treatment for 6 days markedly reduced HBV cccDNA in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the level of HBV rcDNA was minimally attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Consistent with this observation, intracellular HBc accumulation was not suppressed by dicumarol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212233.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). When cells were treated with dicumarol during the last 3 days of HBV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, 4â€“7 day), inhibition of HBV cccDNA was less efficient compared with continuous dicumarol treatment (1â€“7 day) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). To examine the effect of dicumarol on the decay of HBV cccDNA, Hep38.7 cells were cultivated in the absence of tetracycline (0â€“7 day, HBV synthesis on), then tetracycline was added to block HBV synthesis from the transgene (7â€“13 day). The cells were further treated with dicumarol as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g006">Fig 6D</xref> in the presence of tetracycline. HBV cccDNA was maintained after 7 days cultivation in the presence of tetracycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, 0 Î¼M dicumarol). However treatment with dicumarol strongly inhibited HBV DNA maintenance including cccDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, all time course of 50 Î¼M dicumarol). The results suggest that dicumarol accelerated decay of HBV cccDNA.</p>

<title>Dicumarol inhibits HBV cccDNA.</title>
<p>HBV expression was induced in Hep38.7 cells by depleting tetracycline in the common DMEM including G418 medium for 7 days. (A) HIRT DNA was extracted and analyzed by Southern blotting. The DNA was undigested or digested with EcoRI for 1, 2, or 3 h. The positions of rcDNA, linear DNA, and cccDNA are indicated. (B) Cells were treated with increasing amounts of dicumarol as indicated. HIRT DNA (undigested) was subjected to Southern blotting. (C) Cells were treated with dicumarol as shown. HIRT DNA was extracted at 7 day and subjected to Southern blotting. (D) At first, Hep38.7 cells were cultured in common DMEM including G418 medium without tetracycline at 0â€“7 day. At 7day, cell medium was replaced fresh DMEM including tetracycline in the absence (dicumarol 0 Î¼M, 10â€“13 day dicumarol 50 Î¼M) or presence (7â€“10 day dicumarol 50 Î¼M, 7â€“13 day dicumarol 50 Î¼M) of dicumarol. At 10 day, cell medium was replaced fresh DMEM including tetracycline in the absence (dicumarol 0 Î¼M, 7â€“10 day dicumarol 50 Î¼M) or presence (10â€“13 day dicumarol 50 Î¼M, 7â€“13 day dicumarol 50 Î¼M) of dicumarol. Finally, HIRT DNA was collected at 13 day. Data are from one representative of at least two independent experiments.</p>

<p>To evaluate the inhibition of cccDNA by dicumarol in HBV infection, instead of using a transgenic model, NmcHepG2 cells were infected with HBV. As HBV cccDNA levels were much lower than those in Hep38.7 cells, we adopted quantitative PCR for cccDNA detection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref029">29</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, dicumarol reduced the cccDNA level during HBV infection.</p>

<p>The report that human APOBEC3A and B proteins help to eradicate HBV cccDNA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref033">33</xref>] prompted us to examine if APOBEC3 genes are up-regulated by dicumarol. Dicumarol treatment of NmcHepG2 cells did not influence the expression of APOBEC 3A, 3B, 3C, IL-6, or IFN-Î² genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Similar results were obtained for primary hepatocytes (PXB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) and Hep38.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report here a unique assay for non-replicating episomal DNA. Using this assay, we screened a chemical library and identified dicumarol as an inhibitor of LeDNA, demonstrating that the assay functioned as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Although the assay had little to do with the HBV life cycle, dicumarol inhibited HBV replication (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g003">3</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g005">5</xref>). It is important to determine which stage of the HBV life cycle is affected by dicumarol because blockade of any step of the HBV life cycle may reduce HBV cccDNA. Dicumarol significantly inhibited intracellular HBV RNA, DNA, supernatant HBV DNA, Hbe, and HBs during HBV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g004">Fig 4</xref>). However, in cells expressing HBV from the 1.3-fold HBV genome, intracellular HBc expression was minimally affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212233.s005">S4 Fig</xref>), whereas cccDNA expression was markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). These results suggested that dicumarol does not influence HBV transcription via the host RNA polymerase, but specifically inhibits cccDNA levels. LeDNA and HBV cccDNA both exist as circular dsDNA in the nucleus and have no replication origin; therefore, the potential target of dicumarol may function in the process of their formation or stability. In the case of LeDNA, it is produced after initial lentiviral infection, but does not renew. On the other hand, HBV cccDNA decay was accelerated by dicumarol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). It is an interesting question if dicumarol treatment can totally eliminate HBV cccDNA in the infected hepatocytes, because drug-resistant low copy number of HBV cccDNA potentially reconstitutes HBV replication cycle after drug removal. Additionally, dicumarol treatment induced the reduction of HBV linear DNA, rcDNA, and cccDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g006">Fig 6B and 6D</xref>). There is the possibility that dicumarol inhibits not only HBV cccDNA but also all HBV DNA forms. These issues remained to be answered by long term (&gt;year) in vitro and in vivo examination with HBV infection. Concerning the mechanism of cccDNA eradication, it is possible that host cells facilitate the decay of non-chromosomal small DNA and dicumarol can accelerate this process. APOBEC3 proteins, including human APOBEC3A and B, were reported to play a role in editing HBV cccDNA and its subsequent decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref033">33</xref>]. Expression of APOBEC3A and B is up-regulated by IFN-Î± and lymphotoxin-Î², respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref033">33</xref>]. However, dicumarol did not up-regulate APOBEC3 or IFN-Î± expression in HBV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212233.g007">Fig 7</xref>), suggesting that dicumarol does not inhibit cccDNA through APOBEC3 proteins. Dicumarol does not directly inhibit the blood coagulation cascade, but inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0212233.ref034">34</xref>]. Warfarin, a more potent and specific inhibitor of VKOR, and dicumarol-related compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212233.s006">S5 Fig</xref>) did not inhibit cccDNA, suggesting a possibility that dicumarol blocks other reductase(s).</p>
<p>In summary, the assay system we developed is effective for identifying inhibitors of episomal DNA. Our screening is still on-going, and the identification of additional inhibitors will provide insights into the host mechanism of eradicating non-chromosomal small DNA. Whether viral DNA with a replication origin is controlled by this mechanism is also of interest.</p>
