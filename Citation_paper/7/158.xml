          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p>To evaluate CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells (T<sub>REG</sub>) and associated immune-regulatory pathways in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients and healthy volunteers. We subsequently investigated the effects of immunotherapy on circulating T<sub>REG</sub> combining an extensive phenotype examination, DNA methylation analysis and global transcriptome analysis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Design</title>
          <p>Eighteen patients with mRCC and twelve volunteers (controls) were available for analysis. T<sub>REG</sub> phenotype was examined using flow cytometry (FCM). T<sub>REG</sub> were also quantified by analyzing the epigenetic status of the FOXP3 locus using methylation specific PCR. As a third approach, RNA of the PBL was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays and the gene signatures were explored using pathway analysis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We observed higher numbers of T<sub>REG</sub> in pre-treatment PBL of mRCC patients compared to controls. A significant increase in T<sub>REG</sub> was detected in all mRCC patients after the two cycles of immunotherapy. The expansion of T<sub>REG</sub> was significantly higher in non-responders than in responding patients. Methylation specific PCR confirmed the FCM data and circumvented the variability and subjectivity of the FCM method. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the microarray data showed significant enrichment of FOXP3 target genes, CTLA-4 and TGF-ß associated pathways in the patient cohort.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Immune monitoring of the peripheral blood and tumor tissue is important for a wide range of diseases and treatment strategies. Adoption of methodology for quantifying T<sub>REG</sub> with the least variability and subjectivity will enhance the ability to compare and interpret findings across studies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Although therapies with multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase or mTOR inhibitors or agents which block VEGF have made significant inroads in treatment of patients with mRCC, IL-2 therapy remains the only treatment that results in unmaintained sustained complete remissions, albeit in a small percentage of patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Atkins1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Motzer1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Atzpodien1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Cesana1">[4]</xref>. It is therefore important to identify biomarkers which would allow assessment of the probability for patients to benefit from IL-2 therapy. Increasing evidence suggests that immune regulatory pathways, especially regulatory T-cells are the key in limiting the benefits from IL-2 based immunotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Yao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Jacobs1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Wang1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Onishi1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We previously reported a study of 18 patients with mRCC who received intranodal vaccination with DC<sub>vacc</sub> in combination with intravenous high-dose IL-2 and subcutaneous IFN-α2a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Schwaab1">[9]</xref>. With this regimen we observed a surprisingly high objective response rate of 44% (3 complete responses, 5 partial responses, median time to progression of 8 months). In this study we seek to better define the circulating T<sub>REG</sub> population and associated pathways in these mRCC patients using FCM, methylation specific PCR and whole genome transcriptome analysis.</p>
      <p>Naturally occurring CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T-cells (nT<sub>REG</sub>) are a subpopulation of CD4 T-cells capable of suppressing the activation and expansion of T-effector cells, thereby inhibiting the onset of autoimmunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Sakaguchi1">[10]</xref>. T<sub>REG</sub> are characterized by constitutive expression of the IL-2R α-chain (CD25), GITR, CTLA-4, IL-10 and TGF-ß <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Yi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Lafaille1">[12]</xref>. FOXP3, a member of the forkhead-family of transcription factors is the master regulator of T<sub>REG</sub> development and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Ziegler1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Fontenot1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Hori1">[15]</xref>. Loss of FoxP3 leads to functionally deficient T<sub>REG</sub> and causes fatal autoimmunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Bennett1">[16]</xref>. Tumors often induce the expansion of T<sub>REG</sub> cells and recruit them to the tumor site via soluble factors such as IL10, TGF-ß and VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Zou1">[17]</xref>. Hence, cancer patients have significantly more T<sub>REG</sub> in their blood than healthy humans and show infiltration of the tumor with T<sub>REG</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Cesana2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Liyanage1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Wolf1">[20]</xref>. IL-2 was initially described as T-cell growth factor and as a consequence used in immunotherapy of RCC and melanoma. However, it has recently been shown that IL-2 therapy substantially expands the number of T<sub>REG</sub> in cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Cesana2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Ahmadzadeh1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Zorn1">[22]</xref>. Some studies, including ours, suggest that non-responding patients show a higher expansion of T<sub>REG</sub> following IL-2 based immunotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Schwaab2">[23]</xref>. IL-2 signalling induces the expression of FOXP3 in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells through binding of phosphorylated STAT5 to the FOXP3 proximal promoter and intron enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Zorn1">[22]</xref>. Thus, IL-2 is a crucial factor for the development and maintenance of T<sub>REG</sub> in the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Fontenot2">[24]</xref>. How the tolerance inducing capacity of IL-2 can be reconciled with the anti-tumor effects in 15–25% of patients with mRCC and melanoma remains elusive.</p>
      <p>Recently published data shows that FOXP3 and CD25 are not T<sub>REG</sub>-only specific markers. Although new markers are continuing to be found and better gating strategies are proposed (e.g. CD127<sup>low/−</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Sakaguchi2">[25]</xref>, a clear and concise definition of a FCM-staining panel defining “true” human T<sub>REG</sub> is still elusive. In addition, FOXP3 is transiently upregulated in human naive T-cells after stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Pillai1">[26]</xref>. Therefore, it is questionable whether it is possible to distinguish between true T<sub>REG</sub> and recently stimulated T-cells solely by combined staining for CD25 and FOXP3. Nevertheless, the mainstay for quantification of T<sub>REG</sub> in the majority of clinical studies has been the enumeration of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T-cells with or without inclusion of CD25 via FCM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Yao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Cesana2">[18]</xref>. Due to the lack of a consensus staining panel for T<sub>REG</sub>, published studies have used different markers and gating strategies for the quantification of T<sub>REG</sub>, making comparisons between the studies challenging.</p>
      <p>Analyzing the epigenetic status of the FOXP3 locus using methylation specific PCR might be a significant step towards improved quantification of T<sub>REG</sub>. Within the FOXP3 locus exist at least three highly conserved CpG motifs which control FOXP3 expression and are subject to epigenetic modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Huehn1">[27]</xref>. One of them, the TSDR (T<sub>REG</sub> cell specific demethylation region) shows complete and very specific demethylation in T<sub>REG</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Baron1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Floess1">[29]</xref>. Neither <italic>in vitro</italic> (stimulation with TGFß) generated induced T<sub>REG</sub> (iT<sub>REG</sub>) expressing FOXP3 nor any other immune cells have a complete demethylated TSDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Floess1">[29]</xref>. This is consistent with data showing that <italic>in vitro</italic> generated T<sub>REG</sub> display an unstable FOXP3 expression and suppressive potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Baron1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Polansky1">[30]</xref>. In contrast, T<sub>REG</sub> which are induced <italic>in vivo</italic> by delivery of antigen under tolerogenic conditions show stable long term FOXP3 expression and suppressive potential along with complete demethylation of the TSDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Polansky1">[30]</xref>. In summary, the methylation status of the TSDR controls the stability and longevity of FOXP3 expression and is responsible for imprinting of a long lasting suppressive T<sub>REG</sub>-phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Huehn1">[27]</xref>. It is thus possible to quantify the amount of T<sub>REG</sub> in a mixed population of cells by determining copy number of demethylated and methylated TSDR by quantitative PCR after bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA. One aim of this study is to compare how well the FCM determined changes in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T-cells translate into changes of T-cells which have a long lasting T<sub>REG</sub> suppressive phenotype due to epigenetic modification of the FOXP3 locus.</p>
      <p>With Microarray technology becoming more and more widespread, whole genome transcriptome profiling of PBL and peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been reported to be a potential biomarker surrogate for several medical conditions, including mRCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Showe1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Twine1">[32]</xref>. In this study we also examined how changes in immune cell subsets translate into changes seen in the PBL gene expression profile and to explore if this approach could be useful for monitoring immune-regulatory pathways during immunotherapy. RNA from patient PBL samples before (n = 17) and after therapy (n = 13) as well as from PBL of controls (n = 9) was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. The analysis revealed significant enrichment of gene sets and pathways associated with inflammation and counter-regulation in the peripheral blood of mRCC patients compared to healthy controls.</p>

        <title>Definition of FCM gates</title>
        <p>Our FCM data is from multi-parameter staining of PBL samples with a combination of CD3, CD4, CD25 and intra-nuclear FOXP3. For comparisons to the PCR data (see below) we define T<sub>REG</sub> based on two gating strategies relevant to the published T<sub>REG</sub> data from human immunotherapy trials. The gating strategies employed for the T<sub>REG</sub> are shown in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046600.s005">Fig S5</xref>. Lymphocytes are pregated on CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T-helper cells. The FOXP3<sup>+</sup> events within the CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> population are defined as single positive regulatory T-cells and subsequently referred to as <bold>SP-T<sub>REG</sub></bold> (<bold>SP-T<sub>REG</sub> = CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup></bold>). The CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> events within the T–helper cell population are defined as double positive regulatory T-cells and will be called <bold>DP-T<sub>REG</sub> (DP-T<sub>REG</sub> = CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup>)</bold>. The FCM determined amount of T<sub>REG</sub> is presented as a percentage with a numerator of SP- or DP-T<sub>REG</sub>, and a denominator of the total lymphocytes (PBL) or the CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cell population. These proportions are compared to the %TSDR of total lymphocytes or %TSDR of CD3-T-cells as determined by methylation specific PCR. The absolute number of Tregs were quantified by a complete blood count performed the day of the elutriation of the PBL. Absolute Treg numbers were calculated by multiplying the proportion of DP-T<sub>REG</sub>/PBL as quantified by FCM with the absolute lymphocyte count/ul from the blood count. For analysis of the surface markers GITR, CTLA-4, CCR7 and CD45 isoforms cells were pregated on lymphocytes and then 1–2% of these cells which were CD4<sup>+</sup> and had the highest expression of CD25 were selected for analysis. This gating strategy resulted in a subset of cells that was nearly 100% FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T-cells (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046600.s001">Fig S1A</xref>).

        <p>We further characterized the T<sub>REG</sub> cell population in the patients by evaluating the expression of CTLA-4, GITR, CCR7 and CD45RA within the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup> compartment (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046600.s002">Fig S2A</xref>). CTLA-4 could be found consistently on the surface of about 80% of the CD4CD25<sup>high</sup> population of healthy donors as well as in patients before and after therapy. GITR, however, was only detected on a minor fraction of CD4CD25<sup>high</sup> cells. Most CD4CD25<sup>high</sup> were found to belong to the central memory subtype in both patients and healthy donors (<italic>%CCR7<sup>+</sup> CD45RA<sup>−</sup>:</italic><bold>Pt 63.8</bold>±16.4 vs <bold>HD 56.6</bold>±33.4; ns; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046600.s002">Fig S2B</xref>).

        <p>In further analysis, the expression of CTLA-4 and GITR did not significantly differ between pre and post-therapy T<sub>REG</sub>.

        <p>Overall, responding patients showed a lower amount of dTSDR in their samples after therapy.

The PCR based method generally reported a higher proportion of T<sub>REG</sub> cells than the respective T<sub>REG</sub> proportions as determined by FCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046600-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Particularly FCM gating on DP-T<sub>REG</sub> cells seemed to underestimate the proportion of regulatory T-cells as quantified by PCR by a factor of more than 2.

This selection was done to increase test power and reduce irrelevant discoveries by testing thousands of gene sets stored in the database not related to the immune system.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In recent years it has become evident that tumors actively evade eradication by the immune system by several mechanisms. T<sub>REG</sub> are a notable one of these, and are now considered a major obstacle towards successful immunotherapy. Several studies have addressed the role of T<sub>REG</sub> in the clinical setting of cytokine therapy, particularly in melanoma and mRCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Yao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Cesana2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Ahmadzadeh1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Jensen1">[40]</xref>. In this analysis, we determined the impact of combined vaccination and high dose cytokine therapy on number and function of T<sub>REG</sub> cells <italic>in vivo</italic> employing three different methodological approaches currently available for immune monitoring of clinical trial samples.</p>
      <p>Our study confirms previous reports that mRCC patients have higher numbers of circulating T<sub>REG</sub> than healthy controls. We demonstrated that the expanded T<sub>REG</sub> cells in mRCC patients are functional and further characterized them as similar to those in healthy individuals with regard to expression of CTLA-4 and GITR, as well as naive and memory phenotype.</p>
      <p>DC-vaccination combined with high dose IL-2 and IFNα increased the absolute number and percentage of circulating T<sub>REG</sub> significantly. In the course of therapy responding patients exhibited a significantly smaller expansion of their T<sub>REG</sub> cells. The group of patients enrolled in this trial were mainly in the intermediate MSKCC category. This homogeneity of patient stage should limit a possible influence of the overall tumor burden on the outcomes observed. Our results corroborate previous findings of at least three other groups. Jensen et al. looked for FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells in mRCC tumor core biopsies in patients undergoing IL-2 therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Jensen1">[40]</xref>. They showed that intra-tumoral FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory immune cells significantly increase during IL-2-based immunotherapy. Patients with high expansion of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells in biopsy specimens had a significantly worse prognosis than patients with only a moderate rise in the FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cell numbers. Cesana et al. reported a poor outcome for patients with a very high number of T<sub>REG</sub> in their blood after IL-2 based immunotherapy as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Cesana2">[18]</xref>. Rosenberg et al evaluated the outcome from four clinical trials employing adoptive T-cell transfer combined with various conditioning regimes and found that the levels of endogenous CD4+ FoxP3+ T-cells are inversely correlated with outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Yao1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Some studies have reported that higher numbers of T<sub>REG</sub> in the blood at the beginning of therapy influenced the outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Tatsugami1">[41]</xref>. Although we found significantly lower pre-treatment T<sub>REG</sub> proportions in responding patients based on the SP- T<sub>REG</sub> FCM gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046600-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), it was not statistically confirmed based on the DP-T<sub>REG</sub> FCM gating strategy or the PCR method. Notably, in our study the patient who had the highest pre-treatment T<sub>REG</sub> proportion of all the patients (#8) exhibited a long lasting complete remission. Strikingly, this was the only patient who had a significant reduction in the proportion of T<sub>REG</sub> as determined by FCM and PCR upon therapy, highlighting that minimizing the level of T<sub>REG</sub> expansion under immunotherapy might be more important for objective clinical responses than the pre-treatment T<sub>REG</sub> levels. Overall, our data support the use of quantifying T<sub>REG</sub> as a surrogate marker for monitoring immunotherapy in patients, and highlight the prognostic importance of T<sub>REG</sub> expansion under immunotherapy.</p>
      <p>In light of these results, methods that allow reliable and consistent measurement of stable suppressive T<sub>REG</sub> across studies are essential. The recently developed methylation specific PCR-based method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Wieczorek1">[38]</xref> to quantify T<sub>REG</sub> by determining the amount of demethylated (T<sub>REG</sub> specific) and methylated (all other immune cells) TSDR sequences in a sample may help achieve this goal. We consistently found a lower proportion of DP-T<sub>REG</sub> by FCM compared to the TSDR PCR method, which likely resulted from the presence of a significant amount of true T<sub>REG</sub> in the CD25<sup>low/−</sup> population which was excluded by conservative CD25+ FCM gating, but detected by the PCR method. Gating only on FOXP3+ T-cells (SP-T<sub>REG</sub>), as for example used by Rosenberg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Yao1">[5]</xref>, results in FCM T<sub>REG</sub> values that match the results of the PCR better, but the “noise” introduced by inclusion of recently activated FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T-cells which are not true T<sub>REG</sub> is reflected in a lower correlation of SP-T<sub>REG</sub> flow cytometry and PCR results. However, even though Rosenberg et al found, with a far larger number of patients than our study, a clear association between clinical response and T<sub>REG</sub> levels, they also found that the levels of T<sub>REG</sub> had a poor prediction confidence for clinical outcome using logistic multivariable regression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Yao1">[5]</xref>. The authors concluded that T<sub>REG</sub> levels are not useful as significant predictor of response to immunotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Yao1">[5]</xref>. However, in this study we show that gating on CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells has a lower prediction confidence for the true levels of T<sub>REG</sub> as gating on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>. The noise inherent to the CD4FoxP3 method might have contributed to the lack of predictive power found by Rosenberg et al. It is therefore neccessary to establish a more precise and reproducible measurement of T<sub>REG</sub> before final conclusions can be drawn whether T<sub>REG</sub> can serve as a useful biomarker or not.</p>
      <p>Most studies to date have only reported FCM results for T<sub>REG</sub> quantification, which brings into question the contribution of (IL-2) activated T-cells and transiently induced T<sub>REG</sub> to these results, as some of these cells express CD25 and FOXP3 without actually being stable functional T<sub>REG</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Huehn1">[27]</xref>. The methylation specific PCR results from our study show that IL-2 based immunotherapy leads to a substantial expansion of T-cells with a demethylated TSDR, i.e. T<sub>REG</sub> which have a long lasting suppressive phenotype due to epigenetic modification of the FOXP3 locus. More substantial expansion of T<sub>REG</sub> post- therapy in non-responding patients than in responding patients observed within the FCM data is supported by the PCR method results, although it does not reach statistical significance. This can be explained by a lower patient sample number available for PCR analysis (12 patients, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046600-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) compared to FCM (18 patients, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046600-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Whether IL-2 therapy expands the peripheral pool of T<sub>REG</sub> or enhances thymic output, or both, remains to be determined. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> of studies with greater patient numbers will be needed to establish whether the epigenetic method for T<sub>REG</sub> quantification is superior to predict patient outcome compared to FCM based strategies. In our study, incorporating additional FCM markers of T<sub>REG</sub> (CTLA4, GITR, etc.) did not allow further discrimination of treatment related or response related differences between patients. Our results support the use of the methylation specific PCR method because it circumvents much of the variability and subjectivity of the FCM method of T<sub>REG</sub> quantification.</p>
      <p>Genomewide transcriptional profiling of cell samples of patients is being adopted as a mainstay in the search for biomarkers predicting outcome or monitoring therapeutic response. We applied microarray analysis to PBL patient samples and healthy controls, and for this study focused on the impact of mRCC and immunotherapy on pathways associated with T<sub>REG</sub> and immunosuppressive cytokines using GSEA. Analyzing gene sets rather than single (“significant”) genes has been proven to be a valuable tool to compare clinical microarray datasets, due to the high variation inherent in patient derived expression profiles, leading to lack of reproducibility between studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Subramanian1">[36]</xref>. In GSEA the overall behaviour of groups of biologically related genes is assessed without arbitrary cut offs, which is more sensitive and less error prone than the single-significant gene approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Jiang1">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our study, expression profiles of mRCC patients were globally different from the healthy donors assigning them to a distinct cluster in PCA and unsupervised hierarchical clustering. This makes it possible to assign a sample to the patient or control cohort based on the gene expression signature. We queried more than 3000 gene sets available from public databases and found gene sets related to cell activation, cell cycling and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling were highly enriched in the mRCC patient samples, suggesting a state of enhanced activation of the immune system. A priori defined gene sets associated with regulatory T-cells comprising the FOXP3, TGF-ß, IL-2 and CTLA-4 pathways were highly upregulated in the patient samples. In contrast to the large difference between healthy donors and mRCC patients, we failed to detect robustly differentially regulated genes or gene sets between Pre and Post therapy nor between responding and non-responding patients using the preselected immune-regulatory gene sets. A possible explanation why the changes in the T<sub>REG</sub> compartment during therapy and between R and NR did not translate into readily dectectable changes in the expression profiles is that T<sub>REG</sub> comprise a relatively small subset of immune cells. It is highly likely that treatment related changes in other immune cell subsets e.g. NK cells and T-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Schwaab2">[23]</xref>, that make up a considerably larger fraction of PBL, mask the changes occuring within the T<sub>REG</sub> population. Furthermore, the considerable variance in the expression profiles of patients from different genetic background and clinical course as well as limitations in sample size restricted the power to detect possible differences. For a more thorough analysis and discussion of this dataset see Wolf et al. 2012 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046600-Wolf2">[43]</xref>. Larger studies across different cancer types are needed to clarify whether “cancer type specific” cell expression profiles do exist in PBMC and if they are useful for screening or monitoring (immune) therapy.</p>
      <p>In the clinic, cytokine therapy treatment for mRCC patients has been replaced by small molecule inhibitors or antibodies like Sorafenib/Sunitib which offer a higher response rate and less adverse effects. However, these treatments fail to induce long lasting (complete) remissions, which have been observed in a limited number of patients treated with immunotherapy. Combined multi-modality treatment strategies for cancer that incorporate ways to minimize T<sub>REG</sub> and other mechanisms of suppression, and that elicit tumor specific immunity using vaccines, cytokines or adoptive cellular approaches remain an attractive therapeutic approach. Monitoring treatment related changes in T<sub>REG</sub> in peripheral blood and tumor tissue will continue to be important for a wide range of diseases and treatment strategies, and “standardization” of T<sub>REG</sub> quantification would be beneficial.</p>

      <p>Statement of Translational Relevance: IL-2 based immunotherapy remains the only known treatment that can induce long lasting remissions in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). However, only a minority of patients will achieve a stable remission. Characterization of immune regulatory pathways is key to monitor, predict and understand the outcome of immunotherapy. We applied Flow Cytometry, methylation specific PCR and whole genome expression profiling to monitor the regulatory immune response in mRCC patients vaccinated with dendritic cells in combination with IL-2 and IFN-α2a. Our study confirms the prognostic importance of circulating regulatory T-cells (T<sub>REG</sub>) in patients undergoing immunotherapy and provides the first detailed comparative evaluation of different methods to determine their presence. Our results demonstrate that monitoring T<sub>REG</sub> during clinical studies using epigenetic markers is feasible, reliable and may potentially replace applying combinations of surface markers and flow cytometry. Furthermore, using expression profiling of peripheral lymphocytes we showed upregulation of FOXP3, TGF-ß, IL-2 and CTLA-4 pathways in mRCC patients compared to healthy volunteers confirming transcription of operational T<sub>REG</sub> pathways. Methylation specific PCR and whole genome expression profiling of peripheral blood lymphocytes is a promising approach in the evaluation of immune pathways in cancer patients.</p>
