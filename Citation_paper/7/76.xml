<abstract>
<p>We hypothesized that endothelial progenitor cells derived from individuals with diabetes would exhibit functional defects including inability to respond to hypoxia and altered paracrine/autocrine function that would impair the angiogenic potential of these cells. Circulating mononuclear cells isolated from diabetic (n = 69) and nondiabetic (n = 46) individuals were used to grow endothelial colony forming cells (ECFC), early endothelial progenitor cells (eEPCs) and isolate CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. ECFCs and eEPCs were established from only 15% of the diabetic individuals tested thus directing our main effort toward examination of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were plated in basal medium to obtain cell-free conditioned medium (CM). In CM derived from CD34<sup>+</sup> cells of diabetic individuals (diabetic-CM), the levels of stem cell factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and thrombopoietin were lower, and IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) levels were higher than CM derived from nondiabetic individuals (nondiabetic-CM). Hypoxia did not upregulate HIF1α in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells of diabetic origin. Migration and proliferation of nondiabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> cells toward diabetic-CM were lower compared to nondiabetic-CM. Attenuation of pressure-induced constriction, potentiation of bradykinin relaxation, and generation of cGMP and cAMP in arterioles were observed with nondiabetic-CM, but not with diabetic-CM. Diabetic-CM failed to induce endothelial tube formation from vascular tissue. These results suggest that diabetic subjects with microvascular complications exhibit severely limited capacity to generate ex-vivo expanded endothelial progenitor populations and that the vasoreparative dysfunction observed in diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> cells is due to impaired autocrine/paracrine function and reduced sensitivity to hypoxia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many diabetic individuals with ischemic cardiac and vascular disease remain symptomatic despite exhausting conventional medical therapy and mechanical revascularization. Increasing evidence suggests that microvascular insufficiency plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of this ischemia. Recognizing the magnitude of this problem, investigators have worked to develop new treatments that have led to the evolution of therapeutic angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Preclinical and clinical data provide evidence that growth factors and stem/progenitor cells may be used therapeutically for repair of ischemic tissue. Preclinical studies have provided evidence for safety and the potential therapeutic potency of vascular progenitor cells. Clinical trials using a variety of approaches have supporting the feasibility, safety and bioactivity of these cells for treatment of advanced cardiovascular disease with the goal of repairing ischemic tissue.</p>
<p>While the majority of clinical studies that are currently being undertaken involve the use of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, culture-derived cells such as endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) and early endothelial progenitors (eEPC) may represent an alternative for vascular repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Raval1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Yoder1">[3]</xref>. The cell surface marker CD34<sup>+</sup> distinguishes a progenitor population with marked clinical utility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Sekiguchi1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Losordo1">[5]</xref>. In individuals with diabetes, circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> cell numbers predict cardiovascular dysfunction and risk better than CD34<sup>+</sup>VEGFR2<sup>+</sup>- and CD133<sup>+</sup>-based populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Fadini1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Fadini2">[7]</xref>. Fadini et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Fadini3">[8]</xref> reported that circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> cell numbers represented an independent risk biomarker of cardiovascular events and significantly correlated with outcomes in metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>ECFC are “true” endothelial progenitor as the cells become endothelial cells and form capillaries as tested by the in vivo matrigel assay in SCID mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Yoder2">[9]</xref>. In addition to their angiogenic properties in vitro and in vivo, these cells can be differentiated by cell surface markers. ECFCs express the endothelial markers CD31, CD141, CD105, CD146, CD144, vWF, flk-1, and to a lesser extent, the progenitor cell markers CD133, CD34, and CD117. On the other hand, eEPCs also known as endothelial cell-colony forming cells (CFU-ECs), have myeloid progenitor cell activity, differentiate into phagocytic macrophages, and are not vasculogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Yoder1">[3]</xref> but have shown in vivo efficacy for vascular repair by promoting revascularization via paracrine mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Sieveking1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Mukai1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that autologous cells derived from diabetic patients are not as effective at tissue repair as those from nondiabetic or healthy volunteers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Loomans1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Tan1">[17]</xref>. As many cardiovascular disease patients who are candidates for cell therapy have diabetes, understanding the optimal stem/progenitor population to use is imperative. Thus, while individuals with diabetic complications represent a population that may greatly benefit from cellular therapy, their broadly dysfunctional cells limit the feasibility of an autologous cellular approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Jarajapu2">[18]</xref>. Diabetes is associated with a reduced number of circulating progenitor cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Fadini4">[19]</xref> and the cells demonstrate reduced proliferative potential, impaired migratory and generalized vasoreparative functions in <italic>in vivo</italic> models of vascular injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Jarajapu1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Caballero1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Schatteman1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Tepper1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>The degree of vascular engraftment by the cell populations used for vascular repair ranges from none to a modest percentage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Caballero1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Schatteman1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Asahara1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Harraz1">[23]</xref>. These differences may be due to the degree of injury and/or the particular vascular bed examined. However, in most cases, the increase in neovascularization/revascularization is not related to the precise number of cells that differentiate into endothelial cells, but rather to the paracrine effects provided by these cells. The cytokines and growth factors released from these cells stimulate resident endothelium to accelerate vascular repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Schatteman1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Harraz1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Awad1">[24]</xref>. Despite this, little is known about the secretome of endothelial progenitors and how this impacts the reparative capabilities in particular in diabetes.</p>
<p>Ramos et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Ramos1">[25]</xref> demonstrated that cord blood CD34<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup>CD133<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup> cells injected into the mouse hind limb ischemia (HLI) model did not integrate into the host vasculature; however, they successfully restored revascularization and blood flow. Forty-eight hours after local injection of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells into ischemic murine limbs, blood flow increased compared to untreated limbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Schatteman1">[20]</xref>; however, maximal effects were observed weeks later, when injected cells were no longer detected, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Schatteman1">[20]</xref> emphasizing the significance of their lingering paracrine modulatory effects.</p>
<p>A previous study by Majka et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Majka1">[26]</xref> reported that human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells release numerous growth factors and cytokines. Harraz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Harraz1">[23]</xref> showed that CD34<sup>−</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> or CD34<sup>−</sup> cells can incorporate into the endothelium of blood vessels in mouse ischemic limbs only in the presence of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, indicating paracrine modulation of CD14<sup>+</sup> cells by CD34<sup>+</sup> populations. Krenning et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Krenning1">[27]</xref> reported that CD34<sup>+</sup> cells modulate proliferation and endothelial differentiation of CD14<sup>+</sup> cells by releasing HGF, interleukin (IL)-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Recently, CD133<sup>+</sup> cells were shown to secrete interleukins, growth factors, and chemokines that are capable of accelerating vascular network formation <italic>in vivo</italic> and enhancing healing of ischemic ulcers in diabetic mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Barcelos1">[28]</xref>. Culture-derived progenitor cells release IL-8, producing a mitogenic effect on vascular endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-He1">[29]</xref>. Paracrine factors released by these cells confer cerebrovascular protection by increasing prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) production via COX2/PGI<sub>2</sub> synthase and by reducing thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Santhanam1">[30]</xref> Furthermore, these cells express cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and secrete PGI<sub>2</sub>, increasing angiogenesis via activation of PPARδ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-He2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>The reparative ability of progenitors is largely due to their capacity to home to areas of hypoxia. Thus, the sensitivity of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells to hypoxia plays a critical role in initiating the vasoreparative function of these cells. Hypoxic/ischemic environments release stromal cell-derived factor (SDF) and VEGF, and progenitor cells can only respond to these signals if they express CXCR4, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Ulyatt1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Semenza1">[33]</xref>. Furthermore, hypoxic preconditioning enhances the vasoreparative function of progenitor cells in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> angiogenesis assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Tang1">[34]</xref>, an effect that may be due to increased CXCR4, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 surface expression.</p>
<p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that diabetic individuals with microvascular complications would exhibit reduced ability to establish ex vivo expanded populations (eEPC and ECFC) and that diabetes alters the sensitivity to hypoxia, secretory profile and autocrine/paracrine functions of CD34 cells.</p>

<title>Patient Characteristics</title>
<p>We examined ECFCs as potential sources of vascular progenitors for autologous cell therapy. Peripheral blood was obtained from a cohort of subjects with Type 2 diabetic (T2D) (cohort 1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093965-t001">Table 1</xref>; n = 20) for isolation of ECFCs. Blood samples were always obtained between 1PM and 5 PM. Individuals were nonsmokers, were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents and were not taking insulin. Patient were not on statins, as they had no overt cardiovascular disease (CVD) all LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). Eight of 17 patients had documented BP ≥140/80 mm Hg prior to initiation of antihypertensive therapy and were followed in Endocrinology Clinic at University of Florida. The treatment strategy was in accordance with ADA guidelines and focused on life style changes as well as pharmacotherapy with ACEI (n = 6) or ARB (n = 2). These patients on treatment had BP of &lt;130/80 mm Hg. These same 8 patients also had modest (30–299 mg/day [microalbuminuria]) or high (≥300 mg/day [macroalbuminuria or clinical albuminuria]) urinary albumin excretion and one of the 8 individuals had nephropathy. Individuals were 30–69 years of age. There was a slight but not significant increase in the HgbA<sub>1C</sub> of the 17 diabetic individuals from which ECFC could not be grown. All 20 selected diabetic subjects were free of concurrent illness or other diseases known to influence CD34<sup>+</sup> cell function. Exclusion criteria were acute infection, immune diseases, current or past hematologic disorders or malignancy, drug-induced diabetes mellitus, unstable angina, recent (within 6 months) myocardial infarction or stroke, liver failure, dialysis because of renal failure, pregnancy, history of organ transplant, presence of graft and lack of consent to participate in the study. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093965-t001">Table 1</xref> illustrates main clinical data of the 20 subjects who were the participants in this first study.</p>

<title>Cell Isolation and Conditioned Medium (CM)</title>
<p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) were enriched for CD34<sup>+</sup> cells by immunomagnetic selection (Easysep, Human CD34 positive selection kit, StemCell Technologies, Inc.) as per supplier's instructions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Jarajapu1">[14]</xref> Briefly, total monocytes from peripheral blood were obtained by gradient centrifugation using ficoll reagent (Ficoll-Paque, GE Healthcare Biosciences). Plasma was completely excluded from the cell fraction by a series of washings using phosphate-buffered saline with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 mM EDTA. These cells were enriched for lineage negative cells by using a negative selection kit (StemCell Technologies, Inc.) as per supplier's instructions. Lineage negative cells were further enriched for CD34<sup>+</sup> cells by using a positive selection kit. CM was prepared by suspension culture of cells in endothelial basal medium (Lonza), for 18 hours in round bottom 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/150 μl/well. Medium was collected by centrifugation at 440×g for 10 minutes to remove cells and debris and concentrated 10× using CentriPrep filtering units (Amicon Ultra-15 Millipore centrifugal filter units, 3 kDa cut-off) at 4°C. CM was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and preserved at −80°C until analysis was performed. Basal medium was concentrated and preserved in a similar manner as the control medium where applicable. CM concentrates were used for quantitative analysis, and for experiments determining reactivity of intact arteries. However, unconcentrated CM was used for evaluating proliferation, cAMP and cGMP generation in intact arteries, and for evaluating their effect on angiogenesis. Quantitative analysis of selected cytokines and growth factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093965-t003">Table 3</xref>) in the CM was performed by AssayGate Inc. using the Luminex Bead-based immunoassay platform.</p>

<title>Diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> Progenitors Demonstrate a Distinct Paracrine Secretory Profile</title>
<p>Due to the limited ability to expand ECFCs from diabetic subjects, we directed our efforts to the examination of CD34<sup>+</sup> cell function, specifically their paracrine function which is critical for their reparative potential. Well-characterized DM individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093965-t002">Table 2</xref>) were compared to age and sex-matched nondiabetic subjects. Changes in the levels of factors in the CM of nondiabetic and diabetic cells are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093965-t003">Table 3</xref>. Levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), angiopoietin-1, FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt-3L), IL-3, IL-8, and IL-10 are unchanged (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093965-t003">Table 3</xref>), while erythropoietin, basic nerve growth factor, transforming growth factor (TGFβ3), and tumor necrosis factor (TNFβ) are undetectable. Notably, the potent stem cell growth factors, stem cell factor (SCF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and thrombopoietin (TPO) levels were significantly lower in diabetic-CM by 5- (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001), 9- (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.006), and 17-fold (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0002), respectively, compared to nondiabetic-CM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093965-t003">Table 3</xref>). Secreted levels of GM-CSF were higher in diabetic compared to nondiabetic-CM (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.03).</p>
<p>In healthy tissue, exogenous progenitors may act by regulating acute inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Schatteman2">[39]</xref>. However, diabetic progenitors may aggravate the inflammatory response. To test this possibility we examined levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, all well-known pro-inflammatory factors. All three factors increased in diabetic-CM (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, and <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, respectively) compared to nondiabetic-CM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093965-t003">Table 3</xref>). Previously, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 mRNA expression increased in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from T2D, which implicated TGF-β1 in the reparative dysfunction of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Bhatwadekar1">[40]</xref>. Thus, we examined the levels of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in diabetic-CM and found that the levels were similar in diabetic-CM and nondiabetic-CM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093965-t003">Table 3</xref>).

<p>Diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> cells do not respond to hypoxia-regulated factors, SDF-1 and VEGF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Jarajapu1">[14]</xref>. To elucidate the mechanism involved in this dysfunction, we examined the expression of receptors for SDF-1α and VEGF, and activation of HIF1α, which regulates the expression of SDF-1α and VEGF when cells are exposed to hypoxia. Activation of HIF1α and expression of CXCR4, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 under hypoxic conditions (pO<sub>2</sub> = 5 mm Hg) were quantified. As expected in nondiabetic CD34<sup>+</sup>cells, exposure to hypoxia for 4 hours increased HIF1α expression (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, n = 5); however, diabetic cells did not show any change in expression and remained lower compared to nondiabetic cells (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, n = 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093965-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To further confirm the reduced response to hypoxia in diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, cells were exposed to DMOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093965-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and HIF1α levels were determined. Similar to 4-hour hypoxia, DMOG treatment resulted in an increase in HIF1α in controls but not in diabetic cells.</p>

<title>Autocrine/Paracrine Proliferative and Migratory Functions are Impaired in Diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> Cells</title>

The effects of CM on proliferation and migration of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells obtained from nondiabetic individuals was evaluated next. After 72 hours of exposure to nondiabetic-CM, nondiabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> increased their proliferation as determined by division tracking cytometry using carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). Increased proliferation was shown by the higher number of events in the low intensity region M3 and lesser number of events in the high intensity region M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093965-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). In contrast, treatment with diabetic-CM did not support proliferation of these cells, as indicated by lower number of events in the M3 region (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, n = 4) and higher number of events in the M1 region (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, n = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093965-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These results were further confirmed by evaluating BrdU incorporation. This was quantitatively expressed as fold-increase compared to that observed in the presence of 10 μM mitomycin C, which is known to inhibit cell proliferation. In the basal medium, CD34<sup>+</sup> cells proliferated 1.6-fold, which was significantly enhanced to 3.2-fold by nondiabetic-CM (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, n = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093965-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

<title>Paracrine Vasodilatory Function is Impaired in Diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> Cells</title>
<p>Vasoreparative function of cells involves the ability of circulating angiogenic cells to dilate vasculature in areas of ischemic injury to enhance blood flow and increase delivery of reparative cells. Our hypothesis predicts that diabetic cells lack this paracrine vasodilatory effect. To test this possibility, we evaluated the effect of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells on healthy rat posterior cerebral arteries that are highly constrictive to intraluminal pressure and are known to mediate autoregulation of blood flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Johnson1">[41]</xref>.

<p>Next, the effect of paracrine factors in the diabetic-CM and nondiabetic-CM on the vascular reactivity was evaluated in wire-mounted mesenteric arteries. Contraction to phenylephrine and relaxation to bradykinin were evaluated in the presence of CM. In the presence of nondiabetic-CM, contraction to submaximal concentrations of phenylephrine (300 nM) was significantly attenuated (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.04, n = 4) compared to the control medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093965-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). However, this attenuation in contraction was not observed in the presence of diabetic-CM. Relaxation to submaximal concentrations of bradykinin (100 nM) was enhanced in the presence of nondiabetic-CM compared to the control medium (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), and this potentiation was not observed in the presence of diabetic-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093965-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

<p>The pro-angiogenic function of paracrine factors was evaluated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenesis assay using corporeal vascular tissue explants in matrigel culture. Formation of capillary-like tubular structures with sprouting endothelial cells is an indicator of angiogenic function. In the presence of basal medium, few endothelial cells migrated from the tissue sinusoids and formation of clear capillary tubes was minimal after five days of matrigel culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093965-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we report for the first time several highly novel findings. In diabetic individuals with microvascular complications, the ability to establish ECFCs in culture is markedly reduced. Martin-Ramirez et al has shown that success rate of generation of ECFCs are ∼80% from normal donors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-MartinRamirez1">[45]</xref>, whereas we found a failure rate of ∼85% in diabetic donors. Our results would thus suggest that it would be critical to establish ECFCs from a diabetic individual early in their disease when their peripheral blood retained sufficient numbers of these progenitor cells. The ECFC populations would require cell banking for later use by the individual when an autologous cell therapy would be considered for treatment of vascular complications.</p>
<p>While we have established that CD34<sup>+</sup> cells may be a more practical source of cells as no ex vivo expansion is required, these cells are largely dysfunctional and thus their utility as a cell therapy is also limited. Ex vivo manipulation to restore CD34<sup>+</sup> cell function would be required prior to reinfusion.</p>
<p>Our study also supports that human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from healthy individuals release a unique repertoire of growth factors and cytokines that demonstrate pro-proliferative, pro-migratory, pro- or anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory properties. Paracrine vasodilatory effects are mediated by directly enhancing generation of cGMP and cAMP in the vasculature. In contrast, diabetic-CD34<sup>+</sup> cells showed a marked decrease in the release of the proangiogenic factors SCF, HGF, and TPO but an increase of the pro-inflammatory factors GM-CSF, IL1β, IL6, and TNFα. Diabetic-CD34<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited impaired paracrine effects on vascular reactivity, tissue angiogenesis, proliferation, and migration. Furthermore, sensitivity to hypoxia was impaired in diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup>cells.</p>
<p>SCF, HGF, and TPO are pro-angiogenic, regulate proliferation, differentiation and migration of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, and stimulate vascular endothelial function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Ronnstrand1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Eguchi1">[50]</xref> Decreased release of these factors by diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup>cells was reflected in impaired proliferative and angiogenic responses of the diabetic-CM. Furthermore, this functional impairment was not compensated for by other pro-proliferative factors such as IL-3, Flt3L, or GM-CSF, whose levels were either unchanged or enhanced.</p>
<p>Higher levels of pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL1β, IL6, and TNFα, likely contributed to the impaired angiogenic function observed in diabetic cells. IL6 may promote an anti-angiogenic effect via inducing pathological vascular remodeling by activating bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR-II) signaling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Kristiansen1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Brock1">[52]</xref> GM-CSF, a hematopoietic cytokine, triggers the inflammatory cascade and, at relatively higher concentrations, stimulates mobilization of bone marrow-derived cells into the circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Mohty1">[53]</xref>. While an inflammatory response is required to initiate an angiogenic reaction,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Schatteman2">[39]</xref> a prolonged inflammatory stimulus typically impedes the angiogenic process.</p>
<p>The vascular repair process that originates from the bone marrow is triggered by cytokines, growth factors, and other inflammatory factors. In diabetes, an inadequate repair process can lead to a progressive amplification of the inflammatory signals due to the lack of a negative feedback inhibition. These signals in turn contribute to the exaggerated inflammatory reaction, further damaging the arterial wall and impairing the process of vascular repair.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-GoldschmidtClermont1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Ali1">[55]</xref></p>
<p>The present study suggests that IL-1β and TNF-α may play a major role in this amplification of inflammation, and that high levels of the anti-inflammatory factor, TGF-β, serve to counterbalance this inflammatory response at the expense of inducing growth inhibition in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Bhatwadekar1">[40]</xref> Moreover, even the higher expression of VEGF by diabetic-CD34<sup>+</sup>cells can represent an indicator of exaggerated inflammation rather than an indicator of hypoxia in the absence of nitric oxide (NO). VEGF promotes a pro-inflammatory cascade when intracellular NO levels are low and leads to enhanced proliferation, plus migration of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Nakagawa1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, an elegant study by Schatteman et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Schatteman2">[39]</xref> showed decreased secretion of TNFα and MCP1 in murine BM-Lin<sup>-</sup> cells of type-2 diabetic (<italic>Lepr<sup>db</sup></italic>) origin compared to wild-type mice, with no change in the secretion of IL1β, IL4, and IL6. Furthermore, secretion of IL2, IL5, IL10, IL12, and GM-CSF was not observed in this study. IL6 expression was not significantly changed in STZ-diabetic Lin<sup>-</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup> cells compared to wild type mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Orlandi1">[57]</xref> These studies, when compared to the current study using human CD34<sup>+</sup>cells, suggest differences in the secretion profile of murine bone marrow-derived cells vs. human peripheral blood CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.</p>
<p>Recently, we have shown that TGFβ1 mediates vasoreparative dysfunction in CD34<sup>+</sup>cells from diabetics and that the transient blockade of the expression of TGFβ1 or PAI-1, the main gene target of TGFβ, restores vasoreparative function. In our previous study, we only examined changes in TGFβ mRNA levels of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and did not examine the secretion pattern of TGFβ1.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Bhatwadekar1">[40]</xref> In the present study, we show that the secreted levels of TGFβ1 were similar in nondiabetic and diabetic cells. However, levels of decorin were significantly reduced in diabetic-CM. Decorin modulates TGFβ1 function by regulating its bioavailability and intracellular signaling, and it is considered a natural antagonist of TGFβ1.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Yamaguchi1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-AbdelWahab1">[59]</xref> Reduced decorin levels would therefore result in prolonged TGFβ1-mediated effects of diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.</p>
<p>IGF1 protects against endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and cardiac ischemic damage,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Juul1">[60]</xref> and was shown to enhance proliferation of CD34<sup>+</sup> and mesenchymal progenitor cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Dempsey1">[61]</xref> In a similar manner, we and others have shown that IGFBP-3 has IGF1-independent vascular protective effects by enhancing vasoreparative functions of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and their mobilization from bone marrow into the circulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Jarajapu6">[62]</xref> Increased secretion of these two factors by diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup>cells may represent a compensatory effect but clearly is not sufficient to rescue their reparative function.</p>
<p>Previously, we have shown that the diabetic cells do not respond to hypoxia in in vivo models of retinal ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Caballero1">[15]</xref> and we have also demonstrated that the diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup>cells do not migrate towards hypoxia regulated factors, SDF-1 and VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Segal1">[63]</xref>. In the current study, we have observed that the diabetic cells did not respond to hypoxia by up-regulating HIF1α that was accompanied by significant changes in the receptors' expression in response to hypoxia. CXCR4 expression was decreased in diabetic cells following exposure to hypoxia; whereas, VEGFR1 expression was increased. The observation of a decrease in VEGFR2 surface expression was unexpected but highly reproducible, while it is difficult to explain. We postulate that there is internalization of VEGFR2 when cells are transferred from standard incubator conditions to either hypoxia or physiologic conditions as occurred in this study. We and others have shown that VEGFRs are internalized either for degradation or translocated to other parts of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Narazaki1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Smith1">[66]</xref>.</p>
<p>We further demonstrate autocrine/paracrine functions of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in inducing migration and endothelial sprouting and capillary tube formation from tissue-resident endothelial cells. It would be difficult to attribute these beneficial functions to one or another paracrine factor produced by these cells. Rather, it could be a net effect of the combination of these factors. The migration studies were designed to examine the cumulative effects of the molecules in the CM, rather than specific factors. The conclusions from migration studies, however, must be considered within the context of the technical limitations of the study design. The isolated CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were maintained in a serum-free environment in order to exclude the contribution of factors in the serum, and the cells were kept in static (no flow) conditions. Nonetheless, the “net” effect of the CM is greatly impaired in diabetes. Awad et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Awad1">[24]</xref> reported that obesity and diabetes, together, convert the pro-angiogenic phenotype to an anti-angiogenic phenotype in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. These findings can largely be explained by paracrine release of anti-angiogenic factors by CD34<sup>+</sup> cells of obese/diabetic origin.</p>
<p>Our study provides direct evidence for the paracrine vascular effects of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and provides compelling evidence for paracrine dysfunction of diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> cells on the vasculature. Significant dilatory effects were observed by the intraluminal application of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and by their CM in arteries. Signaling mechanisms involving cGMP and cAMP are major pathways that mediate vasodilation in response to the majority of endogenous vasodilators. According to our study, CD34<sup>+</sup> cells promote vasodilation by attenuating vascular tone in response to intraluminal pressure. In agreement, nondiabetic-CM attenuated constriction to phenylephrine, potentiated dilation to bradykinin, and increased generation of cGMP and cAMP levels in the vascular wall. Dilation of arterioles in the peri-ischemic areas accelerates the process of vascular repair by enhancing blood flow, thereby increasing the delivery of reparative cells and transport of circulating vasoactive substances. These beneficial vascular effects were impaired in diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.</p>
<p>It is presently thought that diabetic CD34<sup>+</sup> cells will likely need <italic>ex vivo</italic> modification prior to their utilization in any treatment strategy. Assessment of their secretory profiles may represent a critical way to evaluate their therapeutic utility prior to use as a cell therapy. Thus, evaluation of their paracrine secretory profile may be the key component for the optimization of these cells as a vasoreparative population. Previously, overexpression of Akt/PKB in mesenchymal stem cells was shown to enhance their cardiac reparative function by paracrine mechanisms and was used to assess therapeutic utility; although, the cells studied were derived from normal mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Gnecchi1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093965-Mirotsou1">[68]</xref></p>
<p>In conclusion, this study suggests that the ex vivo expanded population, ECFCs may be limited as a viable therapeutic option, unless these cells are obtained early in the disease prior to the development of microvascular complications. While CD34<sup>+</sup> cells can be easily obtained from diabetics with complications, these cells have marked paracrine dysfunction and an altered response to hypoxia that likely mediates much of this dysfunction and limits there therapeutic utility. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> strategies are now being developed to correct autologous CD34<sup>+</sup> cell dysfunction prior to reintroducing these cells to the patient for treatment of vascular complications in diabetic individuals. Furthermore, our results suggest that hypoxia responsiveness and measurement of key secreted factors of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells may provide the critical information to valid the subsequent in vivo function of these cells. Use of these additional parameters may provide a more rational basis for determining the therapeutic utility of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and would likely improve outcomes of clinical trials using autologous cells.</p>
