<abstract>
<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major etiological pathogens for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic HBV infection is a key factor in these severe liver diseases. During infection, HBV forms a nuclear viral episome in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Current therapies are not able to efficiently eliminate cccDNA from infected hepatocytes. cccDNA is a master template for viral replication that is formed by the conversion of its precursor, relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA). However, the host factors critical for cccDNA formation remain to be determined. Here, we assessed whether one potential host factor, flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 (FEN1), is involved in cleavage of the flap-like structure in rcDNA. In a cell culture HBV model (Hep38.7-Tet), expression and activity of FEN1 were reduced by siRNA, shRNA, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, and a FEN1 inhibitor. These reductions in FEN1 expression and activity did not affect nucleocapsid DNA (NC-DNA) production, but did reduce cccDNA levels in Hep38.7-Tet cells. Exogenous overexpression of wild-type FEN1 rescued the reduced cccDNA production in FEN1-depleted Hep38.7-Tet cells. Anti-FEN1 immunoprecipitation revealed the binding of FEN1 to HBV DNA. An <italic>in vitro</italic> FEN activity assay demonstrated cleavage of 5′-flap from a synthesized HBV DNA substrate. Furthermore, cccDNA was generated <italic>in vitro</italic> when purified rcDNA was incubated with recombinant FEN1, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase. Importantly, FEN1 was required for the <italic>in vitro</italic> cccDNA formation assay. These results demonstrate that FEN1 is involved in HBV cccDNA formation in cell culture system, and that FEN1, DNA polymerase, and ligase activities are sufficient to convert rcDNA into cccDNA <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a worldwide health problem that affects more than 350 million people. HBV is one of the major etiological pathogens for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is a key viral intermediate for persistent infection. However, the molecular mechanism of cccDNA formation has not been clarified. Here, we found that the host factor flap-endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is pivotal in cccDNA formation. We developed a novel cccDNA formation assay by the incubation of purified viral DNA with recombinant FEN1, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cccDNA formation and proposes FEN1 as a potential anti-HBV drug target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major pathogenic cause of human cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref001">1</xref>]. Infectious HBV particles contain relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) encapsidated by core proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref002">2</xref>]. After entering the host hepatocyte, rcDNA is converted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is stably maintained as an episome in the nucleus. cccDNA serves as the template for all HBV transcripts, including pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), a viral replicative intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref004">4</xref>]. pgRNA, viral reverse transcriptase P protein, and core proteins assemble into a nucleocapsid, where pgRNA undergoes reverse transcription by the P protein to produce rcDNA. The mature nucleocapsid is further assembled with surface proteins to allow secretion as an infectious virion. Alternatively, the rcDNA containing nucleocapsid is recycled back to the nucleus to maintain the pool of cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Reverse-transcriptase inhibitors are the major medical intervention for controlling HBV infection. These inhibitors can effectively shut down viral replication, but are unable to eliminate cccDNA from infected hepatocytes; this inability often leads to viral rebound upon therapy withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref006">6</xref>]. New therapeutic approaches are needed to target the mechanisms of cccDNA maintenance and generation. However, a lack of comprehensive knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of cccDNA formation and maintenance has hampered the effective development of such approaches.</p>
<p>The cccDNA precursor rcDNA has unique structural features that are absent from cccDNA. These include a P protein-linked sequence approximately 10 nucleotides in length, known as terminal redundancy (r), which is located at the 5′ end of the minus-strand DNA, and a small RNA oligomer attached at the 5′ end of the plus strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref006">6</xref>]. The first step in cccDNA conversion from rcDNA is removal of the P protein and RNA oligomer linkage from the 5′ ends. Resulting protein-free rcDNA or deproteinized rcDNA is proposed to be a direct precursor to cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref008">8</xref>]. In addition to removing the r sequence and RNA oligomer from rcDNA, filling-in the single-stranded region and ligation of nicks in both DNA strands are required for cccDNA formation.</p>
<p>Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is a flap structure-specific endonuclease. FEN1 plays a role in removing 5′-flap structures formed during Okazaki fragment maturation and long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref010">10</xref>]. Because the r sequence and RNA oligomer at the 5′ end of rcDNA may form a 5′-flap structure, we examined the possible involvement of FEN1 in the removal of 5′-flap structures from rcDNA and its subsequent conversion to cccDNA.</p>

<title>The FEN1 inhibitor PTPD reduces HBV cccDNA levels</title>
<p>To determine whether FEN1 protein removes the r sequence from rcDNA, we designed a synthetic DNA substrate that mimics the 5′-flap structure of the r sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) by modifying an established FEN assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref011">11</xref>]. Human wild-type (wt) and catalytic mutant FEN1 proteins were prepared by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) and used for the HBV-FEN assay. Cleavage of the r sequence was determined by fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s001">S1C Fig</xref>) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Incubation with immunoprecipitated FEN1 protein caused an increase in cleavage of the synthetic r sequence over time when compared with that of the mock-precipitated protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Conversely, two catalytic mutant FEN1 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref012">12</xref>] lost their cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated the inhibition of flap endonuclease activity by the FEN1 inhibitor 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-1-phenylthieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (PTPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref013">13</xref>]. In the current study, we examined whether PTPD could inhibit FEN activity of the immunoprecipitated FEN1 protein by using the HBV FEN assay. PTPD addition strongly inhibited FEN1 cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s001">S1E Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We used this inhibitor to explore the possible involvement of FEN1 in cccDNA formation in a cell culture system. Hep38.7-Tet cells replicate HBV and accumulate cccDNA after removing tetracycline from the culture medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref015">15</xref>]. Using Hep38.7-Tet cells, the production of viral HBV intermediates was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g001">Fig 1A–1E</xref>). Hirt extraction of cccDNA was followed by T5 exonuclease treatment to digest non-cccDNA molecules. T5 exonuclease removes nucleotides from 5′ termini, at gaps and nicks of linear or circular double-stranded DNA. The levels of cccDNA were determined by cccDNA-selective qPCR, which targets the gap region in rcDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref017">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To demonstrate selective detection of cccDNA by the cccDNA-selective qPCR, a control experiment was performed. The Hirt extracted DNA and secreted HBV DNA were prepared from Hep38.7-Tet cells. The same copy number of the Hirt extracted DNA and secreted HBV DNA was applied to the cccDNA-selective qPCR. Our cccDNA-selective qPCR quantitatively detected cccDNA only from the Hirt-extracted HBV DNA, but not from secreted HBV DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To characterize the effect of PTPD treatment in Hep38.7-Tet cells, the effect of a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, 3TC, was compared with that of PTPD. 3TC suppressed secreted and cytoplasmic nucleocapsid-associated DNA (cytoplasmic NC-DNA) and cccDNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>). These results were expected, as HBV NC-DNA and cccDNA generation were completely dependent on reverse transcription in Hep38.7-Tet cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), and 3TC was simultaneously added when Tet-CMV promoter was activated by removal of tetracycline from culture medium. Pre-C mRNA is transcribed from cccDNA, but not from the HBV transgene chromosomally integrated in cellular genome in the Hep38.7-Tet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref018">18</xref>]. Consistent with the decreasing cccDNA levels in 3TC-treated Hep38.7-Tet cells, 3TC also reduced pre-C mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g001">Fig 1C and 1E</xref>). Conversely, PTPD significantly decreased both cccDNA and pre-C mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g001">Fig 1C and 1E</xref>). Importantly, PTPD did not affect the levels of secreted and cytoplasmic NC-DNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>), confirming that transcription of pgRNA from the chromosomal copy was not affected by PTPD. Treating Hep38.7-Tet cells with PTPD (5 μM) for 5 days did not affect cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that PTPD blocked a step of cccDNA formation but did not inhibit reverse-transcription of pgRNA and cellular proliferation, as well as transcription from the HBV transgene.</p>

<title>Reduction in FEN1 expression decreases cccDNA levels</title>
<p>The FEN1 inhibitor experiments suggested that FEN1 is involved in cccDNA formation, but not rcDNA formation. However, the observed reduction of cccDNA level by PTPD was moderate, compared to that of 3TC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To confirm this result by different approaches, we performed small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based knockdown and genome editing. Two siRNAs designed against FEN1 mRNA and control siRNA were transfected into Hep38.7-Tet cells. Transfection of FEN1 siRNA reduced FEN1 mRNA and protein expression by more than half of the control siRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Consistent with the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g001">Fig 1</xref>, knockdown of FEN1 expression reduced, albeit moderately, the cccDNA levels without affecting the cytoplasmic NC-DNA level generated from the HBV transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>To further confirm the requirement for FEN1 in cccDNA formation, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing was applied to Hep38.7-Tet cells. We obtained two independent lines of <italic>FEN1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> Hep38.7-Tet cells; each had one base (T) insertion in exon 2 of the <italic>FEN1</italic> gene. The one-base insertion caused a frame shift and premature stop codon at amino acid position 102, immediately after insertion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses demonstrated reduced FEN1 expression up to approximately half of the parental Hep38.7-Tet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Consistent with the results obtained from the knockdown experiments, <italic>FEN1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> Hep38.7-Tet cells produced cccDNA at approximately half the level of parental Hep38.7-Tet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g002">Fig 2F</xref>).

<title>FEN1 inhibitor blocks HBV replication in infection models</title>
<p>Recent studies documented successful HBV infection in NTCP-expressing HepG2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref020">20</xref>]. Thus, we examined the involvement of FEN1 in cccDNA formation using NTCP-expressing HepG2 (HepG2-hNTCP-C4) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref019">19</xref>]. HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells were pretreated with PTPD for 1 day, and subsequently infected with HBV. HBV-infected HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells were cultivated for 3 days in the presence of PTPD, and cccDNA levels were determined by Southern blotting. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, the cccDNA level was mildly reduced by PTPD treatment (51.3% of control cccDNA level). Exposure of PTPD for 7 days in this cell line did not affect cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). To further confirm the results of infected HepG2-hNTCP-C4, we used PXB primary human hepatocytes derived from liver-humanized mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref021">21</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, PTPD treatment both inhibited secretion of HBV DNA and reduced HBV RNA levels in HBV-infected PXB cells. On the other hand, 3TC suppressed HBV DNA secretion but did not reduce HBV RNA levels. Importantly, in the infection model, rcDNA in the inoculum is first converted into cccDNA in the nucleus, and the newly produced cccDNA is transcribed into pgRNA, resulting in encapsidation and reverse-transcription in the nucleocapsid, yielding the mature virion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable that PTPD treatment reduced both cccDNA formation and HBV DNA secretion in HBV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). These results indicated that the FEN1 inhibitor blocks cccDNA formation following viral replication in infected NTCP-HepG2 cells and human primary hepatocytes.</p>

<p>To assess the requirement of nuclease activity and the C-terminus of FEN1 for cccDNA formation, we knocked-down endogenous FEN1 expression and simultaneously overexpressed either FLAG-tagged-wt, D181A, or ΔC FEN1 protein using the pResQ vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref025">25</xref>]. The pResQ lentiviral expression vector simultaneously expresses both short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of FEN1 mRNA (shFEN1) and exogenous wt or mutant FEN1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s008">S8B Fig</xref>, endogenous FEN1 expression in shFEN1-transduced cells (mock, wt, D181A, ΔC) was significantly lower than in cells transduced with control shRNA (shCtrl). Furthermore, overall FEN1 expression levels in shFEN1-expressing wt, D181A, and ΔC transfectants were substantially higher than in shCtrl- and shFEN1-expressing mock transfectants, due to the exogenous expression of FEN1 protein. Western blotting confirmed the reduction of endogenous FEN1 and the expression of exogenous FEN1 protein, although endogenous FEN1 protein is visible in knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). Cytoplasmic NC-DNA and cccDNA levels were also determined in these transfectants. All cells produced cytoplasmic NC-DNA at similar levels, while shFEN1-mock transfectants exhibited lower levels of cccDNA that were restored by wt FEN1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In addition, D181A and ΔC mutant transfectants tended to exhibit lower cccDNA levels than that of wt, although this tendency was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Although these experiments do not conclusively demonstrate cccDNA formation roles for the FEN1 protein catalytic site and C terminus, they do show that FEN1 expression is required for cccDNA formation.</p>
<p>Since the reduction of the cccDNA level in <italic>FEN1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> Hep38.7-Tet cells was moderate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g002">Fig 2G</xref>), we further examined the additive effect of genome editing and shRNA knockdown on cccDNA formation. pResQ shFEN1-mock lentiviral vector was transduced into two independent clones (#1 and #2) of <italic>FEN1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> Hep38.7-Tet cells. Endogenous FEN1 protein was effectively reduced in these <italic>FEN1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> shFEN1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s008">S8D Fig</xref>). Southern blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) showed that <italic>FEN1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> shFEN1 cells produced cytoplasmic NC-DNA as effectively as shRNA control cells (shCtrl). Meanwhile, the cccDNA level was clearly reduced in <italic>FEN1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> shFEN1 cells compared with shRNA control cells (39.7 and 25.9% of the control cccDNA level, respectively). The additive effect of cccDNA reduction with the combination of <italic>FEN1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>and FEN1 shRNA clearly indicates the requirement of FEN1 for cccDNA formation. It has been reported that rcDNA in Hirt extraction was reduced upon inhibition of cccDNA formation by knock-out of DNA ligases LIG1 and LIG3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref026">26</xref>]. It was proposed that nicked cccDNA behaves similar to rcDNA during electrophoresis, and a concurrent decrease of rcDNA may be due to a decrease in cccDNA formation. Reduction of rcDNA in Hirt DNA is also observed in our study (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g002">2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g004">4D</xref>).</p>

<title>FEN1 physically associates with HBV DNA in the nucleus</title>
<p>Subcellular localization of FEN1 protein was examined in HBV-replicating Hep38.7-Tet cells. As expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref025">25</xref>], wt FEN1 protein localized to the nucleus, which was disrupted by the ΔC mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

The cross linkage and fragmentation of DNA that were necessary for this approach can make it difficult to judge which viral DNA forms are precipitated during FEN1 immunoprecipitation. However, the ability of FEN1 to associate with any of the viral DNAs can be estimated by comparison of the immunoprecipitated HBV DNA levels in the FEN1 with the control IgG conditions. As predicted, a significantly higher level of HBV DNA was detected in the FEN1 wt precipitate compared with that in the control as well as with the ΔC mutant precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Importantly, the ΔC mutant, missing its nuclear targeting ability, exhibited decreased HBV DNA binding, relative to the wild type FEN1 protein. This finding suggests that wild type FEN1 localizes to the nucleus and associates with nuclear HBV DNA, such as nuclear rcDNA, either directly or indirectly.</p>

First, the FEN activity of recombinant FEN1 protein was reconfirmed by the HBV-FEN assay. Consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g001">Fig 1</xref>, recombinant FEN1 protein cleaved the r sequence from the synthetic HBV substrate in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Next, we determined whether recombinant enzymes, including FEN1, could convert the purified rcDNA into cccDNA. The purified NC-DNA from Hep38.7-Tet cells was incubated with recombinant FEN1, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase, and cccDNA formation was determined by cccDNA selective-qPCR, rolling circle amplification (RCA), and Southern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g006">Fig 6A–6D</xref>). RCA is able to speficically amplify closed circular DNA. The combination of FEN1, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase led to the significant production of cccDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g006">Fig 6B–6D</xref>). Meanwhile, incubation with two enzymes (DNA polymerase and DNA ligase) did not support efficient cccDNA formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g006">Fig 6B–6D</xref>). DNA sequencing of the closed circular DNA produced by three enzymes confirmed that the rcDNA gap region was precisely filled and did not have any mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, replication competency of in vitro-generated cccDNA was confirmed by transfecting the self-circularized RCA product into HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>). These results indicate that the circular DNA generated by incubating with FEN1, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase is functional HBV cccDNA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Host DNA repair factors are expected to be involved in cccDNA conversion because the virus genome does not encode the responsible DNA modifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref027">27</xref>]. The TDP2 enzyme has been proposed to remove P protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref028">28</xref>], although another study reported that TDP2 is not required for cccDNA formation <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref029">29</xref>]. We previously showed that the host DNA repair enzyme UNG removes uracil residues from deaminated duck HBV (DHBV) cccDNA (or its precursor), thus changing its mutation frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref030">30</xref>]. FEN1 plays a role in various DNA metabolic pathways, including Okazaki fragment maturation and LP-BER. During lagging strand DNA synthesis, Polδ/Polε use the strand exchange activity to produce the 5′-flap structure, and then FEN1 cleaves the 5′-flap and generates a ligatable end to facilitate lagging strand synthesis. In LP-BER, FEN1 removes the 5′-flap structure containing a damaged sugar and generates a ligatable 5′ end to facilitate its repair process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref010">10</xref>]. However, it remains unknown whether other back-up systems can substitute for absence of FEN1 activity.</p>
<p>During cccDNA formation, rcDNA-specific structures have to be removed. We assume that some of these rcDNA-specific structures form the 5′-flap structure. FEN1 is a good candidate to remove them. To test this, we utilized FEN1 loss-of-functional approaches in HBV-replicating cells, including a FEN1 inhibitor (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g003">3</xref>), siRNA and shRNA knockdown (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g004">4</xref>), and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The four different approaches of FEN1 loss of function showed the same trend, that is, a moderate reduction in cccDNA levels. We also utilized a combined approach of the genome editing and shRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). This method resulted in <italic>FEN1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>-FEN1 shRNA Hep38.7-Tet cells with a clearly reduced cccDNA level. This reduction seemed to be specific to cccDNA because NC-DNA production was not reduced in Hep38.7-Tet cells, which could produce NC-DNA from genome integrated HBV transgene. We interpreted this reduced level of cccDNA as a specific phenotype of FEN1 loss-of-function, rather than off-target effects from each approach. Infection experiments showed that inhibition of FEN1 activity reduced HBV DNA secretion in NTCP-expressing cells and primary human hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g003">Fig 3</xref>). FEN1 protein could cleave the r sequence <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s001">S1</xref>) and convert purified rcDNA into cccDNA along with DNA polymerase and ligase in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate, for the first time, that the host DNA repair factor FEN1 is involved in HBV cccDNA formation, at least in the experimental models used in this study.</p>
<p>The cccDNA was not eliminated completely, even when the combination approach for FEN1 loss-of-function was employed, suggesting the possibility of other redundant enzymes. FEN1 is a member of the RAD2/XPG structure-specific 5′-nuclease family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref032">32</xref>]. Among them, exonuclease 1 (Exo1) is another candidate to remove the HBV r sequence from rcDNA, because it has both 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity and endonuclease activity of the 5′-flap structure. Moreover, yeast genetic studies suggested that Exo1 and FEN1 activities may have a redundant role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref034">34</xref>]. The human genome encodes another flap-structure specific endonuclease designated DNA2. DNA2 plays a role to resolve a flap structure during Okazaki fragment maturation in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref035">35</xref>]. Further studies are needed to determine the host players other than FEN1 that remove the flap structure from rcDNA.</p>
<p>Inhibition of FEN1 activity did not lead to an obvious reduction in proliferation, at least in the experimental conditions used in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007124.s006">S6</xref> Figs). Consistent with our observation, it was reported that the PTPD inhibitor showed little or no effect on cell growth of the T24 bladder cell line, but increased sensitivity to a DNA damage agent, i.e. methyl methanesulfonate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref013">13</xref>]. Moreover, FEN1 mutations that abrogate nuclease activity have been detected in lung cancers and corresponding knock-in mice are viable with autoimmune, chronic inflammatory, and cancer phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref036">36</xref>]. Meanwhile another knock-in mice of FEN1 mutant (F343A and F344A) that lose ability to bind PCNA but retain nuclease activity, die at birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref037">37</xref>]. On the other hand, <italic>FEN1</italic><sup>−<italic>/−</italic></sup>mice, which have a complete knock-out of FEN1, have a lethality phenotype as early as embryonic day 3.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref038">38</xref>]. Recent biochemical and genetic approaches identified more than 30 FEN1 associating proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref032">32</xref>] including proteins involving in DNA replication, such as PCNA, apoptosis, telomere stability, post-transcriptional modification, and DNA repair. It is likely that complete loss of FEN1 protein in mammal manifests as a disturbance of cellular survival because both nuclease-dependent and -independent functions of FEN1 are disrupted. Meanwhile, inhibition of nuclease activity of FEN1 may not result in immediate disturbance of cellular proliferation. Consistent with this idea, the <italic>FEN1</italic><sup>−<italic>/−</italic></sup> cell line was not established in this study, even by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing.</p>
<p>The HBV-FEN assay revealed that FEN1 could remove the r sequence from a synthetic HBV DNA flap substrate. Moreover, the combination of FEN1, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase was sufficient to convert cccDNA from purified rcDNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. It has been reported that Polδ and Lig I cooperate with FEN1 in Okazaki fragment maturation, and Polβ and Lig III cooperate with FEN1 in LP-BER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref032">32</xref>]. However, the specific polymerase and ligase involved in HBV cccDNA formation remain unknown. Interestingly, the T5 exonuclease-resistant cccDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007124.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, top) migrated at approximately 3.4 kbp which is much higher position than that of cccDNA formed in infected hepatocytes, suggesting that its topology was different from cellular cccDNA. It is also possible for other additional factors such as topoisomerase and gyrase to be involved in cccDNA formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, further studies need to determine other host factors responsible for cccDNA formation.</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrate that reduced FEN1 expression and activity decreases cccDNA levels, and that FEN1 protein can bind and cleave the 5′-flap structure of HBV rcDNA <italic>in vitro</italic> to facilitate cccDNA conversion. The data implicate FEN1 as a critical enzyme involved in HBV cccDNA formation.</p>

For the negative control, HBV plasmid (pPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007124.ref030">30</xref>]) was amplified with RCA and then digested with PstI. Because the 5.4-kb PstI fragment has a partial HBV sequence, it was used as a replication-defective control. Self-circularized DNAs were transfected into HepG2 cells. Three days after transfection, HBV DNAs were analyzed by qPCR.</p>

<title>HBV FEN assay.</title>
<p>A fluorophore/quencher-labeled DNA substrate containing the 5′-flap structure of the HBV r sequence was incubated with immunoprecipitated Myc-FEN1 from 293FT transfectants (or immunoprecipitant from Mock-vector transfectant). Fluorescence signal (representing cleavage of the r sequence) was quantified. (A) Schematic presentation of DNA substrate. The substrate was prepared by annealing three synthesized oligonucleotides containing the HBV sequences. The complementary regions are indicated with lines. F represents the 5-TAMRA fluorophore, and Q represents the BHQ quencher. Cleavage of the 5´-flap structure (arrow) on the fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotide (red) results in release of fluorophore moiety from the quencher, and thus increases the fluorescence signal. (B) Western blotting for the immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged FEN1 proteins. FEN1 N has D181A mutation, whereas FEN1 NP has D181A, F343A, and F344A mutations. (C) Time course measurements of FEN1 activity. (D) After completion of the FEN fluorescence assay in C, cleavage of the flap structure was confirmed with urea-PAGE. Positions of substrate (31 nt) and cleaved product are indicated. (E) Inhibitory activity of PTPD was confirmed by the FEN assay.

<title>Verification of the cccDNA-selective qPCR.</title>
<p>HBV DNAs are purified from two fractions (culture supernatant, Hirt extraction) of Hep38.7-Tet cells. Hirt extracted DNA was further treated with T5 exonuclease. HBV DNA copy numbers from both fractions were determined by qPCR using primers indicated by p. To test selective amplification of cccDNA by our protocol, serial dilution of 1x10<sup>5</sup> copy/μl from 1x up to x1/8 were prepared from both fractions, then the cccDNA-selective qPCR was performed.</p>

<title>HBV replication cycle in Hep38.7-Tet and infected HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells.</title>
<p>A proposed model for the pathway of cccDNA formation in HBV replication cycle. After entry through the NTCP receptor, the viral genome translocates into the nucleus, and rcDNA is converted to cccDNA. The cccDNA conversion comprises the following steps: removal of viral polymerase (P protein), removal of r sequence and RNA oligomer, completion of DNA synthesis in single-stranded region, and ligation of DNA ends. In Hep38.7-Tet cells, viral replication starts from the chromosomally integrated HBV transgene under the control of Tet-CMV promoter. 3TC, a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, blocks the production of both rcDNA and cccDNA in Hep38.7-Tet cells. Meanwhile, infected HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells can form cccDNA in the presence of 3TC. This study proposes that FEN1 is involved in the second step of cccDNA formation. Pre-C mRNA is transcribed from cccDNA but not directly from the HBV transgene.</p>
