<abstract>
<p>The structural maintenance of chromosome 5/6 complex (Smc5/6) is a restriction factor that represses hepatitis B virus (HBV) transcription. HBV counters this restriction by expressing HBV X protein (HBx), which targets Smc5/6 for degradation. However, the mechanism by which Smc5/6 suppresses HBV transcription and how HBx is initially expressed is not known. In this study we characterized viral kinetics and the host response during HBV infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) to address these unresolved questions. We determined that Smc5/6 localizes with Nuclear Domain 10 (ND10) in PHH. Co-localization has functional implications since depletion of ND10 structural components alters the nuclear distribution of Smc6 and induces HBV gene expression in the absence of HBx. We also found that HBV infection and replication does not induce a prominent global host transcriptional response in PHH, either shortly after infection when Smc5/6 is present, or at later times post-infection when Smc5/6 has been degraded. Notably, HBV and an HBx-negative virus establish high level infection in PHH without inducing expression of interferon-stimulated genes or production of interferons or other cytokines. Our study also revealed that Smc5/6 is degraded in the majority of infected PHH by the time cccDNA transcription could be detected and that HBx RNA is present in cell culture-derived virus preparations as well as HBV patient plasma. Collectively, these data indicate that Smc5/6 is an intrinsic antiviral restriction factor that suppresses HBV transcription when localized to ND10 without inducing a detectable innate immune response. Our data also suggest that HBx protein may be initially expressed by delivery of extracellular HBx RNA into HBV-infected cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Approximately 250 million individuals have chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and more than 780,000 people die each year due to HBV-associated liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref002">2</xref>]. Multiple nucleos(t)ide analogs as well as interferon-α (IFN-α) are approved for the treatment of CHB, but since these therapies rarely lead to cure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref003">3</xref>] there is an urgent need to develop novel antiviral therapies. Therapeutic targeting of the HBV X protein (HBx) is attractive because this viral protein is essential for HBV infection in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref006">6</xref>] and is required for the initiation and maintenance of viral replication after in vitro infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref007">7</xref>]. Recent work has indicated that HBx plays this key role in the viral lifecycle by maintaining the covalently-closed circular DNA (cccDNA) HBV genome in a transcriptionally active state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref009">9</xref>]. Pharmaceutical targeting of HBx therefore has the potential to transcriptionally silence cccDNA. This would be an attractive therapeutic response since reducing viral antigen levels may restore effective antiviral immunity and drive patients towards functional cure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref010">10</xref>]. Moreover, HBx has been implicated in both the development and progression of HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref012">12</xref>] and so inhibiting HBx function may also have potential as a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention and/or treatment of HBV-related HCC.</p>
<p>We recently determined that cccDNA transcription is inhibited by the structural maintenance of chromosome 5/6 complex (Smc5/6), and that the key function of HBx is to redirect the DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase to target this complex for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>]. In this way, HBx alleviates transcriptional repression by Smc5/6 and stimulates HBV gene expression. However, the mechanism by which Smc5/6 restricts HBV transcription and how HBx is first expressed (since it is required for cccDNA transcription) has not been determined. It is also not known whether degradation of Smc5/6 by HBx plays a role in HBV pathogenesis. This is apposite because Smc5/6 has an essential role in maintaining cellular genomic stability and knock-out of both Smc6 and NSMCE2 (a subunit of Smc5/6) are embryonic lethal in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref015">15</xref>], Moreover, loss of Smc5/6 may predispose to genetic errors under conditions of DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref016">16</xref>], and reduced expression of the NSMCE2 subunit is associated with increased cancer incidence in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref015">15</xref>]. Therefore, while targeting Smc5/6 for degradation stimulates HBV gene expression, it may also contribute to the development and/or progression of HBV-related HCC.</p>
<p>Identifying the spatial relationship between cccDNA, Smc5/6 and other nuclear components may help elucidate the mechanism of HBV restriction by this host complex. Unfortunately, the low copy number of cccDNA together with technical challenges in differentiating it from other HBV nucleic acid species such as relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA), a replicative intermediate, have made it challenging to detect cccDNA in situ. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies indicate that Smc5/6 directly interacts with cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>], suggesting that the HBV genome may co-localize with this complex. Notably, Smc5/6 localizes to Nuclear Domain 10 (ND10) associated with telomeres in immortalized ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres) cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref017">17</xref>]. ND10, also known as PML bodies, are intranuclear complexes comprised of approximately 80 host proteins, including promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and speckled protein of 100 kDa (Sp100) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref019">19</xref>]. ND10 play a role in a variety of cellular homeostatic pathways, including host antiviral defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref021">21</xref>]. ND10 components traffic to the incoming genomes of many DNA viruses and restrict transcription from these extrachromosomal viral templates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref022">22</xref>]. In turn, many DNA viruses encode regulatory proteins that mediate the degradation or disruption of ND10 components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref021">21</xref>]. It is not known if Smc5/6 localizes to ND10 in non-transformed cells, such as primary human hepatocytes (PHH). Similarly, although HBV DNA has been reported to localize to PML foci in a stably HBV-producing hepatoma-derived cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref023">23</xref>], the role of ND10 in the viral replication cycle has not been studied in HBV-infected PHH.</p>
<p>Host nuclear viral DNA sensors, such as IFI16, have recently been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref024">24</xref>]. These pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in virally-infected cells and trigger innate immune responses, including production of IFNs and other cytokines. It is therefore notable that IFN-α treatment can silence HBV transcription and induces similar cccDNA epigenetic changes to those observed with HBx-negative virus (HBVΔX), i.e. when cccDNA is transcriptionally repressed by Smc5/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref025">25</xref>]. Since our previous data suggested that Smc5/6 directly interacts with cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>], it is possible that this complex senses the HBV genome and indirectly suppress cccDNA transcription by activating the hepatocyte innate immune response. Alternatively, Smc5/6 may inhibit HBV transcription independently of innate immune signaling either by sterically hindering access of host transcription factors and/or RNA polymerase to cccDNA or by directly modulating the epigenetic or topological state of cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref027">27</xref>]. Since interfering with viral escape from Smc5/6 may identify new therapeutic targets to activate antiviral responses within infected hepatocytes, determining the mechanistic basis of HBV restriction by this complex is an important new area of research.</p>
<p>While various hepatocyte cell lines that are susceptible to HBV infection have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref030">30</xref>], PHH derived from normal human donors likely represent the most physiologically relevant model for in vitro HBV infection studies. In the present study we report that PML and Sp100 influence the spatial organization of Smc5/6 in the nucleus of PHH, and that association of Smc5/6 to ND10 is important for transcriptional silencing of cccDNA. This study also reveals that HBx RNA is present in cell culture-derived virus preparations as well as CHB patient plasma. Smc5/6 is depleted from the majority of HBV-infected PHH by the time that cccDNA transcription can be detected, suggesting a functional role for this extracellular HBx RNA. Finally, our data suggest that Smc5/6 restriction of cccDNA transcription is not associated with induction of a detectable innate immune response. Collectively, these data indicate that Smc5/6 functions as an intrinsic restriction factor which suppresses HBV when localized to ND10. In addition, the detection of extracellular HBx RNA suggests that HBV employs a novel strategy amongst DNA viruses to counteract restriction by a host factor early after infection.</p>

<title>Smc5/6 co-localizes with PML and Sp100 in human hepatocytes</title>
<p>It has previously been shown that infection of PHH by HBV, but not HBVΔX, leads to degradation of Smc5/6 and that knock-down of Smc6 rescues HBVΔX transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>]. Interestingly, confocal imaging from this previous study revealed that Smc6 localized to nuclear foci in uninfected PHH, and that these nuclear substructures were reminiscent of ND10 bodies. In light of this observation, we evaluated whether Smc5 and Smc6 co-localize with components of ND10 in human hepatocytes. First, we determined that Smc6 co-localizes in the nucleus of human hepatocytes with PML, the primary structural component of ND10, both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g001">Fig 1A and 1D</xref>). We next confirmed that Smc5 co-localizes with both Smc6 and PML in PHH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Finally, we demonstrated that both Smc6 and PML co-localize with Sp100, another component of ND10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Single cell quantitation revealed &gt;90% of Smc5, Smc6, PML and Sp100 foci co-localized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), confirming that the nuclear Smc5/6 foci in human hepatocytes represent localization to ND10.</p>

<title>HBV infection does not alter PML and Sp100 levels in human hepatocytes</title>
<p>Many DNA viruses target ND10 components for degradation or disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref021">21</xref>]. We therefore evaluated whether HBx induces selective degradation of Smc5/6 from ND10 or whether these nuclear bodies are altered by HBV infection. By fluorescence microscopy we determined that PML is not depleted in HBV-infected hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref>). In contrast, Smc6 is degraded and disappears from ND10 after HBV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g001">Fig 1B and 1D</xref>). Consistent with these findings, Western blot analysis revealed that HBV infection reduced levels of Smc6, but not PML or Sp100 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s002">S2A Fig</xref>, black vs. grey bars). These data indicate that HBV promotes destruction of the Smc5/6 restriction factor from ND10, but does not alter PML or Sp100 levels in human hepatocytes.</p>

<title>Depletion of PML and Sp100 alters the nuclear distribution of Smc6 and stimulates HBVΔX transcription</title>
<p>Since Smc5/6 localizes to PML and Sp100, we next evaluated whether depletion of these ND10 structural components alters Smc6 levels or localization. Western Blot analysis of uninfected PHH demonstrated that Smc6, PML and Sp100 protein levels were substantially reduced (&gt;75%) after transfection with cognate siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Interestingly, while knock-down of PML and/or Sp100 did not significantly alter Smc6 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), it significantly reduced (&gt;90%) the number of Smc6 foci in PHH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This reduction in foci number (but not protein levels) suggests that Smc6 is dispersed throughout the nucleus in the absence of PML and Sp100.</p>

<p>In light of this finding, we evaluated whether these ND10 components modulate cccDNA transcription in the presence or absence of HBx. PHH were transfected with siRNAs targeting PML, Sp100 or Smc6, and then infected with HBV or HBVΔX. Consistent with the knock-down in uninfected cells, siRNA treatment substantially (&gt;80%) reduced PML and Sp100 protein levels in both HBV and HBVΔX-infected PHH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>], infection with HBV, but not HBVΔX, induced degradation of Smc6 in PHH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Treatment with the Smc6 siRNA did not further reduce Smc6 protein levels in HBV-infected PHH, but strongly reduced (&gt;95%) Smc6 protein levels in HBVΔX-infected PHH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Since Smc5/6 suppresses transcription of all detectable HBV RNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), we next performed a series of infection studies with the same siRNAs in which we measured HBeAg levels as a surrogate of cccDNA transcriptional status. HBVΔX transcription was strongly induced by Smc6 knockdown as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>], but was also partially rescued by knockdown of PML or Sp100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Strikingly, HBVΔX transcription with knock-down of both PML and Sp100 was comparable to that achieved by knocking-down Smc6 directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In contrast, wild-type HBV was not significantly modulated by knockdown of these ND10 structural subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that PML and Sp100 influence the spatial organization of Smc5/6 in the nucleus, and that localization of Smc5/6 to ND10 is important for silencing of cccDNA transcription in the absence of HBx.</p>

<title>HBx degrades Smc5/6 early after HBV infection</title>
<p>Our previous work indicated that Smc5/6 directly interacts with cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>], suggesting it might sense the HBV genome and trigger an innate immune response to suppress cccDNA transcription. Therefore, we investigated whether HBV infection induces innate immunity in PHH. However, to guide exploration of the host response to HBV, we first performed a series of studies to characterize the kinetics of viral infection in PHH. In these experiments, cccDNA and HBV RNAs could be detected by day 1 and 2 post-infection, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). As expected, viral antigen production displayed slower kinetics, with substantial HBeAg (&gt;100 ng/mL) detected from day 4 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>).

The plots represent the number of cells in each population, expressed as a percentage of the total nuclei analyzed (n≥237 per time-point). The HBV core background was calculated as the mean + 2 x standard deviations of the red channel background signal in mock-infected PHH. The Smc6 background was calculated as the mean—2 x standard deviations of the Smc6 level (green channel) in mock-infected PHH. Values above these limits were considered positive and values below were considered negative. HBV core and Smc6 status of HBV-infected PHH was determined using background levels calculated from time-matched mock-infected controls.</p>

<p>The differential kinetics of HBeAg and HBV core production relative to Smc6 degradation (a functional read-out of HBx expression) suggested that HBx may be expressed prior to other viral proteins after HBV infection. This interpretation is consistent with an RNA-Seq analysis which detected low numbers of viral reads that predominantly mapped within the HBx transcript region during the first 24 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

<title>HBx RNA is present in cell culture-derived virus preparations and CHB patient plasma</title>
<p>Since HBx RNA was present very early after infection—prior to transcription of the other HBV genes—we next investigated whether HBx RNA is associated with the viral input. RNA-Seq analysis of cell-free virus preparations from HepAD38 cells (which produce wild-type HBV) and HepG2-H1.3x- cells (which produce HBVΔX virus) detected viral reads that predominantly mapped within the HBx transcript region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g005">Fig 5</xref>, top). Importantly, viral reads mapping within the HBx transcript region were detected in plasma samples from viremic patients chronically infected with HBV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g005">Fig 5</xref>, bottom). It is notable that in all samples there was a lower number of reads mapping to the HBx transcript region before the second AUG in the open reading frame (at nucleotide position 1608) relative to the number of reads mapping to the rest of the HBx RNA. This may indicate a second transcription start site in HBx corresponding to a shorter protein, as has previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref031">31</xref>]. Lower numbers of viral reads were also detected in both cell culture and patient plasma samples that mapped across the HBV genome. This is consistent with a recent study which reported that pgRNA is present in HBV-like viral particles in HepAD38 cell supernatant and patient serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref032">32</xref>].</p>

HBV DNA levels in the patient isolates were ≥1x10<sup>9</sup> copies/mL. Of note, RNA-Seq analysis of plasma samples from two additional CHB patients also identified viral RNA reads enriched within the HBx region; however, this data was not included because the maximum coverage of the HBV genome was less than 100.

<p>Collectively, these data indicate that HBx RNA and protein is present in PHH shortly after infection. Therefore, if Smc5/6 triggers an innate immune response after detecting cccDNA, activation of hepatocyte antiviral immunity would be expected to be limited to the first few days after infection prior to accumulation of HBx protein. Accordingly, we next performed a series of studies to comprehensively characterize the early host response to infection.</p>

<title>HBV infection does not substantially alter the host transcriptome nor induce ISG expression in PHH</title>
<p>We first conducted a pilot study in highly infected PHH from a single donor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). To assess potential changes in gene expression between HBV-infected and mock-infected cells, RNA-Seq analysis was performed at ten time-points during the two week infection period. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the transcriptome data revealed close proximity between HBV-infected and time-matched mock-infected PHH, indicating a comparable temporal transcriptional profile in HBV-infected and mock-infected PHH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). However, there was a substantial temporal shift in the host transcriptome in both mock-infected and HBV-infected cells, likely associated to cell seeding and/or DMSO treatment, which stabilized several days post-infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). These changes were primarily driven by up-regulation of genes associated with lipid and bile acid metabolism and down-regulation of genes associated with protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s007">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s008">S8</xref> Figs). Most notably, culturing of the PHH prominently induced the FXR/RXR/LXR activation pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Importantly, genes expressed in mature hepatocytes, such as <italic>albumin</italic> (<italic>ALB</italic>), <italic>NTCP</italic> (<italic>SLC10A1</italic>), <italic>HNF-4α</italic> (<italic>HNF4A</italic>) and <italic>CK18</italic> (<italic>KRT18</italic>), had either stable or increased expression over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), indicating that the PHH retained characteristics of hepatocytes and were not de-differentiating under the culture conditions. This is consistent with the permissiveness of PHH to HBV infection up to 9 days post-seeding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, cell cycle-related transcriptional pathways were not induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), indicating that PHH remain in the G<sub>0</sub> stage of the cell cycle (i.e. are quiescent) after seeding in high (2%) DMSO. Overall, under these experimental conditions, high level HBV infection of PHH had little to no impact on the host transcriptome. However, since the substantial time-dependent changes in the PHH transcriptome may have reduced the sensitivity of this initial analysis in the first few days post-infection, subsequent studies evaluating transcriptional responses shortly after infection were performed in PHH that were not infected until at least 4 days post-seeding.</p>
<p>We next performed a study in two independent PHH donors as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g006">Fig 6A</xref>. High level infection (~80–90% PHH infected) at day 13 post-infection was confirmed by HBV core antigen staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). As previously described, transcriptome analysis demonstrated that a substantial increase of total HBV RNA was detected as early as day 2 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), consistent with the aforementioned Northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, HBV infection had only a very modest impact on the PHH transcriptome, with less than 60 of the 20,396 genes analyzed being differentially expressed (FDR&lt;0.05, fold-change &gt;2) at any one time-point post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s017">S1 Table</xref>). Furthermore, higher HBV RNA levels did not correlate with increased number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), indicating that there is no prominent or consistent transcriptional signature associated with HBV infection in PHH. We confirmed that the PHH can respond to innate immune stimuli by characterizing the transcriptional response of uninfected cells to treatment with IFN-α and poly(I:C) (a TLR3 agonist). As expected, these agents substantially modulated the PHH transcriptome, with &gt;2000 DEGs at 8 hours post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), including a large number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Sendai virus (a RIG-I agonist) also strongly induced ISG expression in the PHH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). In contrast, HBV infection did not induce coordinated expression of ISGs in either donor, and no ISGs were identified as DEGs at any time point post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g007">Fig 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s018">S2 Table</xref>). Notably, all PHH samples had very low sequence counts (range: 0–30 counts from ~30 million total reads per sample) of <italic>STING</italic> (<italic>TMEM173</italic>), an adaptor protein of an innate immune receptor (cGAS) that senses intracellular DNA. This is consistent with a recent study which reported that neither murine or human hepatocytes express STING [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref033">33</xref>].</p>

<title>HBVΔX infection does not induce IFNs or ISG expression in PHH</title>
<p>To directly determine whether transcriptional silencing of cccDNA via Smc5/6 is associated with induction of innate immunity, we next studied the PHH response to infection with HBVΔX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). We first demonstrated that there were little to no viral antigens produced by PHH infected with HBVΔX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, none), consistent with cccDNA being largely transcriptionally silent in the absence of HBx. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>], HBV antigen levels were restored by Smc6 knock-down, but not with a non-targeting control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, siSmc6 and siCtrl). The substantial antigens levels (&gt;400 ng/mL) induced by HBVΔX-infected PHH treated with siSmc6 were consistent with high level infection.

<p>It has previously been shown that HBVΔX infection leads to establishment of cccDNA but not degradation of Smc5/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>]. Therefore, if Smc5/6 triggers an innate immune response in hepatocytes after detecting cccDNA, it is expected that there would be prolonged activation of antiviral immunity after HBVΔX infection. However, HBVΔX infection did not induce the expression of two prototypic ISGs, <italic>RSAD2</italic> (Viperin) and <italic>IFIT1</italic> (ISG56), at any time point post-infection when cccDNA was transcriptionally silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, none or siCtrl). HBVΔX infection also did not induce coordinated ISG expression when cccDNA transcription was rescued by knock-down of Smc6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, siSmc6). The lack of ISG expression at day 13 post-infection with HBVΔX was confirmed using a second PHH donor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). HBVΔX also did not induce the production of IFNs or other cytokines in the presence or absence of Smc6 knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g009">Fig 9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s021">S5 Table</xref>). In contrast, IFN-α treatment strongly induced the expression of ISGs as well as production of IP-10 and various other cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g009">Fig 9C and 9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s021">S5 Table</xref>). Consistent with the lack of host response to HBV, these HBVΔX infection data indicate that transcriptional suppression of cccDNA by Smc5/6 is not associated with induction of a detectable innate immune response.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While the hepatocyte innate immune response to HBV is poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref034">34</xref>], it was recently demonstrated that HBV cccDNA is transcriptionally silenced by the Smc5/6 complex when HBx is not present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref035">35</xref>]. However, it is not known how Smc5/6 suppresses viral gene expression or whether depletion of this complex plays a role in evasion of innate immunity or HBV pathogenesis. In addition, it is not understood how HBx is initially expressed if it is required to alleviate transcriptional suppression by Smc5/6. In the current study we used PHH, a physiologically relevant system for in vitro studies, to characterize viral kinetics and the host response during the early stages of HBV infection in order to address these unresolved questions.</p>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Smc5/6 localization to ND10 is important for cccDNA restriction</title>
<p>We first demonstrated that Smc5/6 co-localizes with PML and Sp100 in ND10 in hepatocyte nuclei in the absence of HBV infection. Previously it has been shown that Smc5/6 is recruited to ND10 associated with telomeres in ALT cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref017">17</xref>]. In these cells, Smc5/6 localization to ND10 is cell cycle-regulated and is required for telomere elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref017">17</xref>]. In contrast to ALT cells, PHH are quiescent (i.e. in G<sub>0</sub>), and therefore Smc5/6 localization to ND10 in these non-dividing hepatocytes is likely not related to a role in telomere maintenance via the ALT pathway. Interestingly, in contrast to certain DNA viruses (e.g. HSV-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref021">21</xref>], HBV infection did not induce degradation of ND10 structural components PML and Sp100. Instead, our data indicate that HBx promotes degradation of Smc5/6 from ND10 during HBV infection, whereas PML and Sp100 levels are unaffected. Notably, depletion of both PML and Sp100 altered the nuclear distribution of Smc6 and induced HBV transcription in the absence of HBx, suggesting that the association of Smc5/6 to ND10 is important for transcriptional silencing of cccDNA. In contrast, our data indicate that neither PML nor Sp100 are required for HBV transcription in the presence of HBx. This suggests that these ND10 components do not play a role in restricting (or stimulating) cccDNA transcription when HBx promotes degradation of Smc5/6, but instead act as a scaffold complex promoting Smc5/6 localization and function.</p>
<p>ND10 components can cooperatively repress transcription of various DNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref037">37</xref>], which parallels the observation that simultaneous knock-down of both PML and Sp100 gave the greatest rescue of HBVΔX. However, it is not clear why depletion of both PML and Sp100 was required for maximal induction of HBVΔX transcription, since depletion of each factor individually substantially altered the nuclear distribution of Smc6. Since Smc6 levels were not reduced by PML and Sp100 knock-down, it is possible that some fraction of Smc5/6 is still associated with cccDNA in the absence of either one of these ND10 components, and that only simultaneous knock-down fully prevents association of Smc5/6 with cccDNA. Alternatively, although our previous data indicate that Smc5/6 associates with cccDNA, suggesting a direct mechanism of transcriptional inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>], it is possible that an additional factor also plays a role in suppressing HBV transcription in the absence of HBx. In such a scenario, depletion of Smc5/6, PML or Sp100 may alter the distribution, levels or function of this hypothetical restriction factor, preventing association with cccDNA and resulting in rescue of HBVΔX transcription. Development of a sensitive method to isolate and characterize cccDNA will be required to evaluate these various hypotheses.</p>
<p>Collectively our data suggest that association of Smc5/6 to ND10 is important for suppressing cccDNA transcription. Given that ND10 components traffic to the incoming genomes of many DNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref022">22</xref>], it is tempting to speculate that ND10 play an important role in HBV restriction by recruiting Smc5/6 to cccDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s014">S14 Fig</xref>). It will therefore be interesting to determine whether Smc5/6 plays a role in restriction of other DNA viral genomes that associate with ND10.</p>

<title>HBx RNA is present in cell culture-derived virus preparations and CHB patient plasma</title>
<p>Viral proteins that counteract host restriction factors are typically packaged within the virus particle or are expressed shortly after infection. However, it has not been established whether HBx protein is contained in the HBV virion, whether the HBx gene is transcribed early after infection from newly formed cccDNA or whether HBV employs an alternative strategy. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that HBx RNA can be detected very early after infection of PHH, prior to depletion of Smc6 and transcription of the other HBV genes. Unexpectedly, further RNA-Seq studies demonstrated that HBx RNA can be detected in cell culture-derived virus preparations as well as in patient plasma samples. It is unlikely that these data are a result of viral DNA contamination since the RNA samples were treated with DNase I and selected with poly(dT) prior to sequencing. This is underscored by analysis of simulated sequences from host intergenic regions which showed no evidence of contaminating DNA. Furthermore, analysis by skewness metrics did not show any evidence of 3'-end bias, suggesting the HBx reads are not derived from pgRNA encapsidated in virus-like particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref032">32</xref>]. These data therefore suggest that HBx RNA is present in viral particles, subviral particles or microvesicles, and provide a potential explanation for how HBx protein is initially expressed in HBV-infected cells. However, while the HBx RNA detected by RNA-Seq must have a poly(A) tail as a consequence of the poly(dT) selection step, it is not known whether this RNA is also 5'-capped. It is also remains to be proven that the extracellular HBx RNA is delivered into the cytoplasm of infected cells and can produce functional HBx protein. In the meantime, a functional role for this extracellular HBx RNA is suggested by the observation that Smc5/6 is degraded in the majority of HBV-infected PHH by the time transcription of viral genes from cccDNA can be detected. Future studies will be focused on determining the origin and nature of this HBx RNA.</p>

<title>Smc5/6 is an intrinsic antiviral restriction factor</title>
<p>Previous ChIP studies indicated that Smc5/6 directly interacts with cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>], suggesting that this complex might sense the HBV genome and trigger an innate immune response. However, data from the current study in PHH demonstrated that both HBV and HBVΔX establish high level infection in PHH (~80–90% infected cells) without inducing an ISG or cytokine response, even within the first 24 hours post-infection. It is important to note that, although not all PHH were infected with HBV, the paracrine effect of any cytokines produced by virus-sensing cells would be expected to induce a transcriptional response in uninfected cells. This is illustrated by the strong induction of a large number of ISGs in uninfected PHH by IFN-α treatment. Therefore, the lack of ISG induction by HBV and HBVΔX infection likely does not reflect a lack of sensitivity to detect an innate immune response in this experimental system.</p>
<p>Since Smc5/6 is constitutively expressed in human hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>], our data suggest that the function of this complex is analogous to the "intrinsic" antiviral factors that recognize specific components of HIV-1 and directly target the virus without inducing an innate immune response (e.g. APOBEC3G, SAMHD1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref039">39</xref>]. Another parallel is that both HBV and HIV-1 have evolved accessory proteins that hijack host ubiquitin ligases and target these restriction factors for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref039">39</xref>]. However, Smc5/6 is unusual in that it also has important (although poorly defined) roles in maintaining host genomic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref041">41</xref>]. The dual role Smc5/6 plays in host defense and genome maintenance is reminiscent of the DNA damage response (DDR), which functions to preserve host genome integrity as well as defend cells against DNA virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref042">42</xref>]. It is also notable that there are close parallels between the DDR to viral DNA and cellular genome breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref042">42</xref>], indicating that common molecular mechanisms can regulate host genomic integrity and restrict DNA viruses in the nucleus. Since detection of the HBV genome by Smc5/6 does not trigger a detectable innate immune response, our data suggests that the antiviral function of this complex is likely mechanistically related to its role in cellular genome maintenance.</p>

<title>Implications for the hepatocyte innate immune response to HBV</title>
<p>It has previously been proposed that HBV passively evades or actively inhibits innate immune sensing in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref044">44</xref>]. While our data does not directly address these two possibilities, it is striking that we were not able to detect an innate immune response in PHH at any time post-infection with HBV or HBVΔX. Moreover, we detected little to no STING expression in PHH, consistent with a recent study which reported that deficiency of this adaptor protein prevents functional DNA sensing in hepatocytes, thereby facilitating HBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Importantly, our data is consistent with a seminal study in chimpanzees acutely infected with HBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref045">45</xref>], together with a recent study in woodchucks acutely infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref046">46</xref>], which indicated that HBV and related hepadnaviruses do not induce an intrahepatic innate immune response. These studies are also in line with the lack of elevated type I IFN levels in the serum of patients with acute HBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref047">47</xref>]. In contrast, recent in vitro studies have suggested that HBV can induce a modest IFN response in human hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref051">51</xref>]. However, in many of these studies the response of human hepatocytes to HBV was analyzed in the context of high levels of physiologically irrelevant cells (e.g. mouse stromal fibroblasts or mouse innate immune cells) or where additional cell types were present at non-physiologically relevant levels (e.g. cholangiocyte-like cells). In addition to substantial differences in the experimental systems studied, the discrepancy between our data and these other in vitro studies may be explained, at least in part, by the fact that our PHH prior to culture contained ≥85% hepatocytes and only low numbers of non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). Notably, there was no positive staining for CD68 (a Kupffer cell marker) by flow cytometry in these PHH. While CD68 mRNA could be detected in the PHH shortly after seeding, the levels were strongly decreased after several days in culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), indicating that the high DMSO assay conditions further reduced the numbers of NPCs prior to HBV infection. Therefore, our study was not intended to address whether NPCs can be activated by HBV, as has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref053">53</xref>]. It is also important to note that in addition to not differentiating passive evasion versus active inhibition of innate immunity by HBV, our study does not address whether there are any viral genotype differences in hepatocyte innate immune response. Furthermore, although we evaluated host response to HBV infection in PHH from multiple independent donors and demonstrated that these PHH are responsive to relevant innate immune stimuli, it is possible that genetic and/or environmental factors may have influenced the response of these PHH to HBV infection. Future studies will focus on further characterizing the interaction between HBV and innate immunity in PHH.</p>

<sec id="sec016">
<title>Potential role of Smc5/6 depletion in HBV pathogenesis</title>
<p>Another notable finding from our study was that HBV transcription and protein production as well as assembly, maturation and secretion of virions and subviral particles can occur without substantial modulation of the host transcriptome. Importantly, these in vitro data are consistent with the absence of virus-associated intrahepatic transcriptional signatures in chimpanzees and woodchucks acutely infected with HBV and WHV, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref046">46</xref>]. Moreover, these data also indicate that degradation of Smc5/6 by HBx does not substantially alter gene expression in HBV-infected PHH. This has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that HBx does not strongly activate cellular transcription pathways in the context of natural infection, and instead supports the notion that Smc5/6 transcriptionally suppresses episomal (i.e. HBV cccDNA) but not genomic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>]. Secondly, the lack of a cellular stress response to HBV infection indicates that Smc5/6 is not necessary for hepatocyte viability under the conditions evaluated. Although knock-out of both Smc6 and NSMCE2 are embryonic lethal in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref015">15</xref>], it is important to note that our PHH transcriptome data are consistent with the observation that over-expression of HBx does not have deleterious effects on non-dividing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref054">54</xref>]. In contrast, over-expression of HBx induces genomic instability in dividing cells, with over-expression of HBx and depletion of Smc5/6 both being associated with lagging chromosomes during cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref055">55</xref>]. Moreover, unlike the PHH in vitro infection system, chronic HBV infection is characterized by cycles of liver damage and regeneration as well as widespread DNA damage over long periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref056">56</xref>]. Under these conditions, the loss of Smc5/6 may play a role in disease pathogenesis by contributing to the development and/or progression of HBV-related HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>While our data strongly suggests that HBV infection does not induce a significant transcriptional response in PHH, it is important to note that there was a substantial temporal shift in the host transcriptome in the absence of HBV infection. This is in line with recent studies in PHH as well as primary rat hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref058">58</xref>]. Notably, we showed that seeding and/or DMSO treatment significantly induced lipid and bile acid metabolism pathways, with <italic>CYP7A1</italic> expression in particular being strongly up-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). It has previously been reported that these transcriptional pathways are associated with HBV infection in the humanized mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref059">59</xref>]. Although the PHH transcriptome changes stabilized after several days in culture, and delaying infection for several days substantially reduced these early changes in the host transcriptome after infection, gene expression changes related to seeding and/or DMSO treatment may still have confounded identification of a modest metabolic signal induced by HBV infection in PHH. In addition, although only a small proportion of PHH (~10–20% cells) were not infected with HBV, it is possible that our transcriptome analyses failed to identify virus-induced changes in the expression of low abundance genes.</p>
<p>In summary, the current study expands our understanding of key host-virus interactions that contribute to HBV persistence (and potentially pathogenesis), and underscores the potential of HBx as a novel target for the treatment of chronic HBV infection.</p>

<p>Production of wild-type HBV virions from HepAD38 cells was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169648.ref013">13</xref>]. HBVΔX virions were produced from HepG2-H1.3x- stable cell line using the same protocol.

<title>HBeAg, HBsAg and cytokine measurements</title>
<p>Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were detected in culture media at the indicated time by ELISA or electrochemiluminescence assay (MSD). The HBeAg and HBsAg ELISAs were performed using the HBeAg EIA kit (International Immuno-Diagnostics, Foster City, CA) and HBsAg ETI-MAK-2 plus kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN), respectively. Concentrations were calculated by interpolation from standard curves with purified HBeAg and HBsAg. The MSD assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD). Briefly, cultured supernatants were inactivated with 0.5% Triton X-100 (30 minutes at 37°C) and then transferred into plates pre-spotted with both an anti-HBeAg antibody (Genway Bio, San Diego, CA) and a custom anti-HBsAg antibody. The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with gentle shaking, followed by a wash step in PBS with 0.5% Tween. MSD Sulfate tags anti-A and anti-B (1 μg/mL each) were then added to the wells and the plates incubated for a further 2 hours at room temperature with gentle shaking, followed by another wash step in PBS with 0.5% Tween. A 2X solution of MSD T Buffer Read was then added and the plate was read on a Sector Imager 6000 plate scanner. Cytokine levels (n = 36) were measured by luminex assay (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) on a Luminex 200™ instrument accordingly to the manufacturer's instructions. When HBeAg, HBsAg or cytokine levels were below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), the LLOQ value was plotted. If analyte levels were greater than the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ), the value extrapolated from the standard curve was plotted.</p>

<p>PHH were seeded at day -4, mock-transfected (none) or transfected with the indicated siRNA on day -3 and infected on day 0 with wild-type HBV or HBVΔX. HBV RNA, HBeAg and ISG mRNAs were analyzed at day 13 post-infection. The HBV RNA and HBeAg data is expressed as a percentage of no siRNA (wild-type HBV) or siSmc6-treated cells (HBVΔX). Mean HBeAg levels in mock-transfected PHH infected with wild-type HBV or siSmc6-treated PHH infected with HBVΔX were 431 and 1946 ng/mL, respectively. Since PHH infected with wild-type HBV do not induce an ISG response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169648.g007">Fig 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s018">S2 Table</xref>), ISG mRNA data for both wild-type HBV and HBVΔX were expressed as a percentage of mock-transfected PHH infected with wild-type HBV. In all plots, the bar height indicates the mean and the errors bars represent the standard error of the mean of n = 3 independent experiments.</p>

<title>Model proposing the role of Smc5/6 complex and ND10 in the HBV replication cycle.</title>
<p>We hypothesize that ND10 localizes to cccDNA in HBV-infected hepatocytes as it does with other DNA viral genomes. HBx redirects the DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and promotes the degradation of Smc5/6 associated with ND10, but not PML or Sp100. It is not known whether HBV infection otherwise alters the protein composition of ND10. It is also not known whether HBV cccDNA remains associated with ND10 after Smc5/6 degradation. However, our data suggests HBV transcription does not require PML or Sp100.</p>

<p>(a) and (b) are plots for two independent PHH donors. Dashed line depicts control staining. No positive staining of CD68 or CD299 was detected in either donor. Of note, these analyses were performed on freshly thawed PHH cultures and likely over-estimate the frequency of NPCs after several days in culture in 2% DMSO (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169648.s009">S9 Fig</xref>; compare temporal changes in CD68 (Kupffer cell marker) and albumin (hepatocyte marker) mRNA levels).</p>
