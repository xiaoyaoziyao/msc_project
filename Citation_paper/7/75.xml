<abstract>
<p>Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are two potent cell survival and regenerative factors in response to myocardial injury (MI). We hypothesized that simultaneous delivery of IGF+HGF combined with Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells would improve the outcome of transplantation therapy in response to the altered hostile microenvironment post MI. One million adenovirus nuclear LacZ-labeled Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells were injected into the peri-infarction area after left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation in mice. Recombinant mouse IGF-1+HGF was added to the cell suspension prior to the injection. The left ventricular (LV) function was assessed by echocardiography 4 weeks after the transplantation. The cell engraftment, differentiation and cardiomyocyte regeneration were evaluated by histological analysis. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells formed viable grafts and improved LV ejection fraction (EF) (Control, 54.5+/−2.4; MI, 17.6+/−3.1; Cell, 28.2+/−4.2, n = 9, P&lt;0.01). IGF+HGF significantly enhanced the benefits of cell transplantation as evidenced by increased EF (38.8+/−2.2; n = 9, P&lt;0.01) and attenuated adverse structural remodeling. Furthermore, IGF+HGF supplementation increased the cell engraftment rate, promoted the transplanted cell survival, enhanced angiogenesis, and minimally stimulated endogenous cardiomyocyte regeneration in vivo. The in vitro experiments showed that IGF+HGF treatment stimulated Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell proliferation and inhibited serum free medium induced apoptosis. Supperarray profiling of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells revealed that Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells highly expressed various trophic factor mRNAs and IGF+HGF treatment altered the mRNAs expression patterns of these cells. These data indicate that IGF-1+HGF could serve as an adjuvant to cell transplantation for myocardial repair by stimulating donor cell and endogenous cardiac stem cell survival, regeneration and promoting angiogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The left ventricular (LV) remodeling that occurs following myocardial infarction (MI) results, in part, from the abnormal LV wall stresses that develop in surviving myocardium. The increased wall stress is thought to induce adverse molecular responses in the residual myocardium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Donath1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Weber1">[3]</xref>. Importantly, the limited ability of the heart to regenerate lost cardiomyocytes and vascular cells contributes to the severity of LV remodeling. Therefore, administration of various types of presumed cardiac regenerative cells including skeletal muscle myoblasts, marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), endogenous cardiac stem cells (CSCs), endothelial progenitor cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells to hearts following acute infarction (acute MI) has been attempted in the hope of stimulating cardiac regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-GuaritaSouza1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Passier1">[9]</xref>. It is well known that many animal and clinical trials have indicated that cell transplantation modestly improves cardiac function in post-MI hearts. However, in most animal studies persistent engraftment of transplanted cells has been minimal and few of the transplanted cells appear to have proliferated and differentiated into new cardiomyocytes or vascular cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Gnecchi1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Penn1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>The microenvironment in acutely injured myocardium has been considered to be hostile to both donor cell and native CSCs survival and propagation because of the presence of hypoxia, acidosis, inflammatory mediators, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Mangi1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Crow1">[14]</xref>. Hence, attempts to ameliorate this “transplantation hostile” state have been made including the injection of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) into the acutely injured heart. IGF-1 and HGF are potent cell survival and regeneration factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Rappolee1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Devin1">[16]</xref> and cardiac restricted over-expression of IGF-1 increases the formation of ventricular myocytes and attenuates myocyte death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Linke1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Urbanek1">[18]</xref>. IGF-1 receptor activation induces division of CSCs, upregulates telomerase activity, and preserves the pool of functionally competent CSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Linke1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Urbanek1">[18]</xref>. HGF also enhances survival of mature cardiomyocytes under ischemic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Ueda1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Nakamura1">[20]</xref>. Moreover, intramyocardial HGF gene therapy post-MI is associated with increased angiogenesis and preservation of cardiac contractile function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Jayasankar1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Miyagawa1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Consistent with these observations, studies from the laboratories of Anversa and his colleagues have shown, in both large and small animal studies, that the intra-myocardial combined injection of HGF and IGF facilitated survival of endogenous c-kit<sup>+</sup> CSCs (the majority of which were Sca-1<sup>+</sup>) and enhanced their migration to injured areas, their proliferation, and differentiation into cardiomyocytes and vascular cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Rota1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Anversa1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Davis1">[25]</xref>. Significant cardiomyocyte regeneration from CSCs associated with partial repopulation of the infarct scar zone was also present and it is likely that survival of native cardiomyocytes was also increased in these post-MI hearts. In consequence, substantial attenuation of the structural and functional consequences of LV remodeling was present in these studies.</p>
<p>It is well known that Sca-1 is an antigen located in the plasma membrane of many lines of progenitor cells. Hence, we previously studied the effects of intra-myocardial injection of allogenic heart derived Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells into the peri-infarct region of acutely infarcted mouse hearts; we observed attenuation of LV remodeling with the result that cardiac contractile function and energy metabolism were partially preserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Wang1">[26]</xref>. However, evidence of significant myocardial regeneration from engrafted cells was not present in these hearts despite the fact that our cardiac derived Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells were able to differentiate to early cardiomyocytes under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. We have also reported that post-MI LV remodeling is significantly worse in the hearts of Sca-1 (heterozygote) knockout mice (Sca-1<sup>−/+</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Wang2">[27]</xref>. Collectively, these data suggested that the presence of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells in the myocardium improved the response to an ischemic insult.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned data, we hypothesized that the simultaneous delivery of IGF+HGF and heart derived Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells into the LV peri-infarction zone after coronary occlusion would attenuate LV remodeling more than would cell transplantation alone and the increased benefits of combined treatment would be due, in part, to increased cardiomyocyte regeneration from transplanted and endogenous CSCs.</p>
<p>We found that IGF+HGF administration combined with cell transplantation significantly increased the rate of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell engraftment, reduced infarct size, and further attenuated post-acute MI LV structural and functional remodeling as compared to the results achieved by injection of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells alone. However, in contradiction to hypothesis, there was no evidence that functionally significant numbers of either engrafted Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells or endogenous CSCs differentiated into new cardiomyocytes. Rather, the data suggested that the beneficial effects of transplantation were the result of increased paracrine signaling which resulted in additional protection of native cardiomyocytes from death (apoptotic and/or necrotic) and the maintenance of normal capillary density in the peri-infarct zone of the LV; The latter phenomenon likely helped to preserve the performance of this myocardial region. Data from our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments support these views because firstly, IGF+HGF treatment enhanced the survival of cultured Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells during serum deprivation induced stress; Secondly, co-culture of atrium derived HL-1 cells with Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells protected the HL-1 cells from death induced by three different stressors (TNFα, hypoxia or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and lastly, exposure of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells to IGF+HGF altered the expressions of a number of trophic factors associated mRNAs; the latter finding might indicate the presence of an increased level of paracrine signaling emanating from these cells.</p>

<title>Determination of the Effects of IGF+HGF on Serum Deprivation Induced Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> Cell Apoptosis and Proliferation</title>
<p>For determining the effects of IGF+HGF on Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell apoptosis, cells were cultured in cardio-sphere growth medium (CGM) and then placed in 6 well plates. Following an additional 24 hours of culture, groups of these cells were exposed to serum free medium with or the addition of IGF(100 ng/ml)+HGF(100 ng/ml) (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). This treatment was continued for 48 hours and the cells were then stained with Annexin V conjugates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and assessed by flow cytometry according to manufacture’s directions. For cell proliferation analysis, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells were synchronized in serum free medium for 12 hours. Group of cells treated with basal medium plus 0.5% FBS for 24 hours served as a control group. The treatment group is the group of cells added IGF(100 ng)+HGF(100 ng) in the basal medium plus 0.5% FBS for 24 hours of culture. Cell proliferation was detected using Cycletest Plus DNA Reagent Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and assessed by flow cytometry. The acquired data was analyzed using commercial software (FlowJo, Ashland, OR) and the mathematical model of Dean-Jett- Fox was used in the cell cycle analysis.</p>

<title>Superarray Analysis of mRNA Expression Patterns in Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> Cells Treated with IGF+HGF</title>
<p>For gene array analysis, total mRNA from Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells was isolated using RNeasy columns with mRNAase-free DNAase treatment. 1 µg of total mRNA was reversely transcripted into cDNA using a RT first strand kit following the manufacture’s directions (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD). The PCR array contains a panel of 96 primer sets for a set of 84 relevant genes, plus five housekeeping genes and three mRNA and PCR quality controls. The cDNA template was mixed with ready-to-use RT-qPCR Master. Aliquots of the mixture (25 µl) were introduced into each well of the plate containing pre-dispensed gene specific primer sets. We performed a real-time PCR using a two-step cycling program as follows: 95°C, 10 minutes; 40 cycles for 95°C, 15 seconds and 60°C, 1 minute. The data obtained from RT-PCR array was analyzed using SABiosciences PCR array data analysis software.</p>

<title>IGF+HGF Co-administration with Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> Cells Attenuates LV Structural and Functional Remodeling more than does Cell Therapy Alone</title>
<p>Echocardiography performed four weeks after acute MI revealed significantly higher values of LVEF and better preserved LV geometry in the cell treated group as compared to the control acute MI group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095247-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and IGF+HGF + cell therapy further attenuated LV remodeling. LVEF was 19% in the untreated MI group, 28% in the cell treated MI group and 39% in the IGF+HGF plus cell treated MI group (n = 9, P&lt;0.01 vs untreated and cell treated MI groups). Of interest, the dose of both IGF and HGF given to each heart ranged between ∼5 and 7 ng/heart and this dosage was comparable to that employed in several reports that showed significant cardiac regeneration from endogenous CSCs following growth factor administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Linke1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Urbanek1">[18]</xref>. We also found that administration of IGF+HGF without cells was as effective as was cell transplantation alone. However, combination therapy was more effective than either individual intervention. Significant effects were absent in a group transplanted with Sca-1<sup>−</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells (data not show), although the values in these groups did trend higher as compared to untreated post-acute MI hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095247-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Increased wall thicknesses were present in non-infarcted regions of treated hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095247-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and scar sizes were also smaller in the treated MI hearts (MI, 35.7+/−0.02%; MI+IGF+HGF, 27.12+/−0.09%; MI+Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup>cells, 24.9%+/−0.02%; MI+IGF+HGF+Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup>cells, 19.9%+/−0.02%; n = 6, p&lt;0.05 vs all other MI groups). It should be noted that no intervention was associated with significant repopulation of the central regions of the scars with cardiomyocytes; this contrasts with some reported data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Linke1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Urbanek1">[18]</xref>.</p>

<p>The absolute cell engraftment rate was determined by counting the total number of DAPI and ?-galactosidase double positive cells in the entire LV at three post-transplantation time points and then dividing that number by the total number of donor cells injected. IGF+HGF supplementation significantly improved the engraftment rate at all three time points although by 4 weeks post-transplantation, the numbers of engrafted cells were remarkably decreased in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095247-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine the fate of engrafted cells, immunofluroscence staining was performed with cardiogenic and endothelial markers. In the Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell transplanted group, about 2% of the engrafted cells (i.e., β-galactosidase and DAPI positive) also stained positive for the cardiogenic marker, troponin T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095247-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These triple stained cells were only observed in the non-scar regions of the LV (peri-infarct zone &gt;&gt; remote zone). Among the small number of cells that co-stained positive for β-galactosidase and troponin T, we also identified occasional N-cadherin immunoflurescence staining. The latter observation suggested the presence of some gap junction formation between the differentiated engrafted cells and adjacent cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095247-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Although the IGF+HGF plus Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell group had more engrafted cells that showed evidence of differentiation, this increase was proportional to the increase of engrafted cell numbers in that group. i.e., the likelihood that a given engrafted cell would differentiate was not increased by the co-administration of growth factors. These data, taken together with the fact that engrafted cell numbers were quite low even in the combination therapy group indicated that regeneration of cardiomyocytes from engrafted cells did not account for the structural and functional improvement observed in the Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell treatment groups.</p>

<title>IGF+HGF Stimulated Endogenous Stem Cells Rarely Differentiate into Cardiomyocytes</title>
<p>To determine if cardiomyocytes were regenerated from endogenous stem cells in any group, BrdU <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and troponin T immunoflurorescence staining were performed. Three days post-acute MI, we observed BrdU positive cells in the hearts from all acute MI groups. Most of these cells were present in the peri-infarct and infarct zones. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell transplantation alone or IGF+HGF administration without cells increased the number of BrdU positive cells (BrdU index) in the peri-infarct and infarct zones compared to the untreated MI group (MI, 1.40+/−0.08; MI+Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31, 2.44+/−0.21; MI+IGF+HGF, 1.96+/−0.14; n = 6, P&lt;0.05). In contrast, IGF+HGF+Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31 cell administration was associated with two-fold more BrdU positive cells in the peri-infarct zone than present in the aforementioned groups (4.70+/−0.53, n = 6, P&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095247-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, we found almost no BrdU and troponin T co-stained cells in any group 3 days after MI. At 10 days post-MI, BrdU indices were further increased in all four groups (MI, 5.78+/−0.27%; MI+IGF+HGF, 6.54+/−0.89%; MI+Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell, 10.42+/−0.95%; MI+IGF+HGF+Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells, 14.25+/1.06%; n = 6, P&lt;0.001 combined treatment vs others). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095247-g004">Figure 4A, B, C</xref>). However, once again, we found that only a small number of BrdU positive cells were co-stained with troponin T on day 10 post MI (BrdU Troponin T Index: MI, 0.94+/−0.22%). Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell transplantation slightly increased the number of these cells (Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell, 1.54+/−0.27%, n = 5, P&gt;0.05) compared with MI group. In the IGF+HGF and combined treatment groups this effect was more pronounced at 10 days (IGF+HGF, 1.76+/−0.35%; IGF+HGF+Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells; 2.71+/−0.43%, n = 5, P&lt;0.05 vs other groups) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095247-g004">Figure 4D, E, F</xref>). Although these data do suggest that IGF+HGF administration, with or without concomitant cell injection, did stimulate some endogenous stem cells to differentiate into cardiomyocytes; this phenomenon was infrequent and did not likely make a substantial contribution to the therapeutic responses.</p>

<title>Effects of the Therapeutic Interventions on Peri-infarct Zone Capillary Density</title>
<p>Two weeks after MI, immunofluorescence staining for CD31 antibody demonstrated the presence of more capillaries in the peri-infarct regions of the treated hearts than were present in the untreated MI hearts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095247.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The capillary numbers per microscopic field (20x) in the non-IGF+HGF treated groups were as follows: Control, 258.17+/−6.76; MI, 132.33+/−9.45; MI+Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells, 205.83+/−9.19 (n = 6, all P&lt;0.001 vs MI).

<title>IGF+HGF Treatment Protects Stressed Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells <italic>In vitro</italic></title>
<p>It is well known that IGF and HGF participate in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation.

In IGF+HGF treated stressed cells, Annexin positive cell populations including early (FITC staining positive) and late (FITC and PI double staining positive) evidence of apoptosis remained at control levels (i.e., the levels present in unstressed cells) as compared to the marked elevations present in stressed cells not treated with growth factors. Stressed cells showing early evidence of early apoptosis were less frequent in treated group (7.36+/−0.47%) than in the untreated group (16.77+/−0.91%) (n = 6, p&lt;0.001)]. Similarly, stressed cells showing late evidence of apoptosis were less frequent in the treated (8.42+/−1.25%) than the untreated group (31.65+/−1.52%; (n = 6, P&lt;0.001).

Moreover, combined cell and growth factor co-culture was not more effective than observed with the single interventions (data not shown).

<title>mRNAs Profiling of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> and IGF+HGF Treated Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> Cells</title>
<p>Understanding the effects of IGF+HGF on gene expression patterns in Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells is crucial to understanding the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of combination therapy. Therefore, using growth factor associated gene superarray analyses, we profiled both Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup>cells and IGF+HGF treated Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells. The Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell mRNA expression patterns are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095247-t001">Table 1</xref>; in this Table the growth factor associated mRNAs that are highly expressed (defined as Ct value greater than 25) are included. IGF+HGF treatment significantly altered the expression patterns of a number of growth factor related mRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095247-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095247-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095247.s004">Figure S4</xref>). 6 mRNAs were up-regulated and 5 mRNAs were down-regulated following exposure of the cells to IGF+HGF. These data suggest that one effect of exposure of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells to IGF+HGF was increased expression of mRNAs involved in the synthesis of growth factors and cell cycle regulators. A well-known effect of ligand stimulation of growth factor receptors is activation of Akt and its downstream signaling pathways.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have reported that intra-myocardial injection of mouse heart derived Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells at the time of induction of myocardial injury attenuates the adverse structural remodeling and functional declines consequent to the injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Wang1">[26]</xref>. We also found, using Sca-1 (heterozygous) knockout mice, that the severity of post-acute MI LV remodeling was greater than that present in wild type controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Wang2">[27]</xref>. Taken together, these observations suggested that both exogenous and endogenous myocardial Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells somehow contributed to the repair processes that occur post-acute MI.</p>
<p>The present study explores the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of transplantation of heart derived Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells and asks whether these effects can be amplified by the co-administration of growth factors (IGF and HGF) at the time of cell transplantation. The major findings are: 1. The beneficial effects of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell transplantation in the context of acute MI are confirmed; 2. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells exert anti-apoptotic effects on stressed cardiomyocytes both under <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions; 3. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell transplantation attenuates the decrease of capillary density that usually is present in the peri-infarction zone of post-MI hearts; 4. All of these responses are significantly enhanced in hearts in which IGF and HGF were co-administered with cells; 5. Differentiation of endogenous stem cells into cardiomyocytes, although enhanced by all interventions was still minimal in all groups; 6. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell engraftment was enhanced by co-administration of growth factors, but differentiation of engrafted cells into cardiomyocytes or vascular cells was infrequent; and 7. The <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells to IGF+HGF was associated with significant up-regulation or down-regulation of the expression of mRNAs that are likely linked to trophic factor generation/secretion by these cells.</p>
<p>Collectively, these data support previous reports that indicate that the protective properties of transplanted stem cells can be mediated via paracrine mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Gnecchi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Gnecchi2">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Gnecchi4">[32]</xref>. Somewhat surprisingly, in contrast to some previously published work, cardiomyocyte regeneration from either transplanted or endogenous stem cells did not appear to play a major role in the therapeutic response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Linke1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Urbanek1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Davis1">[25]</xref>. Our data are also compatible with the prevailing view that induction of vasculogenesis (and/or preservation of native capillaries) is commonly associated with cell transplantation (and/or growth factor administration) and that increased capillary density contributes to the observed myocardial protection.</p>

<title>IGF+HGF Added to Cell Transplantation Increases the Rates of Cell Engraftment and Native Cardiomyocyte Survival</title>
<p>It is well established that post-reperfusion oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, and other adverse events that occur in the injured region of the acutely infarcted heart contribute to the occurrence of ischemic (necrotic) cellular death as well as to early and late apoptosis of cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Akasaka1">[33]</xref>. The adverse characteristics of the tissue micro-environment are also presumed to negatively affect the number of cells that persistently engraft following direct myocardial transplantation early during the course of an MI.</p>
<p>The administration of IGF+HGF at the time of cell transplantation essentially doubled the number of engrafted cells present at all time points examined. Hence, as previously reported, trophic factor co-administration or genetic manipulation of donor cells to enhance their rate of secretion of trophic factors enhances both engraftment rates and therapeutic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Gnecchi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Gnecchi2">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Gnecchi4">[32]</xref>. However, despite the increased engraftment rate present in hearts also receiving IGF+HGF, the late engraftment rates were low in all groups. Moreover, the differentiation of engrafted cells or endogenous stem cells into cardiomyocytes and vascular cells was not frequent. It seems reasonable to conclude from these data that the benefits of cell transplantaton ± IGF+HGF were due to paracrine mediated protection of native cardiomyocytes (and perhaps vascular cells).</p>
<p>In humans, native cardiomyocyte apoptosis that occurs early after acute MI is present mainly in the infarct and peri-infarct border zones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Whelan1">[34]</xref>. In the present study we found that all treatments significantly inhibited the early phase of native cardiomyocyte apoptosis (i.e., within 3 days post-MI) and that these effects were most prominent in the combined treatment group. This early anti-apoptotic effect was also observed in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. For example, administration of IGF+HGF decreased the severity of apoptosis present in Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells exposed to serum deprivation and co-culture of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells with atrium derived HL-1 cells significantly inhibited apoptosis of these cells when they were challenged with stressors such as hypoxia, TNFα or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Of interest, HL-1 cell co-culture with Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells alone, culture with IGF+HGF alone and, the culture with cells plus IGF+HGF all yielded comparable results. The latter findings suggest that, in the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, the ratio of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> to HL-1 cells was high enough so that the effects of the presumed secreted trophic factors were already optimal. Hence, additional stimulation of the secretory output Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup>cells and/or the direct effects of the IGF+HGF on the HL-1 cells could not elicit additional protection. In this regard, in our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, the ratio of engrafted cells to native cardiomyocytes was much lower than that presents in the <italic>in vitro</italic> HL-1 cell studies and likely could not elicit maximal protective effects. Hence, under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, it is possible that the addition of IGF+HGF was able to increase therapeutic effectiveness of cell transplantation by enhancing trophic factor secretion by engrafted cells (as well as by direct effects of IGF+HGF on injured cardiomyocytes).</p>
<p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data are consistent with published reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Gnecchi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Gnecchi2">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Gnecchi4">[32]</xref> that showed that the early anti-apoptotic effects of cell therapy occurred in less than 3 days, preceded the later increase in myocardial capillary density. These authors also showed that trophic factors were released by their transplant cells and that over-expression of Akt in these cells was associated with a marked increase in their rates of secretion of trophic factors, and, thereby, of their therapeutic effectiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Gnecchi1">[10]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>Effects of Interventions on Infarct Border Zone Capillary Density</title>
<p>All therapeutic interventions significantly attenuated the reduction in capillary density that occurred in the infarct border zone of untreated hearts. In fact, the combination of cell and trophic factor administration completely prevented this fall in capillary density. Of interest, the response to trophic factor injection alone tended to be smaller than that to cell therapy alone. Because, there was only a small direct contribution of engrafted or endogenous stem cells (via differentiation) to the increased capillary numbers, we conclude that the increase of capillary density can also be attributed to paracrine mechanisms acting on endogenous vascular cell precursors.</p>

<title>The Low Rate of Generation of New Cardiomyocytes Present in this Acute MI Model is Comparable to that Reported in Many, but not All Earlier studies</title>
<p>Some published reports have indicated that IGF+HGF administration (alone) to newly infarcted rodent and dog hearts did result in significant cardiomyocyte generation from endogenous CSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Linke1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Urbanek1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Davis1">[25]</xref>.

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The major effects of the Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cell transplantation (with or without added IGF+HGF) are paracrine in nature. The data supporting this view include: 1. decreased rates of apoptosis of injured cardiomyocytes, 2. preservation of capillary density in the peri-infarct zone of the LV which improved perfusion capacity and presumably cardiomyocyte contractile function, and 3. possible enhancement of suggested beneficial interactions between the vasculature and cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Giordano1">[35]</xref>. It is possible that IGF+HGF administration might be a useful adjuvant to therapeutic cell transplantation at the time of acute revascularization therapy for acute MI. Moreover, it may be that the co-administration of IGF+HGF with Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>−</sup> cells during a later phase of MI recovery might be associated with more significant cardiomyocyte regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Rota1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0095247-Tang2">[36]</xref>.</p>
