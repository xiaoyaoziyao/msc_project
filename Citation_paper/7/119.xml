<abstract>
<p>Tumor neovascularization is targeted by inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or the receptor to prevent tumor growth, but drug resistance to angiogenesis inhibition limits clinical efficacy. Inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase pathway intermediate, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), also inhibits tumor growth and may prevent escape from VEGF receptor inhibitors. mTOR is assembled into two separate multi-molecular complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The direct effect of mTORC2 inhibition on the endothelium and tumor angiogenesis is poorly defined. We used pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference to determine the function of mTORC2 <italic>versus</italic> Akt1 and mTORC1 in human endothelial cells (EC). Angiogenic sprouting, EC migration, cytoskeleton re-organization, and signaling events regulating matrix adhesion were studied. Sustained inactivation of mTORC1 activity up-regulated mTORC2-dependent Akt1 activation. In turn, ECs exposed to mTORC1-inhibition were resistant to apoptosis and hyper-responsive to renal cell carcinoma (RCC)-stimulated angiogenesis after relief of the inhibition. Conversely, mTORC1/2 dual inhibition or selective mTORC2 inactivation inhibited angiogenesis in response to RCC cells and VEGF. mTORC2-inactivation decreased EC migration more than Akt1- or mTORC1-inactivation. Mechanistically, mTORC2 inactivation robustly suppressed VEGF-stimulated EC actin polymerization, and inhibited focal adhesion formation and activation of focal adhesion kinase, independent of Akt1. Endothelial mTORC2 regulates angiogenesis, in part by regulation of EC focal adhesion kinase activity, matrix adhesion, and cytoskeletal remodeling, independent of Akt/mTORC1.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Drug therapy to inhibit tumor neovascularization is used clinically as an adjuvant in chemotherapy–resistant cancers, including renal cell carcinoma, recurrent glioblastoma, and bowel cancer. The rapalog mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are used after failure of pro-angiogenic growth factor–receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and in some cases as first line therapy [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Rapalog mTOR inhibition decreases Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) production by the tumor to reduce tumor neovascularization and inhibit tumor growth [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, this therapeutic approach is limited by the development of resistance of the tumor and microvasculature to the effect of rapalog mTOR inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This “escape” of the vasculature from the effects of current mTOR inhibitors emphasizes the need for new agents with durable effects.</p>
<p>In mammalian cells, mTOR is assembled in two distinct signaling complexes: mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1), sensitive to inhibition by rapalog drugs, and mTOR complex-2 (mTORC2) [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition to the mTOR catalytic subunit, mTORC1 consists of raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR), mLST8 (also termed G-protein β-subunit-like protein, GβL, a yeast homolog of LST8), and PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa). mTORC1 activity is best characterized by phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 to regulate translation [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. mTORC2 similarly includes mTOR and mLST8, but raptor is replaced by two mTORC2-specific proteins: rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), and mSin1 (mammalian stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein 1). The principal known target of mTORC2 is Akt, a key survival enzyme, and upstream regulator of mTORC1 [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The targets of mTORC1 are well-defined, but much less is known regarding mTORC2-mediated effects independent of Akt/ mTORC1.</p>
<p>Pro-angiogenic cues are recognized by activation of several growth factor receptors displayed on the vascular endothelium, and the diverse signals are integrated to recruit key signal transduction pathways in the endothelial cell (EC). For example, the principal endothelial VEGF receptor, VEGF-receptor 2, is coupled to phosphatidylinositide 3 (PI3)-kinase, signaling to the downstream mTOR kinase [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In pre-clinical models, mTORC1 inhibition reduces early vessel growth to VEGF stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, vessel development and tumor growth proceeds in humans treated with rapalog drugs, prompting the investigation of agents that inhibit mTOR in both complexes [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The effect of disrupted signaling of the mTORC2 branch point on the PI3 kinase pathway in the endothelium is poorly understood, but may contribute anti-angiogenic effects [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this paper we report that genetic inactivation of mTORC1 activity or inhibition by rapamycin paradoxically upregulates mTORC2 and Akt activity in primary human ECs. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic disruption of mTORC2 by rictor knock-down optimally blocks VEGF-stimulated angiogenic sprouting of human ECs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Mechanistically, we identify that mTORC2 activity in ECs is needed for cell migration, development of mature matrix adhesion structures, and specifically regulates VEGF-stimulated Src and focal adhesion kinase activity.</p>

<p>A 3D angiogenesis assay <italic>in vitro</italic> was done as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, HUVECs were transfected with siNS or siRictor and were labeled with CellTracker Green (Life Technologies). Cytodex beads were coated with HUVECs (~400 cells/bead) and cultured for 4 hours in (M199, 10%FBS, 20ng/ml VEGF). The beads were washed twice, suspended in fibrinogen (2 mg/mL) containing aprotinin (0.15 U/mL), and 0.625 U/mL thrombin was added. Angiogenesis growth media (M199, 10% FBS, 50 ng/ml VEGF) was then added on top. To inhibit mTORC1 <italic>versus</italic> mTORC1/2, rapamycin (5 nM) or PP242 (1–10 μM) were added, respectively, to both the fibrin gel and the growth media. To study tumor angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>, HUVECs were pre-treated with PP242 (1 uM), ku-0063794 (50 nM) or rapamycin (5 nM) for 24 hours, then labeled with CellTracker Green (Life Technologies). Caki-1 human renal cell carcinoma cells (ATCC; Manassas, VA) were labeled with CellTracker Red. Cytodex beads were coated with HUVECs or Caki-1 (~400 cells/bead) then embedded in fibrin gel. Growth media (M199, 8% FBS) containing Caki-1 (20,000/well) in suspension was then added on top. At least 90 beads per treatment from each experiment were imaged after 18–20 hours incubation in 5% CO2 at 37°C, using a 20X objective lens and a CCD camera equipped inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica, Concord, ON). Scoring was done using OpenLab (PerkinElmer; Waltham, MA).</p>
<p>Assay of angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> was performed as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, collagen onplants were generated by superimposing two square-gridded nylon meshes on which 30 μl of 4.73 mg/ml rat tail collagen with VEGF (100 ng/onplant) was placed. Following collagen polymerization, the onplants were placed on the chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) of 10-day-old shell-less chick embryos. Embryos were incubated for 64 hours at 37°C, then the extent of onplant vascularization was quantified. Newly formed vessels were identified by imaging the upper mesh of the onplant with a dissecting microscope. Images were captured at 6.3x using a StereoLumar V12 fluorescence dissection microscope (Carl Zeiss). The angiogenic index of each onplant was determined as the percentage of grids with newly formed blood vessels out of the total number of grids in the upper mesh.</p>

<title>Exposure to rapamycin activates endothelial Akt</title>
<p>In tumor cells, active mTORC1 participates in a negative regulatory loop that inhibits serine 473 (S473) phosphorylation and full activation of Akt. Inhibition of mTORC1 relieves this inhibition, but has a variable and cell-type specific effect on upstream growth factor receptor signaling [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We sought to determine if this mechanism is present in primary human ECs, since these events could contribute to resistance to rapalog anti-angiogenesis treatments. First, we treated ECs with rapamycin for 1 hour, then stimulated the cells with VEGF. Rapamycin inhibited VEGF-stimulated, mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of S6K in dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A–1C</xref>). We determined rapamycin 5 nM optimally inhibited VEGF-stimulated mTORC1 signaling. Next, we sought to model chronic <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure of ECs to rapamycin by treatment with 5 nM rapamycin for 24 hours. Paradoxically, sustained exposure to rapamycin increased Akt S473 phosphorylation, the mTORC2-dependent site, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Rapamycin treatment at 5 and 10 nM increased Akt S473 phosphorylation ~2.4 ± 0.4 and ~2.7 ± 0.4 fold (mean ± SEM) compared to the control carrier treatment, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Similarly, sustained inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin in human microvascular ECs (HMEC-1) increased Akt S473 phosphorylation (<xref rid="pone.0135245.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine if mTORC2- has the same effect as mTORC1- inactivation, we specifically disrupted EC mTORC2 or mTORC1 using siRNA targeted against rictor or raptor, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We observed that sustained mTORC1 disruption persistently blocked S6K phosphorylation, but increased phosphorylation of Akt S473 ~2.5 fold and its down stream target, FOXO1/3 S319, compared to control (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). Conversely, mTORC2 disruption markedly lowered Akt S473 phosphorylation compared to control (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). Notably, specific disruption of mTORC2 also blocked FOXO and S6 kinase phosphorylation (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F and 1H</xref>). These data indicate sustained inactivation of mTORC1, but not mTORC2, relieves feedback inhibition to drive hyper-activation of the PI3 kinase/ Akt pathway in primary human ECs.</p>
<p>Next, we sought to study the effect of dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibition on VEGF-stimulated EC Akt activation. Selective mTOR kinase inhibitors are active against mTOR in both complexes [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Pretreatment of EC with PP242 or Ku-0063794 inhibited VEGF-stimulated Akt activation in a dose-dependent manner, and we determined the optimal inhibitory concentration of the compounds (data not shown). Like rictor knock-down to disrupt mTORC2 formation (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F–1H</xref>), sustained pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC1 + mTORC2 using either PP242 or Ku-0063794 did not increase Akt phosphorylation or Akt activity in EC (<xref rid="pone.0135245.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0135245.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Figs).</p>

Akt activity mediates an important cellular pro-survival pathway, hence we sought to determine the effect of extended mTORC1/2 <italic>versus</italic> mTORC1 inactivation on EC apoptosis. We challenged the EC with pro-apoptotic factors, then quantified active cleaved caspase 3 expression among rapamycin-, PP242-, or Ku-0063794-pretreated ECs. We observed that extended mTORC1 inhibition increased EC resistance to apoptosis <italic>versus</italic> mock-treated, or mTORC1/2 inhibited EC (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Conversely, treatment with the PP242 or Ku-0063794 compound did not confer similar resistance. Further, we investigated the effect of extended mTORC1 inhibition on sprouting angiogenesis of human ECs to tumor cells. ECs were pre-treated with rapamycin, PP242 or Ku-0063794 for 24 hours, then embedded in a 3D fibrin matrix with human RCC cells in the absence of exogenous pro-angiogenic growth factors and compounds. Tumor cells stimulated EC sprouting, which was increased by rapamycin but not PP242 or Ku 0063794 pre-exposure (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Similarly, rapamycin pre-exposure increased EC migration toward tumor cells in Boyden chamber chemotaxis assay (data not shown). These observations suggest that mTORC1/2 inactivation may be more effective than mTORC1 inhibition to block tumor neoangiogenesis.</p>

<p>Next we studied the effect of mTOR inhibition on sprouting angiogenesis of human primary ECs in response to VEGF. Primary human ECs were loaded on microcarrier beads and embedded in 3D fibrin gels, then treated with PP242.

<title>Specific mTORC2 disruption inhibits VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis</title>
<p>In complementary experiments, we used RNA interference to specifically inactivate mTORC2 activity in ECs. We used two different siRNA against rictor (siRict<sup>1</sup> and siRict<sup>2</sup>) to disrupt mTORC2, and confirmed the effect of the knock-down in EC by Western blot of rictor expression, and mTORC2 activity by Akt S473 phosphorylation (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Rictor siRNA treatment reduced EC rictor and Akt S473 phosphorylation by ~80% (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>).

<title>mTORC2 regulates EC migration and cell-matrix adhesion independent of Akt and mTORC1 activity</title>
<p>Next we sought to determine if Akt-dependent signaling mediates the contribution of mTORC2 to angiogenesis. Akt activity is regulated in parallel by PDK1-dependent T308 phosphorylation in the activation loop of Akt, and enhanced by S473 phosphorylation mediated by mTORC2 to regulate a subset of Akt-dependent responses [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Using RNA interference we selectively knocked-down expression of Akt1 (the dominant Akt isoform in ECs) or rictor, then we studied the effect of EC Akt1<italic>versus</italic> mTORC2 loss on ECs <italic>in vitro</italic>. The level of Akt1 after knockdown is shown in (<xref rid="pone.0135245.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine migration of rictor-, Akt1-, and raptor-deficient ECs, we wounded confluent EC monolayers using a high-field electric current. We observed a modest decrease in the closure of the wound, indicating EC migration was impaired, among both Akt1- and raptor-deficient cells (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0135245.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). However, loss of rictor conferred a striking decrease in wound closure. EC migration and sprout elongation require EC adhesion and anchorage to the surrounding matrix. Hence we determined the effect of mTORC2-inactivation on cell-matrix interaction. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion was reduced by 73 ± 3% after mTORC1 + mTORC2-inactivation, and by 66 ± 10% (mean ± SEM) among mTORC2-disrupted ECs compared to control ECs, measured by electrical impedance after seeding ECs on gelatin-coated electrodes (<xref rid="pone.0135245.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0135245.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). Notably, we observed disruption or PP242-mediated inhibition of mTORC2 was more potent than inactivation of Akt to block EC adhesion. These results suggest mTORC2 mediates regulation of EC movement and adhesion, independent of Akt1/mTORC1.</p>

<title>mTORC2 regulates focal adhesion kinase</title>
<p>Defective adhesion, motility, and stress fiber formation in mTORC2-inactivated ECs suggested formation of focal adhesion complex structures that mediate cell interactions with extracellular matrix might be defective.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>At therapeutic concentrations, rapalog drugs primarily inhibit tumor neovascularization through inhibition of mTORC1-dependent VEGF production [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], to blunt tumor angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, rapalog treatment is limited by escape of the tumor and vasculature from drug inhibition, and subsequent tumor progression [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Indeed withdrawal or interruption of angiogenesis inhibitor treatment may be associated with a flare of angiogenesis and tumor growth [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Understanding the events in the endothelial cell underlying the inhibitor drug effects on angiogenesis will guide development of better drugs that target tumor neovascularization. We examined the differential effects on angiogenesis of mTORC2 inactivation or dual mTORC1/2 inhibition <italic>versus</italic> selective mTORC1 inhibition in EC.</p>
<p>We observed that sustained inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin paradoxically up-regulated endothelial mTORC2 and Akt activity, promoted resistance of the EC to pro-apoptotic stress conditions, and sensitized EC to cancer cell-stimulated angiogenic sprouting. Conversely, dual inhibition of mTORC1/2 prevented hyper-stimulation of the PI3 kinase pathway, and markedly decreased tumor- and VEGF-mediated angiogenic sprouting among human primary ECs in 3D angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. Selective gene silencing experiments showed that mTORC2 disruption was sufficient to prevent PI3 kinase pathway hyper-activation in the endothelium, did not confer increased sensitivity to VEGF pro-angiogenic stimulation, and inhibited angiogenesis both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> more effectively than mTORC1 inhibition. Moreover, disruption of mTORC2 had an additive effect to Akt1 loss to directly inhibit angiogenic sprouting. We demonstrated that mTORC2 activity regulates EC sprout extension in 3D matrices, which correlates with defects in migration, cell-matrix adhesion, cytoskeleton remodelling, and focal adhesion formation. These effects are linked to Akt1-/mTORC1-independent, but mTORC2-dependent regulation of VEGF-stimulated FAK activation in ECs.</p>
<p>VEGF-receptor recruitment of the PI3 kinase/ Akt/ mTORC1 pathway in the EC plays a critical role in embryonic vascular development, and postnatal neovascularization in several important clinical contexts. Pathological tumor angiogenesis is linked to VEGF-stimulated PI3 kinase/ Akt and mTORC1 activation in the endothelium [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These direct effects of mTORC1 inhibitors on the endothelium likely contribute to an anti-angiogenic effect of rapalog drug adjuvant treatments for advanced cancers. However, escape of the vasculature from the effects of current rapalog mTORC1 inhibitors may by blocked by investigational agents with dual effects to inhibit mTOR activity in both complexes [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Emerging preclinical studies of mTOR active site inhibitors demonstrate variable control of tumor growth [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, the relative effects of investigational mTOR active-site inhibitory drugs on tumor cell growth, production of vascular growth factors, <italic>versus</italic> direct effects on the host vasculature in <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse xenograft models are difficult to determine. The current data indicate that the mTOR active site inhibitory agents have direct anti-angiogenic effect on the vascular endothelium.</p>
<p>Recent work has identified complex feedback regulation between mTORC1 inhibition and growth factor-dependent PI3 kinase activity in cancer cells, and cancer cell responses to both receptor tyrosine kinase and androgen receptor stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The signal transduction pathway is mediated upstream by PI3 kinase isoform activation by the receptor, then direct and indirect activation of downstream mTORC2, Akt, and mTORC1 to regulate cell metabolism and growth. Inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin relieves constitutive inhibition, and further hyper-activates the upstream pathway [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our data indicate that a similar EC adaptation to sustained disruption of mTORC1 signalling can prime the endothelium to resist growth factor deprivation, and to respond robustly to tumor-derived pro-angiogenic cues upon interruption in drug administration. Among tumor cells, chronic mTORC2 inhibition may be insufficient to prevent PI3 kinase pathway hyper-stimulation, and hyper-phosphorylation of the Akt target, FOXO1/3 [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our data highlights that a tumor may nevertheless be targeted indirectly through the normal EC mTOR signaling pathway which maintains sensitivity to mTORC2 inhibition.</p>
<p>In addition to the important regulatory effects of mTORC2 on cell metabolism and regulation of growth factor receptor activity mediated through Akt-dependent signaling, we identify a new mTORC2-dependent pathway to regulate cytoskeletal remodelling in angiogenic EC. In yeast, TORC2 regulation of actin structures is recognized, and is shown to be mediated through a PKC homolog [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, mTORC2 regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics in mammalian cells has been controversial. Although disruption of mTORC2 by RNA interference in tumor cell lines affects cell shape, no effect of mTORC2 loss is seen in mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from either rictor or mLST8-knockout mice [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In response to VEGF stimulation, we observe a reduction in angiogenic sprouting of primary human ECs, and a marked decrease in the length of sprout extension after inactivation of mTORC2 in VEGF-stimulated 3D angiogenesis. Defective EC adhesion, migration, and actin remodeling were strikingly more pronounced by mTORC2 inactivation compared to Akt1 knockdown, consistent with an independent contribution of mTORC2 signalling. This correlates with defective formation of organized focal adhesion complexes that anchor actin stress fibres to enable cell contractility and movement.</p>
<p>We identify FAK as a novel downstream effector coupled to VEGF-stimulated mTORC2 activity, independent of Akt/mTORC1. Once EC bind to extracellular matrix, the integrin intracellular domain promotes local assembly of structural and signal transduction molecules, such as Src and FAK, to support actin polymerization and cell migration [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. VEGF stimulation induces remodelling of the complexes associated with Src and FAK phosphorylation. Observations in FAK knockout mice provide direct evidence supporting the role of FAK in angiogenesis, as genetic deletion of FAK in mice is embryonic lethal due to cardiovascular defects [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similarly, both rictor and mLST8 subunits of mTORC2 are strongly expressed in the developing vasculature, and mTORC2-disrupted mutant mice die with defective vascular development [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
<p>The current data suggest mTORC2 indirectly regulates FAK activity, since FAK Y397 phosphorylation is not expected to be mediated by the mTOR serine-threonine kinase activity. The integrin-linked kinase (ILK) has been previously identified both outside and as a component of the mTORC2, and shown to participate in regulation of Akt [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Our data indicates that FAK regulation is dependent on mTOR activity, rather than ILK, since FAK phosphorylation is abolished both with disruption of mTORC2 formation after rictor knock-down, and by specific pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR activity. Finally, our data is consistent with previous findings that VEGF-stimulated FAK activation is dependent on VEGFR2 association with integrin, and induction of Src activity in an amplification loop [<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135245.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our data indicates VEGF-stimulated mTORC2 activity is required upstream of both Src and FAK to remodel matrix adhesion sites.</p>
<p>In summary, our results show that sustained mTORC1 inhibition activates maladaptive PI3 kinase signaling to Akt and responsiveness to proangiogenic growth factors in primary human ECs. In contrast, mTORC2 inactivation prevents Akt and downstream FOXO1/3, or S6 kinase hyper-stimulation. Moreover, mTORC2 regulates EC matrix adhesion, motility, and angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> independent of downstream Akt-regulated events. These data indicate that mTORC2 in the endothelium is an attractive target to inhibit pathologic neoangiogenesis.</p>
