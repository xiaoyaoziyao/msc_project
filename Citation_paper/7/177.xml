<abstract>
<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection of hepatocytes begins by binding to its cellular receptor sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), followed by the internalization of viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. The viral relaxed circular (rc) DNA genome in nucleocapsid is transported into the nucleus and converted into covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA to serve as a viral persistence reservoir that is refractory to current antiviral therapies. Host DNA repair enzymes have been speculated to catalyze the conversion of rcDNA to cccDNA, however, the DNA polymerase(s) that fills the gap in the plus strand of rcDNA remains to be determined. Here we conducted targeted genetic screening in combination with chemical inhibition to identify the cellular DNA polymerase(s) responsible for cccDNA formation, and exploited recombinant HBV with capsid coding deficiency which infects HepG2-NTCP cells with similar efficiency of wild-type HBV to assure cccDNA synthesis is exclusively from <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection. We found that DNA polymerase Îº (POLK), a Y-family DNA polymerase with maximum activity in non-dividing cells, substantially contributes to cccDNA formation during <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection. Depleting gene expression of POLK in HepG2-NTCP cells by either siRNA knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9 knockout inhibited the conversion of rcDNA into cccDNA, while the diminished cccDNA formation in, and hence the viral infection of, the knockout cells could be effectively rescued by ectopic expression of POLK. These studies revealed that POLK is a crucial host factor required for cccDNA formation during a <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection and suggest that POLK may be a potential target for developing antivirals against HBV.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>HBV chronically infects 240 million people worldwide. Persistent HBV infection relies on stable maintenance of the nuclear form of viral genome, the covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the conversion of HBV genomic relaxed circular (rc) DNA into cccDNA remains elusive. Our studies reported herein provide unambiguous evidence suggesting that host DNA polymerase Îº (POLK) is required for repairing the gap of rcDNA and formation of cccDNA in a <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection. POLK is thus a potential therapeutic target for treatment of chronic hepatitis B.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the availability of effective vaccines for more than three decades, hepatitis B virus (HBV) still persistently infects 240 million people worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref002">2</xref>]. Antiviral therapies with nucleos(t)ide analog inhibitors of HBV reverse transcriptase dramatically reduce the viral load, significantly improve the liver function and lower the incidence of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, but fail to cure the viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref004">4</xref>], due to the persistence of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref005">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref008">8</xref>]. Hence, better understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of cccDNA is critical for development of novel therapeutics to cure chronic HBV infection.</p>
<p>HBV is the prototype member of <italic>Hepadnaviridae</italic> family and contains a relaxed circular (rc) partially double-stranded DNA genome with its DNA polymerase covalently linked to the 5â terminus of minus strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref009">9</xref>]. While the minus strand of the rcDNA is completely synthesized with a redundant overhang at the 5â end, the plus strand is incompletely synthesized, leaving a 3â terminal gap of variable length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref009">9</xref>]. HBV replicates its DNA genome <italic>via</italic> reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the pregenomic (pg) RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref010">10</xref>]. Briefly, HBV entry into hepatocytes is mediated by its host cellular receptor human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref011">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref014">14</xref>]. Upon entry into the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, rcDNA in the nucleocapsid is transported into the nucleus and converted into an episomal cccDNA, which is assembled into a minichromosome to serve as the template for the transcription of viral mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref016">16</xref>]. Following the synthesis of viral proteins, viral DNA polymerase binds to a stem-loop structure (termed epsilon) within the 5â region of pgRNA to initiate its packaging into nucleocapsids where the pgRNA is reverse transcribed to progeny rcDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref017">17</xref>]. The progeny âmatureâ rcDNA-containing nucleocapsids can be either enveloped and secreted out of the cell as virion particles or might be redirected into the nucleus to amplify the cccDNA pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref018">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref020">20</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, the formation and intracellular amplification of cccDNA plays a central role in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infection. Biochemically, conversion of rcDNA to cccDNA requires the removal of the viral DNA polymerase and RNA primer from the 5â-terminus of minus strand and plus strand DNA, respectively; filling in the gap in plus strand DNA, trimming and ligating the ends of both strands. Although it is speculated that all those reactions are most probably catalyzed by host cellular DNA repair enzymes, identification of the cellular proteins responsible for cccDNA formation has thus far only achieved limited success. For instance, tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase-2 (Tdp2), a cellular enzyme responsible for cleavage of tyrosyl-5' DNA linkages formed between topoisomerase II and cellular DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref022">22</xref>], can release covalently linked RT from the 5â end of minus-strand DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref024">24</xref>], and has recently been shown to cleave the tyrosyl-minus strand DNA linkage of HBV. However, Tdp2 gene knockout only slows down the formation of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) cccDNA from intracellular amplification pathway, but does not inhibit HBV cccDNA formation in HBV infection of HepG2-NTCP cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref026">26</xref>]. In addition to rcDNA, cccDNA can also be formed from double stranded linear DNA (dslDNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref027">27</xref>], which is derived from <italic>in situ</italic> priming of plus strand DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref028">28</xref>]. Interestingly, Ku80, a component of non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway, has been reported to play an essential role in the synthesis of DHBV cccDNA from dslDNA, but not rcDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Completion of plus strand DNA synthesis, or âfilling the gapâ in the plus strand of rcDNA, is essential for cccDNA synthesis. Studies of DHBV and woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), two hepadnaviruses distinct from human HBV but readily cultivable <italic>in vitro</italic>, showed that viral DNA polymerase inhibitors did not prevent cccDNA formation in the infection of primary hepatocytes of ducks and woodchucks, implying that viral DNA polymerase may be dispensable, while cellular DNA polymerase activity is required for the completion of plus strand DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref030">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref033">33</xref>]. Moreover, continued treatment of primary tupaia hepatocytes and HepaRG cells with viral polymerase inhibitors during HBV infection did not inhibit HBV cccDNA formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref035">35</xref>], further suggesting that cellular factor(s) play an important role. Here we set out to identify the DNA polymerase(s) that complete(s) the plus strand DNA synthesis required for HBV cccDNA formation. In HepG2-NTCP cells infected with HBV that is deficient in core protein production, we unambiguously demonstrated that viral DNA polymerase activity is not required for cccDNA formation in a <italic>de novo</italic> infection. Instead, a focused RNA interference loss-of-function screening identified POLK as a crucial cellular polymerase supporting HBV infection. Both knockdown and knockout of POLK impaired the conversion of rcDNA to cccDNA, which could be rescued by ectopic expression of POLK. Our findings thus suggest that POLK is a key host factor required for cccDNA formation during a <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection, and therefore, a potential target for therapeutic intervention of chronic hepatitis B.</p>

<title>Kinetic of cccDNA formation in HepG2-NTCP cells infected by HBV</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular mechanism of HBV cccDNA formation, we first determined the kinetics of cccDNA synthesis in wild-type HBV infected HepG2-NTCP cells. Using Southern blot analysis, we examined HBV cccDNA in Hirt extracts of infected cells at various time points post infection. The identity of the cccDNA, which migrated at the position of 2.1kb linear DNA, was confirmed by the band shift to a 3.2kb DNA species corresponding to the size of unit-length linear HBV genomic DNA upon digestion by <italic>EcoR</italic>I, but not <italic>Hind</italic>III (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, the protein-free rcDNA species accumulated at 12 and 24 h post infection and cccDNA became detectable at day 2 post-infection, followed by a modest increase in the next 5 days. The appearance of cccDNA was coincident with reduction of the protein-free rcDNA in the infected cells. Consistently, based on the quantitative analysis of cccDNA using a more sensitive real-time PCR assay, cccDNA was detectable at 24 h post-infection, markedly increased in the first 2 days post-infection, followed by a slower increase to approximately 3 copies per infected cell in the next 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Similar to the kinetics of cccDNA synthesis, the levels of intracellular HBV 3.5kb vRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) as well as secreted HBeAg and HBsAg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) gradually increased following HBV infection. Immunostaining revealed that over 60% of HepG2-NTCP cells were HBcAg positive at day 7 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). As expected, HBV preS1 myr-47 lipopeptide (myr-47) completely blocked the viral infection. Together, these results demonstrated that HepG2-NTCP cells support an efficient HBV infection, resulting in readily detectable cccDNA formation, gene expression and secretion of viral proteins. Hence, the HBV infection cell culture system is suitable for identification of viral and host cellular factors required for cccDNA formation during a <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection.</p>

<title>HBV DNA polymerase activity is dispensable for cccDNA formation</title>
<p>As stated above, nuclear HBV cccDNA pool is established by direct conversion of rcDNA from incoming virions and supposedly <italic>via</italic> intracellular amplification pathway from rcDNA in the cytoplasmic progeny nucleocapsids. It is clear that viral DNA polymerase activity is essential for the intracellular amplification of cccDNA, but its role in cccDNA formation from incoming virions, specifically, in filling the gap in the plus strand of rcDNA, remains to be rigorously examined. Providing an unambiguous answer to this question is challenging due to the apparently indistinguishable nature of cccDNA synthesized from the two different pathways. In order to thoroughly determine the role of HBV DNA polymerase in cccDNA formation during a <italic>de nove</italic> infection, we first produced HBV virion particles containing genomic DNA with a stop codon at the 38<sup>th</sup> codon (Y) of the core gene open reading frame, designated as HBV-ÎHBc. As depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, this was achieved by co-transfection of Huh-7 cells with plasmid containing 1.05-mer HBV DNA with the desired mutation and plasmid expressing HBV core protein. HBV-ÎHBc virions were harvested from the culture fluid and purified by ultracentrifugation. Due to its inability to produce capsid protein, HBV-ÎHBc infection of cells will not be able to support progeny viral DNA synthesis and formation of cccDNA through the intracellular amplification pathway. Hence, HBV-ÎHBc infection provides a unique opportunity to investigate the role of DNA polymerases in cccDNA formation from incoming virions. HepG2-NTCP cells were infected with a multiplicity of 100 genome equivalents (mge) of wild-type HBV and HBV-ÎHBc virions, respectively. Notably, HBV-ÎHBc successfully infected HepG2-NTCP cells and formed cccDNA at a level comparable to that of wild-type HBV on day 7 post infection and persisted during the following two weeks of extended culturing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Similarly, immunostaining analysis showed that the levels of intracellular HBsAg were similar in both wild-type HBV and HBV-ÎHBc infected cells during the prolonged 21 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). As expected, HBV-ÎHBc infected cells did not produce HBeAg in the culture supernatant due to the stop codon mutation. Meanwhile, HBV-ÎHBc infected cells secreted a slightly higher level of HBsAg than wild-type HBV infected cells at the indicated time points post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Together, the results indicate that cccDNA in HBV infected HepG2-NTCP cells were mainly synthesized from input viral rcDNA and that the intracellular amplification pathway did not significantly contribute to the establishment of cccDNA pool under this experimental condition.</p>

<p>To directly examine whether HBV polymerase activity is required for conversion of viral rcDNA from the input viruses to cccDNA, HepG2-NTCP cells were infected with HBV-ÎHBc in the presence or absence of adefovir (ADV) or entecavir (ETV). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>, neither of the compounds prevented cccDNA accumulation in HBV-ÎHBc infected cells. Quantitative analysis indicated that the viral DNA polymerase inhibitor treatment at relatively high concentration reduced cccDNA accumulation by less than 27%. Interestingly, similar ADV and ETV treatment of wild-type HBV infected cells reduced cccDNA accumulation by 28 to 42% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These results indicate that the activity of HBV DNA polymerase is dispensable in cccDNA formation from incoming virion rcDNA, and re-enforce the notion that intracellular amplification of cccDNA does not play an important role in establishment of cccDNA pool in the HBV-infected hepatoma cells.</p>

<title>Focused siRNA screening identifies cellular DNA polymerases involving in HBV infection</title>
<p>There are fifteen different DNA polymerases in mammalian cells. They function in genome replication, DNA repair, and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) of damaged DNA. To identify which host DNA polymerase contributes to HBV infection, we conducted a focused siRNA screening by targeting cellular DNA polymerase genes. We assessed HBV infection upon silencing the expression of individual DNA polymerase gene in HepG2-NTCP cells. All siRNA sequences targeting cellular DNA polymerase genes were obtained from previous studies; these individual siRNAs could unequivocally discriminate between the mRNAs of the 15 different polymerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref036">36</xref>]. An siRNA targeting NTCP and a scrambled sequence (siRNA NC) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The levels of intracellular 3.5kb viral RNA as well as secreted HBeAg in culture supernatants were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g003">Fig 3</xref>, among 15 cellular DNA polymerases, knocking down POLK, POLH or POLL gene expression significantly decreased the levels of intracellular 3.5kb viral RNA as well as secreted HBeAg, POLB and POLD2 silencing only led to a modest decrease of intracellular 3.5kb viral RNA production. Of note, no significant cytotoxic effect was observed upon silencing any of the host DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). To confirm the specificity of the siRNA in the targeted RNAi screen, we evaluated the efficacy of single and combined dual siRNA-mediated knockdown of POLK, POLL and POLH genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s005">S5 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g004">Fig 4</xref>), respectively. Western blot analysis or qRT-PCR assay showed that each of the siRNAs specifically reduced the expression of its targeted DNA polymerase gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s005">S5A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Among the three cellular polymerases, silencing of POLK exhibited the most dramatic inhibitory effect on HBV infection, with approximately 74% reduction of HBV infection as judged by HBeAg level, which was comparable to the efficiency of silencing NTCP expression that reduced HBV infection by 80% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). Similar extents of reduction were also observed for intracellular 3.5kb vRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s005">S5B Fig</xref>) and HBcAg levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s005">S5D Fig</xref>) in POLK siRNA transfected cultures. Knock-down of POLL gene also led to a notable decrease of intracellular 3.5kb viral RNA and HBcAg. Interestingly, at the same total concentrations of siRNAs, compared with only knock-down POLK gene (by siRNAs of NC and POLK), dual siRNAs-mediated knockdown of POLK and POLL, or, POLK and POLH demonstrated enhanced inhibition of HBV infection, but did not completely abolish HBV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s005">S5EâS5G Fig</xref>). These results thus suggest that while POLK, POLL and POLH each individually could contribute to <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection, POLK clearly plays a critical role.</p>

<p>POLK belongs to the Y family of DNA polymerases, which functions in translesion synthesis and nucleotide excision DNA repair. Its enzymatic activity is resistant to aphidicolin (APH) and dideoxynucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref037">37</xref>]. In line with this, APH treatment did not inhibit HBV cccDNA synthesis and secretion of HBeAg in HBV infection of HepG2-NTCP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).

<title>Silencing of POLK impairs <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection and ectopic expression of POLK rescues the infection</title>
<p>To confirm the role of POLK in HBV cccDNA formation, two individual siRNAs targeting different region of POLK gene were transiently transfected into HepG2-NTCP cells. The siRNAs significantly reduced the expression levels of endogenous POLK at day 3 and 5 post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We found that POLK knockdown led to 70% reduction of cccDNA levels compared to that in control siRNA transfected cells on day 7 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In line with this observation, the 3.5kb vRNA level was also reduced by approximately 60% in POLK knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). HBeAg and HBsAg levels in culture supernatants were reduced to less than 30% of that from control siRNA transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Immunostaining of intracellular HBcAg also showed significant decrease in POLK knockdown cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether POLK plays a similar role in other <italic>in vitro</italic> HBV infection experimental models, we conducted siRNA-mediated knockdown of POLK in HepaRG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g004">Fig 4Fâ4H</xref>) and primary tupaia hepatocytes (PTH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g004">Fig 4I and 4J</xref>), respectively. Compared to a negative control (NC), differentiated HepaRG cells treated with two individual siRNAs targeting POLK reduced the expression level of POLK, decreased HBV cccDNA synthesis and reduced secretion of HBeAg and HBsAg. No cytotoxic effect was observed at 5 days post siRNA transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Consistent with the results for HBV infected HepG2-NTCP and HepaRG cells, silencing of tupaia POLK by siRNA (sitsPOLK) led to a marked decrease of cccDNA synthesis and production of HBeAg and HBsAg on day 7 post infection of PTH. Moreover, similar to infection by wild-type HBV, transfection of sitsPOLK also significantly reduced the levels of intracellular HBV cccDNA and HBsAg in HBV-ÎHBc infected PTHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). Importantly, siRNA knockdown of POLK did not reduce the infection efficiency of HDV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s007">S7A Fig</xref>) or an EGFP-encoding VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus (VSV-EGFP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s007">S7B Fig</xref>), demonstrating that POLK has a specific role in HBV infection. Together, these data suggest that POLK is required for <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection and depletion of POLK diminishes HBV cccDNA synthesis.</p>
<p>In order to further confirm that POLK is responsible for formation of HBV cccDNA, we intended to restore POLK expression in the siRNA transfected cells. To achieve this goal, an expression plasmid of POLK fused with GFP at N-terminus (GFP-POLK-wt) was constructed. Silent mutations were introduced to siPOLK1-targeting sequence for expression of the siRNA-resistant POLK mRNA (GFP-POLK-res). HepG2-NTCP cells were transduced with VSV-G protein pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing GFP-POLK-res, GFP-POLK-wt or GFP alone, respectively. The cells were then transfected with siPOLK-1. Fluorescence microscopic analysis showed that POLK localized in the nuclei, and siPOLK-1 dramatically reduced the expression of GFP-POLK-wt, but not GFP-POLK-res, suggesting that the expression of GFP-POLK-res is indeed resistant to siPOLK-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). We next performed HBV infection assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005893.s008">S8BâS8D Fig</xref>, while siPOLK-1 transfection efficiently reduced HBV cccDNA formation as well as 3.5 kb vRNA expression and HBeAg secretion in HepG2-NTCP cells transduced with control lentivirus expressing GFP, the effects of siPOLK-1 transfection on cccDNA formation and function in HepG2-NTCP cells expressing POLK, in particular GFP-POLK-res were significantly attenuated. The results thus suggest that ectopic expression of POLK partially rescued the suppression of HBV cccDNA formation caused by POLK-targeting siRNA.</p>

<p>We next carried out HBV infection assay with these stable cell lines described above. The levels of cccDNA were examined by Southern blotting analysis at day 7 post-infection. No visible band of cccDNA could be detected in HepG2-NTCP<sup><italic>polk-/-</italic></sup> cells, indicating that lack of POLK impaired HBV cccDNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Quantitative PCR also showed that the amounts of cccDNA decreased by approximately 3- or 4-fold in the cells with reduced (HepG2-NTCP<sup><italic>polk+/-</italic></sup>) and abolished (HepG2-NTCP<sup><italic>polk-/-</italic></sup>) POLK expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). ELISA analysis showed that secreted HBeAg and HBsAg levels were markedly decreased from HepG2-NTCP<sup><italic>polk-/-</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Similarly, depletion of POLK also dramatically reduced intracellular HBcAg, which was closely related to intracellular 3.5kb vRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g005">Fig 5D and 5F</xref>). Importantly, a time course analysis using Southern blot assay showed that cccDNA was readily detectable in parental HepG2-NTCP cells at day 2 post infection and modestly increased in the next 4 days. In contrast, cccDNA only became detectable in HepG2-NTCP<sup><italic>polk+/ -</italic></sup>cells containing one intact <italic>polk</italic> allele at day 4 and day 6 post infection in much reduced amounts, compared to that in the parental HepG2-NTCP cells at the same time points. Only very faint cccDNA bands could be detected in HepG2-NTCP<sup><italic>polk-/-</italic></sup> cells with both <italic>polk</italic> alleles disrupted during the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). In agreement with the cccDNA formation results, POLK knockout cells produced low level HBeAg and HBsAg.</p>
<p>To confirm the function of POLK in HBV cccDNA synthesis, we restored POLK expression in HepG2-NTCP<sup><italic>polk-/</italic>-</sup>cells by stable transduction of lentivirus expressing POLK. HepG2-NTCP<sup><italic>polk-/-</italic></sup> cell clones with defective endogenous <italic>polk</italic> but expressing exogenous POLK were established. Production of POLK protein was largely restored in two independent cell clones as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The amount of cccDNA upon HBV infection was assessed by Southern blot. Remarkably, HBV infection in these two clones was rescued, and the cccDNA level correlated with the expression levels of POLK in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). In contrast, transduction of HepG2-NTCP<sup><italic>polk-/-</italic></sup> cells with a control lentiviral vector did not rescue cccDNA synthesis. Consistently, ELISA analysis for HBeAg in culture supernatant and immunofluorescence staining of intracellular HBcAg also confirmed that restoration of POLK expression in the HepG2-NTCP<sup><italic>polk-/-</italic></sup> cells efficiently rescued not only cccDNA formation, but also viral gene transcription and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005893.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>).</p>

<title>POLL also plays a role in cccDNA formation</title>
<p>Considering that knockout of POLK did not completely abolish HBV infection and cccDNA formation, and knockdown of POLL and POLH with siRNA also reduced HBV infection despite at a lesser extent, we further investigated the role of POLL in HBV infection with more rigorous experimental conditions. We accordingly generated POLL knockout cell lines with CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Synthesis of cccDNA is a critical, but not well-understood step in the life cycle of hepadnaviruses. Our current study characterized the kinetics of cccDNA formation in HBV infected cells and obtained strong evidence suggesting that cellular POLK plays a crucial role in cccDNA synthesis in <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection. In addition, our findings reported herein also provide important clues for further investigation of viral and cellular factors in cccDNA biosynthesis and regulation.</p>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Establishment and regulation of cccDNA pool in virally infected hepatocytes</title>
<p>We demonstrated in this study that cccDNA is formed from incoming virion DNA in HepG2-NTCP cells at as early as 24 h post infection and establishes the pool size of approximately 3 copies of cccDNA per infected cell within a few days of infection. The kinetics of cccDNA accumulation as well as two lines of independent evidence obtained from HBV-ÎHBc infection of HepG2-NTCP cells and viral DNA polymerase inhibitor treatment of wild-type HBV-infected cells strongly support the notion that intracellular amplification does not play a significant role in the establishment of cccDNA pool in the HBV-infected hepatoma cells. This observation is consistent with the findings from HBV infection of primary human hepatocytes and HepaRG cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref039">39</xref>], but distinct from DHBV infection of primary duck hepatocytes where significant intracellular cccDNA amplification occurs in a manner regulated by the level of its large envelope protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref020">20</xref>]. However, intracellular amplification of cccDNA has been observed in HepG2-derived cell lines supporting constitutive or inducible HBV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref040">40</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref042">42</xref>]. Developing therapeutics against chronic HBV infection requires better understanding the contribution of intracellular cccDNA amplification in the maintenance of persistent infection, and further investigation of the activity and regulation of this pathway in HBV-infected hepatocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> is thus warranted.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Role of HBV core protein in cccDNA function</title>
<p>An elegant study by Chisari and colleagues demonstrated that although DHBV deficient for capsid protein expression (DHBVÎcp) infected primary duck hepatocytes and produced similar amounts of cccDNA from the incoming virions as did wild-type DHBV, the cccDNA in DHBVÎcp-infected hepatocytes was significantly less efficiently transcribed into viral RNAs, suggesting an important role of capsid protein in DHBV cccDNA transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref043">43</xref>]. However, our results showed that HBV-ÎHBc infected HepG2-NTCP cells and expressed viral genes at a similar efficiency as wild-type HBV did. The results therefore suggest that the synthesis of HBV capsid protein may not significantly modify HBV cccDNA transcription activity. Interestingly, DHBV capsid protein is structurally distinct from the capsid proteins of mammalian hepadnaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref044">44</xref>] and may have HBx-like function in regulation of DHBV cccDNA transcription. However, the possibility that HBV capsid proteins from in-coming virions interact with cccDNA and promote its transcriptional activity cannot be completely ruled out. It has been shown that HBV capsid protein is a structural component of viral cccDNA minichromosome and its binding reduces the nucleosomal spacing of the minichromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref045">45</xref>]. In addition, it has also been suggested that capsid protein promotes an epigenetic permissive state of HBV cccDNA by binding on CpG islands of cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref046">46</xref>]. Of note, some non-nucleoside analogue compounds targeting capsid protein can dysregulate functional HBV capsid assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref047">47</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref052">52</xref>]. Those capsid assembly effectors may alter the amounts and/or structure of cccDNA-bound capsid protein and consequentially interfere with cccDNA metabolism and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref053">53</xref>]. Intriguingly, interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) APOBEC3A seems to have a role in the destruction of cccDNA by direct interaction with HBV core protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref054">54</xref>]. Further investigation on the differential roles of capsid proteins in regulation of cccDNA function should shed light on this aspect of hepadnaviral pathobiology.</p>

<title>Role of viral DNA polymerase in cccDNA formation</title>
<p>We showed herein that, similarly to DHBV and WHV, completion of plus strand DNA synthesis during <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection of HepG2-NTCP cells is not sensitive to viral DNA polymerase inhibitors, suggesting the reaction is most likely catalyzed by a host DNA polymerase. In support of this hypothesis, by following the fate of viral DNA sequence during conversion of rcDNA into cccDNA, Seeger and colleagues demonstrated that independent of a viral enzymatic activity, a cellular DNA polymerase may fill in the 3â end of both DNA strands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref055">55</xref>]. The observed slight reduction of cccDNA amounts in ADV or ETV treated cells in this study could indicate either a minor contribution of viral DNA polymerase to cccDNA formation or an off-target inhibition of cellular functions required for cccDNA formation. Interestingly, studies of HBV cccDNA biosynthesis <italic>via</italic> intracellular amplification pathway in HepG2-derived stable cell lines, such as HepAD38 or HepDES19 cells, suggested that deproteinization and uncoating of progeny rcDNA require the completion of plus strand DNA synthesis, which requires viral DNA polymerase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref042">42</xref>]. Hence, different from rcDNA in virion particles with various length of incompletely synthesized plus-stranded DNA, the precursor rcDNA for cccDNA synthesis from the intracellular amplification pathway may have a very short gap in plus strand DNA and thus distinct DNA repair enzymes may be recruited to convert the rcDNA to cccDNA. Moreover, it had been shown that a small fraction of cccDNA can be formed from dslDNA <italic>via</italic> NHEJ DNA repair pathway. The cellular DNA polymerases required for cccDNA synthesis through intracellular amplification pathway and from dslDNA remain to be determined in future studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec013">
<title>Role of host cellular DNA polymerase in cccDNA biosynthesis and implications</title>
<p>While our results demonstrated that POLK plays a critical role in cccDNA formation during <italic>de novo</italic> HBV infection of cultured HepG2-NTCP, HepaRG and PTHs, we also showed that POLL and POLH play a role in cccDNA formation, albeit at a lesser extent. It is currently not clear whether each of the cellular DNA polymerases plays a redundant or distinct role in <italic>de novo</italic> cccDNA synthesis. As mentioned above, plus-strand DNA in rcDNA in virions has gaps of heterogeneous lengths. It is possible that depending on the length of gaps, distinct DNA repair complexes containing different repairing DNA polymerases are recruited to fill the gaps with different length. If this is the case, the three DNA polymerases may play non-redundant roles and be involved in conversion of distinct rcDNA precursors into cccDNA. Alternatively, each of the three cellular DNA polymerases may participate in a different DNA repair complex to fill the plus strand gaps, irrespective of their length, but in a different efficiency. These two possibilities will need to be further investigated.</p>
<p>POLK plays a functional role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway by filling the gap produced upon excision of damaged nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref057">57</xref>]. The activity of POLK is partially dependent on the growth state of the cells, and reaches maximum activity under conditions of low deoxynucleotide concentration such as in non-dividing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref056">56</xref>]. A previous study showed treatment of HBV-transfected HepG2 cells with aphidicolin arrested cells in the G1 phase could result in enhancement of cccDNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref058">58</xref>]. Consistent with this observation, we found that the efficiency of HBV infection closely correlates with the number of G0/G1 phase cells in HepG2-NTCP cultures. Therefore, HBV cccDNA formation may preferentially occur at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, supporting the notion that HBV infects non-dividing cells, so that cccDNA is formed and stably exists in quiescent hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref059">59</xref>]. It is thus conceivable that cell cycle-dependent factor(s) or protein post translational modification affecting the physiologic state of hepatocytes may regulate the formation of HBV cccDNA.</p>
<p>Moreover, because cellular DNA polymerases must work in concert with other DNA repair proteins to restore the structure of damaged DNA, other DNA repair proteins in NER pathway may also play a role in HBV cccDNA formation. For example, it is possible that HBV hijacks cellular endonuclease (e.g. XPG) or exonuclease (e.g. Exo1) to cleave the capped RNA primer to leave a free 5â end of plus strand DNA of rcDNA, and followed by POLK or other cellular DNA polymerase, such as POLL and POLH, to fill the gap using minus strand DNA as a template. Additionally, POLK has been shown to work together with POLD to fill in single stranded DNA gaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref060">60</xref>] and XRCC1-Lig3 is required for ligation of NER-induced breaks in quiescent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref061">61</xref>]; hence it will be interesting to test whether those host enzymes are involved in cccDNA formation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, taking advantage of highly efficient genetic manipulation of HepG2-NTCP HBV infection system, and in combination with studies using recombinant HBV virus and chemical inhibitors, we rigorously demonstrated that cellular DNA polymerase Îº substantially contributes to HBV cccDNA formation in HepG2-NTCP cells. Our findings shed new light on the molecular mechanism of cccDNA formation and may facilitate the development of novel therapeutics to cure chronic hepatitis B.</p>

<p>For quantification of HBV cccDNA, infected cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.4 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, pH = 8.0) in the presence of proteinase K (QIAGEN), total DNA was extracted according to a standard phenol-chloroform extraction protocol. 500 ng of total DNA was digested with 0.5 Î¼l plasmid-safe adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent deoxyribonuclease DNase (PSAD) (Epicentre Technologies) in 25 Î¼l reaction for 8 h at 37Â°C to allow removal of linear genomic DNA and HBV replication intermediates (rcDNAs, single-stand DNAs, linear double-strand DNAs). DNase was inactivated by incubating the reactions for 30 min at 70Â°C. 20 ng of digested DNA was used for quantification of HBV cccDNA, 5'-TGCACTTCGCTTCACCT (forward) and 5'-AGGGGCATTTGGTGGTC (reverse) were used as HBV cccDNA specific primers, the real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq on ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System as the following reaction procedure: 95Â°C for 5 min then 45 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 s, 62Â°C for 25 s, and 72Â°C for 30 s. The amount of HBV cccDNA in a DNA preparation was determined by real-time PCR using a plasmid containing HBV-D genome as the standard. The pool size of HBV cccDNA per infected cell was calculated by quantification of cccDNA copies using digital PCR in the whole cell population and estimation of the number of infected cells by immunostaining of intracellular HBcAg.</p>

<title>Southern blot analysis of HBV cccDNA and intracellular viral core DNA</title>
<p>Selective extraction of HBV cccDNA from HBV infected cells was achieved by a modified Hirt method as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005893.ref065">65</xref>]. Briefly, infected cells from one well of 6-well plates were lysed in Hirt lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.6% SDS, pH = 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. After adding 5 M NaCl, the cell lysate was vigorously mixed and incubated at 4Â°C overnight. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4Â°C, the supernatant was extracted twice with saturated Tris-phenol (pH = 8.0) and once with phenol:chloroform. The extracted DNA was precipitated with equal volumes of isopropanol at -20Â°C overnight. The DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, pH = 8.0), and digested with <italic>Hind</italic>III or <italic>EcoR</italic>I restriction enzyme (NEB) before being analyzed.</p>
<p>For detection of cccDNA by Southern blot, the extracted HBV cccDNA sample was subjected to 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Amersham Hybond-N<sup>+</sup> membrane (GE Healthcare). The Hybond-N<sup>+</sup> membrane was crosslinked in a UV crosslinker chamber with UV energy dosage at 1200 mJ and followed by being probed with [Î±-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP (250 Î¼Ci, Perkin Elmer)-labeled HBV genotype D (Accession number: U95551.1) linear full-length genomic DNA. Hybridization was performed in Perfecthyb plus hybridization buffer (Sigma) with prehybridization for 1 h at 65Â°C and overnight hybridization at 65Â°C, followed by two washes in wash buffer (0.1ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS) at 65Â°C. The membrane was exposed to Carestream X-OMAT BT Film (XBT-1, Carestream). 100 pg each of 3.2kb, 2.1kb and 1.7kb HBV DNA fragments prepared by PCR amplification of a plasmid containing 1.0 copies linear HBV genotype D genome was used as DNA marker.</p>

<title>Generation of transgene stable expression and knockout cell lines</title>
<p>The POLK rescue cell lines were generated by infection of POLK stable knockout cells with recombinant lentivirus expressing POLK, and cells were selected with puromycin (Sigma). Expression of POLK in the established stable cell lines were verified by Western blot assay.</p>
<p>To generate POLK deficient HepG2-NTCP cells, genomic engineering of <italic>polk</italic> gene was achieved with the CRISPR/Cas9 system as described with the following single-guide (sg) RNA target sequences: CTTCTCCTTTGTGCTATCCA (sgPOLK-1), GATGATCTTCTGCTTAGGAT (sgPOLK-2). Firstly, stably expressing Cas9 cell line (HepG2-NTCP/Cas9) was generated by transfection of human codon-optimized Cas9 (hCas9) expressing vector (Addgene) using Lipofectamine 2000 and selection with Blasticidin (Calbiochem). Then the cells were infected with gRNA expressing lentivirus. After culture for 3 d <italic>in vitro</italic>, EGFP positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry FACSAria II, and further analyzed by T7 endonuclease I (NEB) assay. Genomic DNA sequence of POLK around the gRNA targeting site was amplified using the following primers: cas9-POLK-F: 5'-GTGTCGAACCCCTGAGCTCAGTCAATCT and cas9-POLK-R: 5'-AGGTGAACAGGAACATATACATTATTT. Single clones of sorted cells were obtained by serial dilutions and amplified, verified by sequencing of PCR fragments, and confirmed by Western blot using anti-POLK antibody. POLL deficient HepG2-NTCP cell lines were constructed by following the above mentioned procedure, a 20-bp single-guide sequence (sgPOLL: CGGGCCCATGTTGTGCGCAC) targeting DNA within the third exon of <italic>poll</italic> gene was selected. cas9-POLL-F: 5â-GCTATATGTAGAAGGAAAGCTGTC and cas9-POLL-R: 5â-ACTGGGATCAGCCCACCTACTGG were used as primers for amplification of a region around the gRNA targeting site and the PCR products were further analyzed by T7E1 assay. Individual clones were validated by sequencing of PCR fragments, and confirmed by Western blot using anti-POLL antibody.</p>
