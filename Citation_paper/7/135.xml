          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Dysregulated signaling of the JAK/STAT pathway is a common feature of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), usually associated with <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F mutation. Recent clinical trials with JAK2 inhibitors showed significant improvements in splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms in patients with myelofibrosis but meaningful molecular responses were not documented. Accordingly, there remains a need for exploring new treatment strategies of MPN. A potential additional target for treatment is represented by the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway that has been found constitutively activated in MPN cells; proof-of-evidence of efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 has been obtained recently in a Phase I/II trial in patients with myelofibrosis. The aim of the study was to characterize the effects <italic>in vitro</italic> of mTOR inhibitors, used alone and in combination with JAK2 inhibitors, against MPN cells.</p>

          <title>Findings</title>
          <p>Mouse and human <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F mutated cell lines and primary hematopoietic progenitors from MPN patients were challenged with an allosteric (RAD001) and an ATP-competitive (PP242) mTOR inhibitor and two JAK2 inhibitors (AZD1480 and ruxolitinib). mTOR inhibitors effectively reduced proliferation and colony formation of cell lines through a slowed cell division mediated by changes in cell cycle transition to the S-phase. mTOR inhibitors also impaired the proliferation and prevented colony formation from MPN hematopoietic progenitors at doses significantly lower than healthy controls. JAK2 inhibitors produced similar antiproliferative effects in MPN cell lines and primary cells but were more potent inducers of apoptosis, as also supported by differential effects on cyclinD1, PIM1 and BcLxL expression levels. Co-treatment of mTOR inhibitor with JAK2 inhibitor resulted in synergistic activity against the proliferation of <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F mutated cell lines and significantly reduced erythropoietin-independent colony growth in patients with polycythemia vera.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>These findings support mTOR inhibitors as novel potential drugs for the treatment of MPN and advocate for clinical trials exploiting the combination of mTOR and JAK2 inhibitor.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), which include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Vannucchi1">[1]</xref>, are characterized by a V617F point mutation in the exon 14 of Janus Kinase 2 (<italic>JAK2)</italic> that occurs in 95% of PV and 60% of ET or PMF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Vainchenker1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Levine1">[3]</xref>. In addition, <italic>JAK2</italic> exon 12 mutations are detected in 2–3% of PV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Scott1">[4]</xref> and mutations in <italic>MPL</italic>, the receptor for thrombopoietin, have been reported in 5–10% of ET and PMF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Pikman1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Pardanani1">[8]</xref>. These molecular abnormalities result in a constitutive activation of the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway and contribute to cytokine hypersensitivity and cytokine independent growth of the mutant cells, as exemplified by the erythropoietin-independent erythroid colonies (EEC) typically found in most PV patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Prchal1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Dupont1">[10]</xref>. Transplant, transgenic and conditional knock-in murine models have shown that expression of mutated <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F is sufficient to recapitulate a MPN phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Li1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Akada1">[19]</xref>, indicating that constitutive activation of the JAK2/STAT pathway deserves a central role in the pathogenesis of MPNs.</p>
      <p>Therefore, activated JAK2 has become an attractive target for therapy. In preclinical models, ATP-competitive JAK2 inhibitors prevented the proliferation of <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F mutant cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and mitigated myeloproliferation in <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F transgenic animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Liu1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-QuintasCardama1">[21]</xref>. When employed in clinical trials, JAK2 inhibitors produced significant clinical improvement in patients with myelofibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Verstovsek1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Pardanani2">[23]</xref> or hydroxyurea-resistant PV or ET <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Verstovsek2">[24]</xref> at such an extent that the JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has been approved recently by FDA for the treatment of patients with intermediate and high risk myelofibrosis based on the results of two large phase III trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Verstovsek3">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Harrison1">[26]</xref> demonstrating rapid and sustained reduction of splenomegaly and improvement of constitutional symptoms. However, only modest reduction of the <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F burden were documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Pardanani2">[23]</xref>. This is consistent with the observation that the disease-initiating cell population in <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F knock-in mice was not affected by treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor TG101348 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Mullally1">[12]</xref>, supporting current notion that <italic>JAK2</italic> mutation presumably does not represent the driver mutation in MPN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Vainchenker1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Tefferi1">[27]</xref>. Thus, it seems unlikely that eradication of the MPN clone can be achieved with (available) JAK2 inhibitors; therefore, novel drugs and more effective therapeutic strategies need to be sought. In this regard, it has been shown that co-treatment of the HDACi panobinostat and the JAK2 inhibitor TG101209 resulted in greater attenuation of JAK/STAT signaling in human and mouse <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F-mutated cells and increased cytotoxicity against MPN CD34<sup>+</sup> cells compared to individual drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Wang1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Enhanced activation of downstream pathways other than JAK/STAT, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, has been documented in <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F mutated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-James1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Bumm1">[30]</xref>. The serine/threonine protein kinase B/Akt is downstream of PI3K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Engelman1">[31]</xref>; it is a key regulator of many cellular processes including cell survival, proliferation and differentiation, and has been found dysregulated in many cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Engelman2">[32]</xref>. The main target of activated Akt is the serine/threonine kinase mTOR that exists in two complexes, TORC1 and TORC2. TORC1, formed with raptor, controls the level of cap-dependent mRNA translation and phosphorylates effectors such as the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and S6 kinase 1 (S6K1); it is strongly inhibited by rapamycin and its derivatives. In turn, phosphorylated 4E-BP1 affects the translation activation of several genes, including cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> and VEGF, whereas S6K1 regulates cell growth by phosphorylating key targets such as eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), mTOR itself and elongation-2 kinase. Both eIF4E and S6K1 have been involved in cellular transformation and are overexpressed in some poor-prognosis cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Engelman2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Maruani1">[33]</xref>. Additional components of mTORC1 include mammalian LST8/G-protein β-subunit like protein (mLST8/GβL) and the recently identified partners PRAS40 and DEPTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Kim1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Kim2">[35]</xref>. mTOR also combines with Rictor in mTORC2, that is largely rapamicin insensitive, and is composed of GβL and mammalian stress-activated protein kinase interacting protein 1 (mSIN1). mTORC 2 is also involved in the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, that might, in some instances, mediate a negative feedback loop to dampen IRS-1/PI3K/AKT signalling. To overcome possible limitations and drawbacks of allosteric mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and RAD001, novel molecules acting as competitive inhibitors of the mTOR ATP active site have been developed; one of these, PP242 strongly suppresses both mTORC1 and mTORC2-mediated activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Feldman1">[36]</xref> and exerted potent cytotoxicity against leukemia cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Janes1">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although Akt was found constitutively activate in <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F mutated cells <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-James1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Bumm1">[30]</xref> and in V617F transgenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Shide1">[38]</xref> or knock-in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Akada1">[19]</xref>, the contribution of PI3K/Akt signaling to the pathogenesis of MPN is still poorly characterized. Akt is phosphorylated and activated via PI3K in response to signals originated by the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor; in particular, Akt is able to support erythroid differentiation in JAK2-deficient fetal liver progenitor cells through a mechanism downstream of EpoR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Ghaffari1">[39]</xref> and at least in part related to GATA-1 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Zhao1">[40]</xref>. Akt resulted strongly activated in erythroblasts from the bone marrow and the spleen of mice expressing a conditional <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F knock-in allele, especially in V617F homozygous animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Akada1">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, phosphorylated STAT5 and Akt were found expressedat high levels in the bone marrow of MPN patients, particularly in megakaryocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Grimwade1">[41]</xref>, consistent with the strong inhibition of human megakaryocyte progenitors by rapamycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Drayer1">[42]</xref>. Finally, inhibitors of the JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt pathway caused comparable inhibition of EEC formation and EPO-induced erythroid differentiation in cultured progenitor cells of patients with PV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Ugo1">[43]</xref>. All this evidence is in favor of abnormal Akt/mTOR signaling in MPN cells and constitute the basis for exploring the potential effectiveness of drugs targeting this pathway in MPN cells.</p>
      <p>In this study we evaluated the effects of mTOR inhibitors, either as single drugs or in combination with JAK2 inhibitors, in different cellular models and primary cells from patients with MPN. We present evidences that drugs targeting mTOR signaling exert significant inhibition of MPN cells and their activity is synergistically enhanced by co-treatment with a JAK2 inhibitor. Therefore, these results reinforce the pathogenetic role of disregulated Akt/mTOR pathway in MPNs and open new avenues for the treatments of these disorders.</p>

        <title>Inhibition of mTOR Signaling Results in Reduced Proliferation and Impaired Colony Formation of <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F Mutant Cell Lines</title>
        <p>To ascertain the effects of mTOR inhibition on the growth of cell lines harboring the <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F mutation we employed the selective allosteric mTOR inhibitor RAD001 and the ATP competitive inhibitor of the active site of mTOR, PP242. Concurrently, we used the two ATP-competitive JAK2 inhibitors ruxolitinib and AZD1480. <italic>JAK2</italic> wt Ba/F3 cells engineered to express the erythropoietin receptor (Ba/F3-EPOR wt) and the cytokine-independent counterpart with ectopic expression of <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F (Ba/F3-EPOR VF) were exposed to increasing drug concentrations in proliferation (48 h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054826-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and clonogenic (7 days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054826-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) assay. We found that Ba/F3-EPOR VF cells were definitely more sensitive to inhibition of the mTOR pathway than the wt counterpart: the IC<sub>50</sub> (mean±SD) was 651±50 nM versus 11,000±1,000 nM and 500±100 nM versus 5,931±1,000 nM, respectively, in case of RAD001 and PP242 (P&lt;0.001 for both) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054826-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, JAK2 inhibitors effectively prevented the growth of Ba/F3 VF cells with greater sensitivity compared to wt cells; the IC<sub>50</sub> was 313±23 nM versus 752±30 nM and 220±20 nM versus 457±15 nM in case of AZD1480 and Ruxolitinib, respectively (P&lt;0.001 for both) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054826-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Also the clonogenic potential of Ba/F3-EPOR VF cells, evaluated in semisolid cultures, was potently inhibited by mTOR and JAK2 inhibitors at very low nanomolar concentrations, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054826-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. The IC<sub>50</sub> for VF and wt Ba/F3-EPOR cells was 4±2 nM versus 22±10 nM and 47±12 nM versus 308±100 nM for RAD001 and PP242, respectively, and 19±11 nM versus 750±100 nM and 20±15 nM versus 740±100 nM for AZD480 and ruxolitinib, respectively (P&lt;0.01 for all combinations). Similar results were obtained using the parental IL-3- dependent Ba/F3 JAK2 wt and VF cell lines (not shown). Finally, we tested the effect of different inhibitors also in liquid cultures of cytokine-independent Ba/F3 VF cells maintained in the presence of Epo (1 U/mL). We found that the IC<sub>50</sub> remained significantly lower (1,231±100 nM for RAD001 and 750±100 nM for PP242) than wt cells (11,000±1,000 nM and 5,931±1,000 nM, respectively; P&lt;0.01), reinforcing the greater sensitivity of VF cells to mTOR inhibitors. On the other hand, the addition of Epo largely prevented the inhibitory effects of JAK2 inhibitors: the resulting IC<sub>50</sub> was 707±11 nM for AZD1480 and 521±45 nM for ruxolitinib compared with 752±30 nM and 457±15 nM, respectively, in wt cells.</p>

        <p>We then evaluated the effect of increasing drug amounts on the rate of cell division through the analysis of changes in cell cycle of Ba/F3-EPOR VF cells that could contribute to slowed cell division observed in previous experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054826.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). After 24 hours, mTOR and JAK2 inhibitors induced a block in the G0/G1 phase with subsequent decrease in the S-phase: a 50% reduction of the cells in the S-phase compared to untreated cells was reached at a median value of 6.5 µM for RAD001, 1.87 µM for PP242, 1.2 µM for AZD1480 and 1.87 µM for Ruxolitinib. On the other hand, the proportion of Annexin V positive apoptotic cells increased dose-dependently with PP242 and both the JAK2 inhibitors: the median IC<sub>50</sub> values for apoptosis were 4.0 µM for PP242, 0.8 µM for AZD1480 and 1.3 µM for Ruxolitinib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054826.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). In cells exposed to RAD001 an increase of apoptotic cells became appreciable only at drug concentrations &gt;3.3 µM followed by a plateau, resulting in an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 5.0 µM, indicating modest efficacy of RAD001 as inducer of cell apoptosis.</p>
        <p>Efficacy of the drugs was also assessed in the human <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F mutated HEL and SET2 cell lines. We found that both cells lines were relatively insensitive to RAD001 showing an IC<sub>50</sub> in the micromolar range (mean value, 14.0 µM and 17.0 µM, respectively for HEL and SET2 cells), unlike the case of PP242 and JAK2 inhibitors that efficaciously prevented cell proliferation at nanomolar concentration (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054826-t001">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, counterintuitively, colony formation by HEL and SET2 cells was efficaciously prevented at nanomolar concentrations of RAD001 (mean value, 0.93 nM and 0.044 nM for HEL and SET2 cells, respectively) and PP242 (0.172 nM and 0.062 nM), and similar for JAK2 inhibitor AZD1480 (0.46 nM and 0.035 nM) and Ruxolitinib (0.37 nM and 0.027 nM) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054826-t001">Table 1</xref>). We are not able to provide obvious explanations for such contrasting findings concerning the efficacy of RAD001 in clonogenic versus proliferation assay, that could not be actually ascribed to different culture conditions, variable times of drug exposure, types of plastics used as well as a number of other variables we deliberately introduced in the system. One possibility might be that optimal inhibition of HEL and SET2 cell proliferation by RAD001 requires some kind of cell-to-cell interactions that are favoured in the semisolid media as compared with liquid cultures. These experiments also indicated that HEL cells, that display multiple copies of <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F, resulted significantly less sensitive than the <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F heterozygous SET2 cells.</p>

        <p>In further experiments aimed at evaluating the effects of treatment on cell cycle and apoptosis we used SET2 cells as a model. Mirroring the results obtained in Ba/F-EPOR VF cells, we observed a dose-dependent decrease of SET2 cells in the S-phase due to a block in G0/G1: a 50% reduction of SET2 cells in the S-phase compared to controls was obtained with a median concentration of 33 µM for RAD001, 2.7 µM for PP242, 1.5 µM for AZD1480 and 10 µM for Ruxolitinib. Apoptosis was promoted more efficaciously by JAK2 inhibitors (median IC<sub>50</sub> values for apoptosis were 0.4 µM for AZD1480 and 0.5 µM for Ruxolitinib) than RAD001 (38 µM) and PP242 (5.2 µM) (data not shown in detail).</p>
        <p>Inhibition of the mTOR- and JAK2-dependent signalling pathways in Ba/F3-EPOR and SET2 cells exposed to the relevant drugs was supported by results of western blot experiments showing reduced levels of phosphorylated 4eBP1, in case of mTOR inhibitors, and phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT5 in case of JAK2 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054826.s003">Figure S3A</xref>, B). We also assayed the mRNA level of selected downstream targets in SET2 cells We found that mTOR and JAK2 inhibitors similarly induced statistically significant early downregulation of <italic>CCND1</italic>, that however resulted more durable (at 24 h) with JAK2 inhibitors.

Similarly AZD1480 and ruxolitinib produced more effective inhibition of the proliferation rate of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from PMF patients (IC<sub>50</sub> = 474±30 nM and 840±300 nM, respectively) compared to control cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 891±100 nM and &gt;5,000 nM; P&lt;0.05 and 0.001, respectively).</p>

        <p>Then, to evaluate the effects of mTOR inhibitors on the colony-forming activity of hematopoietic progenitors from MPN patients, bone marrow mononuclear cells or CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from PMF and PV patients and healthy controls were cultured in the presence of cytokines optimally supporting the growth of BFU-E, CFU-G/GM or CFU-Mk. A separate set of experiments was also devised to evaluate drugs’ effect on the formation of erythropoietin endogenous erythroid colonies (EEC) in patients with PV. Drugs were added at increasing concentrations once at the beginning of culture and the IC<sub>50</sub> was established by comparison to control dishes containing vehicle only. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054826-g003">Figure 3</xref>, colony formation from MPN patients was dose-dependently reduced by mTOR inhibitors; the data reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054826-t002">Table 2</xref> indicate that MPN progenitor growth could be inhibited with IC<sub>50</sub> drug concentration significantly lower than control cells (in case of RAD001, from 4.7 to 13-fold lower and in case of PP242 from 2.6 to 6.1-fold lower, depending on colony type), pointing to a substantial degree of drug selectivity against MPN cells. Progenitors forming megakaryocytic colonies were the most sensitive. Results obtained with JAK2 inhibitors were similar, with IC<sub>50</sub> values lower than control of 1.6–21.4-fold in case of AZD1480 and 3–6.2-fold in case of Ruxolitinib. By keeping separate <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F positive and negative PMF subjects (n = 5 each) we did not observe appreciable difference in the inhibitory effect of either drugs depending on the <italic>JAK2</italic> mutation status of the patients (not shown in detail). Finally, we determined that the growth of EEC from circulating progenitors in PV patients (n = 5) could be inhibited at very low nanomolar concentrations of RAD001 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 15.0±10.0 nM), PP242 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.0±0.7 nM), AZD1480 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 19.0±2.0 nM) and Ruxolitinib (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.8±1.0 nM), indicating a high sensitivity of these progenitors, that are considered as being mostly <italic>JAK2</italic>V617 mutated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Dupont1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Nussenzveig1">[49]</xref>, to both mTOR and JAK2 inhibitors.</p>

        <title>Combination of mTOR and JAK2 Inhibitor Results in Improved Efficacy Against MPN Cells</title>
        <p>Next, we evaluated the effects of concurrent inhibition of mTOR and JAK2 signaling in Ba/F3-EPOR VF and SET2 cells. Cells were put in culture using progressively increasing concentrations of the drugs and the proportion of viable cells at 48 h, or the number of colony formed at 10d, was measured; the combination index (CI), as a measure of the interaction between two drugs, was calculated as detailed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref> section (examples are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054826.s005">Figure S5</xref> and 6). Results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054826-t003">Table 3</xref> indicate that combination of a mTOR and JAK2 inhibitor resulted in markedly lower concentrations of the individual drugs necessary to produce a 50% inhibition in the assay. For example, the proliferation of SET2 cells could be efficaciously inhibited with RAD001 amounts of 9.4 to 10.6-fold lower, 2.3 to 7.9-fold in case of PP242, 3.1 to 9.4-fold in case of AZD1480 and 3.0 to 5.1-fold in case of Ruxolitinib, depending on the drug combinations. The calculated CI values was always lower than 1, ranging from 0.33 to 0.98, to indicate synergism of the mTOR and JAK2 inhibitors in the two cell lines and experimental settings.</p>

      <p>Dysregulation of the JAK2/STAT pathway represents a central mechanism in the pathogenesis of MPNs: in fact, (i) the <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F gain-of-function mutation occurs in the majority of patients with PV and 60% of PMF and essential thrombocythemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Vainchenker1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Levine1">[3]</xref>, (ii) other mutations (<italic>MPL, LNK, CBL</italic>) found in 5–10% can similarly activate the JAK/STAT pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Pikman1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Pardanani1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Grand1">[50]</xref>, (iii) mouse models indicate that those mutations are able to induce a myeloproliferative disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Li1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Akada1">[19]</xref>, (iv) the JAK/STAT pathway is involved in the dysregulated cytokine expression that accompanies MPNs and underlies some tract of the clinical phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Tefferi3">[51]</xref>, and finally (v) targeting activated JAK2 with ATP-competitive JAK2 inhibitors resulted in measurable clinical improvements in patients with myelofibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Verstovsek3">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Harrison1">[26]</xref>. The clinical efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors has been ascribed to a variable degree of myelosuppression and a general down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine signalling (at least in part mediated by the concomitant anti-JAK1 properties of some JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Tefferi4">[52]</xref>, well keeping in mind that none of the available molecules is specific to mutant as opposed to wild-type JAK2. Conceivably, in contrast to the capacity of JAK2 inhibitors to reduce the enlarged spleen and improve disease symptomatic manifestations, changes in the burden of mutated cells have been variable (with SAR302503 being reported as the most effective until now <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Pardanani3">[53]</xref>) but usually modest, at least in the short-term follow-up. Also, while generally well tolerated, JAK2 inhibitors caused some degree of unwanted myelosuppression, particularly anemia and thrombocytopenia. Therefore, current efforts are directed towards additional targets involved in the dysregulated proliferation of MPN cells and/or novel therapeutic options with the hope to maximize anticancer efficacy and/or improve the tolerability profile of available JAK2 inhibitors.</p>
      <p>In this study we have focused on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key downstream target of the PI3K/Akt pathway, with the objective to characterize the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in different cellular models of MPNs, including primary cells. We found that <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F mutated human and murine leukemia cell lines are sensitive to mTOR inhibitors showing a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation and clonogenic potential that mainly reflected a cytostatic rather than an apoptotic effect. However, the ATP mimetic inhibitor PP242 resulted a more potent and dose-dependent inducer of apoptosis than the allosteric inhibitor RAD001, leading to speculate that such a difference may be attributable to the activity of PP242 against both mTORC complexes as opposed to the inhibition of mTORC1 only exerted by RAD001 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Engelman1">[31]</xref>; further experiments are in progress at this regard. We also showed that mTOR inhibitors inhibited the proliferation of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and hematopoietic colony formation from MPN patients at doses significantly lower than healthy subjects and potently reduced the generation of erythroid-independent colonies (EEC) that are considered to closely represent the MPN clone since they are mostly <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F mutated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Dupont1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Nussenzveig1">[49]</xref>. As a whole, these results, indicating sensitivity of MPN cells to mTOR inhibitors, provided mechanistic explanation for the findings of a phase I/II trial that showed efficacy of RAD001 (Everolimus) against splenomegaly and symptomatic burden in patients with myelofibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Guglielmelli1">[54]</xref> and reinforce the rationale for designing clinical trials with novel, and possibly more effective, drugs targeting the activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.</p>
      <p>In fact, the abnormal activation of mTOR in cancer cells and its role in many critical cellular processes, together with the availability of a growing number of molecules entering the clinical scenario, makes it an attractive target for therapy in neoplasia where involvement of the mTOR pathway contributes to disease pathogenesis; activation of this pathway has been demonstrated in MPN cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-James1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Bumm1">[30]</xref>, <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F-expressing mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Akada1">[19]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Shide1">[38]</xref> and primary samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Grimwade1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Ugo1">[43]</xref>. However, in most trials performed in different clinical settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-MericBernstam1">[55]</xref> RAD001 and other rapalogs resulted in disease stabilization rather than tumor regression, an effect largely attributable to the predominantly cytostatic effect of these agents. Indeed, in a mouse myeloproliferative disease model characterized by constitutively active STAT5, treatment with rapamycin effectively reduced myeloid cell proliferation in transplanted mice and significantly prolonged survival; however, the myeloproliferative disease recurred once the treatment was stopped <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Li2">[56]</xref>. Such prevalent antiproliferative rather than pro-apoptotic effect of rapamycin derivatives including RAD001 has prompted on one side studies of combination with agents that preferentially induce apoptosis or are directed against other disease-associated targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-MericBernstam1">[55]</xref> on the other the development of novel ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Bearing this in mind, we explored the effects of combining mTOR and JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors <italic>in vitro</italic>. We first determined that, in the same experimental settings, JAK2 inhibitors (AZD1480 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Hedvat1">[44]</xref> and Ruxolitinib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-QuintasCardama1">[21]</xref>) efficaciously impaired the growth of <italic>JAK2</italic>V617F mutated mouse and human cell lines and primary cells by slowing the progression to S-phase of the cell cycle and exerting a more definite apoptotic effect, at least in part mediated by downregulation of BcLxL and PIM. Accordingly, we determined that combination of mTOR and JAK2 inhibitor resulted in significant synergism concerning the inhibition of proliferation and colony formation of mouse and human <italic>JAK2</italic>V617 mutated leukemia cell lines and prevented at very low nanomolar concentration the formation of EPO-independent erythroid colonies.</p>
      <p>Combinations of mTOR inhibitor with chemotherapeutics, targeted drugs or antibodies are being explored in preclinical models and/or have been preliminary reported in clinical trials. At this regard, combination of rapamycin with ABT-737, an inhibitor of Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, has recently been shown to provoke synergistic effects in mice with a myeloproliferative disorder due to constitutively active STAT5 and persistent activation of Akt/mTOR signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054826-Li3">[57]</xref>. Present data describing synergistic activity of mTOR- and JAK/STAT-directed therapies in cellular models of MPN foresee the opportunity of testing this association in clinical trials, with the expectation that such combination might results in a better therapeutic index producing more effective inhibition of clonal cells and also, due to the modest toxicity of mTOR inhibitors against normal cells, by reducing unwanted side effects of JAK2 inhibitors administered at lower, yet effective, dose.</p>
