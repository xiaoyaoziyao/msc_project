<abstract>
<p>Activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in eukaryotic cells represents an evolutionarily conserved response to physiological stress. Here, we report that the mTOR inhibitors rapamycin (sirolimus) and structurally related temsirolimus are capable of inducing UPR in sarcoma cells. However, this effect appears to be distinct from the classical role for these drugs as mTOR inhibitors. Instead, we detected these compounds to be associated with ribosomes isolated from treated cells. Specifically, temsirolimus treatment resulted in protection from chemical modification of several rRNA residues previously shown to bind rapamycin in prokaryotic cells. As an application for these findings, we demonstrate maximum tumor cell growth inhibition occurring only at doses which induce UPR and which have been shown to be safely achieved in human patients. These results are significant because they challenge the paradigm for the use of these drugs as anticancer agents and reveal a connection to UPR, a conserved biological response that has been implicated in tumor growth and response to therapy. As a result, eIF2 alpha phosphorylation and Xbp-1 splicing may serve as useful biomarkers of treatment response in future clinical trials using rapamycin and rapalogs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The unfolded protein response is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to respond to alterations in cellular homeostasis including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref002">2</xref>]. For example, conditions which promote the accumulation of unfolded proteins results in activation of the resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein IRE1 alpha (inositol requiring enzyme-1 alpha). Following trans-autophosphorylation and dimerization of the luminal domain, IRE1 demonstrates a unique endonuclease activity in its cytoplasmic domain resulting in unconventional splicing of Xbp-1 (X-box binding protein 1) mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref005">5</xref>]. Xbp-1 is the only known mRNA substrate which undergoes such cleavage by IRE-1 and therefore serves as a specific biomarker for UPR induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref006">6</xref>]. The spliced form of Xbp-1 results in a frameshift in the amino acid sequence whereby the resulting protein is converted into a potent transcriptional activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref005">5</xref>]. Initiating transcription of Xbp-1 target genes such as BiP (binding immunoglobulin protein)/Grp78 (glucose regulated protein 78 kDa) and CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) is a key event in UPR induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref011">11</xref>]. For example, upregulation of the chaperone, BiP/Grp78, increases the protein folding capacity of the ER and regulates gating of the ER translocon pore to maintain homeostatic calcium levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref013">13</xref>]. However, under chronic ER stress conditions, sustained transcription of CHOP can result in growth arrest or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>A second feature of the UPR, shared with the integrated stress response (ISR), is phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha at serine 51[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref015">15</xref>]. When unfolded proteins accumulate within the ER lumen, the chaperone BiP is sequestered away from the ER resident kinase PERK (protein kinase RNA PKR-like ER kinase) resulting in PERK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref016">16</xref>]. Kinase activity in the PERK cytoplasmic domain phosphorylates eIF2a (Ser51) inhibiting translation initiation leading to a decrease in protein synthesis. Together, these UPR signaling events determine cell fate in response to acute and chronic stress.</p>
<p>Rapamycin and structurally related analogs (rapalogs) belong to a class of macrolide compounds recently approved and currently being evaluated in clinical trials to treat many types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref018">18</xref>]. However, the promise of these drugs is tempered by the fact that clinical responses, especially in solid tumors, have been infrequent, sporadic and not predicted by pharmacodynamic biomarkers. The best characterized mechanism of action for rapamycin/raplogs involves inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase activity. This occurs through binding of the immunophilin protein FKBP12/rapamycin complex to the FRB domain of mTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref020">20</xref>]. However, a previous study suggested that the potent growth inhibitory effects on cancer cells may not occur through this canonical mechanism of action and might involve direct binding of temsirolimus to mTOR leading to more robust inhibition of mTOR activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref020">20</xref>]. This previous study showed that micromolar exposures were required to inhibit total protein synthesis and resulted in other molecular changes consistent with ER stress such as phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha (Ser51) and increased steady-state levels of ATF4 protein. However, it was unclear whether these effects were due to activation of the integrated stress response or, more specifically, activation of the unfolded protein response.</p>
<p>Our data confirms that micromolar exposures of temsirolimus also provides maximal growth inhibition of osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and results in inhibition of protein synthesis and phosphorylation of eIF2a (Ser51). However, we provide additional data demonstrating splicing of Xbp1, which is specific to activation of the unfolded protein response. This is supported by increased expression of Xbp1 target genes such as BiP and CHOP. In addition, we also demonstrate that the parent compound, rapamycin, induces Xbp1 splicing.</p>
<p>Similar to the findings of Shor et al, co-treatment with FK506, which competes with temsirolimus for FKBP12 binding, abrogated only low dose, but not high dose temsirolimus mediated growth inhibitory effects in sarcoma cells. However, our data suggests UPR induction by rapamycin/rapalogs may not simply be the result of more complete mTOR inhibition, since treatment with structurally unrelated, small molecule ATP competitive inhibitors of mTORC1/2, did not induce Xbp1 splicing. Therefore, our data argues against a direct role for mTOR in mediating the high dose effects of rapamycin/rapalogs.</p>
<p>Finally, we were able to detect temsirolimus in ribosome fractions in which 28S rRNA nucleotides were protected from chemical modification consistent with direct interaction of the drug with ribosomes within the peptide exit tunnel. We propose that this may alter co-translational folding of nascent peptides thereby activating the unfolded protein response.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data supports the idea that UPR unduction, following low micromolar exposures of rapamycin/rapalogs, is linked to some of their anticancer activity. These findings should aid in the rational selection of treatment doses and schedules and may also enable the selection of more relevant pharmacodynamics biomarkers, such as spliced Xbp1 mRNA and eIF2a (Ser51) protein phosphorylation, to guide therapeutic decisions.</p>

<title>Treatment with temsirolimus or rapamycin at low micromolar exposures induces Xbp-1 splicing and transcription of UPR genes</title>
<p>First, we sought to determine the extent to which rapamycin and the rapalog, temsirolimus, could activate a sustained unfolded protein response in tumor cells. The most sensitive and specific molecular marker for UPR induction is the unconventional splicing of Xbp-1 mRNA. Osteosarcoma (143B and HOS-MNNG) and rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30 and RD) cells were included in this study because they represent tumor cell types previously shown to be responsive to rapamycin and rapalogs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref023">23</xref>]. Furthermore, mTOR was first isolated from human osteosarcoma cells as a result of studies to determine the protein(s) responsible for cell cycle inhibition in response to rapamycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, temsirolimus induced Xbp-1 splicing in a dose dependent manner in human osteosarcoma cells. Splicing occurred as early as 1hr following treatment and was transient. The ratio of spliced to unspliced Xbp-1 mRNA returned to basal levels approximately 4hrs following 5μM drug exposure and 24hrs after 20μM exposure. As stated previously, these exposures of rapamycin have been safely achieved in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref029">29</xref>]. The steady-state level of unspliced Xbp-1 mRNA increased just prior to the first detectable cleavage, consistent with previous reports demonstrating increased Xbp-1 message stability contributes to efficient IRE1 mediated splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref005">5</xref>]. Similar results were seen in other osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cells, as well as human breast cancer cells, demonstrating that Xbp-1 splicing in response to temsirolimus was not a cell type specific effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185089.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185089.s002">S2</xref> Figs).</p>

<title>Rapamycin and temsirolimus induce Xbp-1 splicing and downstream target gene mRNA levels.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Human osteosarcoma cells (HOS-MNNG) were treated for the indicated times with 2, 5 or 20μM temsirolimus. RT-PCR was conducted using a primer pair flanking the unconventional splice site of the Xbp-1 mRNA.

<p>Next, we determined the extent of Xbp-1 target gene transcription, following temsirolimus treatment, using quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, BiP/Grp78 and CHOP mRNA levels were transiently increased following temsirolimus treatment and were only induced at time points following initiation of Xbp-1 splicing. These effects were not limited to cells treated with temsirolimus as the parent compound, rapamycin, induced similar changes in Xbp-1 splicing and concomitant increases in BiP/Grp78 and CHOP mRNA levels, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g001">Fig 1C</xref>. Taken together, these results define the low micromolar exposures of temsirolimus or rapamycin that induce Xbp-1 splicing as well as downstream BiP/Grp78 and CHOP gene expression, molecular changes consistent with UPR activation.</p>

<title>mTOR kinase inhibition using an ATP competitive inhibitor has no effect on Xbp-1 splicing</title>
<p>The classic mechanism of action for rapamycin/rapalogs is through inhibition of mTOR kinase activity resulting from direct interaction with drug bound FKBP12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref030">30</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that low doses of rapamycin/rapalogs inhibit the mTORC1 arm of mTOR signaling, but over longer incubation times or at higher doses mTORC2 inhibition also occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref038">38</xref>]. In order to achieve simultaneous and potent mTORC1/2 inhibition, new small molecule inhibitors have recently been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref041">41</xref>]. These drugs act as direct, ATP competitive inhibitors of mTOR kinase activity, distinct from the macrolide rapamycin and rapalogs. It would reason that if UPR induction by rapamycin/rapalogs occurred as a result of mTORC1/2 inhibition then a more potent and direct mTOR inhibitor should also induce Xbp-1 splicing. In order to test this hypothesis, cells were treated with an ATP competitive inhibitor for up to 48hrs. Importantly, this dose has been shown to inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 arms of mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185089.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref041">41</xref>]. Interestingly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, the ATP competitive inhibitor failed to induce Xbp-1 splicing at any time point suggesting that mTOR inhibition is not sufficient to induce UPR. Similar results were seen with a second, structurally distinct, ATP competitive mTOR inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185089.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Micromolar exposures of temsirolimus result in inhibition of total protein synthesis and increased eIF2 alpha phosphorylation</title>
<p>Next, we sought to determine the phenotypic effects associated with UPR activation in response to temsirolimus. Another hallmark of UPR induction is inhibition of total protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref043">43</xref>]. However, the current paradigm is that rapamycin and rapalogs inhibit translation only of a specific subset of mRNA (5’ TOP mRNA) without effecting total protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref045">45</xref>]. Therefore, we wanted to determine the extent to which micromolar exposures of temsirolimus, which induce Xbp-1 cleavage, also, inhibit total protein synthesis. In order to achieve this goal, we first conducted metabolic radiolabeling studies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, the amount of radiolabeled amino acids incorporated into newly synthesized protein was decreased in both osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cells and only at micromolar doses.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, in order to further characterize effects on protein synthesis, we conducted polysome analysis by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. If total protein synthesis is inhibited, there should be a decrease in peak height for the heaviest polysomes (greatest number of ribosomes/mRNA) with a corresponding increase in 80S monosomes and smaller polysomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref046">46</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, vehicle treated cells exhibit well defined peaks corresponding to individual ribosomal subunits as well as 80S monomers and higher multimer polysomes which represent active translation. Following treatment with temsirolimus, the polysome peak area is decreased relative to vehicle treated samples and there is a dramatic increase in 80S monomers consistent with global inhibition of protein synthesis. These results are consistent with the metabolic radiolabeling data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) with a slight difference in the exposure of temsirolimus required to demonstrate translation inhibition in Rh30 cells depending on the assay used. In either case, a micromolar threshold level is required to inhibit protein synthesis.</p>
<p>In order to determine the step(s) at which translation was inhibited, the phosphorylation state of eIF2 alpha and eEF2 were analyzed. Under conditions which promote UPR activation, phosphorylation of both eIF2 alpha and eEF2 increase predicting inhibition of translation initiation and elongation, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref048">48</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha (Ser 51) increased as early as 1hr following treatment with 20μM, but not 20nM, temsirolimus. The phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha persisted through 24hrs and is consistent with long-term inhibition of translation initiation. This data is also supported by decreased polysome profiles observed through at least 12hrs which was the longest treatment duration analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185089.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In contrast, eEF2 phosphorylation was increased at either dose, although to a greater extent in 20μM temsirolimus treated samples. A similar increase in eIF2 alpha (Ser 51) phosphorylation was also observed in multiple human osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines treated with 20μM, but not 20nM rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Taken together, our results are consistent with UPR associated inhibition of total protein synthesis. This seems to occur primarily at the level of initiation through sustained inactivation of eIF2 alpha, although we cannot rule out the combined effects of hyperphosphorylated eEF2 and/or altered activity of 4EBP1 and p70S6 kinase.</p>
<p>4EBP1 can undergo a hierarchical series of phosphorylation events which is thought to result in disruption of eIF4E binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref049">49</xref>]. This results in increased cap binding by eIF4E and increased protein synthesis. On the other hand, hypo-phosphorylation of 4EBP1 is thought to inhibit binding eIF4E to eIF4G, blocking pre-initiation complex formation and inhibiting protein synthesis. We specifically chose to examine 4EBP1 phosphorylation at serine 65, because it has been shown to be mTOR dependent and is the final phosphorylation event in the series of Thr37/46 followed by Thr65 and ultimately serine 65.</p>
<p>Ser65 phosphorylation of 4EBP1 was minimally reduced at 20nM, although phosphorylation of other sites in 4EBP1 (such as Thr37/46) is known to be eliminated at this dose. However, Ser65 phosphorylation is substantially reduced at 20μM, although the mechanism and significance of this finding is unclear. For example, a previous study demonstrated that complete inhibition of mTORC1/2 using the ATP competitive inhibitor Torin1 also resulted in a dramatic decrease in 4EBP1 Ser65 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref041">41</xref>]. Therefore, this event appears to be mTOR dependent. This same study showed that Torin1 did not affect the phosphorylation of eIF2a (Ser51) and we did not detect increased Xbp1 splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref041">41</xref>]. These distinctions provide additional evidence that biomarkers of the unfolded protein response, Xbp1 splicing and eIF2a (Ser51) phosphorylation, induced by micromolar exposures of rapamycin and rapalogs are involved in a second mechanism of action that is mTOR independent. These data challenge a long held view that rapamycin and rapalogs have limited effects on global translation regulation and provide the mechanistic basis for this to occur as a result of UPR induction.</p>

<title>Biphasic growth inhibition characterized by FK-506 sensitive and insensitive mechanisms</title>
<p>Next, we sought to determine the effect of temsirolimus on osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell growth. Temsirolimus was chosen for the analysis because it is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for solid tumors including sarcoma. Drug concentrations tested spanned the range shown to be clinically achievable in patients (1nM-20μM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref029">29</xref>].

<p>In contrast to continuous 48hr drug exposures, we wanted to determine the extent to which shorter duration exposures were capable of inhibiting tumor cell growth. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 20μM temsirolimus for 4hrs (or 24hrs) after which growth medium was removed. Cells were then washed repeatedly and fresh medium without drug was added for the final 44hrs or 24hrs (respectively) of incubation prior to assaying cell growth. Cells were also incubated for the full 48hrs exposed to drug as well. A single 4hr exposure was sufficient to result in &gt;50% growth inhibition measured at 48hrs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185089.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). These data suggest that short term, high dose temsirolimus treatment, at drug concentrations achievable in patients, is capable of effectively inhibiting tumor cell growth and that chronic dosing may not provide additional benefit.</p>
<p>In order to characterize the mechanism(s) leading to growth inhibition following temsirolimus treatment, we conducted cell cycle analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, there were no changes in cell cycle distribution for unsynchronized cells treated with 20nM or 2μM temsirolimus. However, 20μM treatment resulted in altered cell cycle progression with an increase in the proportion of G1 phase cells. These results are consistent with a cytostatic effect and support previous studies describing UPR induced G1 arrest as a consequence of translation inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref047">47</xref>]. It is likely that the modest low dose growth inhibitory effect observed over a broad range of temsirolimus concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) results from a decrease in the rate of cell cycle progression whereas the high dose effect is characterized by cells arresting and therefore, accumulating in G1 phase.</p>
<p>In order to further determine whether the low dose and high dose growth inhibitory effects were mediated by the same, prototypical mechanism of action, we conducted drug competition experiments using the related compound FK-506 (tacrolimus). The K(d) for rapamycin/FKBP12 and FK-506/FKBP12 complexes is nearly identical (~0.2nM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref050">50</xref>]. However, FK-506/FKBP12 cannot bind to the FRB domain of mTOR and therefore, does not inhibit mTOR kinase activity. On the contrary, competition with FK-506 has been shown to effectively rescue the inhibitory effects of rapamycin/temsirolimus on mTOR protein function and associated cell phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref020">20</xref>]. Consistent with these previous studies, in human OS and RMS cells, FK-506 rescued the low dose growth inhibitory effects of temsirolimus when present in equimolar concentrations up to 1μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). However, no antagonism was observed at higher micromolar exposures (10μM) of each drug further supporting an alternative, non-canonical mechanism of action.</p>
<p>A previous study suggested that temsirolimus can directly interact with mTOR, independent of FKBP12, and that this may account for the observed high dose drug effects and represent a new mechanism of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref020">20</xref>]. While we cannot rule out this possibility, previous work and our current data question this assertion. These previous results were only shown using purified recombinant mTOR/FRB and, to the best of our knowledge, such a direct interaction between mTOR/FRB and rapamycin/temsirolimus has never been shown in intact cells. In addition, FKBP12 is expressed in most cell types and the affinity for rapamycin is ~2,000X greater than the affinity of mTOR/FRB for rapamycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref030">30</xref>]. Therefore, while <italic>in vitro</italic> binding experiments, using recombinant protein may demonstrate rapamycin or temsirolimus/mTOR interaction is possible, it is not likely to be relevant under physiological conditions. Furthermore, unrelated and potent mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors (Torin1 and AZD-8055), effectively inhibit mTORC1/2 activity without inducing Xbp1 splicing, a defining feature of the unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185089.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In addition, a previous study demonstrated that Torin1 failed to induce eIF2a (Ser51) phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref041">41</xref>]. Taken together, our data argue against a direct role for mTOR/FKBP12 in mediating the high dose, UPR inducing effects of rapamycin and temsirolimus in tumor cells.</p>

<title>Decreased 28S ribosomal RNA solvent accessibility in cells treated with temsirolimus</title>
<p>Rapamycin is a naturally occurring macrocyclic polyketide synthesized by <italic>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref051">51</xref>]. It is structurally related to the general class of antibiotics known to inhibit prokaryotic protein synthesis through direct interaction with the 50S, large ribosomal subunit. In support of the potential for direct interaction between rapamycin and the ribosome, a previous study determined the crystal structure of rapamycin bound to the large ribosomal subunit of the eubacterium <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref053">53</xref>].

<p>Based on the evolutionarily conserved structure/function relationship between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes, we hypothesized that rapamycin/rapalogs may interact with human ribosomes. In order to test this hypothesis, we first quantified temsirolimus levels from treated cells following sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Temsirolimus was detected in ribosome fractions at all time points analyzed (1.5, 3 and 12hrs) following treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185089.s008">S1 Table</xref>). The amount of temsirolimus in heavy polysome fractions decreased over time and correlated with a decrease in the amount of ribosomes in each of these fractions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g002">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g004">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185089.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Since temsirolimus has only been shown to bind FKBP12 in cells, we analyzed samples for the presence of FKBP12 protein, as well as mTOR, in order to determine if this would account for the presence of drug in each fraction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185089.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, FKBP12 was detected primarily in free mRNP fractions whereas mTOR was detected in fractions containing 40S, 60S and 80S particles. Neither protein was found in polysome fractions in which temsirolimus was detected. In addition, we detected little overlap in FKBP12 and mTOR containing fractions suggesting that temsirolimus binding and ternary complex formation with each protein results in exclusion from mRNPs, ribosomal subunits and intact ribosomes.</p>

This is in contrast to the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> structure where the O2’ is positioned further away due to rotation about the glycosidic linkage which then supports hydrophobic interaction between the base and rapamycin. Another difference between the structures is the position of C1773 DR (U2140 SC). This appears to be a function of rapamycin binding as the base is normally involved in tertiary interactions with C2565 DR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185089.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref055">55</xref>]. Similar tertiary interactions are observed for U2140 SC and U2955 SC and the actual position and conformation of these nucleotides in the presence of rapamycin will require additional structural data from higher eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Although previous work, using ribosomes isolated from <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>, failed to show inhibition of protein synthesis in response to rapamycin, there is no functional equivalent of UPR in prokaryotes. Based on the structural data, it does not appear that the presence of rapamycin within the peptide exit tunnel would physically block the path by which nascent chains progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref052">52</xref>]. However, growing peptides must pass immediately adjacent to the rapamycin binding region as they approach the tunnel constriction formed by ribosomal proteins L4 and L22 (L17 in eukaryotes). This region of the tunnel has been shown to be involved in co-translational folding and stabilization of the nascent peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref059">59</xref>]. In addition, this region is important for sensing the presence of transmembrane (TM) segments in growing peptides and coupling this to structural rearrangements at the ER membrane, specifically opening and closing of the translocon pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref012">12</xref>]. Proper gating is required to maintain the integrity of the pore otherwise an unregulated efflux of calcium from the ER may occur, an event known to induce UPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref060">60</xref>]. In addition, proper gating of the translocon allows for multipass proteins to be properly inserted into the ER membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref061">61</xref>]. Disruption of this process could result in these proteins being presented to the ER as misfolded peptides resulting in UPR induction. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, future studies will be needed.</p>
<p>Mitogenic signaling stimulates mTOR kinase activity resulting in increased protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref034">34</xref>]. However, cells treated with rapamycin/rapalogs have decreased mTOR kinase activity and decreased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref044">44</xref>]. This information provided the rationale for using these proteins as biomarkers for studies evaluating rapamycin/rapalogs in clinical trials. However, phosphorylation of these mTOR targets is inhibited at doses far below those typically needed for therapeutic effectiveness. Therefore, it appears that these classic, proximate targets of mTOR may be highly sensitive biomarkers of rapamycin exposure, but not of effective exposure or of an exposure predictive of therapeutic response.</p>
<p>It is clear that at least two distinct levels of effect can be attributed to rapamycin/rapalogs. Modest, cytostatic responses in tumor cells (mTORC1 dependent effects) generally occur over a broad range of rapamycin/rapalog doses typically in the picomolar to high nanomolar range along with dramatic decreases S6K1 phosphorylation. In addition, these conditions have been shown to promote hyper phosphorylation of Akt over time due, in part, to loss of feedback inhibition through IRS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref062">62</xref>]. However, a second and distinct level of activity is seen at low micromolar doses and this is associated with maximal inhibition of tumor proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and in murine models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanism of action we describe for rapamycin and temsirolimus, may immediately inform their use in patients with cancer. Based on the results, it is clear the second mechanism of action for rapamycin and rapalogs is dependent on maximum concentration. In patients in clinical trials, this value is reflected as c<sub>max</sub>. Specific c<sub>max</sub> values can range as high as 2–20μM depending on the clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185089.ref029">29</xref>]. The low anti-tumor efficacy of rapamycin and rapalogs in some clinical trials may be due to failure to induce the unfolded protein response. In addition, it is possible that patients in previous trials subjected to continuous dosing may have experienced dose-limiting toxicity. We believe our current work provides the rationale for examining intermittent dosing which may be better tolerated by patients. Evaluation of pharmacodynamic biomarkers such as eIF2a (Ser51) phosphorylation, as an indicator of protein synthesis inhibition, and Xbp1 splicing, as a measure of UPR induction, would be useful and may better correlate with a positive clinical response.</p>
