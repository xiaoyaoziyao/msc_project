        <p>Akt, a serine/threonine kinase has been shown to stimulate glycolysis in cancer cells but its role in mitochondrial respiration is unknown. Using PTEN-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup>) with hyper-activated Akt as a cell model, we observed a higher respiratory capacity in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> compared to the wildtype (MEF<sup>WT</sup>). The respiratory phenotype observed in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> was reproduced in MEF<sup>WT</sup> by gene silencing of PTEN which substantiated its role in regulating mitochondrial function. The increased activities of the respiratory complexes (RCs) I, III and IV were retained in the same relative proportions as those present in MEF<sup>WT</sup>, alluding to a possible co-ordinated regulation by PTEN/Akt. Using LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) and Akt inhibitor IV, we showed that the regulation of enzyme activities and protein expressions of the RCs was dependent on PI3K/Akt. There was insignificant difference in the protein expressions of mitochondrial transcription factor: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and its downstream targets, the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) between MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> and MEF<sup>WT</sup>. Similarly, mRNA levels of the same subunits of the RCs detected in Western blots were not significantly different between MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> and MEF<sup>WT</sup> suggesting that the regulation by Akt on mitochondrial function was probably not via gene transcription. On the other hand, a decrease of total 4E-BP1 with a higher expression of its phosphorylated form relative to total 4E-BP1 was found in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup>, which inferred that the regulation of mitochondrial respiratory activities by Akt was in part through this protein translation pathway. Notably, gene silencing of 4E-BP1 up-regulated the protein expressions of all RCs and the action of 4E-BP1 appeared to be specific to these mitochondrial proteins. In conclusion, PTEN inactivation bestowed a bioenergetic advantage to the cells by up-regulating mitochondrial respiratory capacity through the 4E-BP1-mediated protein translation pathway.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homology deleted on chromosome 10) is one of the tumor suppressors frequently lost in cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Stokoe1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Suzuki1">[2]</xref>. It has both protein and lipid phosphatase activities; the latter is associated with tumor suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Li1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Maehama1">[4]</xref>. By dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), PTEN prevents the membrane recruitment and activation of Akt which promotes cell survival, proliferation, growth and glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Manning1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Stambolic1">[6]</xref>. The ability of Akt in stimulating cell proliferation is best illustrated in Cowden and other PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Hobert1">[7]</xref>. The benign nature of these tumors could be due to the fact that neither PTEN nor Akt alone is sufficient for the cell to become cancerous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-BlancoAparicio1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Xue1">[9]</xref>. The signaling downstream of Akt is integrated by mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and transduced to ribosomal protein kinase S6 kinase (S6K) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding proteins (4E-BP1, 2 and 3) to regulate protein translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Ma1">[10]</xref>. 4E-BP1 is a repressor of 5′cap-dependent mRNA translation and it is inactivated upon phosphorylation by mTORC1. The phosphorylated 4E-BP1 is then released from the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) which subsequently binds eIF4G to begin protein translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Gingras1">[11]</xref>. 4E-BP1 is a key effector of oncogenic activation of the Akt and ERK signaling pathways that integrate their function in tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Dowling1">[12]</xref>. It correlates with the clinical findings that expression of high level of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 is associated with poor prognosis in several types of tumor, independent of the alteration of upstream oncogenic signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Armengol1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While the activation of Akt by defective respiration in cancer cells has been shown to stimulate aerobic glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Elstrom1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Pelicano1">[15]</xref>, the action of Akt on the mitochondrial respiration in cell transformation remains largely unknown. In this study, MEF<sup>WT</sup> and MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> were used as a model to examine if the PTEN/Akt pathway has an effect on oxidative metabolism in normal and transformed cells. We compared a number of mitochondrial parameters and found that the MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> with hyper-activated Akt exhibited higher enzyme activities and protein expressions of all respiratory complexes. Pre-treatment of MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> with LY294002 (LY), an inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Brunn1">[16]</xref> and Akt inhibitor IV decreased (a) the phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser<sup>473</sup> and Thr<sup>308</sup>, (b) the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr<sup>37/46</sup> and (c) the expressions of RC I, III and IV. We also measured the mRNAs of the same subunits of the RCs detected in Western blot<bold>s</bold> and the protein expressions of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor (mtFTA) and showed that the regulation of mitochondrial function by Akt was probably not dependent on transcription. In conclusion, the higher proliferation in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> was accompanied by increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity. The protein expressions of the RCs in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> are attenuated by LY294002 and Akt inhibitor IV but are increased in MEF<sup>WT</sup> by siRNA targeting PTEN or 4E-BP1, suggesting a regulation of mitochondrial respiratory activities by the PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway through 4E-BP1-mediated protein translation.</p>

        <p>The MEF<sup>WT</sup> and MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Stambolic1">[6]</xref> were kindly provided by Dr. Tak W. Mak of University of Toronto. They were cultured in DMEM (Sigma, D1152) with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C.</p>

        <title>Respiratory flux</title>
        <p>The measurement of respiratory flux in intact MEF cells in a high-resolution respiratory system (Oroboros, Oxygraph-2k) was carried out according to the protocol described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Pesta1">[17]</xref>. Cellular routine (R) state was established with the presence of cells in 2 ml of culture medium in the chamber at 37°C with constant stirring for 15–30 min. In the absence of exogenous substrates, the R (routine) respiration is dependent on endogenous substrates and substrates present in the culture medium. Following the stabilization of R, oxygen consumption is measured in the presence of 2 µg/ml oligomycin to obtain the Leak (L) state. In this non-physiological state, L respiration reflects intrinsic uncoupling of the mitochondria. Subsequently, a maximal electron transport system capacity (E) of the mitochondria is achieved by titrating sequentially with repeated doses of 1 µl from 1 mM FCCP until a maximal response is achieved. The net Routine/E is then calculated by applying the formula: Net routine/E = (R−L)/E. This parameter therefore represents the net oxygen consumption coupled to ATP biosynthesis, taking into account the leak component.</p>

        <p>Aliquots of the mitochondrial or cytosolic fractions or total cell lysates containing 50 µg protein were subjected to electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and electro-blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 10% non-fat milk in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20, the membranes were probed with the respective primary antibodies of PTEN, Akt, p-Ser<sup>473</sup>Akt, p-Thr<sup>308</sup>Akt, 4E-BP1, p-Thr<sup>37/46</sup> 4E-BP1, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), VDAC (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) malic enzyme 1 (ME 1), hexokinase II (HK II), pan-actin (product no. sc-1615), PGC-1 α, NRF-1, mtTFA, SOD-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme V (LDH-V) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) (Alpha Diagnostic, Texas, USA), α-tubulin (Sigma-aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and aconitase 2 (ACO2) (Abgent, San Diego, CA USA). Western blot analysis of the respiratory complexes was carried out using a cocktail containing antibodies against the following subunits of the five RCs: complex I subunit NDU FB8, complex II subunit 30 kDa (SdhB), complex III subunit Core 2 (RC III core 2), complex IV subunit I (CO1) and ATP synthase α-subunit (ATP5 F<sub>1</sub>α1) (MitoSciences, Oregon, USA). All primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1∶1000 except for α-tubulin and pan-actin, the loading controls, which were diluted 1∶20000. Anti-goat pan-actin was used as the loading control for the Western blot analysis of the respiratory complexes because the α-subunit of ATP synthase and α-tubulin of same species (mouse) have similar molecular weight and therefore could not be resolved.</p>

Rotenone (5 µM) and malonate (10 mM), inhibitors of RCI and II, respectively, decreased the MMP as reflected by an attenuation of the ratio of red∶green fluorescence.

          <title>Mitochondrial Membrane potential (MMP)</title>
          <p>The generation of mitochondrial membrane potential is often used as an indicator to assess mitochondrial respiratory function. We measured the MMP of intact mitochondria using the JC-1 dye with serial addition of substrates and inhibitors. The uptake of JC-1, a cationic dye, depends essentially on the MMP. The oxidation of respiratory substrates such as malate/glutamate and succinate added to mitochondria induced the generation MMP, resulting in an increased entry of JC-1 monomers which exhibited a green fluorescence. With enhanced accumulation, the monomers combined to form J-aggregates which showed a red fluorescence. The ratio of red∶green fluorescence measured the magnitude of the MMP. The MMP induced by malate/glutamate and succinate was higher in the MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> compared to MEF<sup>WT</sup> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>.

          <title>Respiratory Flux</title>
          <p>To investigate the effect of PTEN/Akt on mitochondrial function, oxygen consumption was measured with intact cells in normal culture medium. As compared to isolated mitochondria, the intact cell analysis allowed an integration of regulatory events by which cytoplasmic and nuclear factors influenced mitochondrial function. Net R/E (where R = Routine and E = ETS) combined basal oxygen consumption (Routine), oligomycin-inhibited respiration (Leak) and maximal capacity of electron transport system (E) to provide a parameter R/E which measured the proportion of respiratory capacity coupled to oxidative phosphorylation. As shown in a representative set of data for MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> and MEF<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), the former had higher Net Routine/E, which inferred that a higher proportion of oxygen consumption of the electron transport system was coupled to ATP synthesis. This could be contributed by a lower degree of leak respiration, expressed as Leak/E as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> inset, which was obtained from three independent experiments.</p>

          <title>Activities and protein expressions of respiratory complexes</title>
          <p>The higher MMP and rate of ATP biosynthesis in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> observed above suggested a possible increase in the electron transport system coupled to the phosphorylation of ADP. This was reflected in the data of respiratory flux above. Indeed, extracts of mitochondria isolated from MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> showed higher activities of all five respiratory complexes compared to the MEF<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Interestingly, the ratios of RC III/I, IV/I, and IV/III in the MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> were similar in magnitude to those in the MEF<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, inset). This observation alluded to a coordinated regulation of these RCs via transcription, translation and/or post-translation.

The PTEN-knockdown cells exhibited higher Net R/E with lower Leak/E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting that PTEN aberration could be responsible for the enhanced coupling between oxidation and phosphorylation in mitochondria isolated from MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> (shown previously as NetR/E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). To further explore if the higher mitochondrial respiration in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> was attributed to hyperactivated Akt, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was attempted with LY294002, known to act on PI3K and mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Brunn1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Feldman1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Thoreen1">[29]</xref> and Akt Inhibitor IV, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of Akt autokinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Pastorino1">[30]</xref>.

          <p>We next explored if the Akt-mediated mitochondrial function was regulated by protein translation. As mentioned previously, 4E-BP1 has a central role in converging the upstream signals to protein translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Dowling1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Armengol1">[13]</xref>. Comparatively, MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> had lower 4E-BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>) and a higher proportion of p-Thr<sup>37/46</sup>4E-BP1 relative to total 4E-BP1 when compared to MEF<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, inset). The mRNA levels of 4E-BP1 in the two cell types were not significantly different (p = 0.148) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>. In addition, the repression of activities and expressions of the RCs by LY294002 and Akt inhibitor IV could also be mediated by 4E-BP1 as incubation with LY294001 resulted in a band shift downwards in total and p-4E-BP1 (shown by arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), a phenomenon which indicated hypo-phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Gingras1">[11]</xref>. Although there was no band shift with Akt inhibitor IV, there was evidence of a more hypo-phosphorylated p-Thr<sup>37/46</sup> 4E-BP1 and total 4E-BP1 (shown by arrows of lower bands of greater intensity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). In general, hypo-phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and/or p-Thr<sup>37/46</sup> 4E-BP1 would lead to decreased protein translation which was evident in RC I, III and IV expressions in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> following inhibition by LY and Akt inhibitor IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g004">Figs. 4C and 4D</xref>). Gene silencing of 4E-BP1 in MEF<sup>WT</sup> and MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> up-regulated the expressions of all RCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g006">Fig. 6E and 6F</xref>, respectively). The fact that this was also observed in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> suggested that there was residual 4E-BP1 in these cells which was demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>. The higher degree of increase in RC expressions in the MEF<sup>WT</sup> by si-4E-BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>) could be explained by their higher basal 4E-BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The immortalized MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Stambolic1">[6]</xref> provided a cell model to study any aberrant metabolism resulting from the oncogenic action of Akt. Following its activation, Akt has been reported to translocate to the mitochondria to act on its downstream targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Bijur1">[33]</xref>. Thus, there is evidence of a cross-talk between Akt and mitochondria. This study explores if Akt hyperactivation has an impact on mitochondrial metabolism. It is conceivable that accelerated aerobic glycolysis from Akt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Elstrom1">[14]</xref> produces increased pyruvate which is channeled concomitantly to lactate and the TCA cycle. The reducing equivalents, NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> generated in the mitochondrial matrix are finally oxidized by the active electron transport system consisting of up-regulated RCs in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup>. These could contribute to the higher MMP and ATP biosynthesis in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> and increased oxygen consumption reported in Akt-transfected MEFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Nogueira1">[34]</xref>. Our study also showed consistently higher net routine oxygen consumption in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> which was reproducible by silencing PTEN in the wild type. In both instances, the lower degree of leak respiration may lead to their greater efficiency in OXPHOS. Lower leak is possibly the result of their higher cholesterol content as we had noted consistently that 2–3 times more digitonin was required for cell permeabilization of MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup>. It has been reported that cholesterol enhances the rigidness of mitochondrial membranes leading to a lower leak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Baggetto1">[35]</xref>. In addition, higher enzyme activities of the RCs could be another contributing factor. Of particular interest is that the MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> retain similar relative proportions of activities of RCI, III and IV as those present in the wild type which infers that they could be co-ordinately regulated. These three RCs form supercomplexes known as respirasomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Dudkina1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Wittig1">[37]</xref> which may subject them to collective regulation. Our ratio of the enzyme activities of 1∶2 for RCIII: RCIV is coincidentally similar to that deduced in the model of the “respiratory string” which is made up of several respirasomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Wittig1">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Two inhibitors of the Akt/mTOR pathway were used to examine if the higher RC activities and expressions were attributed to hyperactivated Akt from PTEN aberration in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup>. They are LY294002 (LY) which targets both PI3K and mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Brunn1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Feldman1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Thoreen1">[29]</xref> and Akt inhibitor IV which has previously been reported to block Akt autokinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Pastorino1">[30]</xref>. Both inhibitors decreased RC enzyme activities and protein expressions of RC I, III, and IV, with little to no change in RCII and RCV, an observation which further supports the concept of organization of these three proton pumping RCs in supercomplexes of respirasomes discussed above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Wittig1">[37]</xref>. In addition to their co-ordinated regulation, their ease of change could be explained by their different values of ΔG of folding energy and the length of the 5′UTRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Zid1">[38]</xref>. RC IV with a ΔG of −7Kcal/mol and short 5′UTRs could render it more amendable to inhibition and possibly transcription and/or translation in contrast to RCV with a ΔG of −46Kcal/mol which would be more resistant to change as towards LY and Akt inhibitor in this study. Overall, LY seems to exert a greater influence on these reactions as it is an inhibitor of both PI3K and mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Brunn1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Feldman1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Thoreen1">[29]</xref>. Inhibition of mTORC2 by LY would compromise the phosphorylation of Ser<sup>473</sup> and the subsequent phosphorylation at Thr<sup>308</sup> of Akt necessary for its full activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Sarbassov1">[39]</xref>. In addition, its inhibition of mTORC1 would have a more direct impact on 4E-BP1 as compared to Akt inhibitor IV which acts upstream. However, the greater effect of LY did not result in a more pronounced inhibition of RC enzyme activities. This may suggest that RC activities are more directly affected by Akt kinase since the Akt inhibitor IV has been reported to compromise the Akt autokinase activity more significantly than wortmanin, another PI3K inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Pastorino1">[30]</xref>. No attempt is made to correlate the degree of inhibition of enzyme activities with protein expressions of the RCs as Western blot analysis depends on only one of several subunits present in the RC, whereas enzyme activity measures the functionality of the composite RC. A differential mechanism of action of the two inhibitors was also inferred from the distinct band shifts in 4E-BP1 and its phosphorylated form by LY which was not apparent with Akt inhibitor IV.</p>
      <p>Although our data of LY and Akt inhibitor IV described above provide a plausible relationship between Akt, 4E-BP1 and RC expressions, siRNA targeting 4E-BP1 is deemed necessary to establish unequivocally a direct association between 4E-BP1 and RC expressions. In eukaryotes, protein synthesis is mainly regulated by 4E-BP1, a repressor of 5′cap-dependent translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Sonenberg1">[40]</xref>. 4E-BP1, a downstream target of mTORC1, binds eIF4E to inhibit protein translation. On phosphorylation, it detaches from eIF4E to initiate protein translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Gingras1">[11]</xref>. With gene silencing of 4E-BP1, expressions of RC I to V were up-regulated in MEF<sup>WT</sup>. Likewise, PTEN gene silencing showed a similar effect. The first suggestive evidence of an involvement of translational regulation was the observation of a drastic reduction of this translational repressor in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup>. To examine if up-regulation is peculiar to the RCs, we measured the expressions of assorted proteins (namely cytosolic proteins: ME 1, LDH-V and mitochondrial proteins: HK II, UCP2, ACO2, Bcl-2 and VDAC) besides RCI to V, following silencing of 4E-BP1. Of these, only the RCs were up-regulated which appeared to suggest some degree of specificity of 4E-BP1 regulation on the electron-transport proteins</p>
      <p>Generally, the selection of mRNAs for translation is exerted at the initiation stage with binding of elF4F complex to 5′-end of each mRNA and interaction between 3′UTR binding proteins and 4E-BPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Cridge1">[41]</xref>. The binding of the mRNA binding proteins of the Pumilio (PUF) family to the 3′ UTR can control mRNA stability and translational repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Wickens1">[42]</xref> to provide some measure of selectivity. Of all the Pufs indentified in yeast, Puf3p has been shown to bind nearly exclusively to nuclear encoded mitochondrial mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Olivas1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Gerber1">[44]</xref>. Mitochondrial mRNAs, which essentially code for the assembly factors of respiratory chain complexes and the mitochondrial translation machinery are highly dependent on the presence of Puf3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-SaintGeorges1">[45]</xref>. Taken together, we concluded that it is not impossible for 4E-BP1 to regulate expressions of mitochondrial RCs in a selective manner. However, post-translational modification of enzyme activities cannot be ruled out as several subunits of RCI were predicted from proteomic studies to be potentially capable of phosphorylation, e.g. tyrosine phosphorylation of RCI and RCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Augereau1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Koopman1">[47]</xref>. Transcriptional control was deemed unlikely as there was no significant difference in the mRNAs of several subunits of the RCs between MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> and MEF<sup>WT</sup>. Furthermore, the protein expressions of the transcription factor PGC-1α and its associated downstream targets, NRF-1 and mtTFA were similar between MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> and MEF<sup>WT</sup>. Our conclusion concurred with the report that the regulation of mitochondrial function by mTOR is independent of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Ramanathan1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the hyperactivated Akt confers on MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> a bioenergetic advantage by up-regulating their oxidative mitochondrial functions. We propose the enhanced mitochondrial capacity in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> is used to support their higher rate of proliferation upon substrate availability. Increased OXPHOS has been shown in H-Ras transformed fibroblast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-deGroof1">[49]</xref> and this bestows a proliferative advantage to K-Ras-mediated tumorigenecity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Weinberg1">[50]</xref> and provides energy to transformed human mesenchymal stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Funes1">[51]</xref>. Our hypothesis that mitochondrial respiratory capacity is regulated by the Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 cascade as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045806-g007">Fig. 7</xref>. Supporting evidence was provided using known small molecules as inhibitors of this signaling pathway and siRNA to knockdown PTEN or 4E-BP1 to demonstrate the link between PTEN/Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling and protein expressions of the electron transport respiratory complexes. Our study has highlighted the role of 4E-BP1 in mitochondrial function in the early-transformed cells with PTEN/Akt aberration.</p>

          <title>A proposed model of crosstalk between Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway and mitochondria.</title>
          <p>PTEN knockout in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup>) results in an accumulation of PIP<sub>3</sub> produced by PI3K at the plasma membrane. The recruitment of Akt and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) by PIP<sub>3</sub> is mediated via their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. The phosphorylation at Ser<sup>473</sup> by mTORC2 and that at Thr<sup>308</sup> by PDK1 leads to a fully activated Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Sarbassov1">[39]</xref> which then phosphorylates mTORC1. 4E-BP1, the downstream target of mTORC1, on phosphorylation becomes inactive as a repressor of protein translation as it is not able to bind to eIF4E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045806-Gingras1">[11]</xref>. This leads to the initiation of protein translation of RC components as shown in this study, contributing to enhanced OXPHOS in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup>. Likewise, knockdown of PTEN in MEF<sup>WT</sup> or of 4E-BP1 in MEF<sup>WT</sup> and MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> by RNA silencing also increased RC expressions. Conversely, attenuation of the hyper-activated Akt in MEF<sup>PTEN−/−</sup> by LY294002 or Akt inhibitor IV leads to lower RC activities and expressions. Together, the data presented supports our hypothesis of a link between Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 and mitochondrial respiratory function.</p>
