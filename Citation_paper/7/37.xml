					<title>Background</title><p>The ancient and diverse, yet understudied arthropod class Diplopoda, the millipedes, has a muddled taxonomic history.

The existing classification of the group comprises 16 orders.

			<title>Introduction</title>
		<p>Understanding historical and contemporary patterns of biodiversity are integral to evaluating and conserving the planet’s organismal diversity.  Arthropods are the largest group of animals in terms of number of nominal species, making up roughly half of all described metazoan taxa.  Consequently, the higher-level classifications of many arthropod groups are understudied and have not been subjected to modern phylogenetic analysis.  One such group is the subphylum Myriapoda.  While the myriapod class Chilopoda (centipedes) is one of the few arthropod groups that has an ordinal level classification that presumably reflects phylogeny, is well supported, and is generally agreed upon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]; the much larger class, the Diplopoda (Arthropoda: Myriapoda), does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].  </p>
		<p>The ancient, cosmopolitan class Diplopoda consists of primarily detritivorous species, though some have evolved additional feeding strategies (e.g., fungivory and carnivory).  Despite their abundance and diversity, the class has received comparatively less attention; little is known about the group’s ecology, life histories, and evolutionary patterns and processes.  In many terrestrial habitats, they are perhaps second only to terrestrial oligochaete annelids in carrying out the essential ecosystem service of breaking down dead plant matter and returning its nutrients and minerals to the soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].  Though generally harmless to humans, most millipedes can ward off predators by producing unpalatable defense secretions comprising a remarkable and diverse array of chemical compounds (e.g. hydrogen cyanide, benzoquinone, etc.; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]).  Millipedes are found on every continent (excluding Antarctica) and in virtually every biome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].  The class comprises 12,000 described species with an estimated 80,000 total [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] (but see Brewer et al. 2012 for more conservative, empirically-derived estimates).  Most taxa are described from the well-sampled temperate regions of North America and Europe, whereas less heavily sampled areas like South America currently have only six endemic families and far fewer species [Sierwald, in prep]. The group has a long evolutionary history dating back to 428 million years ago where a diplopod-like species, <italic>Pneumodesmus newmani</italic> Wilson and Anderson, 2004, is currently recognized as the oldest known land animal fossil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].  A few taxa have recently been subjected to rigorous phylogenetic analyses, but these have been mostly species groups or tribes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].  </p>
		<sec id="s1.1">
			<title>Millipede Systematics</title>
			<p>Many past attempts to classify millipedes at higher-levels have been made.  Early phylogenetic studies focused on morphology and suffered from a number of shortcomings that include not employing an explicit optimality criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and a lack of sufficient taxon sampling and character breadth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].  The general consensus is that all orders, except perhaps the Spirostreptida (i.e., the placement of the suborders Cambalidea and Epinannolenidea), are monophyletic, but this assumption has never been subjected to a rigorous phylogenetic evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, the relationships between and within many of the orders are equivocal.  </p>
			<p>The first clade to be designated within the Diplopoda was the Chilognatha Latreille, 1810.  The first classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] focused on the 15 genera in use at the time; many of which gave rise to the currently recognized orders.  After a period of considerable taxonomic proliferation in the early 20<sup>th</sup> Century, Cook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] produced a classification for 190 genera placed among 50 families.  This framework was used by Hoffman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] to produce a classification that, when translated into a phylogeny, results in a highly unresolved Helminthomorpha.  Attempts to recover the phylogeny of millipedes via cladistic analyses commenced with Enghoff’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] morphological character-based analysis of the millipede orders.  This phylogeny recovered the clade Penicillata and, as a grade, the clades Pentazonia, Helminthomorpha, Colobognatha, and Eugnatha.  However, the relationships among the eugnathan orders remained unresolved.  Sierwald et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] used a morphological matrix derived from Enghoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and included the enigmatic order Siphoniulida; their analysis recovered many of the traditional groupings.  The most recent diplopod classifications are based on the works of Shelley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and Shear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] both of which are derived from the nomenclatural classification scheme rather from formal analyses of data.</p>
			<p>	The morphological characters that have been used to delimit millipede taxa vary in efficacy depending on taxonomic level.  Most millipede species are described on the basis of similarities and differences in the gonopods, male modified legs used to transfer spermatophores.  These character systems have been shown to be useful at the species level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] but, unfortunately, are of limited use in high-level studies.  Gonopods are not located on the same body region in all of the orders and do not have the same exact functional morphology; therefore they may not be homologous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].  Beyond the gonopods, morphological character systems are group dependent when they exist; fewer than 50% of millipede higher-taxa are described using apomorphic characters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. </p>
			<p>More recently, phylogenetic investigations have been conducted using molecular characters to provide additional lines of evidence and testable homology hypotheses.  As already mentioned above, these studies have generally lacked either sufficient loci (characters) or a sufficient number of terminals (taxa) to make definitive decisions regarding relationships and thus have resulted in often confusing, unintuitive, and unconvincing hypothesized groupings.  Studies with adequate taxon sampling to address millipede relationships have only recently been attempted and focus more on the relationships within the Myriapoda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].  The study published by Regier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] recovered many of the traditional orders with the Penicillata sister to the Pentazonia and Helminthomorpha.  However, the tree lacks sufficient resolution at shallower levels.  The most recent and only study to include both molecular data and characters based on morphology is that presented in Sierwald and Bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].  Combining the molecular data of Regier et al. and a novel morphological matrix comprising 41 characters, Sierwald and Bond recovered many traditional groups but found others to be polyphyletic (e.g., the Nematophora) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g001">Figure 1</xref>).  Subsequently, Brewer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], has used full mitochondrial genomes in an attempt to reconstruct the relationships between millipede ordinal taxa.  The taxon sampling lacked many of the orders and most loci failed to contain adequate signal to confidently reconstruct relationships at such deep phylogenetic levels.    </p>

			<p>	A potential source of many unlinked, protein-coding nuclear genes is information drawn from the expressed coding sequences of the millipede genome, the transcriptome. As discussed by Hedin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have provided a massive source of genomic data that can be employed for phylogenetic analyses of non-model taxa.  Methods to employ these data in deep-level systematic studies are just now being developed, but a number of studies are currently available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] that, taken together, provide a set of moderately well tested approaches to effectively assembling and analyzing transcriptomes for phylogeny reconstruction.  </p>
			<p>Future detailed studies of millipede evolution and ecology require a solid classification scheme that reflects phylogenetic history.  To this end, we hope to produce a well-supported ordinal-level phylogeny that is extensible to a classification reflecting the evolutionary history of these animals.  The relationships both within and between many of the diplopod high-level groups are not well understood; studies focusing on ordinal level relationships using different techniques and character sources have often recovered conflicting tree topologies that support some traditional groupings while showing no evidence of others.  To help elucidate the evolutionary history and relationships between the ordinal taxa of the Diplopoda, the main objective of this study is to produce a phylogeny using a massive molecular dataset assembled from coding sequences of 12 exemplar arthropod specimens (9 millipedes and 3 outgroups) representing most of the currently recognized millipede ordinal-level diversity.  We employ Illumina RNA-Seq data to generate the first ever phylogenomic data set produced for a myriapod taxon.</p>

				<p>	No special permits were required for the described field studies, the locations were not privately owned or protected, and the study organisms are not endangered or protected.  Taxa were targeted to represent the diversity of ordinal level taxa of the Diplopoda and a centipede outgroup (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079935-t001">Table 1</xref>).  Living animals were field collected and preserved in RNAlater (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA) either immediately or upon return to the lab.  The anterior head region plus several subsequent body rings were extracted from larger animals, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and crushed with a mortar and pestle.  Total RNA was extracted using the RNEasy extraction kit and Shredder columns (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA).  The entire bodies of smaller animals were used.  Total RNA was quantified and shipped to Hudson Alpha (Huntsville, Alabama) on dry ice for cDNA library preparation and subsequent sequencing.  The barcoded libraries were pooled four to a flowcell lane and sequenced using the Illumina RNA-seq method with HiSEQ Paired-end 50 bp chemistry.  Voucher specimens are available from the Auburn University Museum of Natural History collection, and the sequence data are available from the NCBI short-read archive (SRA) (accession s: SRX326775 – SRX326777, SRX326779 – SRX326784).</p>

				<p>	The resulting reads for each taxon were contained in two FASTQ files representing each of the paired-end reads; primer and barcode sequences were removed immediately after sequencing.  Individual read files were subjected to quality trimming using the FASTX Toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].  All sites occurring after a position with a quality score of 20 or less were removed, and all sequences less than 30 bases in length were deleted.  The first nine bases of each sequence were removed to eliminate primer artifacts.  The reads were resynchronized using the script sync_paired_end_reads.py (https://github.com/martijnvermaat/bio-playground/tree/master/sync-paired-end-reads).

				<p>	Trinity output representing assembled transcripts and EST contigs from GenBank (<italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> Say, 1821 and <italic>Archispirostreptus gigas</italic> (Peters, 1855)) were analyzed using the HaMStR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] approach to identify orthologs.  The HaMStR method uses “core orthologs” from a defined set of proteomes to train Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to detect orthologous sequences in Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) libraries or transcriptomes.  The arthropod core orthology set was employed, and <italic>Daphnia pulex</italic> (Linnaeus, 1758) (Arthropoda: Pancrustacea: Branchiopoda) was used as the first reference taxon because it is presumably the closest relative to the myriapods and arachnids in the provided sequences.  The default e-value was changed to “1e-20” to be more conservative (although the total number of orthologs recovered varied little when using the default of “1”).  The representative option, which concatenates contigs representing non-overlapping sections of a single ortholog, was used to increase data recovery.  </p>
				<p>	Ortholog-specific FASTA files were assembled representing sequences from all taxa for which the locus of interest was recovered by the HaMSTR method.

Custom scripts were used to trim any ambiguous sequence from the first twenty bases of each sequence of all ortholog files.  The resulting FASTA files were individually aligned using MAFFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].  The program SCaFoS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] was used to select alignments for phylogenetic analysis.  The following SCaFoS parameters were used gamma=yes, puz=yes, t=5, o=gscl, s=50, g=50, m=25, format=fpmnba, color=yes, cmp=yes.  Gblocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] was used to trim misaligned areas or areas with many indels with the following parameters: -b1=”half of sequences in the alignment +1”, -b2=”half of sequences in the alignment +1”, -b3=8, -b4=10, -b5=h.  Any remaining columns containing all gaps or only one non-gap character were deleted from all alignments.  In an attempt to remove any paralogous sequences that were falsely included, any sequence in which 75% or more amino acid residues differ from the consensus were deleted using output from the EMBOSS package infoalign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].  Alignment masking was performed on each remaining ortholog alignment using Aliscore version 1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and ALICUT version 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].  Any remaining alignments less than 100 AA in length were deleted, individual sequences shorter than 100 AA were deleted, and alignments with less than 11 of the 12 included taxa were deleted.  The cutoff for taxon inclusion (11 of 13) was chosen to be the most conservative while recognizing the limitations of the EST dataset (i.e., <italic>Archispirostreptus</italic>).  The final processed alignments were concatenated using FASconCAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] for subsequent supermatrix analyses.  </p>

				<title>Phylogenetic Inference</title>
				<p>	Phylogenetic trees were inferred using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) optimality criteria.  The ML trees were obtained via analyses of the individual alignments and the supermatrix with partitions corresponding to each ortholog in RAxML version 7.2.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].  Analyses consisted of 1,000 random addition sequence replicates (RAS) with support values obtained from 1,000 bootstrap replicates.  The PROTGAMMAWAG model of AA substitution was used for all partitions.  BI trees based on the supermatrix were obtained using Phylobayes version 3.3b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].  Five independent chains were run for 10,000 cycles sampling every cycle analyzing the supermatrix using default parameters.  Run convergence was estimated and consensus trees were obtained using the bpcomp command.  The first 20% of cycles were discarded as burn-in.  To assess the sensitivity of our resulting phylogeny to long-branch attraction artifacts and outgroup selection, we removed the outgroup taxa and reran the phylogenetic analyses as above.</p>
				<p>	To assess whether our results are significantly better than previous estimates of millipede ordinal phylogeny given our novel data, we conducted likelihood-based topology tests.  Previous tree topology hypotheses that were well-resolved in regards to the taxa included herein were trimmed to contain only those taxa present in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].  Likelihood values for all topologies were calculated using FastTree 2.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and were compared using CONSEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].  CONSEL employs eight methods for comparing tree topology hypotheses given a dataset: approximately unbiased test (AU), two bootstrapping methods (NP &amp; BP), Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP), Kishino-Hasegawa (KH), Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH), weighted Kishino-Hasegawa (WSH), and weighted Shimodaira-Hasegawa (WSH).</p>

				<title>Ancestral State Reconstruction</title>
				<p>	The BI phylogeny and Mesquite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] were used to reconstruct the ancestral states of three characters of importance in millipede evolution: gonopods, ozopores, and spinnerets.  The characters were coded as discrete and unordered as follows for the orders the exemplar represents: gonopods (0=none, 1=ninth and tenth leg pairs, and 2=eighth and ninth leg pairs), ozopores (0=none, 1=present), and spinnerets (0=none, 1=present).  A parsimony model was used to reconstruct the ancestral states at all nodes on the tree.</p>

				<title>Molecular Divergence Dating</title>
				<p>	Estimates of divergence dates and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using Phylobayes 3.3 and the majority rule consensus tree from the BI analyses described above.  Two fossil constraints were used, <italic>Pneumodesmus newmani</italic> Wilson and Anderson, 2004 (origin of the Helminthomorpha - 428 MYA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]) and <italic>Sigmastria dilata</italic> (origin of the Juliformia - 410 MYA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]).  A maximum age for the origin of the Diplopoda was set to coincide with the emergence of land plants (~480 MYA), and the age of the root node was set at 560 MYA, following Rehm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] with an exponential distribution (i.e., a standard deviation of 560 MY).  The analysis was run for 10,000 cycles under the “UGAM” method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] and for 10,000 cycles under a lognormal relaxed clock model. The first 2,000 generations of each run were discarded as burn-in.</p>

				<title>Transcriptomic sequences and dataset assembly</title><p>	High throughput sequencing technologies provide millions of reads that confer high confidence in base calls and, when assembled, data from thousands of loci.  The use of transcriptomic data allow us to construct datasets comprising many unlinked regions of millipede genomes comprising only protein-coding sequence, which are more likely to be appropriate for deep phylogenetic studies.  By doing so, we can confidently avoid the impact of past hybridization events and deep coalescent problems that can have profound effects on phylogenetic studies that have previously relied on mitochondrial gene regions or just a few nuclear loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].  Additionally, such a tremendous wealth of data permits us to be selective with respect to loci included in phylogenetic analyses while still assembling relatively large datasets.  The HaMSTR approach of choosing orthologs from EST data, or RNA-seq data in our case, performed adequately.  By targeting core orthologs, the difficulties associated with <italic>de novo</italic> orthology assessment and varying completeness of transcriptome recovery are largely alleviated.</p>
				<p>		The HaMSTR approach coupled with various levels of dataset optimization has been successfully employed in other recent studies of scorpions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] protostomia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] arthropods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], and molluscs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].  These studies all employed some varied combination of both traditional and second generation sequencing techniques and a range of dataset optimization approaches, but used similar approaches to filtering data for orthologous sequences. While Illumina reads lengths are currently considerable shorter than those produced by the 454 pyrosequencing technology, these methods are more cost effective, yield more data, and are well-suited for transcriptome sequencing due to the lack of homopolymers in most coding DNA.  </p>
				<p>	By using dataset optimization techniques on individual gene alignments, we reduced the total millipede dataset to 11.59% of its original concatenated size.  These methods reduced the occurrence of gaps in the alignments by 20.82% and missing data by 18.57%.  Our data were optimized, with regards to signal and information content, using only the taxa included in this study.  Although a lot of data were discarded, these rejected alignment regions were found to contain too many gaps or lacked appropriate phylogenetic signal.  The optimization methods allowed us to build datasets that comprise confidently aligned orthologs that are relatively free of phylogenetic “noise”.  In the end, this highly filtered data set comprised 221 nuclear protein coding genes composed of 61,641 aligned amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079935-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

				<title>Millipede phylogenomics</title>
				<p>		The phylogeny obtained from the BI analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g001">Figure 1</xref>) has high support values at many nodes and recovered many groupings supported in past analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].  The Myriapoda was recovered as monophyletic with a 0.99 posterior probability.  The Diplopoda (or, more accurately, the Chilognatha) was recovered with a posterior probability of 1.00.  Because no members of the order Polyxenida were included in the analyses, the millipede clade strictly depicts the Chilognatha (Pentazonia + Helminthomorpha).  Within the Helminthomorpha (worm-like millipedes), the Colobognatha and Eugnatha were each recovered with posterior probabilities of 1.00.  This is significant because past analyses of morphology and molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] do not recover a monophyletic Eugnatha.  The Nematophora (Stemmiulida+Callipodida+Chrodeumatida) was not recovered <italic>sensu stricto</italic> as the Stemmiulida allied with the Juliformia and Polydesmida (PP = 0.99).  The Stemmiulida has been separated from the other nematophorans in past analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and was not included in the group by Hoffman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To our knowledge, a grouping of Juliformia+Polydesmida+Stemmiulida has never before been proposed.  </p>
				<p>	The ML phylogeny was similar to the BI tree except with regards to the placement of the Polydesmida.  The polydesmidan exemplar, <italic>Pseudopolydesmus</italic> sp., was recovered as basal to the remaining eugnathan millipedes in the ML analysis.  The support for the remaining eugnathan orders as a monophyletic group excluding the Polydesmida had low support (BS = 20).  When the ML bootstrap replicates were used to assess support for the BI tree (i.e., support for the BI tree was calculated in RAxML using the previously generated bootstrap results), the Phylobayes topology had greater support at all nodes than the RAxML tree.  In general, the BI tree had better support than the ML tree and is our preferred topology. </p>
				<p>	The dataset presented here appears to be robust regarding outgroup selection.  The topology was unaffected when the outgroup taxa were removed indicating strong signal in the data.  Additionally, the data support our results over previous hypotheses regardless of the comparison method used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g002">Figure 2</xref>).  Unfortunately, only a single method preferred our Phylobayes results over the RAxML trees, and all other methods could not distinguish between them.</p>

				<title>A consideration of millipede classification</title>
				<p>		The current millipede classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079935-t005">Table 5</xref>, comprises 16 extant orders placed in a number of superordinal and higher taxa.  The class Diplopoda, the millipedes, is universally considered a natural group and is defined by four synapomorphies: 1) body segments are fused to form diplosegments in the trunk region, resulting in two leg pairs per body segment for most of the length of the body; 2) the first segment behind the head, the collum, region is legless – the class Pauropoda, the presumed sister group to the millipedes, has a collum segment, but this segment has leg rudiments; 3) the antennae of millipedes bear four sensory cones; and 4) sperm are aflagellate.  The BI and ML phylogenies clearly support a monophyletic Diplopoda (although our analyses do not include the millipede order Polyxenida or the sister class Pauropoda), as do previous cladistic and molecular phylogenetic analyses of the group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p>
				<p>	The most “primitive” millipede order, the Polyxenida (bristly millipedes), is the sole member of the subclass Penicillata.  Polyxenidans lack modified mating appendages of any kind and, instead, deposit spermatophors on a substrate for the females to find and pick up.  Additionally, bristly millipedes do not produce defense secretions but instead have long modified setae that break off and tangle the mandibles of predatory insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].  The group is defined by having tufts of setae and a transverse suture between the ocelli and antennae; their bodies are generally soft and uncalcified.  The Tömösváry organ is small in most species.  Although no bristly millipedes were included in our analyses, the order Polyxenida was the sister group to the remaining millipedes in Sierwald and Bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], Sierwald et al., and Enghoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and thus is likely to remain non-contentious.  However, Regier and Shultz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and Regier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] recovered a Polyxenida+Pentazonia clade in some of their analyses.</p>
				<p>	The remaining millipede orders are placed in the subclass Chilognatha comprising the Pentazonia (pill millipedes) and Helminthomorpha (worm-like millipedes) clades.  The subclass is composed of 15 orders and is defined by three synapomorphies: 1) calcified cuticle; 2) the absence of trichobothria; and 3) sternites and first legs fused in females.  All millipede transcriptomes used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships reported herein represent Chilognatha taxa; the group is recovered as monphyletic in all of our analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g001">Figure 1</xref>).  Of the published millipede phylogenetic studies, only Regier and Shultz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and Regier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] did not recover a monophyletic Chilognatha.  As mentioned above, the Polyxenida rendered the Pentazonia paraphyletic, thus calling into question the monophyly of the Chilognatha.  Alternatively, the ML analysis of Regier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] finds Chilognatha to be monophyletic.</p>
				<p>	The infraclass Pentazonia comprises three orders arranged into two superorders: the Linacomorpha (order Glomeridesmida) and the Oniscomorpha (orders Sphaerotheriidia and Glomerida).  Pill millipedes generally have modified posterior appendages in males for grasping females during mating and lack defense secretions (although the Glomerida may have evolved chemical defenses independent of the remaining diplopod taxa).  The following five characters define the Pentazonia: 1) divided sternites; 2) a labrum that has a single median tooth; 3) lamellae lingules of the gnathochilarium fused; 4) mandible with molar plate process; and 5) the last tergite is enlarged and covers the anal segment.  Because we included only a single pill millipede (<italic>Glomeridesmus</italic> sp.) in our analysis, we cannot comment on the monophyly of the group as a whole. While most analyses support the monophyly of the Pentazonia, Regier and Shultz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] recovered a tree that calls the monophyly of the pill millipedes into question.  The Limacomorpha (= order Glomeridesmida) is distinguished by the following characteristics: 1) females with pleated ovipositor at coxa of leg pair 2 and 2) last pair of legs held straight out posteriorly.  The Oniscomorpha comprises the two orders Glomerida and Sphaerotheriida.  The group is defined by having only up to 13 body rings.  Of the published studies that include adequate sampling of pill millipedes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], only Regier and Shultz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] disputed the monophyly of the Oniscomorpha.</p>
				<p>	The infraclass Helminthomorpha contains the remaining 12 orders in two subterclasses, the Colobognatha and Eugnatha.  Helminthomorpha are characterized by: 1) the presence of paired lateral ozopores (pores for release of repugnatory secretions) on each trunk diplosegment starting at body ring five, 2) lacking spiracles on body rings two and three, and 3) the tracheae are not branched (as in the Polyxenida and Pentazonia).  Species in the Helminthomorpha also possess modified anterior legs in males, the gonopods, to transfer a spermatophore to the female during mating.  Our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and all other published phylogenetic studies support Helminthomorpha monophyly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].  When the presence of ozopores was reconstructed on the BI tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g003">Figure 3</xref>), the use of repugnatory secretions appears to have been present in the ancestor of the Helminthomorpha and was subsequently lost in the Chordeumatida and Siphoniulida, although the latter is of contentious phylogenetic placement. </p>
				<p>	The subterclass Colobognatha comprises four orders: Platydesmida, Polyzoniida, Siphonocryptida, and Siphonophorida.  Colobognathans are recognized as having the following characteristics: 1) simple leg-like gonopods (two pairs) on body rings seven and eight that modify step-wise from walking legs as the animals mature, 2) palps associated with the gnathochilarium absent, and 3) tubular repugnatory glands. Colobognathan gonopods have historically been thought to offer little taxonomic information, even at the species level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].  Our analyses support a Colobognathan clade sister to the remaining Helminthomorpha (=Eugnatha) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g001">Figure 1</xref>) as does Sierwald et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and Enghoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].  However, few other phylogenetic analyses have recovered this grouping and usually ally the Polydesmida with the Colobognatha, thus rendering the Eugnatha paraphyletic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p>
				<p>	The subterclass Eugnatha comprises eight orders and contains the vast majority of millipede species diversity (~11,000 of ~12,000 nominal species).  Eugnathans often have highly modified gonopods that are diagnostic at lower taxonomic levels.  The group is currently split into three superorders: Merocheta, Nematophora, and Juliformia.  The Eugnatha is defined by the following synapomorphies: leg pair eight modified into gonopods, gonopods develop from small bud-like structures, tergites and pleurites fused, and globular defense glands.  The sister relationship between the Colobognatha and a monophyletic Eugnatha is supported by Sierwald et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], Enghoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and in both our BI and ML trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g001">Figure 1</xref>).  Characteristics relating to the development of gonopods between the two groups appear to reinforce their exclusivity.  The gonopods of colobognathans and eugnathans are, however, of questionable homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].  Our ancestral state reconstruction of gonopod developmental origins recovered an ambiguous condition for the ancestor to the Helminthomorpha (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g003">Figure 3</xref>), thus illustrating the difficulty in assigning homology to these structures.</p>
				<p>	The Merocheta contains a single, yet very diverse (&gt;5,000 nominal species), order, Polydesmida.  Polydesmidans are defined as having between 19 and 21 body rings, a projection at the seventh antennomere, fused sternites lacking a suture, no ocelli, first gonopods with cannula, no ozopores on body ring six, two compartments in the repugnatory glands, cyanide in the defense secretions.  Polydesmidan species may have functional spinnerets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].  These species can be quite colorful and often have wing-like paranota extending laterally from the tergites.  The monophyly of the Polydesmida is unequivocal.</p>
				<p>	Three orders, each possessing posterior structures often considered anecdotally to be “silk spinnerets”, make up the Nematophora: Stemmiulida, Chordeumatida, and Callipodida.  Nematophorans are defined as having spinnerets on the telson, branched tracheae associated with the spinnerets, and a molar cusp at the mandible.  The Chordeumatida are the only traditional eugnathan order to lack defense secretions (the Siphoniulida have only recently been placed in the Eugnatha).  The Stemmiulida is currently of controversial placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and has been said to not closely ally with any extant Eugnathan group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>].  As mentioned above, the Stemmiulida were placed in a clade with the Polydesmida and Juliformia in our BI and ML phylogenies.  The trees presented herein recover a monophyletic Coelocheta (Callipodida+Chrodeumatida).  This grouping was described by Hoffman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and is currently defined as follows: unique Tömösváry organ morphology and mentum of gnathochilarium transversely divided.  The monophyly of the Coelocheta, a clade not recognized by Shelley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] or Shear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], has been supported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].  The use of spinnerets to define the Nematophora is difficult given that many other groups produce “silk”, and some even have spinnerets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].  Therefore, the homology of these structures is difficult  to ascertain, and  their presence/absence could have multiple meanings.  Either there have been several independent originations of silk spinning/spinnerets (i.e., convergent evolution or homoplasy), or spinnerets originated once and were subsequently lost in some lineages.  We reconstructed the ancestral conditions for putative millipede spinnerets on the BI phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and found that the ancestor of all eugnthans likely had spinnerets.  These structures were subsequently lost in the Juliformia based on this character transformation and may represent a putative synapomorphy for the group.  </p>
				<p>	The order Siphoniulida has proven difficult to place.  Currently the group is considered a member of the Nematophora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] based on spinneret structures.  The order is extremely rare; males were described for the first time in 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].  Siphoniulidans have fused sternites, no ozopores, no ocelli, and unique characteristics of the gonopods stemming from leg pair eight.  Leg pair nine is unmodified in males and the Tömösváry organ is absent.  The animals have structures identical in form to the spinnerets of stemmiulidans.  Siphoniulidans are not represented in this study, and only two past phylogenetic studies have attempted to place them on the millipede tree of life; Sierwald et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] was the first.  Sierwald and Bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] included the Siphoniulida in their total evidence analysis, but only morphological characters could be scored for this enigmatic order.  The group was recovered as sister to the remaining Helminthomorpha in both analyses.</p>
				<p>	The remaining three orders (Spirobolida, Spirostreptida, and Julida) comprise the Juliformia.  The Juliformia is based on the following synapomorphies: sternites fused to pleurotergites with suture present at interface, collum enlarged covering part of the head, and spermatozoa with pseudoperforatorium.  The spirostreptid superfamily Cambalidea is of contentious placement and has been suggested to belong to the Julida.  Alternatively, some authors have suggested the Cambalidea represents a unique 17<sup>th</sup> order.  The spirostreptid superfamily Epinannolenidea may also represent a unique order.  We included two “Spirostreptida” species in this analysis: <italic>Archispirostreptus gigas</italic> (Spirostreptidea) and <italic>Cambala</italic> sp (Cambalidea).  As a result, we cannot comment on the monophyly of the Juliformia or the Spirostreptida, but these superfamilies appear to have diverged between 200 and 300 MYA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g004">Figure 4</xref>), on the order of other arthropod orders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>].</p>
				<p>	Our results are perhaps most intuitive in regards to the placement of traditionally problematic taxa but differ from the most recent, and most inclusive, analysis of millipede ordinal phylogeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].  The placement of the Stemmiulida and Polydesmida are obvious points of disagreement between our analysis and that published by Sierwald and Bond, which placed the Stemmiulida sister to the Colobognatha+Eugnatha and the Polydesmida sister to the Colobognatha.  This polydesmidan placement was obtained by Brewer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] when using full mitochondrial genomes to investigate millipede ordinal phylogenetics (stemmiulidans were not included in their analysis).  Both Sierwald and Bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and Brewer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] suffer from issues inherent to the data used to reconstruct their phylogenies. The former used the limited dataset, three nuclear protein coding genes, of Regier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and the morphological matrix of Sierwald et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In regards to Brewer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], one of the conclusions of the study was that mitochondrial genomes do not have adequate signal at timescales associated with millipede ordinal divergence.  The placements of the Polydesmida and Stemmiulida, recovered as members of the Eugnatha, lend credence to the often discussed 8<sup>th</sup> gonopod clade (Polydesmida + Stemmiulida + Chordeumatida + Callipodida) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>], though not in the strictest sense.  The BI tree would support the existence of the 8<sup>th</sup> gonopod clade in that the ancestor of the Eugnatha developed gonopods where the eighth leg pair transferred the spermatophore, and the Juliformia has a derived condition where the ninth leg pair is involved in sperm transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079935-g003">Figure 3</xref>).  Again, topology comparisons preferred our results to previous hypotheses that were fully resolved with regards to our included taxa.  </p>

				<title>Molecular divergence dating</title>
				<p>		The millipede fossil record, recently reviewed by Shear and Edgecombe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], is extensive.  The abundance of ancient diplopod fossils can be attributed, in large part, to the thick, calcified cuticle present in many chilognathan groups.  The number of millipede fossils exceeds the numbers for the other myriapod classes by a large margin.  Unfortunately, many of the fossil species are not placed in extant orders (especially the Paleozoic species), thus phylogenetic relationships to extant groups are ambiguous.  Also, the Myriapoda and all of its daughter classes have presumably long “ghost lineages” (i.e., a lack of fossils showing transitional and marine forms that must have existed).  As mentioned above, the oldest currently known land animal is a millipede, <italic>Pneumodesmus newmani</italic> Wilson and Anderson, 2004, living ~428 MYA that represents the derived helminthomorphan clade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].  This coupled with the ambiguous placement of many millipede fossils makes using the diplopod fossil record to calibrate molecular clocks difficult.  If the oldest fossil represents one of the most derived clades, other fossils underestimate the age of the many higher groups <italic>de facto</italic>.  As a result, we used only <italic>Pneumodesmus newmani</italic> and <italic>Sigmatria dilata</italic> as calibration points for our estimates.</p>
				<p>	As expected our divergence time estimations have tighter confidence intervals (CIs) at nodes closer to the calibration point.  Deeper nodes have larger CIs and point estimates that are relatively old compared to recent studies focusing on higher taxonomic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].  Rehm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], recently used the data and phylogeny of Meusemann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] to date the divergence times of major arthropod groups.  The authors report the Chilopoda and Diplopoda split to have occurred 504 MYA using methods similar to those employed here.  Overall, the dates recovered within the Diplopoda in both of our analyses are congruent.  The lognormal method provided tighter CIs and more reasonable results for the deeper nodes.  Regardless of the method, the millipede exemplars in this study represent lineages that originated long ago.  These ancient divergence times are corroborated by the contemporary biogeography of many groups of millipedes.  Recently reviewed by Shelley and Golovatch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], many millipede orders anecdotally show current distributions that likely correspond to Pangaean, Gondwanan, or Laurasian origins.</p>
				<p>	The Cambrian explosion, the observation that most modern animal body forms and phyla originated in a relatively short time period ~550 MYA, has received recent scrutiny.  Possible metazoan trace fossils have been found dating as far back as 565 MYA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>].  Additionally, Erwin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] estimated the divergence dates within the Metazoa and found that animal life may have began diversifying in the Cryogenian over 700 MYA.  These studies indicate that the Cambrian “explosion” may have been slower and began earlier than previously thought.  Although the confidence intervals are relatively large (especially in the UGAM estimations), the ages recovered in our analyses, especially using the UGAM method, show ages of major arthropod lineages could be pre-Cambrian.  Estimates of deep divergence times, especially nearing the root of trees, often have wide confidence intervals, and we are therefore conservative in our conclusions, particularly regarding the UGAM results.</p>

			<title>Conclusions</title>
			<p>	 	Although our analyses lack sufficient sampling to warrant major nomenclatural changes concerning millipede groups above the ordinal level, the relationships we recovered have very strong support (all PP &gt;/= 0.99).  Additionally, this study includes an unprecedented amount of nuclear data for millipedes and more than most other arthropod studies as well.  Moving forward, we will sequence more taxa and continue to expand and improve upon these data.  The HaMSTR approach coupled with phylogenetic dataset selection and optimization, as outlined herein, appears to be very effective at selecting orthologous sequences and choosing amino acid residue characters with good signal at the depths we are investigating.  These results are confidence inspiring and represent a step toward unraveling the relationships between higher-level millipede taxa, an achievement that has thus far proven difficult.  Using this dataset containing many unlinked, protein-coding nuclear genes, some traditional groupings (e.g., the Nematorpha) are not recovered, whereas at least one as of yet unrecognized group is identified.  Character systems once used to delineate major clades above the ordinal level (e.g., spinnerets) are suspect in light of these data, as are the timing of divergence between major groups (i.e., they appear to be more ancient than previously thought).  Millipede high-level relationships have proven to be difficult to confidently reconstruct.  Our data offers a much larger characters set than all other past analyses and presents novel results with high support values but these advantages are obviously countered with a paucity of taxa.  Our results inspire confidence in a phylogenomic approach as we move forward collecting data for many more taxa representing orders not included here and lineages within each order.  </p>
			<p>	These data used here to reconstruct the relationships between millipede taxa will likely also prove to be useful in many other ways.  The relative completeness of transcriptome recovery in <italic>Brachycybe lecontii</italic> (93.95%) and other taxa will allow us to address many questions regarding millipede molecular evolution.   Characterizations of the proteins found in various taxa including tests for selection, alternative splicing, and gene duplications are some of the additional areas we will address.  As we continue to amass genomic-scale data, we will be able to investigate questions central to millipede character evolution, both morphological and molecular.  For example, millipede defense secretions have been suggested to contain phylogenetic signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and may show very interesting patterns of gain and loss in a complex set of characteristics.  Future genomics based studies will continue to address important questions concerning millipede life history, physiology, and behavior, and a more taxonomically diverse phylogeny will be integral to studying the evolution of one of the planet’s oldest and most diverse land animal lineages.</p>
