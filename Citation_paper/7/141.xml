        <p>Uveal melanomas possess activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. MAPK activation occurs via somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein subunits <italic>GNAQ</italic> and <italic>GNA11</italic> for over 70% of tumors and less frequently via V600E <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations. In this report, we describe the impact of dual pathway inhibition upon uveal melanoma cell lines with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055. While synergistic reductions in cell viability were observed with AZD8055/selumetinib in both <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutant cell lines, apoptosis was preferentially induced in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cells only. <italic>In vitro</italic> apoptosis assay results were predictive of <italic>in vivo</italic> drug efficacy as tumor regressions were observed only in a <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant xenograft model, but not <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutant model. We went on to discover that <italic>GNAQ</italic> promotes relative resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis in <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutant cells. For <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cells, both AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were modulated by the combination; however, decreasing AKT phosphorylation alone was not sufficient and decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not required for apoptosis. Instead, cooperative mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and MEK inhibition resulting in downregulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 was found to be critical for combination-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combined MEK and mTOR kinase inhibition will be determined by tumor genotype, and that <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant malignancies will be particularly susceptible to this strategy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Uveal melanoma is a primary intraocular malignancy that arises from melanocytes within the uveal tract, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Over 50% of these patients develop incurable, metastatic disease for which there are no effective therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Patel1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>52% to 86% of uveal melanomas possess activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Weber1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Zuidervaart1">[3]</xref>. In contrast to cutaneous melanomas, the relevance of <italic>BRAF</italic> (T1799A→V600E) mutations for MAPK activation in uveal melanoma is less clear. Though initial studies of uveal melanoma tumor samples reported that <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations are rare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Weber1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Rimoldi1">[6]</xref>, several groups have detected the mutation in a disproportionate number of uveal melanoma cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Zuidervaart1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Calipel1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Maat1">[10]</xref>. Two studies utilizing more sensitive genetic approaches have reported higher rates of <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation and confirmed that the mutation can be limited to select areas within a tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Maat1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Janssen1">[11]</xref>. The possibility that techniques to establish cell lines may preferentially select for <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant tumors also can not be excluded.</p>
      <p>For over 40% of uveal melanomas, MAPK activation is driven by mutation of <italic>GNAQ</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-VanRaamsdonk1">[12]</xref>, a gene that encodes for the alpha subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein complex (αβγ) that mediates signaling between G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and downstream effectors. Mutation of codon 209 in the <italic>ras</italic>-like domain blocks intrinsic GTPase activity, keeping Gα in a GTP-bound, constitutively active state. Recently, a mutation at Q209 in the <italic>GNAQ</italic> paralogue gene <italic>GNA11</italic> that also activates MAPK signaling was discovered in over 30% of uveal melanomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-VanRaamsdonk2">[13]</xref>. Notably, recent clinical data has demonstrated modest preliminary signals of efficacy in uveal melanoma patients treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Dummer1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been hypothesized that activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway cooperates with MAPK activation to generate and maintain the malignant phenotype in uveal melanomas. High rates of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the <italic>phosphatase and tensin homolog</italic> (<italic>PTEN</italic>) (a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway) locus and mutations within the <italic>PTEN</italic> coding region translates to more than half of uveal melanomas having decreased or complete loss of PTEN expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-AbdelRahman1">[15]</xref>. Pathway stimulation can also occur via activation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including c-kit, insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R), and c-met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Patel1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>For inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling, effort has been put into targeting mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin), which is a serine/threonine kinase activated by the pathway. The drugs rapamycin and its analogues inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which includes mTOR and other regulatory proteins such as regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor). However, clinical activity with rapamycin and its analogues has been modest to date, and several molecular mechanisms potentially limiting clinical efficacy have been proposed, including: 1) incomplete mTORC1 inhibition, 2) activation of AKT by release of negative feedback pathways regulated by mTORC1 substrates and 3) minimal inhibition of a second rapamycin-resistant complex called mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which contains a protein called “rapamycin-insensitive component of mTOR” (Rictor) instead of Raptor. mTORC2 is the protein dependent kinase 2 (PDK2) responsible for phosphorylating AKT at serine 473 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Sarbassov1">[16]</xref>, which in cooperation with threonine 308 phosphorylation results in full AKT activation. These limitations with mTORC1 inhibitors led to the development of ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR which effectively inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Chresta1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Thoreen1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we explored combined MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibition with an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, AZD8055, and the allosteric MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, in uveal melanoma cell lines of various genotypic backgrounds. AZD8055 potently inhibits the mTOR kinase <italic>in vitro</italic> (IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.8+/−0.2 nM), while exhibiting &gt;1000 fold selectivity against closely related kinases such as PI3K, ATM, and DNA-PK, and no activity against a panel of 260 other kinases at a concentration of 10 µM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Chresta1">[17]</xref>. Selumetinib is a highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/2 that potently inhibits MEK1 <italic>in vitro</italic> with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 14.1+/−0.79 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Yeh1">[20]</xref>. Utilizing these small molecule inhibitors, we found that the antitumor effectiveness of combined mTOR and MEK inhibition is dependent upon tumor genotype.</p>

        <title>The AZD8055/selumetinib Combination Synergistically Inhibits BRAF and GNAQ Mutant Tumor Cell Viability</title>
        <p>We investigated the impact of dual pathway inhibition with the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib and the mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 upon uveal melanoma cell lines of distinct tumor genotypes. This panel included two cell lines which lack activating mutations in <italic>BRAF</italic>, <italic>GNAQ</italic>, <italic>GNA11</italic>, and <italic>RAS</italic> (Mel290 and C918, referred to as “wild type” or “WT”), two cell lines which possess the V600E <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation (OCM3 and OCM1A, referred to as “BRAF”), and two cell lines which possess activating <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutations at Q209 (92.1 (Q209L) and Mel270 (Q209P), referred to as “GNAQ”); these cell lines were otherwise negative for common mutations in several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, and <italic>AKT1</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s010">Table S1</xref></bold>).

        <p>The viability of cells treated with various concentrations of AZD8055 (0 to 1000 nM) and selumetinib (0 to 5000 nM) alone and in different combinations were evaluated (50% growth inhibitory values (GI50s) for each compound alone are depicted in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). In both GNAQ and BRAF cells, the AZD8055/selumetinib combination at different dose combinations consistently reduced cell viability by more than 50% (“fractional activity” (Fa) &gt;0.5) in a synergistic manner (combination index (CI) values &lt;1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). The interaction between the two drugs was not effective in WT cells as observed CI values ranged from slightly less than 1 to greater than 1 with lower Fa values than those observed in BRAF and GNAQ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>).</p>

        <p>To investigate how AZD8055/selumetinib preferentially elicits apoptosis in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cells, we assessed the impact of the combination upon the phosphorylation status of mTOR and MEK substrates. In WT cells, AZD8055 inhibited phosphorylation of both the mTORC1 substrate S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) and the mTORC2 substrate AKT (at serine 473; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref><bold>, lane 2 of Blots #1 and 2</bold>); selumetinib, however, failed to inhibit ERK phosphorylation in a sustained manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref><bold>, lane 3 of Blot #3</bold>) due to rebound ERK phosphorylation (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s002">Figure S2D</xref></bold> and the accompanying figure legend for the selumetinib time course experiment demonstrating this phenomenon).

        <p>In BRAF and GNAQ cells, AZD8055 potently suppressed S6K1 phosphorylation, but failed to completely inhibit AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref><bold>, lane 2 of Blots #1 and #2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s002">Figure S2A</xref></bold>). This was <italic>not</italic> due to ineffective mTORC2 inhibition, but instead rebound AKT phosphorylation: while 100 nM AZD8055 inhibited AKT phosphorylation after 2 hours in all three tumor genotypes, by 24 hours AKT phosphorylation rebounded only in BRAF and GNAQ cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s002">Figure S2C</xref></bold>). Interestingly, the addition of selumetinib to AZD8055 substantially decreased AKT phosphorylation in BRAF cells, but not significantly in GNAQ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref><bold>, lane 4 of Blot #1</bold>).</p>
        <p>Given evidence in other systems that the release of negative feedback pathways resulting in AKT phosphorylation represents a critical mechanism of intrinsic resistance to mTORC1 inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-OReilly1">[21]</xref>, we investigated the mechanism by which AKT is modulated by AZD8055/selumetinib. Utilizing an RTK array assay, we found that mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition with AZD8055 in the <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cell line OCM1A increased phosphorylation of the insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). The addition of selumetinib to AZD8055 decreased the IGF-1R phosphorylation signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>).</p>
        <p>These results suggest that inhibition of IGF-1R activity may be one mechanism downstream of MEK/ERK inhibition by which selumetinib inhibits AZD8055-induced, rebound AKT phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the small molecule inhibitor NVP-AEW541 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-GarciaEcheverria1">[22]</xref> to directly inhibit IGF-1R in OCM1A cells.

In combination with AZD8055, NVP-AEW541 suppressed AKT re-phosphorylation without impacting ERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref><bold>, lane 6</bold>), consistent with the model that IGF-1R activation regulates AKT downstream of MEK/ERK activity in these cells. However, despite modulating AKT phosphorylation, the addition of NVP-AEW541 to AZD8055 was <italic>insufficient</italic> to induce apoptosis as assayed by PARP cleavage and quantifying sub-G1 cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref><bold>, lane 6</bold> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref><bold>,</bold> respectively). Hence, while selumetinib suppresses AZD8055-mediated activation of the IGF-1R/AKT axis, modulation of these targets alone is not sufficient for the apoptosis induced by the AZZD8055/selumetinib combination, implying that other target(s) downstream of selumetinib-mediated ERK inhibition is (are) critical for the induction of apoptosis.</p>

        <title>AZD8055/selumetinib Inhibition of 4E-BP1 Phosphorylation in BRAF Mutant Cells also does not Contribute to Apoptosis</title>
        <p>4E-BP1 (eIF4E binding protein-1) has recently been implicated as the key protein target cooperatively modulated by an AKT and MEK inhibitor combination to induce apoptosis in tumors harboring both <italic>RAS</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-She1">[23]</xref>. Therefore, we investigated the potential role of 4E-BP1 in AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis for <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant uveal melanomas.</p>
        <p>4E-BP1 is an mTORC1 substrate that negatively regulates translation by binding and blocking the function of eIF4E, an initiation factor that binds to the 5′ mRNA cap structure to promote mRNA translation. mTORC1 activity leads to 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at several sites (T37/T46, S65 and T70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Gingras1">[24]</xref>), which results in 4E-BP1 dissociation from eIF4E and activation of cap-dependent translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Ruggero1">[25]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Phosphorylation at all the 4E-BP1 sites assayed was inhibited with AZD8055 alone in WT cells. In the <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutant cell line 92.1 and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cell line OCM1A, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at T37/46 was only modestly suppressed by AZD8055; phosphorylation at S65 and T70 was more effectively inhibited by AZD8055 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>). The addition of selumetinib further suppressed 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at T37/46 in only BRAF cells, not GNAQ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>). However, an mRNA cap binding assay demonstrated that this further reduction in T37/46 phosphorylation did not increase the capacity for 4E-BP1 to associate with m<sup>7</sup> GTP Sepharose beads (which mimics the 5′ cap of untranslated mRNAs) in the BRAF cells, suggesting no significant change upon 4E-BP1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>). Furthermore, pooled siRNA construct-mediated downregulation of 4E-BP1 (which reportedly protected tumors cells from apoptosis induced by combined AKT and MEK inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-She1">[23]</xref>) failed to reduce PARP cleavage induced by the combination, confirming that 4E-BP1 is not an essential regulator of apoptosis in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref><bold>, lane 4 versus lane 8</bold>).</p>

            <p><italic>A,</italic> the AZD8055/selumetinib combination cooperatively suppressed MCL-1 and induced BIM in the <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant OCM1A cell line. Cells were treated with the indicated drugs (vehicle denoted by “-”) for 24 hours and Western blots were then performed.

Cells were transfected with pooled siRNA constructs targeting MCL-1 or unrelated control constructs for 48 hours and then treated with 1000 nM selumetinib for 24 hours. Western blots were then performed. Ku-70 was used as a loading control. <italic>C,</italic> MCL-1 overexpression in the OCM1A cell line reduced AZD8055/selumetinib induced apoptosis.

Western blot was performed to confirm overexpression of MCL-1. Cells were then treated with the indicated drugs for 24 hours. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for DNA content; sub-G1 populations were quantified. <italic>D</italic> bi-parametric flow cytometry demonstrated that apoptosis was preferentially induced by AZD8055/selumetinib in low MCL-1 expressing cell populations.

        <p>To explore if MCL-1 downregulation in BRAF cells is sufficient to induce apoptosis in combination with selumetinib, MCL-1 levels in OCM1A cells were reduced with pooled siRNA constructs. Transfection of MCL-1 targeting siRNAs reduced MCL-1 expression (relative to an unrelated control siRNA) to a level comparable to that observed with AZD8055 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g007"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref>). While selumetinib in combination with the control siRNA downregulated MCL-1 and increased BIM levels, it was only with further MCL-1 suppression achieved with the targeting siRNAs that the addition of selumetinib induced apoptosis as detected by increased PARP cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g007"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref>).</p>
        <p>We next transfected into OCM1A cells a plasmid driving MCL-1 expression under the control of a constitutively active viral promoter in order to determine if MCL-1 downregulation is necessary for AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g007"><bold>Figure 7C</bold></xref>). Overexpression of MCL-1 rescued cells from apoptosis induced by the combination, decreasing the apoptosis fraction of OCM1A cells from 15.5% in vector-transfected cells to 10.9% in MCL-1-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g007"><bold>Figure 7C</bold></xref>). We also analyzed MCL-1 transfected cells by bi-parametric flow cytometry for both DNA content and MCL-1 levels to separate out low- and high-expressing MCL-1 cells and then compare the differences in sub-G1 percentage between these two subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g007"><bold>Figure 7D</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>). This analysis revealed that apoptosis was induced with the combination only in the subset of cells expressing lower levels of MCL-1, while the drug combination failed to induce more apoptosis than that observed with selumetinib alone in the high MCL-1 expressers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g007"><bold>Figure 7D</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>). In the xenograft model of the <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cell line OCM1A, Western analysis of frozen tumor tissue revealed that cooperative MCL-1 downregulation and increased BIM levels were also achieved <italic>in vivo</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s006">Figure S6</xref></bold>). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that MCL-1 downregulation is both necessary and sufficient to induce apoptosis with selumetinib, and strongly argues that MCL-1 is a singular target that is cooperatively modulated by the combination to induce apoptosis in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant uveal melanoma.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Concomitant activation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways in tumor cells confers relative resistance to drugs targeting either pathway in isolation. AKT activation in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cutaneous melanomas mediates resistance to MEK inhibition with selumetinib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Gopal1">[31]</xref>. <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>RAS</italic> mutations mediate resistance to AKT targeted agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-She1">[23]</xref>. Alternatively, drug combinations that inhibit both pathways may be more clinically effective for tumors with evidence of dual pathway activation, including those with RTK mutation/activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Faber1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-She2">[32]</xref>, other genetic alterations of the pathway (<italic>RAS, PIK3CA, BRAF</italic> mutations and/or <italic>PTEN</italic> loss) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-She1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Meng1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Engelman1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Xing1">[37]</xref>, or simply expression of phosphorylated AKT or ERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Gopal1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Yu1">[38]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we found that uveal cancer cell fate in response to combined MEK and mTOR inhibition was closely correlated to tumor genotype. AZD8055/selumetinib did not confer cooperative antitumor effects in WT cells, possibly related to incomplete suppression of MAPK activity with selumetinib. Alternatively, the combination did synergistically suppress the viability of both <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutant cells; however, apoptosis was only induced in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cells. Ultimately, <italic>in vitro</italic> measurement of apoptosis correlated better than cell viability to <italic>in vivo</italic> effectiveness as tumor regressions were observed only in the <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant xenograft model. These distinct drug induced fates may in fact reflect biologic differences in how <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutations activate MAPK signaling: while the former directly activates MEK→ERK activity, the latter does so via protein kinase C (PKC) activation which can mediate cell survival signals via several pathways parallel to MAPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Patel1">[1]</xref>. The observation that suppression of GNAQ expression in <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutant cells predisposes to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis argues that GNAQ activity in these cells activates MEK- and mTOR- independent pro-survival signals.</p>
      <p>Further elucidation of the differences in drug-induced outcomes for <italic>GNAQ</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant uveal melanomas revealed that AKT, 4E-BP1, and MCL-1 were cooperatively regulated by the AZD8055/selumetinib combination only in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cells and not <italic>GNAQ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g008"><bold>Figure 8A</bold></xref>), suggesting these as candidate targets responsible for the distinct apoptotic outcomes observed. In fact, activation of RTKs (including IGF-1R), AKT, and 4E-BP1 have each been implicated as critical mechanisms of resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-She1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Gopal1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Atefi1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Villanueva1">[41]</xref>. Establishing apoptosis as an important cellular outcome that correlates to <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumor effects in our model allowed us to critically evaluate whether the biochemical modulation of any of these molecules are truly critical for the anti-tumor effects elicited with dual pathway inhibition. Our data revealed that while 4E-BP1 is cooperatively regulated by AZD8055/selumetinib, this is not critical for the induction of apoptosis in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant uveal melanoma cells. Selumetinib suppression of AZD8055-mediated activation of the IGF-1R/AKT axis alone is also not sufficient to induce apoptosis in these cells. Instead, AZD8055 suppression of mTORC2 cooperates with selumetinib to reduce MCL-1 protein expression, a change that in combination with selumetinib-mediated induction of BIM, is essential for combination-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g008"><bold>Figure 8B</bold></xref>). In the context of recent data arguing that the superior <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors over rapamycin are related primarily to more effective mTORC1 targeting rather than mTORC2 inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Chresta1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Thoreen1">[19]</xref>, the findings presented here also argue that mTORC2 may still be a relevant therapeutic target.</p>

          <p><italic>A,</italic> This study revealed that AZD8055 and selumetinib impacted the regulation of several signaling proteins differently in <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutant versus <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cells. The proteins AKT, 4E-BP1, and MCL-1 were cooperatively regulated by the AZD8055/selumetinib combination in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cells, while none of the candidate targets examined were found to be cooperatively regulated in <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutant cells. <italic>B,</italic> Diagram of the signaling pathways impacted by selumetinib and AZD8055 to induce apoptosis in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cells. Our data suggests that BIM upregulation and MCL-1 downregulation are necessary for apoptosis achieved with dual pathway inhibition. While BIM was induced by selumetinib, MCL-1 was decreased by combined mTORC2 inhibition and MEK inhibition by AZD8055 and selumetinib, respectively, possibly through cooperative AKT inhibition. The dotted arrows indicate that drug mediated inhibition of MEK and mTORC2 likely influence BIM and MCL-1 through molecular intermediates.</p>

      <p>In <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant lung cancer cells, inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and MEK were directly linked to MCL-1 downregulation and BIM upregulation, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Faber1">[27]</xref>. In this study, MCL-1 downregulation correlated with cooperative inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in BRAF cells, suggesting that concomitant MEK and AKT inhibition may be essential for altering both BIM and MCL-1 levels to induce apoptosis in these cells as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040439-g008"><bold>Figure 8B</bold></xref>). We also observed that dual MEK and AKT inhibition can be achieved by combining selumetinib with the IGF-1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541, and also resulted in decreased MCL-1, increased BIM, and induction of apoptosis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s007">Figure S7</xref></bold>). Hence, different targeted approaches may achieve the dual pathway inhibition that can impact BIM/MCL-1 levels and induce apoptosis in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cells.</p>
      <p>What remains unknown is how differences in uveal melanoma PTEN status may influence drug susceptibility independent of <italic>GNAQ</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status. We did observe that <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cell lines had overall less <italic>PTEN</italic> protein expression compared to WT or GNAQ cells, though this did not result in baseline differences of AKT or S6K1 phosphorylation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s008">Figure S8A</xref></bold>). Since <italic>PTEN</italic> null uveal melanoma cell lines are not currently available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Naus1">[42]</xref>, the contribution of <italic>PTEN</italic> status to drug susceptibility can not be fully addressed. We did investigate how siRNA-mediated depletion of <italic>PTEN</italic> expression in the GNAQ cell line 92.1 impacted drug-induced apoptosis and found this did not change the drug effects upon the relevant signaling pathways or MCL-1 levels (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s008">Figure S8B</xref></bold>). Though there was also no statistically significant increase in apoptosis with PTEN siRNA compared to control siRNA transfected cells, we did observe a very small trend towards higher apoptosis with the selumetinib/AZD8055 combination in cells with suppressed PTEN expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s008">Figure S8B</xref></bold>). We concluded that while PTEN status may modestly influence the induction of apoptosis, it does so in a manner distinct from the MCL-1 dependent mechanism we have delineated for <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cells, though further study regarding the contribution of PTEN status apart from <italic>BRAF or GNAQ</italic> mutations is warranted.</p>
      <p>One question stemming from this study is how applicable the efficacy of combined mTOR and MEK inhibition may be for other <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant malignancies. We have evaluated the AZD8055/selumetinib combination in cutaneous melanomas and have found that the combination preferentially induced apoptosis in most <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cell lines (3 out of 4 lines tested), but not <italic>N-RAS</italic> mutant cells or cells lacking these mutations (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s009">Figure S9</xref></bold>), supporting observations from Gopal et. al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040439-Gopal1">[31]</xref>. For <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutant cells, further study is warranted to develop more effective <italic>GNAQ</italic> targeting strategies in order to achieve better therapeutic efficacy.</p>

This implies that a PDK2 other than mTORC2 may be re-activated after prolonged AZD8055 exposure. Interestingly, higher concentrations of AZD8055 inhibited AKT phosphorylation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s002">Figure S2A</xref></bold>), which we concluded represented off-target activity given 1) effective mTORC2 inhibition in all the cell lines at 2 hours with 100 nM AZD8055, and 2) discordance between inhibition of AKT and S6K1 phosphorylation in BRAF cells (a discrepancy not observed in WT cells), confirming that mTOR inhibition occurs at concentrations as low as 20 nM in BRAF cells. While rebound AKT phosphorylation was accompanied by rebound S6K1 phosphorylation in the <italic>GNAQ</italic> mutant cell line, this was not observed in the <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant cell line, suggesting different mechanism of rebound phosphorylation may exist. For selumetinib, 1000 nM was the lowest concentration that inhibited phosphorylation of the MEK substrates ERK1/2 at 2 hours, but rebound ERK phosphorylation occurred preferentially in WT cells after 24 hours (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040439.s002">Figure S2D</xref></bold>).</p>
