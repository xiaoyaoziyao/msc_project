          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Two recent studies demonstrated that bariatric surgery induced remission of type 2 diabetes very soon after surgery and far too early to be attributed to weight loss. In this study, we sought to explore the mechanism/s of this phenomenon by testing the effects of proteins from the duodenum-jejunum conditioned-medium (CM) of <italic>db/db</italic> or Swiss mice on glucose uptake <italic>in vivo</italic> in Swiss mice and <italic>in vitro</italic> in both Swiss mice soleus and L6 cells. We studied the effect of sera and CM proteins from insulin resistant (IR) and insulin-sensitive subjects on insulin signaling in human myoblasts.</p>

          <p><italic>db/db</italic> proteins induced massive IR either <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>, while Swiss proteins did not. In L6 cells, only <italic>db/db</italic> proteins produced a noticeable increase in basal <sup>473</sup>Ser-Akt phosphorylation, lack of GSK3β inhibition and a reduced basal <sup>389</sup>Thr-p70-S6K1 phosphorylation. Human IR serum markedly increased basal <sup>473</sup>Ser-Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Human CM IR proteins increased by about twofold both basal and insulin-stimulated <sup>473</sup>Ser-Akt. Basal <sup>9</sup>Ser-GSK3β phosphorylation was increased by IR subjects serum with a smaller potentiating effect of insulin.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disorder usually associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia leading to impaired glucose tolerance or frank diabetes as pancreatic insulin response declines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-DeFronzo1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Typically, obesity promotes insulin resistance with a compensatory increase in insulin production via increased β-cell mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Kasuga1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Prentki1">[3]</xref>. In obese T2D subjects, a prompt diabetes remission is observed after bariatric surgery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Guidone1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Mingrone1">[5]</xref> and insulin sensitivity is restored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Guidone1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Mari1">[6]</xref> along with the normalization of the first phase of insulin secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Salinari1">[7]</xref>. Bariatric operations reroute food through the upper small intestine, possibly reducing the production of putative factor/s inducing insulin resistance and whose secretion is stimulated by nutrients. The mechanisms of T2D remission have been investigated in experimental animals. These suggest a pivotal role of the small intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Rubino1">[8]</xref>. The bypass of duodenum and jejunum in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, an animal model of non- obese T2D, was shown to control diabetes directly and not as a secondary effect of weight loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Rubino2">[9]</xref>. That food intake reduction is not implicated in the amelioration of glucose disposal was then demonstrated by the observation that GK rats which had undergone duodenal-jejunal bypass had a markedly better oral glucose tolerance compared to pair-fed sham-operated rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Rubino2">[9]</xref>. Duodenal-jejunal bypass surgery in rats normalized glucose disposal in streptozotocin-induced diabetes as well as in insulin deficient autoimmune type 1 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Breen1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Obese, diabetic C57BL/Ks <italic>db/db</italic> mice are an extensively studied genetic model of obesity and type 2 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Hummel1">[11]</xref>. These animals show characteristics similar to human T2D including obesity and severe insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Kodama1">[12]</xref>. Brozinick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Brozinick1">[13]</xref> have reported that despite the marked <italic>in vivo</italic> insulin resistance observed for the normal-glucose tolerant <italic>db/db</italic> mice during hyperinsulinemic clamps, their muscles are completely insulin responsive <italic>in vitro</italic>. On the basis of these findings, they suggested the presence of a humoral factor impairing the insulin action <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Brozinick1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To test the hypothesis that the small intestine of <italic>db/db</italic> mice produces factors/hormones inducing insulin resistance, proteins enriched from the conditioned medium (CM) of <italic>db/db</italic> and Swiss duodenum-jejunum or of insulin resistant and insulin sensitive subjects were obtained. Their molecular cutoff was chosen in a range between 10 and 100 kDa, on the basis of a series of previous experiments. The biological activity of mouse CM proteins was assessed both <italic>in vivo</italic> in Swiss mice which underwent an intra-peritoneal insulin tolerance test, and <italic>in vitro</italic> in Swiss skeletal muscle tissue as well as in L6 cell cultures to measure insulin-mediated glucose uptake and insulin signaling. Furthermore, the effect on insulin signaling of serum or CM proteins from jejunum specimens obtained during abdominal surgery in insulin resistant and insulin sensitive human subjects was studied in human myotubes.</p>

          <p>In order to enhance the secretion of intestinal factor/s inducing insulin resistance, fed mice were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection with pentobarbital (12 mg/mouse, ip, Nembutal, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Everted duodenum-jejunum sacs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Russell1">[14]</xref> were washed with saline and incubated in oxygenated (O<sub>2</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub>, 95∶5, v/v) Krebs-Henseleit solution (37°C, pH 7.4) for 1 h to isolate proteins secreted into the medium.

          <p>The effect on insulin sensitivity of saline (control) and CM proteins from <italic>db/db</italic> or Swiss mice injected in Swiss mice was evaluated by the intraperitoneal insulin test (IPITT) and minimal model analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056258-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, A and B). Amounts of proteins injected were 15 or 150 µg, which corresponded to circulating levels of 2.1 or, respectively, 21 µg/ml assuming that the distribution volume of these proteins equals that of glucose (7.1 ml, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Pacini1">[16]</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Two recent studies demonstrated that bariatric surgery induced remission of T2D and significant improvement in metabolic control of the diabetes over and above medical therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Mingrone1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Schauer1">[25]</xref>. The improvement in glycemia occurs very soon after the surgery and far too early to be attributed to weight loss. In this study, we sought to explore the mechanism/s of this phenomenon. Jejunal conditioned medium proteins from both diabetic, insulin resistant animals and insulin resistant humans impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle cell cultures. A similar effect was obtained with the human serum from insulin resistant subjects, suggesting that circulating (and thus by definition endocrine) factors are inducing insulin resistance.</p>
      <p>An <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> state of insulin resistance was reproduced in the presence of proteins secreted by the duodenal-jejunal mucosa of <italic>db/db</italic> mice. Contrary to the conditioned medium proteins from Swiss mice, those secreted by the <italic>db/db</italic> mice small intestine induced insulin resistance when injected in normal Swiss mice or when added to the incubation medium of skeletal muscle preparations <italic>in vitro</italic>. Also the experiments with the L6 cells were congruent, as shown by ∼65% and ∼30% reduction of insulin-dependent (<italic>ΔR</italic>/<italic>K</italic><sub>0.5</sub>) and insulin-independent (<italic>R<sub>b</sub></italic>) glucose uptake in the presence of <italic>db/db</italic> proteins, respectively. Notably, Swiss mice proteins failed to decrease glucose uptake either <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
      <p>Our study demonstrates that the molecular mechanism through which proteins secreted by the duodenal-jejunal mucosa of <italic>db/db</italic> mice induce insulin resistance could be mediated by interference with intracellular signaling pathways. We found that <italic>db/db</italic> proteins robustly induced the phosphorylation of the Akt <sup>473</sup>serine residue at zero insulin, leading to a prompt saturation of the insulin dose-response curve. Moreover, <italic>db/db</italic> CM proteins tended to reduce the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt on <sup>308</sup>Thr residue. Thus, 100 nM insulin treated L6 cells in the presence of <italic>db/db</italic> CM exhibited maximal Akt phosphorylation at <sup>473</sup>Ser residue but about 50% phosphorylation at <sup>308</sup>Thr residue, so full Akt activation could not be attained, consistent with the observed reduction of 2DG uptake in the soleus muscle and L6 cells. CM <italic>db/db</italic> also determined a marked proteolysis of GSK3β phosphorylated form and inhibited the basal activation of the p70 S6kinase.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, when compared with insulin sensitive individuals, both serum and intestinal CM proteins from insulin resistant subjects determined a higher basal <sup>473</sup>Ser Akt and <sup>9</sup>Ser GSK3β phosphorylation in human myotubes. A tendency toward an increased basal phosphorylation of <sup>9</sup>Ser GSK3β was also observed in the presence of CM from insulin sensitive subjects. Furthermore, the incremental <sup>9</sup>Ser GSK3β phosphorylation over basal in the presence of insulin was reduced in IR subjects. Overall, these data suggest that serum and conditioned medium contain factor/s, which are likely in a larger amount in the insulin resistant than in insulin sensitive subjects, that induce insulin resistance. We observe that we could not compare insulin resistant with healthy control subjects because it is near impossible to obtain sufficient duodenal/jejunal mucosa during endoscopy to provide sufficient intestinal secreted proteins for testing in human myoblasts. Our controls were in an inactive phase of their disease with stenosis of the ileum which required elective surgery. We cannot exclude a certain degree of general inflammation, and thus they could not be considered as healthy subjects. However these patients were still insulin sensitive according to a previous observation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Capristo1">[26]</xref> and as assessed by the euglycemic clamp.</p>
      <p>The Akt phosphorylation of <sup>473</sup>Ser residue is a target of the mTOR complex 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Sarbassov1">[27]</xref>, while the Akt phosphorylation at <sup>308</sup>Thr is operated by PDK1, this last step being essential for the full Akt catalytic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Alessi1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Stephens1">[29]</xref>. Fraenkel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Fraenkel1">[30]</xref> showed that, in the fasting state, basal <sup>473</sup>Ser Akt phosphorylation was higher in the skeletal muscle of diabetic than in normoglycemic <italic>Psammomys obesus</italic> (<italic>P. obesus</italic>), while there was a net reduction of the stimulation by insulin in agreement with the high insulin resistance state of these diabetic animals. Furthermore, it was found that Akt directly mediates Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), resulting in a negative feedback loop that reduces insulin action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Li1">[31]</xref>. Interestingly, this effect was inhibited by Rapamycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Li1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Akt phosphorylates <sup>9</sup>Ser in GSK3β with subsequent inhibition of the enzymatic function of GSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Frame1">[32]</xref>. It was recently demonstrated that GSK activity can also be regulated by calpain-induced proteolysis of its N terminus, which gives way to a short-lived constitutively active form of the enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-GoiOliver1">[33]</xref>. Our data suggest that similar mechanisms could occur in the presence of small intestine <italic>db/db</italic> CM. If the products of GSK3β degradation induced by <italic>db/db</italic> CM proteins are active, they might contribute to enhance the recognition of GSK substrates. In addition to the well-known effect on glycogen synthase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Cross1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-McManus1">[35]</xref>, GSK3 has been implicated in the phosphorylation of the IRS-1 on serine residues with a consequent impairment of insulin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-EldarFinkelman1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Liberman1">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, GSK3 overexpression was found in peripheral tissues in a variety of diabetic animals and also in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Wang1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Ciaraldi1">[42]</xref>. It has also been shown that Rapamycin markedly decreased GSK3 phosphorylation in muscle of normoglycemic and diabetic <italic>P. obesus</italic>, indicating increased GSK3β activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Fraenkel1">[30]</xref>, while diabetes was reversed in obese diabetic mice treated with GSK3 inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Ring1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Mora1">[44]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) exists in two forms, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 regulates protein synthesis by S6K1 and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 at ribosomal level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Hay1">[45]</xref>, while mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at <sup>473</sup>Ser. Rapamycin is an mTORC1 inhibitor, which acts specifically on S6K1, whereas the ATP-competitive inhibitor PP242 completely blocks both mTORCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Feldman1">[46]</xref>. We found that the effect of <italic>db/db</italic> CM proteins on Akt <sup>473</sup>Ser phosphorylation was fully prevented by PP242, but not by Rapamycin, indicating a preferential role of mTORC2 in the response to CM proteins in L6 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of p70S6K1 phosphorylation suggested a negative modulation of mTORC1 inhibitors.</p>
      <p>Taken together, these results support a possible mechanism of action of the <italic>db/db</italic> or IR subjects CM on insulin signaling and action in skeletal muscle cells by which proteins produced by small intestine could act via activation of mTORC2 while inhibiting mTORC1. Activation of mTORC2 may be regulated by activation of TSC1/TSC2 complex, which directly binds to mTORC2 while inhibiting Rheb and thus mTORC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Huang1">[47]</xref>. So, the increased <sup>473</sup>Ser Akt phosphorylation is accompanied by decrease in basal (no insulin) p70 S6K1 <sup>389</sup>Thr phosphorylation. Accordingly, Rapamycin and PP242 inhibit p70 S6K1 <sup>389</sup>Thr phosphorylation (as also observed in the absence of <italic>db/db</italic> CM). This is accompanied by the lack of inhibition of GSK3 due to the proteolysis of its phosphorylated form, and may in turn lead to the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on serine/threonine residues that determines inhibition of insulin signaling by reducing IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation with consequent insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Huang2">[48]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056258-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

          <title>Interaction between IRS1−PI3K−Akt signaling pathway and mTOR.</title>
          <p>Upon insulin binding insulin receptor activates, through insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), which results in Akt phosphorylation at <sup>308</sup>Thr residue via Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate (PIP3) conversion followed by Akt and PDK1 recruitment to plasma membrane (not shown). A factor J present in duodenal-jejunal conditioned medium activates, possibly via the tuberous sclerosis complex TSC1-TSC2, the mammlian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC2 also appears to be regulated by the PI3K pathway and phosphorylates Akt at <sup>473</sup>Ser residue. Through TSC1-TSC2 and the GTPase Rheb, Akt activates mTORC1 and its direct substrate S6K1. Akt also inhibits GSK3. S6K1, mTORC1 and GSK3 phosphorylate serine residues on IRS1, thus attenuating insulin signalling. Hypothetical signalling is denoted by dotted lines.</p>

      <p>Our finding that <italic>db/db</italic> CM promotes Akt <sup>473</sup>Ser phosphorylation in L6 cells, likely via mTORC2 or TSC activation and Akt recruitment to plasma membrane, may provide a new insight on the upstream regulation of mTORC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Cybulski1">[49]</xref>. Finally, the reversibility of CM proteins action after washout suggests that these proteins may act through the activation of a membrane receptor. We conclude that, although some difference in the effect of mice and human CM proteins on the insulin signaling does exist, the mechanism of action, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056258-g006">Figure 6</xref>, likely involves the mTOR pathway.</p>
      <p>The strength of the present study is the demonstration that the small intestine of insulin resistant humans and mice secrete a protein factor/s inducing insulin resistance by impairing the insulin signaling.</p>
      <p>The limitations of our investigation are that insulin sensitivity in mice was assessed by the IPITT instead of a more sophisticated euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and that the insulin signaling pathway was studied in two different cellular lines, the L6 cells to test the proteins secreted by the mice intestine and human myoblasts to test the proteins secreted by the human intestine. Concerning the first point we note that the steady state conditions of plasma concentration, required by the clamp, could not be assured for the jejunal proteins, whose kinetics is not known. Moreover, the minimal model analysis also provides the estimate of the glucose effectiveness that has been found decreased after the <italic>in vivo</italic> injection of <italic>db/db</italic> proteins.</p>
      <p>As for the second point, it is well accepted that insulin action is comparable in L6 cells and primary muscle cells. Because the use of human primary muscle cells requires biopsies and time-consuming expansion and differentiation, we restricted the use of these cells to the study of the human secreted proteins. Actually, we found similar results by using the secreted proteins from <italic>db/db</italic> mice and insulin resistant humans, although the proteolytic degradation of phopsphorylated GSK3, observed in the rodent study, was not present in the human study.</p>
      <p>Ideally, the best model to investigate the role of the small intestine in inducing insulin resistance would be that of studying the same insulin resistant subjects and animals before and after bariatric surgery, in particular the bilio-pancreatic diversion that was proven to allow diabetes remission through the normalization of insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Guidone1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Salinari1">[7]</xref>. After this operation as well as after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, however, the biliary limb is excluded from food transit and it is no further explorable endoscopically to obtain mucosal biopsies. To harmonize the experimental design in humans and animals, we have thus chosen to demonstrate that the duodenum/jejunum of insulin resistant humans and mice secrete hormone/s inducing insulin resistance.</p>
      <p>The natural evolution our study will be the isolation and identification of the IR hormone/s secreted by the duodenum-jejunum tracts. Their future identification might permit the development of new pharmacological agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is, in fact, a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of this disease although the presence of a concomitant β-cell failure is necessary. It is worldwide recognized that the skeletal muscle insulin resistance develops decades before β-cell failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Dixon1">[50]</xref>. The clinical implications of our study are related to the mechanisms of action of the jejunal hormone/s inducing IR which can explain the immediate metabolic and longer term effects of bariatric surgery in inducing the remission of type 2 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056258-Dixon1">[50]</xref>.</p>
