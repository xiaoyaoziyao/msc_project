        <p>Autophagy is a major degradative process responsible for the disposal of cytoplasmic proteins and dysfunctional organelles via the lysosomal pathway. During the autophagic process, cells form double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes that sequester disposable materials in the cytoplasm and finally fuse with lysosomes. In the present study, we investigated the inhibition of autophagy by a synthesized compound, MHY1485, in a culture system by using Ac2F rat hepatocytes. Autophagic flux was measured to evaluate the autophagic activity. Autophagosomes were visualized in Ac2F cells transfected with AdGFP-LC3 by live-cell confocal microscopy. In addition, activity of mTOR, a major regulatory protein of autophagy, was assessed by western blot and docking simulation using AutoDock 4.2. In the result, treatment with MHY1485 suppressed the basal autophagic flux, and this inhibitory effect was clearly confirmed in cells under starvation, a strong physiological inducer of autophagy. The levels of p62 and beclin-1 did not show significant change after treatment with MHY1485. Decreased co-localization of autophagosomes and lysosomes in confocal microscopic images revealed the inhibitory effect of MHY1485 on lysosomal fusion during starvation-induced autophagy. These effects of MHY1485 led to the accumulation of LC3II and enlargement of the autophagosomes in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Furthermore, MHY1485 induced mTOR activation and correspondingly showed a higher docking score than PP242, a well-known ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, in docking simulation. In conclusion, MHY1485 has an inhibitory effect on the autophagic process by inhibition of fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes leading to the accumulation of LC3II protein and enlarged autophagosomes. MHY1485 also induces mTOR activity, providing a possibility for another regulatory mechanism of autophagy by the MHY compound. The significance of this study is the finding of a novel inhibitor of autophagy with an mTOR activating effect.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Autophagy is a cellular process responsible for the degradation of cytoplasmic components via the lysosomal pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Salminen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Yang1">[2]</xref>. As an essential cellular housekeeping system, autophagy occurs at low baseline levels in all cells and contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Salminen2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Yuk1">[4]</xref>. Autophagy is upregulated beyond basal levels when cells need to utilize intracellular nutrients under certain conditions such as starvation, hypoxia, and growth factor withdrawal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Huang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-White1">[6]</xref>. During the autophagic process, cells form double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes that sequester disposable materials in the cytoplasm. Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, and then the sequestered contents undergo degradation by lysosomal hydrolases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Tanida1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>During the formation of the autophagosome cytosolic microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-I (LC3I) is cleaved and conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), leading to formation of LC3II, an autophagic vacuole-associated form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Wang1">[8]</xref>. Thus, an increase in the amount of the LC3II protein and an increase in the LC3II/LC3I ratio have been considered hallmarks of autophagy. However, LC3II of the inner membrane of the autophagosome is also degraded by lysosomal proteases after the formation of autolysosomes, and the extent of autophagosome formation often dissociates from the level of autophagic flux. Therefore, the static LC3II/LC3I ratio, which shows LC3I and LC3II at a single time point, can produce misleading results. For this reason, we measured autophagic flux to evaluate autophagic activity. Autophagic flux, which expresses autophagic activity and its nature as a dynamic process, is assessed by comparing the LC3II/LC3I ratio in the absence and presence of lysosomal inhibitors such as bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine. In addition, p62/SQSTM1 is a useful marker of autophagic activity. The scaffolding adaptor protein p62 interacts with both LC3II and polyubiquitinated protein, which leads to the self-degradation as well as degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins in autolysosomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Bauvy1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Mizushima1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Yoon1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Autophagy is a complicated process that consists of autophagosome biogenesis, maturation, and fusion with lysosomes. A number of diverse signaling complexes have effects on the respective molecular steps in the regulation of the autophagic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-He1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Mehrpour1">[13]</xref>. There are several pharmacological compounds, including rapamycin, a well-known specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), that have been found to induce the autophagic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Cho1">[14]</xref>. Rapamycin has been used as a conventional reagent for autophagy activation since it was first discovered that its inhibition of mTOR strongly induced autophagy. On the other hands, a few inhibitors of autophagy including 3-methyladenine (3-MA), chloroquine, and bafilomycin A1, are employed in experimental and clinical research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Mizushima2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Tanida2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Klionsky1">[17]</xref>. 3-MA inhibits class III phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) that positively regulates the formation of autophagosomes. Bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine, which are useful tools in assessment of autophagic flux mentioned above, inhibit the final step of autophagy. Bafilomycin A1, a macrolide antibiotic isolated from <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic> strains, specifically inhibits vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase (V-ATPase), which plays a role in the acidification of the lysosome leading to the digestive function of the lysosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Yoshimori1">[18]</xref>. Chloroquine also inhibits fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes through unknown molecular targets.</p>

      <p>Here, we have shown the effect of our synthesized 4,6-dimorpholino-<italic>N</italic>-(4-nitrophenyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (MHY1485) on the arrest of the autophagic process through the inhibition of lysosomal fusion in normal rat liver Ac2F cells. MHY1485 was synthesized based on its morpholino triazine structure that is known to bind mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), and was selected based on the results of the ratio of LC3BII/LC3BI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Agarwal1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Kolmakov1">[20]</xref>. However, the effect of MHY1485 on autophagic regulation was first studied in this study. In our result, LC3II protein largely accumulated and autophagosomes enlarged by the treatment of MHY1485. In addition, MHY1485 induced mTOR activity, which is another regulator of autophagy. We strongly suggest that the synthetic MHY compound has potential as a new inhibitor of autophagy.</p>

        <title>1. Increased LC3II Levels and LC3II-positive Vacuoles by MHY1485</title>
        <p>First, we evaluated the LC3II/LC3I ratio in normal rat liver Ac2F cells treated with MHY1485 with different doses and times. MHY1485 markedly increased the LC3II/LC3I ratio dose-dependently and time-dependently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g002">fig. 2</xref>, the LC3II/LC3I ratio was increased due to presumably inhibited LC3II degradation. Next, to monitor the formation of autophagosomes which is characterized by LC3 aggregation, formation of puncta was observed. For this, the cells were treated with the MHY compound after transfection with AdGFP-LC3. In comparison with the control cells that showed the spread of fluorescence and formation of few LC3-puncta, many autophagosomes were seen in the form of perinuclear puncta of GFP-LC3 in the cells treated with our compound after 1 h exposure. However, the size of these LC3-positive vacuoles further increased with longer MHY1485 treatment and finally filled the cytoplasm with vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g002">Fig. 2</xref> C). Merged images (bottom) show the ring-shaped vacuoles in phase contrast images overlapping with the LC3-positive vacuoles (green).</p>

        <title>2. Inability of MHY1485 to Increase Autophagic Flux</title>
        <p>To confirm that the increased LC3II/LC3I ratio was an outcome of the accumulation of autophagosomes and not elevated autophagic activity, we measured autophagic flux with the lysosome inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Wang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Mizushima2">[15]</xref>. We also presumed that the expansion of the LC3-positive vacuoles occurred because the autophagosomes did not fuse with the lysosomes, which is the final destination of the autophagosome. Bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine was added 1 h before the cell harvest to inhibit lysosomal activity leading to accumulation of LC3II protein. Western blot analysis showed that LC3II protein increased after treatment of bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine, implying the basal autophagic activity. In contrast, MHY1485 treatment increased the ratio of LC3II/LC3I, which was accompanied by no further increase of LC3II by bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine treatment. As our expectation, LC3II protein did not accumulate after treatment with the lysosomotropic reagents in the cells treated with MHY1485, indicating that MHY compound did not increase the autophagic flux and suppressed the basal level of autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g003">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). Because p62 acts as a scaffolding adaptor protein interacting with both LC3II and polyubiquitinated protein, and degrading with these proteins in autolysosomes, changes in p62 was measured. In the present result, the p62 level did not decrease or slightly increased in MHY1485-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Beclin-1 is required for the initiation of the formation of autophagosomes, and increases in autophagic process. MHY1485 did not change the level of beclin-1 compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Therefore, we determined that MHY1485 inhibited the autophagic process.</p>

        <title>3. Inhibition of Starvation-induced Autophagic Flux by MHY1485</title>
        <p>Next, to confirm the inhibitory effect of MHY1485 on autophagy, we evaluated the autophagic flux and the colocalization of LC3-positive vacuoles and lysosomes using confocal microscopy in cells stimulated by starvation, which is a powerful circumstance leading to autophagy. Active autophagic processes occurred in cells with starvation, as demonstrated by increased accumulation of LC3II protein after treatment of bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine. However, the extent of accumulated LC3II protein was less after treatment of bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine in the MHY1485 treated starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). These data strongly indicate decreased autophagic flux by MHY1485. Consistent with this, the result using chloroquine, another inhibitor of lysosomal fusion, showed a similar inhibitory effect of MHY1485 on the autophagic flux induced by starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). We assessed the colocalization of autophagosome with lysosomes to confirm the level of their fusion. Ac2F cells were transfected with AdGFP-LC3 and stained with LysoTracker to visualize the lysosomes. LC3 and lysosomal signal overlap in cells under starvation decreased by MHY1485 co-treatment, indicating that starvation-induced fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes was inhibited by the MHY compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The percentage of overlap index was 132.7% in cells with starvation, 127% in cell with starvation plus MHY1485, and 121% in cell treated only MHY1485.</p>

        <title>4. Increased mTOR Activity and Docking Simulation of MHY1485 with mTOR</title>
        <p>mTOR, a major regulator of autophagy, plays a role in the inhibition of autophagy through the phosphorylation of unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), a component involved in the initiation of autophagic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Mehrpour1">[13]</xref>. Recently, lysosomal positioning of mTOR has been identified. mTOR is recruited to the surface of lysosomes where it becomes activated. Morpholino triazine structure, which our compound also possesses, has also been reported to easily bind mTOR and inhibit its activity. Therefore, we examined the effect of our compound on the activity of mTOR. The phosphorylation of mTOR at ser2448, which implies the activated form of mTOR, dose-dependently increased in MHY1485-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The level of phosphorylation of eukaryotic-translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) which is the typical downstream substrate of mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Zoncu1">[27]</xref> was also increased in a dose-dependent manner. Rapamycin was used as a positive control. To confirm that the MHY compound binds mTOR, the docking simulation of the compound with mTOR was carried out. We checked the Z-score of the 3D structure to validate predicted structure models using the QMEAN server. Because mTOR had low sequence identity (18%) with the template structure (1E8X), the Z-score of the predicted model was −4.8. However, we checked the quality of each residue on the mTOR structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). As a result, the internal region that bound ATP and compounds was more reliable (color is blue) than the external region (color is red) of mTOR. The estimated residue error was visualized using a color gradient from blue (more reliable regions) to red (potentially unreliable regions, estimated error above 3.5 Å). The docking simulation was successful with significant scores. The binding energies of the compounds were −7.28 kcal/mol (PP242) and −7.55 kcal/mol (MHY1485). The docking score between the ligand and the receptor is represented by various energy terms such as electrostatic energy, van der Waals energy terms, and the solvation energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). MHY1485 showed a higher docking score with mTOR than PP242, a first selective inhibitor that targets the ATP domain of mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Feldman1">[28]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Autophagy is a self-degradation process via the lysosomal pathway that is required for the normal turnover of cellular components and the starvation response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Salminen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Yang1">[2]</xref>. The autophagic process involves a unique membrane structure, the autophagosome which is a spherical structure consisting of double bilayer membranes. In the final stage of autophagy, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes for degradation of contents in the autophagosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Tanida1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Noda1">[29]</xref>. The present study verified that the synthesized compound, MHY1485, inhibited the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes leading to accumulation of LC3II protein and enlarged autophagosomes in rat hepatocytes and also induced the activity of mTOR.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that autophagic markers such as LC3 and beclin-1 increase when the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosmes is blocked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Shacka1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Ramser1">[31]</xref>. In our study, treatment with MHY1485 led to the accumulation of LC3II and enlargement of cellular vacuoles. This phenomenon is very similar to that induced by treatment with chloroquine, a typical inhibitor of autophagy. It has been reported that chloroquine-treated human retinal pigment epithelium-derived ARPE-19 cells demonstrated a marked increase in vacuolation and LC3II protein by blocking the lysosomal fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Yoon1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Chen1">[32]</xref>. While the conspicuous cytosolic vacuoles induced by chloroquine were dilated lysosomes, the MHY1485-induced vacuoles were the enlarged LC3-positive vacuoles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043418-g002">Fig. 2</xref> C. Further, it has been speculated that chloroquine is easily accumulated in lysosomes due to its character as a weak base <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Yoon1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Hiruma1">[33]</xref>. MHY1485 is also a weak base, but other synthesized compounds that have higher basicity than MHY1485 did not show cellular vacuolation. Therefore, we considered that the MHY1485-induced enlargement of the cellular vacuoles was not caused by its basicity.</p>
      <p>Many small molecules that induce the autophagic process including rapamycin, SAHA, temozolomide and curcumin have been explored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Oh1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Katayama1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Aoki1">[36]</xref>, but few materials have been found to have inhibitory effects on autophagy. The maintenance of autophagy is important for normal cellular conditions, and cancer cells also employ autophagy as a cellular survival pathway. Therefore, pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy have been used with combinations of chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Geng1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Ullman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Yang2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Wang2">[40]</xref>. The inhibitors of autophagy generally exhibit cellular toxicity and induce cell death. We examined the viability of Ac2F cells treated with MHY1485 for 24 h at different concentrations. MHY1485 concentrations at over 20 µM induced a 20% decline of the cell viability compared to untreated cells. This concentration was 10-fold higher than 2 µM of MHY compound that was sufficient to have an inhibitory effect on autophagy. Treatment of MHY1485 2 µM also did not show any cell death during longer treatment, supporting that MHY1485 had less toxicity than other well-known inhibitors.</p>
      <p>One interesting finding is the activation of mTOR by MHY1485. mTOR is a major regulator of initiation of autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Mehrpour1">[13]</xref>. The recent identification of mTOR localization at the lysosomal membrane when it is activated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Pous1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Sancak1">[42]</xref> and the several reports that morpholino triazine analogs can easily bind mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Richard1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Zask1">[44]</xref> led us to the question about the effect of MHY1485 on the activity of mTOR. At first, we expected that the MHY compound would inhibite mTOR activation, because some morpholino triazine analogs have been identified as a selective ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Richard1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Zask1">[44]</xref> and because on docking simulation, the MHY compound showed the higher docking score than PP242, a first selective inhibitor that targets ATP domain of mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Feldman1">[28]</xref>. Contrary to our expectation, MHY1485 induced the activation of mTOR as described in the results. Although further study is required to identify the reasons, we speculated 2 possibilities: 1) MHY1485 might bind a different site from an ATP-binding site of mTOR. 2) MHY1485 might indirectly activate mTOR. In respect that the phosphorylated mTOR at ser2448 elevated, there is a possibility of indirect activation on mTOR by the MHY compound. Because the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway phosphorylates mTOR at ser2448 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043418-Wang3">[45]</xref>, MHY1485 may activate upstream signaling of mTOR. Further study will also be needed to verify an association between MHY1485-induced activation of mTOR and regulation of autophagy.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we found a novel mechanism for inhibition of autophagy by MHY1485. The effects of the synthetic compound MHY1485 included the inhibition of autolysosome formation, leading to the arrest of autophagy and the induction of mTOR activity.</p>
