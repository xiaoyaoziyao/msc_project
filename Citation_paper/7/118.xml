<abstract>
<p>The cyclin B/CDK1 complex is a key regulator of mitotic entry. Using PP242, a specific ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTOR kinase, we provide evidence that the mTOR signalling pathway controls <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA translation following fertilization in <italic>Sphaerechinus granularis</italic> and <italic>Paracentrotus lividus</italic>. We show that PP242 inhibits the degradation of the cap-dependent translation repressor 4E-BP (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-Binding Protein). PP242 inhibits global protein synthesis, delays cyclin B accumulation, cyclin B/CDK1 complex activation and consequently entry into the mitotic phase of the cell cycle triggered by fertilization. PP242 inhibits <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA recruitment into active polysomes triggered by fertilization. An amount of <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA present in active polysomes appears to be insensitive to PP242 treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that, following sea urchin egg fertilization, <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA translation is controlled by two independent mechanisms: a PP242-sensitive and an additional PP242-insentitive mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cyclins and their catalytic kinase partners CDKs (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases) control cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref001">1</xref>]. The mitotic cyclins A and B were first discovered in sea urchin as key proteins, which are synthetized and degraded during M-phase at each cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref002">2</xref>]. Different mechanisms that underlie the control of mitotic cyclin B translation during the cell cycle and development transitions of model organisms have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref003">3</xref>]. In sea urchin and clams, cyclin B is synthetized continuously and rapidly destroyed shortly before the metaphase-anaphase transition of the mitotic cell cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref002">2</xref>]. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, cyclin B translation was reported to be maximal during mitosis and to be driven by the polyadenylation of <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA in cycling extracts from embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref004">4</xref>]. CDK1-mediated negative feedback loop was shown to decrease cyclin B translation and drive <italic>Xenopus</italic> early embryonic cell cycle oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref005">5</xref>]. Taken together, these studies highlight the requirement for fine-tuning of mitotic cyclins translation during the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The early steps of the first mitotic division induced by fertilization of sea urchin egg represent an optimal system for studying the relationships between mRNA translation regulation and mitotic cell cycle for the following reasons. Sea urchin eggs have completed their meiotic maturation and are haploid cells blocked in G1. The overall rate of protein synthesis is low in unfertilized eggs and fertilization triggers a dramatic rise in protein synthesis independently of mRNA transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref008">8</xref>]. Sea urchin embryos are naturally synchronized during the first mitotic divisions. <italic>De novo</italic> protein synthesis is dispensable for S-phase progression but is required for the onset and normal progression of mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref009">9</xref>]. A comparative genomics platform for the echinoderm clade is available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Echinobase.org" xlink:type="simple">http://Echinobase.org</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref010">10</xref>]). The <italic>S</italic>. <italic>purpuratus</italic> genome analysis allowed identifying the canonical B-type cyclin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref012">12</xref>]. Cap-dependent translation is highly regulated following fertilization and is involved in the onset of the first mitotic division of the sea urchin embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanism of eukaryotic cap-dependent initiation of translation accounts for the translation of most eukaryotic mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref016">16</xref>]. Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4E (eIF4E), a central actor for the control of cap-dependent translation initiation, is a cap-binding protein that binds to m<sup>7</sup>GpppN (where N is any nucleotide) present at the 5’ extremity of the vast majority of eukaryotic mRNAs (review in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref017">17</xref>]). eIF4E bridges the mRNA and the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref018">18</xref>] by recruiting eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4G (eIF4G), a scaffolding protein that acts as docking site for several proteins including Initiation Factors 3 (eIF3) and 4A (eIF4A). eIF4G also associates with the Poly(A)-Binding Protein (PABP) that interacts with poly(A) tail. This association stimulates translation of polyadenylated mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) are well-characterized inhibitors of eIF4E function (review in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref020">20</xref>]). Three 4E-BPs (4E-BP1, 4E-BP2 and 4E-BP3) exist in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref023">23</xref>]. A single 4E-BP ortholog exists in sea urchin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref024">24</xref>]. 4E-BPs competitively inhibit eIF4G association with eIF4E. Binding of 4E-BPs to eIF4E is regulated by phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref026">26</xref>]. Hypophosphorylated 4E-BPs bind to eIF4E and inhibit cap-dependent translation, whereas hyperphosphorylated forms do not.</p>
<p>4E-BPs phosphorylation is controlled <italic>via</italic> the mTOR (mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin) pathway (reviews in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref028">28</xref>]). mTOR is an atypical serine/threonine protein kinase that interacts with several proteins to form two distinct complexes named mTOR Complex 1 (TORC1) and 2 (TORC2), which are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Both complexes have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth in response to various stimuli, TORC1 controlling the cell mass whereas TORC2 would be responsible for cell surface area control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref029">29</xref>]. Translational regulation is the best characterized process regulated by TORC1, which phosphorylates p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase and 4E-BP1, which in turn, promote protein synthesis (review in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref030">30</xref>]).</p>
<p>We previously showed in the sea urchin <italic>Spharechinus granularis</italic> that 4E-BP degradation triggered by fertilization allows eIF4E association with eIF4G and the consequent accumulation of cyclin B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref032">32</xref>]. 4E-BP degradation induced by fertilization of sea urchin eggs is affected by rapamycin treatment, suggesting that it reflects TORC1 signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref031">31</xref>]. Rapamycin does not directly inhibit TOR kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref033">33</xref>]. In mammal cells, rapamycin associates with FKBP12 (12-kDa FK506 binding protein) and together they affect TOR enzymatic activities by binding to a domain different from mTOR kinase site.</p>
<p>PP242 is a novel and specific ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTOR kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref034">34</xref>]. PP242 is a dual inhibitor of TORC1 and TORC2 and it inhibits more efficiently TORC1 than rapamycin. Here, using PP242, we set out to study mTOR signalling in the control of mitotic cyclin B translation following egg fertilization in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>granularis</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>lividus</italic>, two sea urchin species separated by 20 million years evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref035">35</xref>]. We show that PP242 inhibits drastically 4E-BP degradation and delays cyclin B accumulation triggered by fertilization. PP242 consequently delays cyclin B/CDK1 complex activation and mitotic cell division triggered by fertilization. We demonstrate that <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA recruitment into active polysomes induced by fertilization is controlled by a PP242-sensitive pathway. Using puromycin as an active polysome disrupter, our results suggest that an additional PP242-insensitive mechanism is involved in the control of <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA recruitment into polysomes.</p>

<title>Handling of gametes and embryos</title>
<p><italic>Sphaerechinus granularis</italic> and <italic>Paracentrotus lividus</italic> collected in the Brest area (France), were obtained from CRBM (Centre de Ressources Biologiques Marines) at the Roscoff Biological Station (France). Spawning of gametes was induced by intracoelomic injection of 0.1 M acetylcholine. Eggs were collected in 0.22 μm Millipore-filtered seawater (FSW) and rinsed twice by centrifugation (2,000 rpm, 2 min). Eggs were dejellied by swirling twenty seconds in 3.5 mM citric acid pH5 and rinsed three times with fresh FSW. For fertilization, eggs were suspended in FSW (5% suspension). Diluted sperm was added to the eggs. Experiments were only performed on batches exhibiting greater than 90% fertilization, each experiment used gametes from a single female. Cultures were performed at 16°C under constant agitation. When required PP242 was added at the indicated final concentration to the egg suspension 10 min before fertilization from a 30 mM stock solution in DMSO. For polysome analyses, in order to freeze ongoing translating polysomes, emetine was added to the embryos suspension 5 min prior lysis. When required, disruption of translating polysomes was performed <italic>in vivo</italic> by adding puromycin (0.6 mM final concentration) to the embryos suspension 20 min prior lysis for polysomal RNA preparation.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Determination of cleavage rates and cytological analysis</title>
<p>At time intervals during 4 hours after fertilization, cleavage was scored by observation under a phase contrast microscope. Thousands of embryos were incubated for each experimental determination, from which around 100 were scored for cleavage occurrence. At various times after fertilization, 0.2 ml aliquots of embryo suspension were fixed overnight in 1 ml methanol/glycerol (3:1, v/v) in the presence of the DNA dye Hoechst (bisbenzimide, 0.1 μg/ml), mounted in 50% glycerol. The nuclear envelope and DNA were respectively observed under Nomarski differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Marly Le Roi, France).</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Embryo extracts and Western blot analyses</title>
<p>At different times following fertilization, total extracts were obtained by direct solubilization of 20 μl pelleted cells (eggs or embryos) in 150 μl of SDS-Fix buffer containing 2% sodium dodecyl-sulfate (SDS), 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8.</p>
<p>Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. 4E-BP level was assessed after sample resolution on a gel containing 15% acrylamide/bisacrylamide from a 40% stock solution (acrylamide/bis acrylamide; 2.6%), and Phospho-PP1Cα (<sup>320</sup>T in human sequence; <sup>318</sup>T in sea urchin sequences, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150318.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and cyclin B analyses were performed on a 12% acrylamide gel containing 0.1% bisacrylamide.</p>
<p>Western blot analyses were performed following electrophoretic transfer of proteins from SDS-PAGE onto 0.22 μm nitrocellulose membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref039">39</xref>].

The antigen-antibody complex was measured by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxydase-coupled secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ECL or ECL2). Signals were quantified using the public domain ImageJ program (written by Wayne Rasband at the US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>, 1997–2015.).</p>

<p>5 ml of 5% cell suspension was pelleted. Pelleted cells were lysed with a Dounce homogenizer in 1 ml of polysome lysis buffer in RNase-free water (10 mM Tris pH 7.4; 250 mM KCl; 10 mM MgCl2; 25 mM EGTA; 0.4% Igepal; 5% sucrose; 1 mM DTT; 10 μg/μl Aprotinin; 2 μg/ml Leupeptin; 100 μg/ml Emetine; 40U RNase inhibitor). Lysates were then clarified for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. Supernatants were loaded on a linear 15–40% sucrose gradient (10 mM Tris pH 7.4; 250 mM KCl; 10 mM MgCl2; 25 mM EGTA; 1 mM DTT), which ran for 2.5h at 38,000 rpm in a SW41Ti rotor at 4°C. Gradients were fractionated into equal fractions (~600 μl per fraction). RNAs were extracted with the KingFisher Pure RNA tissue kit (ThermoFisher), each fraction was diluted with one volume lysis buffer provided in the kit and processed using manufacturer’s instruction. RNA integrity was checked on 2% agarose/TBE gel electrophoresis. Equal volume of RNA isolated from each fraction was used for cDNA synthesis using the reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instruction. cDNAs were diluted in RNase-free water (1 vol.

<title>PP242 affects early embryonic development in sea urchins</title>
<p>The effect of PP242 was first analysed on the kinetics of cell division following fertilization. Unfertilized <italic>S</italic>. <italic>granularis</italic> eggs were pre-incubated for 10 min in the presence of different PP242 concentrations. They were then fertilized, cultured in drug-containing medium and scored for the first embryonic division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). PP242 induced a dose-dependent delay in the occurrence of cell division as judged by the percent of first cleavage measured during 4 hours post fertilization. At 30 μM the drug completely prevented the resumption of cell cycle induced by fertilization. At 10 μM PP242, at the time when first cleavage had occurred in the totality of control embryos, none of the treated embryos displayed cell division. Some divisions occurred then after in PP242-treated embryos, never reaching 100% of the batch and with major cell cycle di-synchrony as judged by changes in the slope of the curve. This PP242-induced delay in the first division was reproducibly obtained in 8 different females, ranging from one hour to more than 3 hours. PP242 did not affect fertilization <italic>per se</italic> since elevation of the fertilization membrane and the movement of the female and male pronuclei up to their fusion occurred normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). However, the nuclear envelope remained intact until at least 180 min post fertilization indicating a block at the entry into M-phase of the cell cycle.</p>

<p>The main well-known target of mTOR in cells is the cap-dependent protein synthesis inhibitor, 4E-BP. The effect of PP242 on 4E-BP was therefore examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g002">Fig 2</xref>). As already reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref031">31</xref>] fertilization induced the rapid and almost complete disappearance of 4E-BP during the first 15 minutes. Fertilization in the presence of PP242 completely inhibited 4E-BP disappearance, the protein remaining at a constant and high level for more than 180 min after fertilization.</p>

<p>Global protein synthesis activity was then compared in PP242-treated <italic>versus</italic> untreated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In control embryos, as expected, fertilization induced an increase in the level of neo-synthesized proteins measured as indicated in Material and Methods. In contrast, in PP242-treated embryos, the neo-synthesized protein amount remained low, increasing only 4 fold from unfertilized eggs at 150 min after fertilization, as compared to the 10 fold increase for untreated embryos versus unfertilized eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The profile of neo-synthesized proteins was analysed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis of the radioactive proteins. With the resolution limit of this method, no obvious significant difference in the level of specific proteins was observed following PP242 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, it was noted that the behaviour of a 46/48-kDa neo-synthetized protein assumed to be cyclin (accumulation, shift at 90 min and disappearance at 120 min post fertilization) seemed not detectable in PP242-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, arrow).</p>

<p>To ascertain the cell cycle stage for the PP242 effect, the <italic>in vivo</italic> kinetics of cyclin B/CDK1 complex activation was monitored in treated embryos following fertilization. We took advantage of the specific phosphorylation of the alpha catalytic subunit of the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 1 (PP1Cα) at threonine 320 (in the human sequence) by cyclin B/CDK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref040">40</xref>] and the availability of antibodies that distinguish phosphorylated from non-phosphorylated PP1Cα at threonine 320 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref038">38</xref>].

<p>A peak of phospho<sup>318</sup>T-PP1Cα reflecting cyclin B/CDK1 activation appeared at 90 min post fertilization in accordance with the time of the first mitosis in untreated embryos.

<p>Altogether, these data demonstrated that, in two evolutionary distant sea urchins, a PP242-sensitive pathway is conserved and controls cyclin B accumulation. PP242 affects the degradation pathway of 4E-BP and consequently induces the stabilisation of the translational inhibitor, which maintains a low activity of protein synthesis, preventing cyclin B accumulation and cyclin B/CDK1 activation triggered by fertilization.</p>

<title>PP242 inhibits <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA recruitment into polysomes following fertilization</title>
<p>Protein level is the result from its translation <italic>versus</italic> its degradation rates. Polysome analysis is widely used to evaluate changes in the translation status of specific mRNAs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref044">44</xref>]. By optimizing a protocol to purify polysomes on sucrose gradient from sea urchin eggs, we showed that <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA became actively recruited into heavy fractions of a sucrose gradient following fertilization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150318.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, top panels). Puromycin, an inhibitor of the elongation step of translation, only impacts active polysomes and is used as a polysome disrupter to distinguish between translated mRNAs associated with polysomes and untranslated mRNAs co-migrating with polysomes because of their association to large ribonucleoprotein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref045">45</xref>]. Puromycin treatment of control embryos induced a complete shift of <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA from polysome fractions to monosome fractions, indicating that <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA was indeed recruited into active polysomes following fertilization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150318.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, bottom panels). We next compared <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA recruitment into polysomes in PP242-treated and untreated control embryos. We first chose to carry out those analyses using <italic>P</italic>. <italic>lividus</italic> embryos, which present more synchrony in the cell division kinetics. Polysome preparations from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>lividus</italic> embryos were performed at 60 min post-fertilization, corresponding to M-phase in control embryos as judged by the occurrence of the cyclin B/CDK1 activity peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). As expected, <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA was actively recruited into the active polysomal fractions in control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, black circles). In PP242-treated embryos, <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA associated to the heavy fractions significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, black triangles), indicating that PP242 inhibited <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA polysomal recruitment. Furthermore, our data showed that the remaining amount of c<italic>yclin B</italic> mRNA in the PP242-treated embryos corresponded to active polysomes since it was shifted to lower fractions of the gradient after puromycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, empty triangles), suggesting a PP242-insensitive pathway. These data were reproducible in 6 different experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), and suggest two independent mechanisms for <italic>cyclin</italic> B mRNA recruitment.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that PP242 severely affected M-phase entry triggered by fertilization of sea urchin eggs. The initial target of PP242-induced mTOR inhibition would be the 4E-BP translational inhibitor, which remained undegraded in the presence of the drug. PP242 binds to the ATP-site of mTOR to inhibit both TORC1 and TORC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref034">34</xref>]. 4E-BPs are well-characterized downstream targets of TORC1 (review in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref027">27</xref>]). The present results confirm and extend our previous works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref046">46</xref>] showing that 4E-BP is degraded by mTOR-sensitive pathway triggered by sea urchin egg fertilization. A few reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref048">48</xref>] had been published related to the control of 4E-BPs stability in mammals <italic>via</italic> ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. In mammal cells, <sup>57</sup>Lys was the potential ubiquitination site in 4E-BP1 and only hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 could be degraded, suggesting that 4E-BP degradation proceeds only when 4E-BP is not accessible to mTOR kinase activity. Therefore this mechanism could not account for the observed effect of PP242 in sea urchin embryo. Moreover, neither <sup>57</sup>Lys nor <sup>69</sup>Lys and <sup>105</sup>Lys present in human 4E-BP1 are conserved in sea urchins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref049">49</xref>]. Thus it is likely that mTOR-mediated regulation of 4E-BP degradation relies to another molecular mechanism that remains to elucidate. Since many reports indicate that the 4E-BPs are functionally inactivated in cancer cells by major oncogenic signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref020">20</xref>], elucidation of the molecular mechanism involved in the mTOR-mediated regulation of 4E-BP degradation remains a major challenge. Our current work providing evidence that 4E-BP degradation depends on mTOR signalling confirms the strength of the sea urchin embryo as a model for the study of such mechanism.</p>
<p>Importantly, our data show that the fertilization-induced accumulation of cyclin B protein is repressed under mTOR pathway inhibition in two sea urchin species, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>lividus</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>granularis</italic>. We demonstrate that <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA recruitment into active polysomes is impacted by PP242 treatment of the embryos. This result definitely demonstrates that sea urchin egg fertilization stimulated the cap-dependent initiation of <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA translation <italic>via</italic> the mTOR-induced 4E-BP degradation.</p>
<p>In addition, our data further support two attractive hypotheses. On the one hand, the partial inhibition of <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA recruitment by PP242 treatment suggests that an additional mechanism, independent of 4E-BP level and insensitive to mTOR pathway, is involved in the recruitment of the <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA. This alternative pathway for <italic>cyclin B</italic> translation remains to be uncovered in sea urchin. Some reports have put forward 3’UTR-binding proteins in the control of <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA translation in different species (review in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref003">3</xref>]). As an example, the RNA-binding protein CPEB (Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding protein) binds specific sequence in the 3’UTR region of the messenger, determines polyadenylation status, and consequently translational efficiency, of its target mRNAs. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte, Maskin, which is a CPEB-interacting protein, sequesters eIF4E and supresses translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref050">50</xref>]. Therefore, Maskin serves as a classical example of a protein that links a RNA-binding protein to 3’UTR and eIF4E associated with the cap to inhibit translation initiation. Alternative mechanisms have since been identified involving an ovary specific eIF4E and the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref051">51</xref>]. CPEB-mediated control of cyclin B1 translation is critical for <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref004">4</xref>]. In starfish oocytes, we showed that cyclin B translation during meiotic maturation is correlated with the phosphorylation and the dissociation of CPEB from eIF4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref052">52</xref>]. Sea urchin contains genes involved in cytoplasmic polyadenylation such as CPEB, CPSF and Symplekin (review in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref024">24</xref>]) and egg fertilization is associated with an increase in the polyadenylation of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref053">53</xref>]. However, it was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref054">54</xref>] that sea urchin development prior to hatching is not affected by cordycepin, an inhibitor of RNA adenylation, suggesting that CPEB-mediated polyadenylation is not required for the first mitotic divisions in sea urchin.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries and syncytial embryos, the PAN GU (PNG) kinase complex regulates the developmental translation of cyclin B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref055">55</xref>]. PNG acts as an antagonist of PUMILIO-dependent translational repression, which represses cyclin B by binding the <italic>cis</italic>-acting Nanos Response Element (NRE) in the 3’UTR and by recruiting nanos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref056">56</xref>]. Sea urchin embryos contain three nanos homologs. However, <italic>nanos</italic> mRNAs are only expressed in small micromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref057">57</xref>], suggesting that the regulation of cyclin B translation following fertilization in sea urchin is independent of nanos.</p>
<p>Finally, Vasa, a broadly conserved ATP-dependent RNA helicase, has been reported to regulate the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA in a dual-luciferase assay in four- to eight-cell stage lysates of sea urchin embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref058">58</xref>]. Since Vasa protein and mRNA are present uniformly throughout the egg and early embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150318.ref059">59</xref>], Vasa could play a potential role in <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA translation regulation following fertilization.</p>
<p>Since a significant pool of <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA remains recruited and appears actively translated in the presence of PP242, a second exciting hypothesis drawn by our data came from the finding that cyclin B protein remains at a low basal level in presence of the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150318.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The intracellular level of a protein results from an equilibrium between its translation and its degradation rate. Therefore it can be assumed that the degradation of cyclin B protein must be activated in PP242 treated embryos in order to maintain a low level of cyclin B despite the mTOR insensitive recruitment of <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA triggered by fertilization. The simplest hypothesis to fit these data would be that fertilization triggers (i) the increase in <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA translation <italic>via</italic> both a mTOR dependent- and a mTOR independent-recruitment of <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA and (ii) the inhibition of cyclin B protein degradation <italic>via</italic> mTOR-signalling pathway.</p>
<p>Altogether our work brings important clues on the control of cyclin B translation <italic>via</italic> mTOR signalling and underlines the fine-tuning orchestration of mitotic cyclin translation after fertilization in sea urchin.</p>
