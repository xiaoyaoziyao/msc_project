      <abstract>
        <p>YB-1 is a eukaryotic protein with numerous intra- and extracellular functions based on its ability to interact with RNA, DNA, and many proteins. In spite of achievements in studying its functions, regulation of YB-1 synthesis in the cell remains poorly understood. In the current study Western and Northern blotting were used to determine the amounts of YB-1 and <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in rabbit organs and several cell lines. As found, in the majority of studied eukaryotic cells a considerable proportion of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA was stored in free mRNPs, i.e., was poorly translated. Also, we demonstrated that YB-1 synthesis depended on conditions that determined the rate of cell division. Specific suppression of YB-1 synthesis resulted from inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway with inhibitor PP242, but not rapamycin. Experiments on reporter constructs showed that dependence of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA translation on activity of the mTOR signaling pathway was dictated by 5′ untranslated regions of this mRNA, irrelatively of the TOP-like sequences at the beginning of 5′ UTR.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>YB-1 belongs to proteins with a cold shock domain and performs many functions in the cell (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Eliseeva1">[1]</xref>). It interacts with many other proteins and with DNA and RNA. It acts as a chaperon of nucleic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Skabkin1">[2]</xref>, thereby restoring their conformational mobility lost upon a temperature decrease. By binding to nucleic acids, YB-1 regulates virtually all DNA- and mRNA-dependent events in eukaryotic cells, including replication and reparation of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Gaudreault1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Pestryakov1">[5]</xref>, as well as transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Eliseeva1">[1]</xref>, splicing of mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Chansky1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Raffetseder1">[7]</xref> and mRNA translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Evdokimova1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Svitkin1">[11]</xref>. In other words, it performs both overall and specific regulation of gene expression at differential levels. The amount of YB-1 is especially high in cancer cells, which makes it a pronounced marker of tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Kuwano1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Knosel1">[13]</xref>. YB-1 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus stimulates transcription of a number of genes encoding protective proteins, including those responsible for multiple drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Stein1">[14]</xref>. When involved in DNA reparation in the nucleus, YB-1 contributes to cell resistance against ionizing radiation and xenobiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Ohga1">[15]</xref>. Therefore, the nuclear localization of YB-1 is considered to be an early marker of multiple drug resistance of cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Kuwano1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Bargou1">[16]</xref>. Its elevated concentration in the cytoplasm may prevent oncogenic transformation of the cell caused by activated PI3K/Akt kinase signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Bader1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Besides, YB-1 can promote transition of differentiated epithelial cells into mesenchymal stem ones with an elevated migration ability allowing their dispersion elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Evdokimova3">[18]</xref>. As shown by independent studies, an elevated expression of YB-1 in tumors correlates with enhanced tumor dissemination, which makes YB-1 an early marker of metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Gens1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Wu1">[21]</xref>. Also, YB-1 was shown to be able to secret from cells and to bind to Notch receptors on the cell surface, thereby stimulating cell proliferation similar to the epidermal growth factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Frye1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Rauen1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In spite of considerable achievements in studying YB-1 functions, regulation of YB-1 synthesis in the cell remains poorly understood. The reported studies are mostly devoted to regulation of <italic>YB-1</italic> expression at the level of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Uramoto1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Ohashi1">[28]</xref>. There are only a few papers on expression regulation at the post-transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Lyabin1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Kato1">[32]</xref>, although it is quite possible.</p>
      <p>Here, using Western and Northern blotting, we detected amounts of YB-1 and <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in rabbit organs and in some cultivated cell lines. As found, these two values frequently show no correlation with each other in rabbit organs. In cultivated cells, they are slightly variable, with the bulk of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA usually observed in free mRNPs, i.e., poorly translated. Using [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met pulse labeling of cell proteins followed by immunoprecipitation of YB-1, we determined the rate of YB-1 synthesis in the cell. It was shown to depend on conditions affecting the rate of cell division (cell culture density, serum starvation). Finally, we have shown that inhibition of the mTOR kinase results in specific negative regulation of both endogenous YB-1 synthesis and translation of reporter constructs containing <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA 5′ UTR.</p>

        <title>Analysis of YB-1 and <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA Amounts in Cultivated Cells and Rabbit Organs</title>
        <p>Prior to determining the level of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA translation, we estimated the amounts of YB-1 and <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in several eukaryotic cell cultures and various rabbit organs. The amount of YB-1 was determined using Western blot with antibodies against its C-terminal peptide, while Northern blot was used to detect <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA. As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, in total lysates of eukaryotic cell lines YB-1 varies only slightly and amounts to about 20–30 ng per 15 µg of the total protein. The amount of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA shows no considerable variability either, ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 ng per 10 µg of the total RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The only exception is amounts of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA and YB-1 detected in 3T3 cells, where <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA exceeds the level typical of other cell lines, while the amount of YB-1 does not approach it.</p>
        <p>As to YB-1 and <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA amounts in rabbit organ lysates, they differ from organ to organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Rabbit testis, spleen, lungs, and heart are rich in YB-1 (30–40 ng per 50µg of the total protein), while liver, kidneys, brain, and muscles contain from 5 to 10 ng per 50µg of the total protein. The largest amount of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA was detected in testis (1.5 ng per 15 µg of the total RNA) and heart (0.5 ng per 15 µg of the total RNA). In other rabbit organs it varies from 0.1 to 0.2 ng per 15 µg of the total RNA. It should be noted that in spite of a low <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA content in rabbit lungs and spleen, the YB-1 amount in these organs was almost as large as in testis, which suggested a high level of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA translation there or a high YB-1 stability.</p>

        <title>Analysis of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA Distribution between Polysomal and Free mRNP Fractions in Various Cell Lines</title>
        <p>To analyze the translational level of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA, we determined its content in polysomal- and free mRNP fractions from lysates of various eukaryotic cell lines and rabbit organs. As a rule, the presence of mRNA in a polysomal fraction points to its efficient translation. In contrast, predominant localization of mRNA in a free mRNP fraction is indicative of the absence or low level of translation of this mRNA. The lysate samples were centrifuged through 50% sucrose to give free mRNPs in the supernatant, and polysomal mRNPs in the pellet. Isolation of the total RNA from these fractions was followed by detection of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA (or <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA as a control) by Northern blot. Applicability of this technique was verified by addition of up to 30 mM EDTA to the lysate prior to centrifugation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052527.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>It follows from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g002">Fig. 2</xref> that, predictably, in all these cell lines, the bulk (50–70%) of <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA was detected in translated polysomal mRNPs. A high content of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in the polysomal fraction is typical of HeLa, MCF-7, and HEK293 cells, where about 50% of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA is localized to polysomal mRNPs. Other studied cell lines, including cancer cells, demonstrated predominant localization of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in free mRNPs, which suggested its poor translation or no translation at all. In some samples (3T3 cells) more than 90% of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA is sedimented in the form of free mRNPs. Thus, in the majority of the studied cell lines, <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA proved to be a weak template.</p>

            <p>Cells were scraped and lysed. Nuclei and mitochondria were removed by centrifugation, and cytosolic extracts were then spun through a 50% sucrose cushion at 100,000 rpm in a TLA-100 centrifuge (Beckman) for 13 min to separate postpolysomal supernatant from polysomes. Total RNA from postpolysomal supernatant and polysomal fractions (resuspended pellets) were extracted with TRIzol, subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and Northern blot hybridization to [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled <italic>YB-1</italic> and <italic>GAPDH</italic> cDNA. <bold>B,</bold> Relative radioactivity of the bands was determined using a Packard Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard Instrument Company, Inc.).

        </fig>
        <p>An analysis of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA distribution in lysates of rabbit organs showed a lower translational level of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA as compared to <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA used as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). However, there are some peculiarities worthy of note. Although the amount of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in rabbit lungs is rather low, the level of its translation is presumably high enough to provide an amount of YB-1 exceeding that in other organs. In the brain, the translational level of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA is also high, but the amount of YB-1 is fairly low. This may be explained by enhanced YB-1 degradation possibly occurring in this organ. Testis contains large amounts of both <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA and YB-1, with 90% of the former localized to free untranslated mRNPs. It can be expected that <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA is stored as masked mRNPs.</p>

        <title>Assessment of YB-1 Synthesis in the Cell</title>
        <p>To confirm conclusions drawn from the experiments on cell cultures, we studied the rate of YB-1 synthesis in the cell. For this purpose, we proposed a technique implying metabolic cell labeling with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine followed by YB-1 immunoprecipitation with anti-YB-1 antibody, electrophoretic analysis of the precipitate, and autoradiography. Since YB-1 electrophoretic mobility in SDS gel electrophoresis shows no difference from that of heavy immunoglobulin chains, we used acid-urea electrophoresis. In these conditions, a much higher positive charge of YB-1 makes it show a higher electrophoretic mobility, as compared to the majority of co-precipitating proteins (including immunoglobulins). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows a typical electrophoregram and an autoradiograph obtained from these experiments. A protein with mobility corresponding to that of recombinant YB-1 was cut out from the gel, subjected to peptide fingerprinting, and identified as YB-1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052527.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, the developed technique is applicable to assess YB-1 synthesis in eukaryotic cell cultures.</p>

        <p>Using this technique, we analyzed YB-1 synthesis in the following cell lines: HeLa, HEK293 (with a large proportion of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in the polysomal fraction), 3T3, CHO, and Vero (with a large proportion of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in free mRNPs). The studied cell lysates were equilibrated in terms of radioactive labeling (incorporated [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine). It appeared that in 3T3, CHO and Vero cells with a high level of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in the free mRNP fraction YB-1 was nevertheless synthesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, lanes 1, 3 and 5), though to a lower extent than in HeLa and HEK293 cells (by 3 and 2 times, respectively) that have a high amount of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in their polysomal fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, lanes 2 and 4). So, the proportion of YB-1 synthesis in the total protein synthesis is lower for 3T3, Vero and CHO cells than for HeLa and HEK293 ones, which is in agreement with the above data on <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA content in polysomal- and free mRNP fractions. Also, it can be stated that in the majority of the studied cell lines <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA is poorly translated indeed, but not stored as untranslated masked mRNPs.</p>
        <p>The proposed technique for detection of YB-1 synthesis in living cells is easy and informative as to some peculiar aspects of regulation of YB-1 amount in the cell, which have been yet poorly and only indirectly studied. Specifically, it allowed us to elucidate the relationship between YB-1 synthesis and the rate of cell division.</p>

        <title>YB-1 Synthesis and the Cell Division Rate</title>
        <p>As known, the amount of YB-1 in a cell depends on its proliferative ability. It was found that an elevated YB-1 amount correlates with expression of proliferation markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Feng1">[33]</xref>, YB-1 overexpression causes hyperplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Bergmann1">[34]</xref>, and cell doubling time increases with decreasing YB-1 expression under the action of siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Basaki1">[35]</xref>. But the opposite may be speculated too, i.e., that YB-1 synthesis decreases as a result of a slower cell division.</p>
        <p>A simple way to slow down cell division is to change cell density (or confluence) which underlies the so-called density-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. We sought to see how an increased cell density (and hence, inhibition of cell proliferation) affected YB-1 synthesis. For this purpose 3T3 cells were cultivated up to a confluence of 40–50%, 80–90% and 100%, and additionally incubated with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine for 1 h, which provided label incorporation in direct proportion to the number of cells with appropriate density (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052527.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>Cell lysates from different dishes were equilibrated in terms of incorporated radioactive label ([<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine), and then YB-1 synthesis was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). As appeared, an increase of confluence of 3T3 cells from 40% to 100% resulted in about 2-fold decrease of YB-1 synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). A similar result was shown by HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g005">Figs. 5C and 5D</xref>).</p>

        <p>Our other task was to reveal the effect of serum starvation (deficiency of growth factors) on YB-1 synthesis and its amount in the cell.

After serum addition to the starving 3T3 or HEK293 cells, the amount of YB-1 restored fairly soon (after 3–6 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, lanes 3–6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, lane 3).

        <title>YB-1 Synthesis and the mTOR Signaling Pathway</title>
        <p>What could be the reason for such a sensitivity of YB-1 synthesis to growth factors? More precisely, what signaling pathway provides it? The mTOR signaling cascade seems to be a most suitable candidate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052527.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Its key protein mTOR is a protein kinase that acts as a kind of sensor that responds to nutrients, growth factors, or stress. With ample resources and the absence of stress, mTOR is active and phosphorylates some substrates, such as S6 kinase and 4E-BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Laplante1">[36]</xref>. This results in a higher level of protein synthesis, as well as cell growth and division. Apart from the overall regulation of translation, the mTOR signaling pathway is involved in specific regulation of translation of a large set(s) of mRNAs. Primarily, these are 5′TOP mRNAs and those with structured 5′UTR sensitive to 4E-BP which are responsible for cell growth and proliferation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Ma1">[37]</xref>). A question arises as to whether <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA falls into the set of mRNAs whose translation is strongly dependent on activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. To answer it, we incubated HeLa and HEK293 cells with PP242, a specific mTOR inhibitor, for 2–3 h (the mRNA amount was shown to remain unchanged during this time interval <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Hsieh1">[38]</xref>) and looked for an effect produced by this treatment on YB-1 synthesis.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g007">Figure 7A</xref> shows that treatment of HeLa cells with PP242 (1µM) induced a significant decrease in phosphorylation of 4E-BP, p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), S6 ribosomal protein (rpS6) and Akt and had no effect on phosphorylation of eIF4E and eIF2α as it was previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Feldman1">[39]</xref>. Also, the total amount of 4E-BP remained unchanged.</p>

        <p>At the same time PP242 had a slight effect on [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine incorporation in the total protein of HeLa cells but made it 2 times lower in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g007">Figs. 7</xref> B, E). However, in both HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g007">Figs. 7</xref> C and D) and HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g007">Figs. 7</xref> F and G) the level of YB-1 synthesis was about 5 times lower.</p>
        <p>The use of other inhibitors of the mTOR signaling cascade gave the following results. Like PP242, wortmannin (an inhibitor of <underline>p</underline>hospho<underline>i</underline>nositide <underline>3</underline>-<underline>k</underline>inase (PI3K) suppressing phosphorylation of Akt and downstream substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>)) inhibited YB-1 synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g008">Figs. 8B</xref> (cf. lane 1 and lanes 2, 4) and 8C). U0126, inhibitor of Erk1/2 signaling pathway responsible, among other events, for eIF4E- and eIF4G phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>) accompanied by translation stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Bianchini1">[40]</xref>, had no effect on YB-1 synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g008">Figs. 8B</xref> (cf. lanes 1 and 5) and 8C). What is of special interest, rapamycin, that affects the mTOR signaling pathway through reduced phosphorylation of S6 kinase but not 4E-BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>), produced no effect on YB-1 synthesis either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g008">Figs. 8B</xref> (cf. lanes 1 and 3) and 8C). As to the effect of the above inhibitors on total protein synthesis, it was insignificant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g008">Figs. 8A and 8C</xref>). Together, these results show that regulation of YB-1 synthesis depends on the level of phosphorylated 4E-BP.</p>

        <p>This dependence must be presumably underlain by 5′UTR (by analogy with 5′TOP and similar mRNAs). We sought to verify this suggestion using reporter mRNA coding for luciferase (luc) and possessing 5′UTR and/or 3′ UTR from <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA. According to the NCBI database, <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA 5′UTR may comprise from 118 to 171 nt. We used 2 variants of this 5′UTR: one of the minimal length – from rabbit mRNA (118 nt, (NM_001082785.1)) and the other of the maximal length – from human mRNA (171 nt, (NM_004559.3)). These or <italic>luc</italic> mRNA with control 5′- and 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>) were used to perform transfection of HeLa cells pre-treated with pp242. After 2 h we estimated the level of translation of reporter mRNAs by enzymatic activity of luciferase. As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>, the mTOR inhibitor selectively inhibited translation of the reporter mRNAs containing rabbit- as well as human YB-1 mRNA 5′UTR but not luc mRNAs containing either the both control UTRs or solely <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA 3′ UTR.</p>

        <p>Besides, we checked the effect of other inhibitors on translation of the reporter mRNAs. As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052527-g009">Fig. 9C</xref>, similarly to PP242 and in contrast to other inhibitors used, wortmannin strongly and selectively inhibited translation of <italic>luc</italic> mRNAs with rabbit <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA 5′ and 3′ UTRs.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we studied the amounts of YB-1 and <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in eukaryotic cells of a number of cell lines and in various rabbit organs. In the cell lines these amounts vary only slightly. We have shown that in the majority of the studied cell lines <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA is predominantly stored as free mRNPs, and hence, it is translated poorly, unlike the control <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA. This suggests that <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA translation is sensitive to the amount or activity of some key cellular translation factor or a protein responsible for activity of this factor. Only some cells (cancer HeLa and MCF7 cells and embryonic HEK293 cells) provide conditions for a high level of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA translation.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, analysis of the amounts of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA and YB-1 in rabbit organ lysates showed that they are variable and often display no correlation. In this situation, one can suggest several modes of post transcriptional regulation of YB-1 synthesis. Specifically, a high level of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA translation in the lungs explains a large amount of YB-1 along with a low content of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in this organ. A high level of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA in the testis lysate might suggest a large amount of the protein. However, it is not so, suggesting that the bulk of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA may be stored in the masked form for a future use. In the brain, the level of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA translation is also high, but the YB-1 amount is fairly low. Possibly, this is underlain by an enhanced YB-1 degradation in this organ.</p>
      <p>The developed here technique of YB-1 synthesis assessment allowed us to pioneer in finding the peculiarities of synthesis of endogenous YB-1 in the cell. Specifically, we report the dependence of YB-1 synthesis on the rate of cell division. As shown, the density-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation makes the rate of YB-1 synthesis much lower.</p>
      <p>Serum starvation that also retards cell division results in a lower amount of YB-1 in the cell. As to YB-1 synthesis, it decreases to a larger extent than the total protein synthesis. The release from the starvation-induced arrest of cell division is accompanied by a rapid and essential increase of the YB-1 synthesis rate followed by renewal of the YB-1 amount in the cell.</p>
      <p>The role of YB-1 in cell proliferation has been widely reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Feng1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Basaki1">[35]</xref>. The main conclusion was that the proliferation rate depended on the YB-1 amount in the cell. Our experiments are evidence that, in turn, YB-1 synthesis depends on the proliferation rate. It should be stressed that endogenous YB-1 itself cannot trigger cell division. It is an intermediate on the signaling pathway(s) responsible for cell division, and its artificially altered amount can only shift the equilibrium required for signal transduction.</p>
      <p>We have shown that the mTOR signaling pathway is one of the signaling cascades responsible for YB-1 synthesis regulation. Inhibition of the mTOR kinase by PP242 and the upstream kinase PI3K (by wortmannin) results in specific negative regulation of both endogenous YB-1 synthesis and translation of reporter constructs containing <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA 5′ UTR. Besides, YB-1 insensitivity to rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor affecting mostly phosphorylation of S6 kinase and, to a lower extent, phosphorylation of 4E-BP) shows that it is phosphorylation of 4E-BP, and hence, its eIF4E-binding activity that regulates translation of YB-1. Of interest, the Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126 had no effect on YB-1 synthesis. It is known that ERK activation causes, in particular, phosphorylation of eIF4E by kinase Mnk1, and hence, an increase in translation of some eIF4E-dependent templates. The fact that YB-1 synthesis remained unaffected by ERK inhibition (and hence, inhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation) suggests that the level of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA translation depends on the eIF4E/phospho-4E-BP ratio rather than on the amount and phosphorylation of eIF4E.</p>
      <p>The role of mTOR in regulation of translation of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA was supported by the results reported recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Hsieh1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052527-Thoreen1">[41]</xref>. Using ribosome profiling they showed that <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA was detected in the pool of mRNAs whose translation was suppressed with inhibited mTOR. These authors believed that inhibition of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA was induced by PRTE (Pyrimidine Rich Translational Element) or TOP-like elements of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA 5′ UTR. But this element was positioned at the beginning of the 171 nt-long 5′ UTR of human <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA, while our reporter construct contained a 5′UTR of rabbit mRNA which is shorter and lacks PRTE. However, <italic>luc</italic> mRNA with such a truncated 5′ UTR displayed sensitivity to inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway. Presumably, the sequence responsible for sensitivity to mTOR inhibition within the 5′ UTR, is closer to the coding region than PRTE. It is still to be refined what elements of the primary or secondary structure of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA 5′UTR are responsible for mTOR-dependent regulation of <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA translation.</p>

          <p>A simplified scheme of the mTOR signaling pathway. The basic mTOR substrates are 4E-BP (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein) and S6 kinase (p70S6K). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP results in its lower affinity for eIF4E, which makes the latter accessible for translation initiation. Activated S6 kinase phosphorylates a number of substrates (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), ribosomal protein S6, programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) - a tumor suppressor that binds to eIF4A, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) etc.), thereby contributing to activation of both initiation and elongation of translation. Inhibitors of mTOR kinase are rapamycin and PP242, the former predominantly inhibiting phosphorylation of p70S6K. The major mTOR activating pathway is the PI3K/Akt kinase cascade. Its inhibition with wortmannin affects, among others, mTOR kinase. Inhibition of Erk kinase with U0126 causes inhibition of Mnk-1, and hence, suppression of eIF4E phosphorylation, thereby decreasing translation of some eIF4E-sensitive mRNAs (here used as a control).</p>
