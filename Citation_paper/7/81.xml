        <p>To develop an effective therapeutic strategy for cardiac regeneration using bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), the primary mouse BM-MSCs (1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs) and 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs from β-galactosidase transgenic mice were respectively intramyocardially transplanted into the acute myocardial infarction (AMI) model of wild type mice. At the 6<sup>th</sup> week, animals/tissues from the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs group, the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs group, control group were examined. Our results revealed that, compared to the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs, the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs had better therapeutic effects in the mouse MI model. The 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs maintained greater differentiation potentials towards cardiomocytes or vascular endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is indicated by higher expressions of cardiomyocyte and vascular endothelial cell mature markers <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, we identified that 24 proteins were down-regulated and 3 proteins were up-regulated in the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs in comparison to the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs, using mass spectrometry following two-dimensional electrophoresis. Our data suggest that transplantation of the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs may be an effective therapeutic strategy for cardiac tissue regeneration following AMI, and altered protein expression profiles between the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs and 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs may account for the difference in their maintenance of stemness and their therapeutic effects following AMI.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a main presentation of ischemic heart disease, is one leading cause of death globally. Although pharmacologic intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting, which can restore the blood flow (reperfusion), keep viable myocardium working, these approaches cannot rescue dying myocardium or restore normal cardiac functions. Moreover, new therapeutic approaches are needed for patients under critical conditions suffering from small vessel diffuse lesions, who are unable to withstand coronary angioplasty and for whom medication is not effective. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an effective therapeutic approach to regenerating myocardium and restoring its normal contractile-relaxant function following AMI. For a long time, it was commonly accepted that cardiomyocytes, as terminally differentiated cell type, could not be regenerated. Recently, accumulated evidence indicates that cardiac muscles can be regenerated or repaired via a variety of ways including stem cell technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Murry1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To use stem cell technology for the treatment of AMI has been one of the hot areas in cardiovascular research. BM-MSCs are readily obtainable, safe, ethical, and an easy handling resource for tissue transplantation with a high proliferation/differentiation potential. It is low risk for immunorejection and pathogen transmission. It also has a stable genetic background, so that has been used as seeding cells in tissue engineering and stem cell therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Bianco1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Shiota1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Popov1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Aggarwal1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Pountos1">[6]</xref>. BM-MSCs are primary seeding cells of heart transplantation used for the treatment of AMI. Accumulated evidence indicates that the transplantation of BM-MSCs can effectively prevent ventricular remodeling, improve cardiac performance, and ameliorate the outcome of ST-elevated AMI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Strauer1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Airey1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Valiunas1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Lim1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Tang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Gnecchi1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Passaging <italic>in vitro</italic> has been a conventional approach to obtaining a large number of BM-MSCs as required by transplantation. However, during the sub-culture processing, BM-MSCs gradually lose their differentiation potency towards cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells, and this is likely to result in less satisfactory improvement in cardiac performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Pittenger1">[13]</xref>. Previous studies suggest that biological properties of BM-MSCs are not everlasting features and their proliferation and differentiation properties decline along with passaging process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Pittenger1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Kretlow1">[14]</xref>. How to obtain sufficient number of seeding cells, with a good quality of stem cell biological properties for transplantation, remains the center of stem cell therapy research.</p>
      <p>Although therapy based on BM-MSCs has been gradually introduced into clinics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Hipp1">[15]</xref>, their basic biological characteristics remain largely unknown. It is generally accepted that BM-MSCs are a highly adhesive fibroblast-like cell type. Our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Zhang1">[16]</xref> jointly with data from others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Boiret1">[17]</xref> indicate the existence of a population of non-adherent, small, round cells, with self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potential in adult bone marrow, and those cells are capable of forming CFU-Fs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Accordingly we have developed the “Pour-off” method to amplify the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSC.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that bone marrow milieu can preserve stem cell properties of BM-MSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Chen1">[18]</xref>. Main marrow components including hematopoietic cell population are present in primary culture of BM-MSCs, but those components are missing when BM-MSCs undergo repeat passaging on tissue culture plastic. This change accounts for major differences between primary BM-MSCs and repeat passage BM-MSCs in terms of culture conditions. It is likely that hematopoietic cells maintain the self-renewal and differentiation potency of the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs by releasing cytokines and growth factors. Therefore, depletion of hematopoietic cells may result in decline of differentiation potency of repeat passage BM-MSCs towards cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Presumably the “Pour-off” method not only can ensure to prepare sufficient numbers of BM-MSCs for the transplantation, but also can help to retain differentiation potency of BM-MSCs, possibly through the actions of hematopoietic cells, which are present in conditioned culture media. Therefore, we hypothesized that: i) the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs amplified using the “Pour-off” method would be superior to repeat passage BM-MSCs in terms of the potency of proliferation and differentiation, and paracrine effects, and ii) the transplantation of the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs would be superior to that of repeat passage BM-MSCs in terms of therapeutic effectiveness for AMI. In the present study, the primary mouse BM-MSCs (1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs) and 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs from β-galactosidase transgenic mice were respectively intramyocardially transplanted into AMI model of wild type mice. At the 6<sup>th</sup> week, animals/tissues from the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs group, the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs group, control group were examined. To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the differential therapeutic effects, we utilized <italic>in vitro</italic> culture systems and cellular/molecular and proteomics techniques. We examined the profiles of proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation potentials towards cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells of the 1<sup>st</sup> or the 5th passage BM-MSCs, and expressions of gene markers for pluripotent stem cells or tissue committed stem cells expressed by the two types of cells, and identified protein expression profiles between the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs and the 5th passage BM-MSCs.</p>

        <p>For immunohistochenmistry, the mice were anesthetized with 3% pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg) after 6 weeks following transplantation. Myocardial specimens were perfused with 100 ml normal sodium and then perfused and fixed with PLP solution. The 0.5 cm transverse sections of the short axis of the left ventricles below the artery ligation site were removed and embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-µm sections. Serial paraffin sections were deparaffinized, dehydrated, and, for antigen retrieval, steamed for 20 minutes in PBS (0.01 mM pH 7.4) followed by blocking of endogenous peroxidase (3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and preincubation with serum. Primary antibodies against β-galactosidase (Dako Cytomation, Denmark), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (R&amp;D, America), platelet endothelial cell adherence molecular (PECAM) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, America), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Dako Cytomation, Denmark), Troponin I (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Desmin (Thermo, America) were used. After washing steps, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody (biotinylated IgG; Sigma), washed again, and processed using the Vectastain ABC-HRP kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). The sections were then counterstained with Hematoxylin and mounted with Biomount medium. For immunofluorescence labeling procedures, corresponding affinity-purified Rhodamine (TRITC), Texas Red (TXRD) or FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Nuclei were labeled by DAPI (Sigma) and mounted with medium which prevents quenching of fluorescence (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). After immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining, images of the infarct border zone at the posterior left ventricles from a single section were digitally recorded using a rectangular template and three different fields at ×200 magnification. All images were taken with a Sony digital camera, and processed using Northern Eclipse image analysis software, version 5.0 (Empix Imaging, Inc., Mississauga, Canada). The immunopositive area or positive cell numbers from each section were averaged and expressed as the ultimate positive area or the number of positive cells per field.</p>

Animals were lightly sedated with ketamine (50 mg/kg) for each echocardiogram. Measurements were made by two independent observers unaware of the treatment condition, offline with Philips Qlabz. For analysis of left ventricular function, left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole (LVIDd), left ventricular internal diameter at end-systole (LVIDs), left ventricular end-diastolic volume(LVEDV) and left ventricular end-systole volume (LVESV) were measured at the anterior wall, from the short-axis view, just below the level of the papillary muscle.

        <p>The stained gels were scanned, and the Image Master 2D Platinum Software (Version 6.0; GE Healthcare, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) was used for spot detection, quantification, and comparative and statistical analyses, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Wang1">[23]</xref>. In each experiment, protein expression in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs and the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs were compared at baseline.

        <p>Differential silver-stained protein spots were excised, dehydrated in acetonitrile, and dried at room temperature. The proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT and 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> at 56°C for 1 h and alkylated in the dark with 55 mM iodoacetamide and 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> at room temperature for 45 min in situ. The gel pieces were then thoroughly washed with 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, 50% acetonitrile, and 100% acetonitrile in succession and were completely dried in a Speedvac. The dried gel pieces were reswollen with 2–3 µl of trypsin solution (trypsin at a concentration of 10 ng/µl in 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>). After incubation at 4°C for 30 min, the excess liquid was discarded, and the gel plugs were incubated at 37°C for 12 h. Finally, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to stop the digestion reaction.

        <p>Database Searches: Each acquired mass spectrum (m/z range, 700–4000; resolution, 15 000–20 000) was processed using the software Flex Analysis version 2.0 (Bruker Daltonics). The tryptic autodigestion ion peaks (842.51 and 1045.56 Da,) were used as internal standards to validate the external calibration procedure. Matrix and/or autoproteolytic trypsin fragments or known contaminants were removed. The resulting peptide mass lists were first used to search the Swiss-Prot 48.7 database (release 10/09/05; 204 086 sequences; 74,182,688 residues) for Homo sapiens (13,344 sequences) by using Mascot (version 2.1.03) in the automated mode. In cases where we were unable to obtain a confident result, the mass lists were used to further search the TrEMBL 31.7 database (release 10/09/05; 2,506,886 sequences; 805,901,253 residues) for Homo sapiens (58,416 sequences), which is a supplement to the Swiss-Prot database. The search conditions used were as described in previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Wang1">[23]</xref>. The peptide mass was compared with the theoretical peptide masses of all available proteins from a species. The search conditions used were as follows: 100 ppm for external calibration, one missed cleavage allowed, and modification of cysteines by iodoacetamide, methionine oxidation, and N-terminal pyroglutamylation as variable modifications. The minimal requirement for an identity assignment was 4 matching peptides, and we only considered mouse proteins.

        <title>Preparation and characterization of seeding cells for the transplantation</title>
        <p>We have showed previously that not only total BMCs can give rise to colony-forming units-fibroblasts (CFU-fs), but also the non-adherent fraction (‘Pour-off’ NA-BMCs), indicating the presence of ‘non-adherent’ mesenchymal stem cells (NA-MSCs) in rat bone marrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Zhang1">[16]</xref>. First of all, in this study, we examined the clonogenic ability of mouse BMCs using the ‘Pour-off’ method. In agreement with the results obtained from the rat cells, our results showed that both total mouse BMCs and NA-BMCs can give rise to CFU-fs. Also the efficiency of CFU-fs in PO2, PO3, PO4, and PO5 increased 14%, 84%, 161% and 172%, respectively, following the treatment of cells with 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (10<sup>−8</sup> M) in mouse BMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021005-g002">Figures 2A and B</xref>). These results suggest that using of the “Pour-off” method on cultures can maximize the quantity of BM-MSCs, which can be used as seeding cells for tissue transplantations, from limited numbers of adult mouse BMCs. Pooled BM-MSCs from the primary total and PO1–5 BMC cultures were subcultured for 5 passages. The β-gal transgenic mouse-derived BM-MSCs from both the 1st pour off cultures and the 5<sup>th</sup> passaged cultures, which were positive for β-gal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021005-g002">Figures 2C</xref>) as demonstrated by LacZ cytochemical staining, were used as donor cells for the transplantation.</p>

        <p>To compare potential differences between the 1<sup>st</sup> and passaged BM-MSCs, the β-gal transgenic mouse-derived BM-MSCs from the 1<sup>st</sup> pour-off cultures (the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSC) and the 5<sup>th</sup> passaged cultures (the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSC) were further characterized by comparison of expression levels of markers of pluripotent stem cells, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), protein expression profile, and differentiation potential into cardiomyocytes or vascular endothelial cells. Our results showed that mRNA levels of markers for pluripotent stem cells (OCT-4, CXCR4, LIF-R, Dppa3, Nanog, MET-R, Rex-1 and RIF-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021005-g002">Figures 2D–K</xref>), for cardiac-committed stem cells (Csx and GATA-4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021005-g002">Figures 2L, M</xref>) or for vascular endothelial-committed stem cells (VE-Cadherin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021005-g002">Figures 2N</xref>) in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs were significantly higher than those in the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs. These results indicate that the stemness maintenance of the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs is superior to that of the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs. Our results also showed that mRNA levels of MT1-MMP, MMP-2 and MMP-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021005-g002">Figures 2O–Q</xref>) in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs were higher than those in the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs.

        <p>The comparison of protein expression profile was performed by 2-D electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021005-g003">Figures 3A</xref>) and mass spectrometric analysis. Our results showed that 27 protein spots were identified to be differentially expressed by the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs for at least 5 times in comparison to the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs. Among those proteins, 24 proteins were down-regulated and 3 proteins were up-regulated in the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs. Some proteins among them have been known to be involved in regulating cellular functions of stem cells, which include adhesion, homing, engraftment, angiogenesis, anti-apoptosis, protecting cells from oxidative stress, and modulating inflammatory and immune responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021005.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p>

Also following the treatment of 5′-azacytidine, mRNA levels of desmin were downregulated while mRNA levels of troponin I were upregulated either in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs or in the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs, and mRNA levels of MHC-β was upregulated in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs while they remained unchanged in the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021005-g003">Figures 3B–D</xref>). mRNA levels of either VEGF or its receptors, KDR and FLT-1, in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs were higher than those in the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs in the absence or presence of VEGF.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The transplantation of stem cells is believed to be a promising approach to treatment of ischemic heart diseases, which cannot be cured by medication or surgical interventions. BM-MSCs are highly self-renewable multipotent stem cells and have been widely used in therapeutic transplantation and tissue engineering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Bianco1">[2]</xref>. However, BM-MSCs are not immortal and their capacities of proliferation and differentiation are known to be impaired through the repeated passaging process <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Stolzing1">[26]</xref>. Repeated passaging, a conventional approach to amplify BM-MSCs for sufficient numbers required for a successful transplantation, is known to compromise the stem cell biological characteristics of BM-MSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Zhang1">[16]</xref>. Unsatisfactory therapeutic effect is likely to be attributable to the utilization of repeated passaging BM-MSCs, which only have an impaired regeneration capacity for either cardiac muscles or vascular tissues, as seeding cells for heart transplantation following acute MI. Therefore it is imperative to seek a population of BM-MSCs which have fine stem cell biological characteristics, and can be amplified extensively, for satisfactory therapeutic effect following acute MI. BM-MSCs are generally regarded as a highly adhesive fibroblast-like cell type. However, our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Zhang1">[16]</xref>, in agreement with other reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Boiret1">[17]</xref>, have indicated the existence of a population of non-adherent and round cells with self-renewal and differentiation potency towards multiple tissues, and these cells are also capable of forming CFU-Fs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Accordingly, we have developed the “Pour-off” method to amplify primary BM-MSC and have demonstrated that the treatment of the cells with 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> enhances the formation of CFU-Fs. In this study, we prepared primary BM-MSCs as seeding cells for the transplantation using the “Pour-off” culture method. In comparison to the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs, the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs had better therapeutic effects in the mouse MI model in that they were readily being engrafted into the scarred myocardium and border zone, proliferating gradually <italic>in situ</italic>, forming mature vessels and cardiomocytes, promoting angiopoiesis, reversing wall thinning in scarred areas and improving cardiac functions. Those results indicated that transplantation of the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs prepared using the “Pour-off” culture method has a better therapeutic effect on acute MI than that of repeated passage BM-MSCs.</p>
      <p>β-galactosidase (β-gal) encoded by the bacterial gene <italic>lacZ</italic> is a very effective molecular marker to trace the migration, distribution, proliferation, and differentiation of donor cells <italic>in vivo</italic> for their roles in tissue repair following injury. In this study, we used BM-MSCs derived from β-galactosidase transgenic mice as donor cells for intramyocardial transplantation in male C57BL/6J wild type mice following acute MI. We also performed histochemical staining for LacZ and immunohistochemical staining for β-gal to show the migration/distribution and differentiation of the donor cells. Our results indicated that at the 6<sup>th</sup> week following the immediate local transplantation of β-gal<sup>+</sup> BM-MSCs, β-gal<sup>+</sup> cells were seen at infarct foci, and some of the cells expressed markers of mature cardiomyocytes. It has been shown that the peak of inflammatory phase occurs at days 1∼3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Strauer2">[27]</xref>, and survival of transplanted BM-MSC was likely to be compromised if the cells were transplanted during this period. It is known that muscular vasculatures are formed at ∼20 days following MI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Strauer2">[27]</xref>. The migration of transplanted BM-MSC was likely to be compromised if the cells were transplanted during this stage. Moreover levels of some growth factors such as VEGF reach a peak at day 7 following MI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Strauer2">[27]</xref>, so the best time points for the transplantation of BM-MSC are likely to be between day 7 and day 14 following MI to reverse left ventricular remodeling. Although certain therapeutic effects were demonstrated in this study by immediate transplantation of BM-BMCs, following acute MI, whether transplantation of BM-MSCs between day 7 and day 14 following MI has a better therapeutic effect remains to be examined.</p>
      <p>Recently, the existence of a population of small embryonic-like CXCR4-SSEA-Oct4<sup>+</sup> stem cells expressing markers for embryonic stem cells and tissue-committed progenitor cells in adult bone marrow has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Kucia1">[28]</xref>. The CXCR4-SSEA-Oct4<sup>+</sup> stem cells are self-renewal proliferating cells and play an active role in tissue repair following MI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Dawn1">[29]</xref>. This suggests the existence of very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) in adult bone marrow. However, the scarcity of CXCR4-SSEA-Oct4<sup>+</sup> stem cells and the lack of an effective amplification method put a limit on its clinical application. In this study, we found that BM-MSCs <italic>in vitro</italic> express markers for embryonic stem cells, cardiac-committed stem cells, or vascular endothelial-committed stem cells. Gene expression levels of the stem cell markers by the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs are significantly higher than those expressed by the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs, and expressions of some of those markers by the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs are higher than those by total BMCs. This implies amplification of <italic>VSELs</italic> in the process of amplifying the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs and differentiation potency towards cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Interestingly Oct4, a key transcription factor in the induction of somatic cell towards pluripotent stem cells, is expressed at higher levels in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs, in comparison to the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs. PKM2 is known to upregulate transcription levels of Oct4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Pesce1">[30]</xref>. Our results from MS analysis following 2-DE indicated that the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs express PKM2 at a higher level in comparison to the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs. This could be the reason why the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs express higher levels of Oct4. Furthermore, levels of either Csx or GATA-4 expressed by the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs were higher than those by the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs. Likewise, in this study, our results indicate that the differentiation capacities of the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs towards either cardiomyocytes or vascular endothelial cells is superior to those of the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Undoubtedly stem cell biological characteristics of donor/seeding cells is a key factor for improving therapeutic effect of BM-MSCs transplantation following acute MI.</p>
      <p>Recent studies suggest that the transplantation of BM-MSCs may not only directly induce neovasculature formation but also enhance indirectly neovasculature formation via autocrine factors such as VEGF and cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Li1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Jo1">[32]</xref>. It has been shown that the transplantation of BM-MSCs following MI results in the elevation of VEGF levels for 2 months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Tang1">[11]</xref>. In agreement with those studies, our results indicate that the transplantation of BM-MSCs enhances neovasculature formation in MI areas and infarct border zones. More interestingly, our results from MS analysis following 2-D electrophoresis indicated that the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs express higher levels of annexin A3, annexin A2, or hn RNP K in comparison to the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs. Those three proteins are known to enhance neovasculature formation via paracrine mechanisms. Annexin A3, a newly discovered pro-angiogenic factor, can induce VEGF via the HIF pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Park1">[33]</xref>. Annexin A2 can regulate neoangiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Ling1">[34]</xref>, and hn RNP K can upregulate VEGF mRNA level via stimulating angiotensin II. Additionally it has been shown that newly regenerated cardiomyocytes are capable of enhancing neovasculature formation via secreting VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Feliers1">[35]</xref>. In this study, our results indicate that the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs have greater differentiation potency towards cardiomyocytes in comparison to the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs, therefore it is likely that the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs have more profound pro-angiogenic effect than the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs do. Differences between the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs and the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs in the two aspects mentioned above may explain why more VEGF positive reactions are present in the infarct areas and border zones in the MI+1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs group than those in the MI+5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs group.</p>
      <p>SDF-1/CXCR4 axis seems particularly important for the homing, chemotaxis, engraftment, and retention of stem/muscle progenitor cells within ischemic myocardium. SDF-1 released from the ischemic myocardium improves cardiac performance through its effects on pro-angiogenesis, cardio-protective, anti-apoptotic, and wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Imanishi1">[36]</xref>. Moreover, SDF-1 is a potent chemoattractant for cells expressing CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Shiota1">[3]</xref>. It is evident that bone marrow and skeletal muscles contain a small population of cells positive for CXCR4 antigen and expressing genes specific for early muscle-committed stem/progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Shiota1">[3]</xref>. In this study, we found that the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs expressed CXCR4 at obviously higher levels in comparison to the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs, suggesting that primary BM-MSCs might have more motility in response to chemoattractants such as SDF-1. Previous studies have shown that the overexpression of CXCR4 in BM-MSCs has been correlated to upregulated gene expressions of MMPs, such as MT1-MMP and MMP-9, under hypoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Zhang2">[37]</xref>. MMPs are known to play an important role in cell migrations. In this study, we found that mRNA levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs are higher than those in the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs, and this may be attributable to high levels of CXCR4 levels in the primary BM-MSCs. Meanwhile, our results from MS analysis following 2-DE indicated that the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs express higher levels of TRAP1, which is known to induce MMP-9 expression in cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Masuda1">[38]</xref>, in comparison to the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs. Previous studies suggest that high levels of MMPs may contribute to softening the collagenous areas, enhancing the ability of CXCR4<sup>+</sup>-MSCs to cross the reconstituted basement membrane for the generation of new myocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Zhang2">[37]</xref>. Additionally annexin A2, which is highly expressed in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs and is known to have an effect on fibrinolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Ling1">[34]</xref>, may have a role in the reorganization of collagen fibril in the MI areas and border zones. Furthermore, annexin A2 together with Lgals, another protein highly expressed in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs, may both regulate the adhesion, homing, migration, and engraftment of BM-MSCs following the transplantation.</p>
      <p>In this study, our data of immunohistochemical staining for PCNA showed that a number of PCNA-positive cells in MI areas and infarct border zones in the MI+1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs group was significantly greater than that in the MI+5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs group in MI areas and border zones. This indicates a strong amplification potential of the primary BM-MSCs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Relevantly our data of MS analysis following 2-DE, showed mcm7, a cell proliferation-promoting protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-You1">[39]</xref>, is highly expressed by the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs. In contrast, the isoform 2 of src kinase-associated phosphoprotein, a cell proliferation-inhibiting protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Menasche1">[40]</xref>, is upregulated in the 5<sup>th</sup> passage BM-MSCs.</p>
      <p>In this study, we found that, in comparison to the transplantation of the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs, the transplantation of the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs has more evident anti-apopotsis effect in MI areas and border zones. Multiple mechanisms may underlie this difference. First of all, as shown by MS analysis following 2-DE, lgals, a protein known to have anti-apoptotic effect through enhancing p-AKT levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Saegusa1">[41]</xref>, is highly expressed in the primary BM-MSCs. p-Akt may contribute to the protection of ischemic myocardium, possibly through enhanced expression of VEGF, as well as by decreasing ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Lim1">[10]</xref>. Secondly, as identified by MS analysis following 2-DE, trap1, a protein known to have an important role in anti-apoptosis through suppressing the formation of ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Saegusa1">[41]</xref>, is highly expressed in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs. Meanwhile, as identified by MS analysis following 2-DE, catalase and stip1 are highly expressed in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs, and these two proteins may rescues cells from apoptosis by protecting cells against oxidative stress by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Liang1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Shih1">[43]</xref>. Furthermore, efhd2, a protein known to contribute to BCR-induced apoptosis by enhancing BCR signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021005-Avramidou1">[44]</xref>, is highly expressed in the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs. Ultimately, as shown by our immunoblotting results, levels of either total caspase3 or its active form, which play a critical role in the execution of apoptosis, is down-regulated in the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs transplanted heart more obviously than the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs transplanted heart. This implies anti-apoptotic property of the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs is superior to that of the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs. Our TUNEL assay results support this possibility. Additionally, p-STAT5 level in lysate samples prepared from primary BM-MSCs transplanted hearts was higher than that in those prepared from the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs transplanted hearts, raising the possibility that the activation of the STAT5 pathway may inhibit caspase-3-mediated apoptosis in the primary BM-MSCs. To sum up, in comparison to the transplantation of the 5th passage BM-MSCs, the transplantation of the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs more effectively leads to the efficient activation of Akt/STAT5 pathway. This inhibits caspase-3-mediated apoptosis and efficient inhibition of ROS formation, which protects cardiomyocytes from ischemic injury resulted from oxidative stress. It may also play a better role in preventing post-MI ventricular remodeling, through assisting viable ventricular cardiomyocytes to escape from the immune reaction induced by BCR, and /or alleviating inflammation in the MI areas and border zones.</p>
      <p>In summary, in the present study, a novel “Pour-off” method was used to obtain sufficient numbers of 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs with a good stem cell quality. Following intramyocardial transplantion into the mouse MI model, in comparison to the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs, the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs were more capable of rapidly migrating, proliferating <italic>in situ</italic>, and differentiating into mature vascular endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. Meanwhile, undifferentiated 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs may contribute to the infarct-healing process and to improving post-MI cardiac performance through its paracrine effects on promoting cell migration, homing, and proliferation and neovasculature formation, and preventing apoptosis in the MI areas and border zones. Therefore, using the 1<sup>st</sup> BM-MSCs obtained using the “Pour-off” method as seeding cells for intramyocardial transplantation following acute MI in mice has a better therapeutic effect than using the 5<sup>th</sup> BM-MSCs obtained from conventional repeated passaging.</p>
