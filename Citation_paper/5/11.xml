We surveyed residues of the quinolones enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics (amoxicillin and oxytetracycline) in nestling griffon <italic>Gyps fulvus</italic>, cinereous <italic>Aegypius monachus</italic> and Egyptian <italic>Neophron percnopterus</italic> vultures in central Spain. We found high concentrations of antibiotics in the plasma of many nestling cinereous (57%) and Egyptian (40%) vultures. Enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were also found in liver samples of all dead cinereous vultures. This is the first report of antibiotic residues in wildlife. We also provide evidence of a direct association between antibiotic residues, primarily quinolones, and severe disease due to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Our results indicate that, by damaging the liver and kidney and through the acquisition and proliferation of pathogens associated with the depletion of lymphoid organs, continuous exposure to antibiotics could increase mortality rates, at least in cinereous vultures. If antibiotics ingested with livestock carrion are clearly implicated in the decline of the vultures in central Spain then it should be considered a primary concern for conservation of their populations.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibiotics (formally antimicrobials) are one of the biomedical revolutions of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

In this study we demonstrated residues of four different antibiotics in three species of wild birds. To our knowledge, this is the first report of circulating antibiotic residues in wildlife. This striking finding furthers our knowledge about the impact of human activities on environmental health through the potential detrimental effects of circulating antibiotics on wildlife, including the selection and dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria.</p><p>Avian scavengers ingested antibiotics present in the livestock carrion upon which they feed. Veterinary antibiotics are used in large, although regionally variable quantities throughout the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Aarestrup1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Sarmah1">[16]</xref>. Therefore, the potential impact of antibiotic residues on scavenging wildlife may be widespread but the severity is likely to vary with the features of livestock operations and practices of eliminating livestock residues in different regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Blanco1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Blanco2">[9]</xref>. The use of different antibiotics to treat livestock in the study area and their variable kinetics may explain their varying presence in each vulture species. Both amoxicillin and oxytetracycline were displaced by quinolones as the drugs of choice alone or with other antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-VanBambeke1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-GarcaRey1">[18]</xref>, which may explain their high presence and concentrations. The detection of quinolones with other antibiotics in several samples may indicate their combined use and the metabolic transformation of enrofloxacin to ciprofloxacin in livestock and vultures. Differing prevalences and concentrations of antibiotics in the three vulture species may reflect their different feeding habits and physiology, especially the pH of the digestive tract. Griffon vultures evolved as social consumers of entire corpses of large herbivores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Donzar1">[19]</xref>, which has been argued to be associated with the evolution of a very acidic gastric pH (between 1 and 2) to minimise infection by pathogens from rotten meat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Houston1">[20]</xref>. Cinereous and Egyptian vultures evolved as scavengers and opportunistic predators of small vertebrates, and preferentially feed upon small fragments of livestock carcasses, especially tendons, skin and viscera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Donzar1">[19]</xref> which tend to concentrate these antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Veterinary1">[21]</xref>. The differing ecological and evolutionary strategies for carrion exploitation may explain the different impacts of antibiotics on the health of griffon <italic>vs.</italic> cinereous and Egyptian vultures. Griffon vultures would degrade more antibiotics and pathogens with such a highly acidic gastric pH. This may explain the lower prevalence of antibiotics and pathogens despite the species' greater dependence on livestock carrion. The less acidic gastric pH of cinereous and Egyptian vultures may make them more susceptible to the direct effects of ingested antibiotics despite their higher dependence on wild prey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Donzar1">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The mean quinolone concentrations found in vulture plasma may equal that expected in birds treated with a therapeutic dose 24–48 h before testing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Prescott1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Lathers1">[24]</xref>. Such high antibiotic concentrations in vultures may indicate an intensive use of these drugs in farming operations in the study area. Antibiotic ingestion is likely to vary with the frequency of use of carrion from different livestock species or wild prey by parental vultures and the concentrations of antibiotics in different livestock carcasses. Nestling vultures may be fed every several days and antibiotics may be metabolised and excreted by birds over a similar time period. This may explain the lack of antibiotics in several nestlings despite the consumption of livestock carrion by all individuals.</p><p>The most striking result of this study was the clear association between antibiotic residues, especially quinolones, and disease in the three vulture species. Potential negative health effects of direct antibiotic ingestion with livestock meat include immunosuppression, toxicity, allergy and bacterial flora alteration which may temporarily reduce host resistance to pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Levy1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Brown1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Lathers1">[24]</xref>. The presumably discontinuous ingestion of different antibiotics at different concentrations may lead to sideeffects similar to health problems resulting from the misuse of antibiotics in humans and domestic animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Levy1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Prescott1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Lathers1">[24]</xref>. For instance, severe infections with <italic>C. albicans</italic> or <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> may be important causes of morbidity and mortality among individuals ingesting antibiotics which enhance the invasiveness of these and other pathogens by altering the normal flora and by depressing the host defences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Levy1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Lathers1">[24]</xref>.</p><p>The impact of antibiotics on the health of cinereous vultures was clearly illustrated by post-mortem findings and histopathology of both liver and kidney samples. All liver samples from dead cinereous vultures contained both enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Although there is no detailed information about the pathology caused by antibiotics in birds, lesions and tissue damage in the liver and kidney are consistent with the expected direct toxic effects of antibiotics in these organs in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Montagnac1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Bataille1">[28]</xref>, especially because in birds they concentrate these drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Veterinary1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Prescott1">[22]</xref>.

This effect may be associated with the recent steady decline of vulture populations in the study area, especially of cinereous and Egyptian vultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Tella1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001444-Blanco3">[29]</xref>. Therefore, the ingestion of antibiotics in livestock carrion represents a major concern for the conservation of these species. Antibiotic residues in meat in livestock dumps used by scavengers should be regulated to avoid damaging the health and conservation of vultures. The intensive use of antibiotics worldwide and their presence in wild birds have global implications for conservation and in generating and spreading resistant pathogens throughout the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fieldwork</title><p>We sampled nestlings of the three vulture species breeding in central Spain (primarily in Segovia Province) from 2003 to 2005.

Briefly, for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, plasma samples (300 µl) were added with an internal standard (75 µl ofloxacin), mixed and shaken with chloroform (4.5 ml). After centrifugation the organic phase was collected and dried under nitrogen. The extracted sampled was injected directly into the HPLC (UV) apparatus (Spectra System AS1000 Autosampler, Thermo Separation Products, Florida USA). These antibiotics were detected using ultraviolet spectrophotometry at 279 nm. The limits of quantification of both molecules were 0.005 µg/ml and the method was linear up to 30 mg/L. The mean percentage recoveries of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were 93% and 90%, respectively. The inter- and intra-assay reproducibility was below 4%.</p><p>Liver samples used to determine quinolone residues were homogenised in methanol and centrifuged for pellet debris. Three millilitres of the supernatant were then passed through a solid phase extraction cartridge. Elution was concentrated to a volume of 1 ml. Quinolone concentrations were determined using the same methodology as for plasma samples. The recovery, limit of detection, accuracy and precision of this method were evaluated at concentrations from 0.025 to 250 µg/g. The method was validated and shown to be linear in the range of 0.01–50 µg/g. Spike recoveries for liver prepared at 4 spiking levels ranged from 81% to 98%. The coefficient of variation for recovery as a measure of relative variability was between 3% and 8% and the relative standard deviation was &lt;11%. The limits of quantification were 0.1 µg/g for enrofloxacin and 0.25 µg/g for ciprofloxacin.</p><p>For amoxicillin determination, 50 µl of plasma were mixed with 50 µl of perchloric acid using a vortex mixer and then centrifuged to precipitate plasma proteins. The clear supernatant was then injected into the HPLC. Amoxicillin was eluted with a mobile phase consisting of 6% methanol plus phosphate buffer with pH adjusted to 3.2. The concentration of amoxicillin was scanned at a wavelength of 227 nm, and the injection volume was 20 µl. The limit of quantification was 0.05 µg/ml in plasma. The absolute recovery of amoxicillin was 93%. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 2% and 3%, respectively.</p><p>To determine oxytetracycline concentrations, 9.5g of Mueller-Hinton medium were dissolved in 250 ml of distilled water and autoclaved at 121°C for at least 15 minutes. The solution was cooled to 50°C in a water bath and 0.4 ml of spore solution (1 ml of <italic>B. cereus</italic> spores in 50 ml sterile saline) was added. After the agar solidified 90 µl wells were cut into the bioassay plates. Plasma samples were deproteinised by adding 20 µl of a 30% trichloroacetic acid solution to 40 µl of plasma. The mixture was gently vortexed and centrifuged and the supernatant was assayed. Ninety microlitres of standards, controls and samples were pipetted into duplicate wells in the bioassay plates. Assay plates were incubated at room temperature overnight and the zones of inhibition were measured in micrometres using electronic digital callipers. The plasma concentration was calculated from a standard curve. The limit of quantification was 0.05 µl/ml.
