<abstract>
<p>CCR5, a coreceptor for HIV-1 entry, is a major target for drug and genetic intervention against HIV-1. Genetic intervention strategies have knocked down CCR5 expression levels by shRNA or disrupted the CCR5 gene using zinc finger nucleases (ZFN) or Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN). In the present study, we silenced <italic>CCR5</italic> via CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) and single guided RNAs (sgRNAs). We constructed lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and CCR5 sgRNAs. We show that a single round transduction of lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and CCR5 sgRNAs into HIV-1 susceptible human CD4<sup>+</sup> cells yields high frequencies of <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption. <italic>CCR5</italic> gene-disrupted cells are not only resistant to R5-tropic HIV-1, including transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 isolates, but also have selective advantage over <italic>CCR5</italic> gene-undisrupted cells during R5-tropic HIV-1 infection. Importantly, using T7 endonuclease I assay we did not detect genome mutations at potential off-target sites that are highly homologous to these CCR5 sgRNAs in stably transduced cells even at 84 days post transduction. Thus we conclude that silencing of <italic>CCR5</italic> via Cas9 and CCR5-specific sgRNAs could be a viable alternative strategy for engineering resistance against HIV-1.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Entry of HIV-1 into human CD4 T cells is initiated with the binding of the viral envelope protein gp120 to the CD4 receptor on the cell surface. Subsequently, a conformational change in gp120 allows its interaction with a coreceptor, CCR5 or CXCR4. Coreceptor binding activates gp41, enabling it to mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes and the release of the viral core into the cytoplasm. Depending on coreceptor usage, HIV-1 variants are classified as being CCR5 (R5), CXCR4 (X4), or dual-tropic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Ray1">[1]</xref>. For reasons that are still not completely understood, HIV-1 founder viruses transmitted across mucosal surface by sexual contact, by maternal-infant exposure, and by percutaneous inoculation are all R5 viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Shaw1">[2]</xref>. Furthermore, individuals with a homozygous CCR5Δ32 deletion are highly resistant to HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Dean1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Samson1">[5]</xref>. As a result, CCR5 has been one of major targets for drug and genetic intervention against HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Nazari1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Initially, genetic intervention focused on phenotypic knock-down of CCR5 expression levels using intracellular antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Swan1">[7]</xref>, transdominant mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Chelli1">[8]</xref>, ribozymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Akkina1">[9]</xref> and siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Akkina1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-DiGiusto1">[10]</xref>. More recently, disruption of CCR5 at the genomic level has been studied using zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Perez1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Maier1">[14]</xref> and TALE nuclease (TALEN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Mussolino1">[15]</xref>. <italic>CCR5</italic> disruption was obtained following a single round of transduction with the adenovirus vectors expressing CCR5-ZFN or electroporation of a plasmid DNA expressing CCR5-ZFN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Perez1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Holt1">[13]</xref>. When CCR5-ZFN-transduced cells were infected <italic>in vitro</italic> with R5-tropic HIV-1 isolates, a two-fold enrichment of the <italic>CCR5</italic>-modified cells was observed at the end of the culture period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Perez1">[11]</xref>. Moreover, a significant increase of <italic>CCR5</italic>-modified cells and lower plasma viremia were observed in HIV-1 infected NOG mice engrafted with CCR5-ZFN-transduced T cells but not NOG mice engrafted with mock-transduced T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Perez1">[11]</xref>. Currently CCR5-ZFN-modified, <italic>ex vivo</italic> expanded autologous T cells are in Phase I clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-DiGiusto1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Tebas1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Bacterial and archaeal CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) systems rely on CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) in complex with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to direct degradation of complementary sequences present within invading viral and plasmid DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Makarova1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Sampson1">[18]</xref>. In <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of the <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> type II CRISPR system, single guide RNAs (sgRNA, i.e. crRNA-tracrRNA fusion chimeras) are sufficient to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to specifically cleave target DNA sequences matching the crRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Jinek1">[19]</xref>. This two-component system enables efficient genome editing in eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Cong1">[20]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Maggio1">[23]</xref> and even in model organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Cong1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Chang1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Yu1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the two-component sgRNA/Cas9 system has many advantages, such as ease of design and construction, low cost, possibility for highly multicomplexed modifications and efficient site-specific targeting, whether this system could become a viable alternative to ZFN and TALEN in genotypic disruption of <italic>CCR5</italic> depends on its efficiency and target sequence specificity. Recently, Cho <italic>et al.</italic> showed high frequencies of indels within <italic>CCR5</italic> of the K562 cell line co-transfected with DNA plasmids encoding Cas9 and 2 of 28 CCR5 sgRNAs, but no indels at any of potential off-target sites to these 2 CCR5 sgRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Cho1">[32]</xref>. However, when additional 9 CCR5 sgRNAs were tested, off-target mutations at <italic>CCR2</italic> sequences that bear one nucleotide mismatch to 6 CCR5 sgRNAs were detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Cho2">[33]</xref>. Cradick <italic>et al.</italic> showed that although high frequencies of indels occurred within <italic>CCR5</italic> in 293 cells co-transfected with DNA plasmids encoding Cas9 and 5 different CCR5 sgRNAs, off-target indels at <italic>CCR2</italic> gene were detected in cells transduced with just 2 of 5 CCR5 sgRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Cradick1">[34]</xref>. More recently, Ye <italic>et al</italic>. combined TALENs or sgRNA-Cas9 with piggyBac technology to generate CCR5Δ32 deletion mutant in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). They then differentiated the modified iPSCs into monocytes/macrophages and demonstrated that these cells were resistant to HIV-1 challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Ye1">[35]</xref>. Although these studies showed that <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption can be generated in 293 and K562 cells and iPSCs and modified iPSCs, when differentiated into monocytes/macrophages, were resistant to HIV-1 challenge, the efficiency and the specificity of individual sgRNAs that target different CCR5 sequence segments in human CD4 T cells, the major cell targets for HIV-1, remain to be carefully evaluated.</p>
<p>In the present study, we examined <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption using lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and CCR5 sgRNAs. Here we report that a single round co-transduction of these lentiviral vectors into HIV-1 susceptible TZM.bl and CEMss-CCR5 cells results in high frequencies of human <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption. <italic>CCR5</italic>-modified cells not only are resistant to infection by R5-tropic HIV-1 including transmitted founder (T/F) viruses, but also have a selective advantage over cells carrying wild type <italic>CCR5</italic> alleles during R5-tropic HIV-1 infection. Importantly, using T7 endonuclease I assay we did not detect indels at 12 potential off-target sites that are highly homologous to these CCR5 sgRNAs even at 84 days post transduction. Finally, we showed that a single round transduction of a single lentiviral vector expressing both CCR5 sgRNA and Cas9 also efficiently disrupts <italic>CCR5</italic> gene in CEMss-CCR5 cells. Thus, we conclude that <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption using lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and specific CCR5 sgRNAs may be a viable alternative genetic intervention strategy against HIV-1.</p>

<title>Lentiviral vectors expressing the Cas9 and sgRNAs efficiently disrupt CCR5</title>
<p>To disrupt <italic>CCR5</italic> in HIV-1 susceptible CD4<sup>+</sup> cells we constructed a third generation lentiviral vector to express: 1) a Cas9-HA-NLS fusion protein driven by an internal PGK promoter; or 2) one of three sgRNAs to CCR5 (designated as CR1, CR2 and CR3), or a sgRNA to GFP (designated as GF1) driven by a RNA polymerase III U6 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115987.s001">S1 Fig</xref>.). The HA-tag was to facilitate detection and the NLS (nuclear localization signal) was to target the Cas9 protein to the nucleus. The lentiviral vector expressing Cas9-HA-NLS fusion protein was co-transduced into the HIV-1-susceptible cell line TZM.bl with the vectors expressing sgRNA CR1, CR2, CR3 or GF1 as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Wen1">[37]</xref>. Seven days after the transduction, the levels of CCR5 expression on the surface of the transduced TZM.bl cells were determined by staining with fluorescent anti-CCR5 (Becton Dickinson) or isotype-control antibody (eBioscience) followed by FACS analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> shows that 10.8%, 67.7% and 36.7% of TZM.bl cells co-transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9-HA-NLS fusion protein and sgRNAs CR1, CR2 or CR3, respectively, were negative for CCR5 surface expression. In contrast, no reduction of CCR5 expression was observed in cells co-transduced with vectors expressing the Cas9-HA-NLS and GF1 control. FSC and SSC analysis shows that 75.8 to 81.3% of TZM.bl cells transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9-HA-NLS fusion protein and sgRNAs CR1, CR2, CR3 or GF1 were live cells, which was slightly lower than mock-transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>CCR5<sup>-</sup>/CR2 and CCR5<sup>+</sup>/GF1 cells were then infected with either X4-tropic HIV-1 Bru-3 or R5-tropic HIV-1 Bru-Yu2. After the challenge, cells and culture supernatants were collected every 3 days and replenished with fresh medium for a total of 21 days. As measured by HIV-1 gag p24 in the culture supernatants, similar viral replication was observed when CCR5<sup>-</sup>/CR2 and CCR5<sup>+</sup>/GF1 cells were infected with X4-tropic HIV-1 Bru3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, a significant reduction in HIV-1 replication was found in CCR5<sup>-</sup>/CR2 cells as compared to CCR5<sup>+</sup>/GF1 cells when cells were infected with the R5-tropic HIV-1 Bru-Yu2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>To test whether <italic>CCR5</italic> gene-disrupted cells had a selective advantage over CCR5 expressing cells during R5-tropic HIV-1 infection, we mixed CCR5<sup>-</sup>/CR2 and mock-transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells at 1∶9 ratio and then challenged cell mixture with either X4-tropic HIV-1 Bru-3 or R5-tropic HIV-1 Bru-Yu2. After the challenge, cells and culture supernatants were collected every 3 days and replenished with fresh medium for a total of 18 days. At day 6 and 18 post-infection, portions of the cultured cells were stained with anti-CCR5 and anti-CD4 antibodies followed by FACS analysis, and genomic DNA were extracted from another portion of cells and subjected to T7 endonuclease I assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g006">Fig. 6C</xref> shows that the 1∶9 ratio of CCR5<sup>-</sup> and CCR5<sup>+</sup> cells at both day 6 and 18 post-infection with the X4-tropic HIV-1 Bru3 was maintained (middle panel), similar to uninfected cell mixture (left panel), although infection resulted in down regulation of CD4. By contrast, in the cell mixture infected with R5-tropic HIV-1 Bru-Yu2, the ratio of CCR5<sup>-</sup> and CCR5<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly altered. At the 6 days post-infection the ratio of CCR5<sup>-</sup> and CCR5<sup>+</sup> cells became 4∶6 (upper/right panel) and at the 18 days post-infection the ratio became 9∶1 (lower/right panel). Similar results were also found when we analyzed the ratios of cleaved versus uncleaved CCR5 bands at days 6 and 18 post-infection in the cell mixtures infected with X4-tropic HIV-1 Bru3 or R5-tropic HIV-1 Bru-Yu2 using T7 endonuclease I assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). Thus, taken together we concluded that <italic>CCR5</italic> gene-disrupted cells are resistant to R5 viruses and exhibit a selective survival advantage during R5 HIV-1 infection.</p>

<title>High efficiency of CCR5 gene disruption in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells via a single lentiviral vector expressing both Cas9 and CR2</title>
<p>Having demonstrated that co-transducing CEMss-CCR5 with two individual lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and CR2 efficiently disrupt <italic>CCR5</italic> gene, we next constructed a single lentiviral transfer vector expressing both CR2 and Cas9 along with EGFP reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). In this single transfer vector CR2 was driven by U6 promoter and Cas9/HA/NLS/2A/EGFP fusion gene was driven by elongation factor-1α (EF1α) promoter. Seven days after the transduction, cells were stained with anti-CCR5 or isotype control antibody followed by FACS analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g007">Fig. 7B</xref> shows that 43 (11.1 + 31.9)% CCR5 negative cells was obtained in CEMss-CCR5 cells transduced with this single vector (the bottom-left panel); whereas only 2.2 (2.2+0)% CCR5 negative cells was observed in mock-transduced cells (the bottom-right panel). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g007">Fig. 7C</xref> shows that <italic>CCR5</italic> gene was effectively disrupted in CEMss-CCR5 cells transduced with this single vector using T7 endonuclease I assay. CCR5 negative cells (43%) obtained in CEMss-CCR5 cells transduced with this single vector co-expressing sgRNA (CR2) and CAS9 was similar to 42.5% CCR5 negative cells transduced with two vectors that express CR2 and CAS9 separatedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Certainly, there are several ways to further improve the efficiency of CCR5 gene disruption, such as higher MOI used in transduction, multiple rounds of transduction and test more sgRNAs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the first reported “cure” of HIV-1 infection came from a CCR5Δ32 homozygous allogeneic bone marrow transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Htter1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Allers1">[53]</xref>, few individuals are likely to benefit from this treatment due to toxicity of allogeneic rejection and limitation of HLA-matched CCR5Δ32 homozygous donors. To overcome these problems, a CCR5-ZFN has been developed to inactivate the <italic>CCR5</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Nazari1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Perez1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Mussolino1">[15]</xref>. <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption was observed following a single round of transduction with adenovirus vectors expressing the CCR5-ZFN or electroporation of a plasmid DNA expressing CCR5-ZFN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Perez1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Holt1">[13]</xref>. Moreover, significant increases in <italic>CCR5</italic> gene-disrupted cells and lower plasma viremia were observed in NOG mice after challenged with HIV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Perez1">[11]</xref>. Currently CCR5-ZFN-transduced autologous T cells are being tested in two Phase I clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-DiGiusto1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Tebas1">[16]</xref>. In the present study, we tested whether lentiviral vectors expressing the Cas9 and sgRNAs of <italic>CCR5</italic> could be used to engineer HIV-1 resistance.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the most important findings of this study are that a single round of co-transduction of human CD4<sup>+</sup> cells with the lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and sgRNAs CR1, CR2 or CR3 or a single round of transduction of human CD4<sup>+</sup> cells with a single lentiviral vector expressing both CR2 and Cas9 resulted in high efficiency of human <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g001">Fig. 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g002">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). The <italic>CCR5</italic> gene-modified cells are highly resistant to R5-tropic HIV-1 infection including transmitted founder (T/F) viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g006">6A and B</xref>) and exhibit a selective survival advantage over cells with unmodified <italic>CCR5</italic> during R5-tropic HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g006">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g006">D</xref>). These findings indicate that the efficiency of <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption by the Cas9 and sgRNA system is at least the same as, if it is not higher than, those by CCR5-ZFN or CCR5-TALEN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Perez1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Mussolino1">[15]</xref>. However, further side-by-side study is needed to compare CCR5 gene disruption by these three gene editing approaches.</p>
<p>Another important finding is that we did not detect off-target mutations in 12 loci that contain one nucleotide mismatch to the 3′ 13 nucleotide seed regions and PAM (NGG) of CR2 or CR3 in cells co-transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and CR2 or CR3 using T7 endonuclease I assay even at 84 days post transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), indicating that likely co-transducing cells with lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and CR2 or CR3 does not induce mutations at potential off-target sites that are highly homologous to CR2 or CR3 in HIV-1 susceptible human CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. However, due to its lower sensitivity, the T7 endonuclease I assay can only detect off-target mutations that occur at frequencies equal to or high than 1% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Kim1">[54]</xref>. Thus, to completely rule out potential mutations in these 12 loci that contain one nucleotide mismatch to the 3′ 13 nucleotide seed regions and PAM (NGG) of CR2 or CR3, it would be necessary to perform deep sequencing to thoroughly rule out much lower frequencies of mutations. Using deep sequencing Cho <italic>et al.</italic> recently showed high frequencies of CCR5 indels in K562 cells co-transfected with DNA plasmids encoding Cas9 and 2 of 28 CCR5 sgRNAs, but no mutations at measurable frequency (about 0.01%) at these putative off-target sites to these 2 CCR5 sgRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Cho2">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, when testing for potential off-target mutations in the <italic>CCR2</italic> gene with an additional 9 CCR5 sgRNAs, one of the CCR5 sgRNAs (off#3), which has an identical crRNA sequence of our CR2, did not cause <italic>CCR2</italic> gene mutations that were identifiable by deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115987-g002">Figure 2</xref> in ref 33). Thus, taken together the findings by Cho <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Cho2">[33]</xref> and by our present study indicate a low possibility for off-target mutations induced by Cas9 and CR2.</p>
<p>In this study, we used lentiviral vectors to deliver Cas9 and sgRNAs into HIV-1 susceptible human CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. Therefore, the high level of <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption observed in our study could be due to efficient gene delivery by lentiviral vectors to these cells. Interestingly, we observed that although <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption could be detected at 3 days post transduction, the disruption continued increasing until 9 days post transduction (Wang <italic>et al.</italic> data not shown). Similar observation was also reported in other genes disrupted by lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and sgRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Zhou1">[55]</xref>. However, since lentiviral vectors are integrated into host cell genome and Cas9 and sgRNAs are likely to be persistently expressed, the long-term effect of vector integration and persistent expression of Cas9 and sgRNAs on the target cell genome is currently unknown. To overcome this potential adverse effects, a integrase defective lentiviral vector that co-expresses Cas9 and sgRNAs should be tested. Otherwise, similar to vectors reported by Levine <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115987-Levine1">[56]</xref>, the lentiviral vectors used in this study to express Cas9 and CCR5 sgRNAs may have the potential advantage of <italic>in vivo</italic> vector mobilization when they are used to treat HIV-1 patients.</p>
<p>After successfully disrupting <italic>CCR5</italic> gene in human T cell lines, we have made several attempts to disrupt <italic>CCR5</italic> gene in human primary T cells from multiple donors with lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and sgRNA CR2, including a single lentiviral transfer construct that co-expresses Cas9 and sgRNA CR2 along with GFP marker protein. Prior to transduction, we have also tried several stimulation protocols such as Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody-coated plate, or anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody-coated beads. Without exception, all our attempts yielded negative results, i.e. no <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption could be detected by T7 endonuclease I assay, although all these constructs effectively disrupt <italic>CCR5</italic> gene in human T cell lines and decent transduction efficency of these constructs into the primary T cells was obtained and Cas9 RNA transcripts were detected by real-time PCR (Wang et al. data not shown). Similarly, when we generated single lentiviral transfer constructs to disrupt <italic>CD4</italic> and <italic>CXCR4</italic> genes, we observed the same results, i.e. the single lentiviral vectors efficiently disrupt <italic>CD4</italic> and <italic>CXCR4</italic> genes in transduced human T cell line, but not in primary human T cells (Wang et al. Data not shown). At this time, we do not know what causes such a dramatic difference in <italic>CCR5, CD4</italic> and <italic>CXCR4</italic> gene disruption between T cell lines and primary T cells. But our unexpected results in primary T cells serve as a cautionary warning for researchers like us who are interested in developing the CRISPR/CAs9 system into clinical applications.</p>
<p>In summary, we tested <italic>CCR5</italic> gene disruption in HIV-1 susceptible cells using lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and sgRNAs CR1, CR2 or CR3. We demonstrated that co-transducing lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and CR2 yields high frequencies of on-target (<italic>CCR5</italic>), but not off-target, genome modification in a HIV-1 susceptible human CD4<sup>+</sup> cell lines. <italic>CCR5</italic> gene-disrupted cells are highly resistant to R5-tropic HIV-1 infection and exhibit selective advantage over <italic>CCR5</italic> gene-undisrupted cells during R5-tropic HIV-1 infection. Finally, we showed that transducing human CD4 T cells with a single lentiviral vector expressing both sgRNA CR2 and Cas9 efficiently disrupt <italic>CCR5</italic> gene. Thus, this lentiviral vector expressing both Cas9 and sgRNA CR2 may be a viable alternative to CCR5-ZFN gene editing, i.e. to recapitulate the success of CCR5Δ32 homozygous allogeneic transplantation via CCR5 gene-disruption of autologous hematopoietic stem cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, since all our attempts to disrupt <italic>CCR5</italic> gene in human primary T cells with lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and sgRNA CR2 yielded negative results, finding out why lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and sgRNA CR2 fail to disrupt <italic>CCR5</italic> gene in primary T cells and how efficient lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and sgRNA CR2 disrupt <italic>CCR5</italic> gene in human hematopoietic stem cells will be extremely important for moving these Cas9 and sgRNA CR2 contructs into clinical settings.</p>
