          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Physiological costs of rapid growth may contribute to the observation that
                        organisms typically grow at submaximal rates. Although, it has been
                        hypothesized that faster growing individuals would do worse in dealing with
                        suboptimal temperatures, this type of cost has never been explored
                        empirically. Furthermore, the mechanistic basis of the physiological costs
                        of rapid growth is largely unexplored.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Finding</title>
          <p>Larvae of the damselfly <italic>Ischnura elegans</italic> from two univoltine
                        northern and two multivoltine southern populations were reared at three
                        temperatures and after emergence given a cold shock. Cold resistance,
                        measured by chill coma recovery times in the adult stage, was lower in the
                        southern populations. The faster larval growth rates in the southern
                        populations contributed to this latitudinal pattern in cold resistance. In
                        accordance with their assumed role in cold resistance, Hsp70 levels were
                        lower in the southern populations, and faster growing larvae had lower Hsp70
                        levels. Yet, individual variation in Hsp70 levels did not explain variation
                        in cold resistance.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>We provide evidence for a novel cost of rapid growth: reduced cold
                        resistance. Our results indicate that the reduced cold resistance in
                        southern populations of animals that change voltinism along the latitudinal
                        gradient may not entirely be explained by thermal selection <italic>per
                            se</italic> but also by the costs of time constraint-induced higher
                        growth rates. This also illustrates that stressors imposed in the larval
                        stage may carry over and shape fitness in the adult stage and highlights the
                        importance of physiological costs in the evolution of life-histories at
                        macro-scales.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Growth rate is a key life history trait that will determine age and size at maturity
                and therefore contributes in shaping adult fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Roff1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Stearns1">[2]</xref>. Despite the obvious benefits
                of growing fast, i.e. reaching a large size in a short time, it is becoming widely
                accepted that animals typically are not growing at their maximum speed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Arendt1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Tammaru1">[5]</xref>. This has
                initiated a search for counterbalancing costs of growing fast with most focus on
                ecological costs like increased predation risk (e.g. ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Gotthard1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Stoks1">[7]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Physiological costs of rapid growth, i.e. those entailing a lower ability to endure
                adverse environmental conditions, are much less studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Gotthard2">[8]</xref>. Most attention went to food
                shortage demonstrating that faster growing individuals did worse in coping with
                starvation (e.g. ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Gotthard3">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Stoks2">[11]</xref>). Although, it has been hypothesized that faster growing
                individuals would also do worse in dealing with suboptimal temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Gotthard2">[8]</xref>, this type of
                cost has never been explored empirically.</p>
      <p>Costs as part of trade-offs can not only be studied at the individual but also at the
                population level because also interpopulation differences in growth rates exist. As
                the benefits and costs of rapid growth may vary among populations, optimal growth
                rates also show geographic variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Gotthard2">[8]</xref>. In this context, time
                constraints associated with the length of the available growth period play an
                important role in shaping higher growth rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Abrams1">[12]</xref>. Changes in voltinism with more
                generations in low-latitude (-altitude) populations are widely documented along
                latitudinal (altitudinal) gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Corbet1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Altermatt1">[14]</xref>, and have been identified as a key factor causing higher
                time constraints and therefore higher growth rates in these populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ragland1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Karl1">[16]</xref>. This generates
                the hypothesis that the reduced ability to deal with low temperatures in
                low-latitude (-altitude) populations (e.g. ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Karl1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ragland2">[17]</xref> may be partly explained as a
                physiological cost of the higher growth rates rather than by thermal selection
                    <italic>per se</italic>.</p>
      <p>The mechanistic basis of the physiological costs of rapid growth is largely
                unexplored. With regard to cold resistance, stress proteins like Hsp70 seem to play
                an important role in insects. Several studies showed an upregulation of Hsp70 under
                cold stress (e.g. ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Karl2">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Colinet1">[19]</xref>) which improves survival at low temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Rinehart1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Kotl1">[21]</xref>. Also, chill coma
                recovery times, a key measure of cold resistance, have been linked to PGI genotypes
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Karl3">[22]</xref>, and PGI
                genotypes differ in Hsp70 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Dahlhoff1">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, higher Hsp70
                levels are associated with reduced growth rates (overview in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Srensen1">[24]</xref>). Altogether, this suggests
                that the proposed physiological cost of rapid growth in terms of reduced cold
                resistance may be mediated through reduced expression of Hsp70 in fast growers.</p>
      <p>The overall aim of the present study is to evaluate physiological costs of rapid
                growth in terms of reduced cold resistance, as measured by chill coma recovery
                times, both at the individual and at the population level using the damselfly
                    <italic>Ischnura elegans</italic> as a model system. At the population level we
                compared two northern univoltine with two southern multivoltine populations. Given
                the stronger time constraints associated with multivoltinism, we expected higher
                growth rates in the southern populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Abrams1">[12]</xref>. Based on previous empirical
                research (see above) we expected lower cold resistance in the southern populations,
                and rapid growth to be associated with reduced cold resistance potentially through a
                link with lower Hsp70 levels. Because patterns in growth rate and cold resistance
                among populations along latitudinal gradients may depend on rearing temperature
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ragland1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ragland2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ayres1">[25]</xref>, we reared
                larvae at three temperatures from the egg stage in a common-garden experiment. Clear
                latitudinal patterns in growth rate were observed. Higher growth rates were
                associated with reduced cold tolerance both at the population and at the individual
                level, and this relationship was consistent with differences in Hsp70 levels at the
                population level.</p>

      <title>Materials and Methods</title>
      <p>The damselfly <italic>Ischnura elegans</italic> is a very abundant damselfly in
                Europe occurring from northern Spain to southern Sweden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Dijkstra1">[26]</xref>. In northern Europe it has
                one generation a year (univoltine), while in southern Europe it has multiple
                generations a year (multivoltine) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Corbet1">[13]</xref>. Two populations were studied from southern Sweden,
                Genarp (GE) and Vallby (VA), and two from southern France, St-Martin de Crau (SM)
                and Salin de Giraud (SG). To assess latitudinal differences in growth rate and cold
                resistance and their plastic responses to rearing temperature, we reared larvae of
                the four study populations from the egg stage until emergence at three temperatures
                (18°C, 21°C and 24°C) and measured chill coma recovery time one day
                after emergence in the adult stage. This temperature range has been shown to
                generate clear thermal reaction norms in related species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-VanDoorslaer1">[27]</xref> and spans the natural
                temperature regime of the populations of this species during the largest part of the
                growth season. Furthermore, survival is low when larvae are reared at lower and
                higher temperatures.</p>
      <p>We collected 8–10 females for each of four study populations. Field-collected
                females were placed individually in small plastic containers and given wet filter
                paper as oviposition substrate and allowed to oviposit for three days in the
                laboratory. Afterwards they were released in the field. Rearing experiments were
                performed with the permission (09-06037) of the Flemish Agency of Nature and
                Forestry. Filter papers with eggs were transported to Belgium where they were kept
                at 21°C. At the day of hatching, larvae were randomly divided among six
                identical incubators set at 18°C, 21°C and 24°C (14∶10 L:D
                photoperiod). Each larva was placed individually in a circular plastic 180 ml cup
                filled to a height of 5 cm with aged dechlorinated tap water. Cups were rotated
                daily within the incubator and regularly between the incubators of the same
                temperature treatment. Larvae were daily fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> with brine
                shrimp nauplii. When larvae entered the final instar the daily food ration was
                doubled. We daily checked animals for adult emergence. Development time was
                calculated as the number of days between egg hatching and adult emergence. One day
                after emergence, each adult was weighed to the nearest 0.01 mg and randomly assigned
                to either a control or a cold shock treatment that induced a comatose condition.
                Larval growth rate was quantified as ln(mass at emergence)/development time (see
                e.g. ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Johansson1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-RichterBoix1">[30]</xref>). This growth rate based
                on the entire larval period correlates strongly with growth rates based on mass
                increase during the final instar in this species (R. Stoks, unpublished data). For
                the life history variables, sample sizes per combination of latitude and temperature
                varied between 35 and 53 (total <italic>n</italic> = 261).</p>
      <p>Cold resistance was measured as chill coma recovery time; an assay used successfully
                before to demonstrate intraspecific latitudinal and altitudinal patterns (e.g. ref
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Karl1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ragland2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Hoffmann1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Hoffmann2">[32]</xref>). For this,
                we placed individual one-day old adults in a microcentrifuge tube in an incubator at
                4°C at 11am. We chose this chilling temperature based on the cold challenges
                imposed on the natural adult populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016935.s001">File S1</xref>). After 1.5 h each adult was gently
                placed on its back in a petri dish with roughened bottom at 21°C. We scored
                recovery times to the nearest second as the time taken for an animal to stand
                upright. Following recovery, animals were given another hour to allow for the
                possible upregulation of Hsp70 and were then frozen at −80°C (see ref
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Karl2">[18]</xref>). No
                animals died during the cold shock. For recovery times, sample size per combination

                    <italic>n</italic> = 140).</p>
      <p>We quantified Hsp70 levels using an immunoblot assay closely following the protocol
                of Slos and Stoks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Slos1">[33]</xref>. Briefly, single larvae were homogenised in a proteinase
                inhibitor cocktail (Sigma®, St Louis, MO P2714) and a sample corresponding with
                10 µg of protein was separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
                (PAGE). Therefore, any patterns in Hsp70 are independent of total protein content.
                Stress proteins were detected using monoclonal primary antibodies cross-reacting
                with the stress-induced Hsp70 and the constitutive Hsc70 (dilution 1∶1500, SPA
                757, Stressgen®) and a AP-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1∶1000,
                D0486, DakoCytomation®, Glostrup, Denmark). The optical density (OD) of stress
                protein bands on the membrane was quantified on digitized images using the software
                package Image ProPlus. To correct for potential variation between blots, we ran a
                control sample of 1 µL HeLa Cell Lysate (Heat shocked; Stressgen®) on
                every blot. For Hsp70 the response curve for optical density against concentration
                is linear in damselflies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Slos1">[33]</xref>. For Hsp70, we analyzed per combination of latitude and
                temperature 11–13 control animals that received no cold shock and 22–26
                animals that received a cold shock (total
                <italic>n</italic> = 212). Control animals for Hsp70 analysis
                were similarly treated as the ones given a cold shock but placed 1.5 h in an
                incubator at 21°C and not at 4°C. We assayed more larvae after the cold
                shock as our focus was on testing for covariation of Hsp70 levels and recovery
                times.</p>

        <p>We tested for effects of rearing temperature, latitude, and population nested in
                    latitude on the dependent variables in separate general linear models.
                    Population nested in latitude was included as a random factor; it was never
                    significant (all <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.23) indicating consistent results
                    within a given latitude. In all analyses we also included sex and its
                    interactions but these results are not related to out predictions and did not
                    interfere with the observed patterns and therefore will not be reported. Models
                    on life history (age and mass at emergence, growth rate) initially also included
                    the cold shock treatment (present vs absent) to evaluate whether we successfully
                    randomized larvae across the two adult cold shock treatments. Yet, it was never
                    significant (all <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.13) and not retained in the final
                    models. The cold shock treatment was also included as a factor when analyzing
                    Hsp70 levels but not when analyzing recovery times because for the latter
                    variable all animals had been given a cold shock. For the analyses of recovery
                    times (log-transformed) and Hsp70 levels we included mass as a covariate, and
                    for the latter also the optical density of the Hela control. Correct degrees of
                    freedom were estimated using the Satterthwaite option. Because the results on

      <p>In line with the higher perceived time constraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Gotthard1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Stoks1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Stoks2">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Abrams1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-DeBlock1">[34]</xref>, growth rates were higher in
                the southern multivoltine than in the northern univoltine populations. Similar
                latitudinal growth rate patterns associated with changes in voltinism have been
                documented in butterflies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Nygren1">[35]</xref>, mosquitoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ragland1">[15]</xref>, and in a previous study on
                    <italic>I. elegans</italic> (Shama et al., unpublished data). We also found the
                typical increase in growth rates at higher temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Angiletta1">[36]</xref>. This increase was less
                pronounced in the southern populations where growth rates were already high at the
                low temperature, suggesting growth rates were near their physiological maximum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Stoks2">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We provide evidence of a novel cost of rapid growth: rapid growth was associated with
                a reduced cold resistance both at the latitudinal level and at the individual level.
                Importantly, these patterns cannot simply result from differences in mass, as all
                analyses were mass-corrected.</p>
      <p>More generally, our results support the untested hypothesis by Gotthard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Gotthard2">[8]</xref> that faster
                growing individuals would be worse in dealing with suboptimal temperatures. In
                ectotherms like damselflies that forage and mate in flight, there are obvious
                fitness implications of a higher cold resistance in the adult stage. Adults with a
                better cold resistance would better endure cold nights and likely be active earlier
                in the day, hence can spend more time foraging and engaging in reproductive
                activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Corbet2">[37]</xref>.
                This cost may be general in animals and plants, yet not directly considered in
                previous studies. As in our study, southern populations of the pitcher plant
                mosquito have higher growth rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ragland1">[15]</xref> and a lower cold resistance than northern populations
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ragland2">[17]</xref>.
                Further, lowland populations of the copper butterfly have higher growth rates and
                reduced cold resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Karl1">[16]</xref>. Finally, faster growing plant species have higher frost
                damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Turnbulll1">[38]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Cold resistance, as measured by shorter chill coma recovery times, was higher in the
                northern populations and higher at the lowest rearing temperature. This is in line
                with studies along latitudinal gradients in other insects (e.g. ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ragland2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Hoffmann1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Hoffmann2">[32]</xref>), which
                considered this latitudinal pattern as a direct result of geographic differences in
                thermal selection. Also in our study system thermal selection for increased cold
                resistance is likely higher in the northern populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016935.s001">File S1</xref>). Yet,
                the observation that latitudinal differences in cold resistance were not significant
                anymore when growth rate was added to the model indicates growth rate differences
                are contributing to the latitudinal differences in cold resistance. We therefore
                hypothesize that the latitudinal pattern in cold resistance in our study system may
                not be entirely explained by thermal selection <italic>per se</italic> but also by
                the higher growth rates at lower latitudes.</p>
      <p>While there was some indication that the physiological cost of rapid growth in terms
                of reduced cold resistance was mediated through reduced Hsp70 levels there was no
                support for this at the individual level. Treatment groups with higher growth rates
                and longer recovery times, i.e. southern populations and animals reared at higher
                temperatures, indeed had lower Hsp70 levels, and at the individual level faster
                growing animals had lower Hsp70 levels. Yet, individual variation in Hsp70 levels
                did not explain variation in recovery times when taking into account the treatment
                effects. A reason for this may be that we could not detect an upregulation of Hsp70
                under cold stress and that we therefore obtained baseline Hsp70 levels (see below).
                More general, other (stress) proteins may also play a role in shaping the still
                poorly understood resistance to nonfreezing low temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Clower1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Colinet2">[40]</xref>, potentially obscuring any
                effect, if present, from Hsp70 alone.</p>
      <p>Instead of an upregulation of Hsp70 after the cold shock, we found a slight
                downregulation. In the copper butterfly Karl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Karl2">[18]</xref> did report an upregulation of
                Hsp70 after a 1 h cold stress followed by a 1 h recovery period. Yet, in line with
                our results, other studies found that (mRNA) levels of Hsp70, if anything, decreased
                during a cold period and only started increasing several hours after the cold shock
                ended <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Colinet1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Kotl1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Sonoda1">[41]</xref>. Activation of
                the heat shock factors is probably incomplete under a short period of cold stress,
                and longer recovery times would have shown an upregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Colinet1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Kotl1">[21]</xref>. Whatever the reason, this lack
                of upregulation during the experiment indicates that baseline Hsp levels (i.e. those
                present before the cold shock) may have contributed in shaping the latitudinal
                differences in recovery times in current experiment. Upregulation of Hsp70 after
                cold stress may be more important in reducing damage long after the chill coma has
                ended as shown in another insect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Kotl1">[21]</xref> and may not be that important in keeping chill coma
                recovery times short. Similarly, Koštál and
                Tollarová-Borovanská <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Kotl1">[21]</xref> suggested that high Hsp levels during dormancy may
                represent an anticipatory protection against a variety of environmental insults.</p>
      <p>Hsp70 levels were lower in the two treatment groups with the highest growth rates,
                southern larvae and larvae reared at the high temperature, consistent with an
                energetic cost of rapid growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Stoks2">[11]</xref>. Importantly, also at the individual level faster growing
                larvae had lower Hsp70 levels. Note that, development time (nor body mass) did not
                covary with Hsp70 levels when also growth rate was included in the model, so it is
                not a faster life history (or associated patterns in body mass) <italic>per
                    se</italic> that seems to shape Hsp70 patterns. This trade-off pattern between
                growth rate and Hsp70 levels adds to the few other studies showing that higher Hsp
                levels were associated with lower growth rates (overview in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Srensen1">[24]</xref>). For example,
                    <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae with extra copies of the Hsp70 gene have
                decreased growth rates compared to control larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Krebs1">[42]</xref>. This trade-off is thought to be
                energy-mediated as the synthesis, functioning and maintenance of Hsp proteins is
                energetically costly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Srensen1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To conclude, we here presented evidence for a, likely widespread, novel cost of rapid
                growth in terms of reduced cold resistance. Our study thereby is complementary to
                the few other studies demonstrating physiological costs of rapid growth in terms of
                reduced resistance against food stress (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">introduction</xref>), oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-DeBlock2">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Hall1">[44]</xref> and reduced immune function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Soler1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-DeBlock3">[46]</xref> and offers a
                new explanation why organisms typically not grow at their maximal rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Arendt1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Tammaru1">[5]</xref>. Noteworthy,
                this type of cost would never have been detected when only focusing on the adult
                stage, stressing the importance to consider both life stages when trying to
                understand life history variation in animals with a complex life cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Pechenik1">[47]</xref>. This adds to
                the insight that stressors imposed in the larval stage may carry over and shape
                fitness in the adult stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Rolff1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-DeBlock4">[49]</xref>. Furthermore, this type of cost may also contribute to
                the here documented latitudinal patterns in cold resistance. Changes in voltinism
                with more generations in low-latitude (-altitude) populations are widely documented
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Corbet1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Altermatt1">[14]</xref>, and have been identified as a key factor generating
                higher time constraints and therefore higher growth rates in these populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ragland1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Karl1">[16]</xref>. Together with
                current findings this may indicate that the reduced ability to deal with low
                temperatures in low-latitude (-altitude) populations of animals that change
                voltinism along these gradients (e.g. ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Karl1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Ragland2">[17]</xref>) may not be entirely explained
                by thermal selection <italic>per se</italic> but also by the costs of the time
                constraint-induced higher growth rates. Our results thereby highlight the importance
                of physiological costs in the evolution of life-histories at macro-scales. Given
                that cold resistance is a key factor shaping range limits, similar studies at the
                interplay between physiological ecology and macro-ecology may prove rewarding in
                understanding range boundaries and their shifts under global warming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Chown1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016935-Gaston1">[51]</xref>.</p>
