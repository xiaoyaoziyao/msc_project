<abstract>
<p>Alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT, E.C. 2.6.1.2), is a pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-dependent (PLP) enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transfer of an amino group from alanine to 2-oxoglutarate to produce glutamate and pyruvate, or vice versa. It has been well documented in both greenhouse and field studies that tissue-specific over-expression of <italic>AlaAT</italic> from barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>, <italic>HvAlaAT</italic>) results in a significant increase in plant NUE in both canola and rice. While the physical phenotypes associated with over-expression of <italic>HvAlaAT</italic> have been well characterized, the role this enzyme plays <italic>in vivo</italic> to create a more N efficient plant remains unknown. Furthermore, the importance of HvAlaAT, in contrast to other AlaAT enzyme homologues in creating this phenotype has not yet been explored. To address the role of AlaAT in NUE, AlaAT variants from diverse sources and different subcellular locations, were expressed in the wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col-0 background and <italic>alaat1;2</italic> (<italic>alaat1-1</italic>;<italic>alaat2-1</italic>) knockout background in various N environments. The analysis and comparison of both the physical and physiological properties of <italic>AlaAT</italic> over-expressing transgenic plants demonstrated significant differences between plants expressing the different AlaAT enzymes under different external conditions. This analysis indicates that the over-expression of <italic>AlaAT</italic> variants other than <italic>HvAlaAT</italic> in crop plants could further increase the NUE phenotype(s) previously observed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As sessile organisms, the growth and development of plants is highly reliant on their ability to rapidly sense and adjust to changes in their environment. Response patterns to internal and external signals can have both immediate and long lasting effects, affecting current and overall growth and development of the plant [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Nitrogen (N) availability and form (organic or inorganic) is known to strongly impact plant physiology, including N metabolism, carbon (C) metabolism and plant signalling [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Plants that more effectively uptake, allocate or remobilize available N are said to have increased <underline>n</underline>itrogen <underline>u</underline>se <underline>e</underline>fficiency (NUE) [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While many different definitions of NUE have been developed over time, depending on the physiological process being studied, all measurements are based on analyzing three identifiers: 1) total biomass (increases or decreases), 2) grain weight or 3) N taken up from the soil (for a more detailed review see Good et al. [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]).</p>
<p>Interest in increasing the NUE of crop plants is of importance for several reasons. Firstly, quantitatively N is the major nutrient effecting plant growth and development [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While traditional plant breeding practices have increased crop yields significantly, and, concomitantly increased the NUE of the crops, there is still a gap between actual yields and attainable yields and between attainable yields and the yield potential of particular crops [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Secondly, only approximately 30–50% of the N applied in agricultural systems is taken up by plants [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], with the excess lost to run-off [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], utilized by microbial systems [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and contributing to algal blooms and greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. Finally, total N fertilizer consumption, estimated to be 105.3 million tonnes in 2011, is estimated to increase to 112.9 million tonnes in 2015, due to increases in the output of major cereal crops, including rice and wheat [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Accordingly, much focus has been given to the investigation of NUE phenotypes and generation of NUE cereal crops. To date, alterations in very few of the genes involved in primary N metabolism in plant systems have shown to result in increased NUE, determined through various methods including quantitative trait loci analysis as well as gene knockout and over-expression studies (for a review see McAllister, et al. [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]).</p>
<p>While AlaAT is not regarded as a primary nitrogen assimilation enzyme in plant systems [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it is involved in both C and N metabolism. AlaAT catalyzes a reversible reaction converting alanine (Ala) and 2-oxoglutarate to glutamate (Glu) and pyruvate, and vice versa, in the presence of the coenzyme pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP) and is conserved between Archaea, Eubacteria and Eukarya [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. AlaAT is known to be involved in a number of cellular processes in plants including gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, amino acid metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], photorespiration, C4 photosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and NUE [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Previous research has shown that over-expression of barley AlaAT (<italic>HvAlaAT</italic>) driven by a tissue-specific root promoter, <italic>btg26</italic> or <italic>OsAnt1</italic>, in canola and rice respectively, results in an NUE phenotype, including increases in root biomass [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the question of particular interest is “why does HvAlaAT, specifically, produce this phenotype?” Moreover, do AlaAT enzymes from diverse sources also produce an NUE phenotype when expressed in crop plants?</p>
<p>It was hypothesized that, if AlaAT enzymes behave significantly differently <italic>in vivo</italic>, as they do <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], this may then manifest as quantifiable alterations in physical or physiological growth and development, as well as increases or decreases in the NUE of the plant. In order to assess the importance of AlaAT variants in producing the NUE phenotype seen in the previous studies, <italic>AlaAT</italic> genes from a variety of organisms were transformed into <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> (var. Col-0, also termed wild-type background) and a double knockout line (<italic>alaat1;2</italic>, var. Col-0, also termed null background) and assessed under different N conditions. Previous analysis of the kinetic properties of AlaAT enzymes in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> as well as the primary enzyme structure of the variants was used to determine which genes should be transformed into Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The <italic>AlaAT</italic> genes chosen for expression <italic>in planta</italic> were from: barley (<italic>HvAlaAT</italic>), mouse (<italic>Mus muscus</italic>), both cytoplasmic (<italic>MmAlaAT1</italic>) and mitochondrial (<italic>MmAlaAT2</italic>) isoforms and the archaeon <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> (<italic>PfAlaAT</italic>). The results presented here show differences not only between control and transgenic plants, but also between plants expressing different AlaAT enzymes. We demonstrate that plant responses to N as well as C can be altered significantly by over-expressing <italic>AlaAT</italic> in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>, and that these NUE responses can also be significantly influenced by over-expression of a particular AlaAT enzyme variant. These results emphasize the importance of studying enzyme variants in relation to alterations in complex metabolic plant pathways.</p>

NP_579226) was amplified from ATCC gDNA (DSM 3638) [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Restriction enzyme cut sites for <italic>Asc</italic>1 and <italic>Pac</italic>1 were added to the 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively, of the <italic>AlaAT</italic>s using PCR: 5’-ATTATTAAggcgcgccATGATAAGGG-3’ and 5’-GCTATTCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGA-3’. A His/Myc tag was added to the 3’ end of <italic>PfAlaAT</italic> using a second reverse primer in a successive PCR reaction (5’-CTAAAttaattaaTCAATGGTGGTGATGATGATGGTCGACGGCGCTATTCAGATCCTCTTC-3’). AlaAT cDNAs were subcloned into the binary vector pMDC32 [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] behind a 2X <italic>CaMV 35S</italic> promoter using restriction enzymes <italic>Asc</italic>1 and <italic>Pac</italic>1.</p>
<p>Binary vectors were transformed into <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain GV3101 and selected for using 50 μM kanamycin (Kan<sub>(50)</sub>)<sub>.</sub> Two separate <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col-0 backgrounds were transformed using floral dip: a wild-type background and an <italic>alaat1;2</italic> knockout. The double knockout was created using two separate single mutant seed lines; <italic>alaat1-1</italic> (At1g17290, Salk_l 07662) and <italic>alaat2-1</italic> (At1g72330, R366K resulted in the loss of a BseRI recognition site) [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The <italic>alaat1-1</italic> line is a T-DNA insertion mutation [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] in the cytosolic isozyme obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Centre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biosci.ohiostate.edu/_plantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.biosci.ohiostate.edu/_plantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm</ext-link>).

<p>Transformed plants were selected by sowing seeds on 25 μM hygromycin (Hyg<sub>(25)</sub>) using a protocol from Harrison et al., [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], with these modifications; plants were left covered at 4°C for four days and at room temperature for three days. PCR was carried out on all primary transgenic lines with primers specific to the <italic>AlaAT</italic> insert:: for <italic>HvAlaAT</italic>, 5’-GAGGTTCTTGCCCTTTGTGA-3’ and 5’-TTCAGCTCGTTGCAAGTAA-3’; for <italic>MmAlaAT1</italic>, 5’-CCAGAGGATGCCAAGAGAAG-3’ and 5’-GCTCCGTGAGTTTAGCCTTG-3’; for <italic>MmAlaAT2</italic>, 5’-GCAGGCTTGTGGTGGAAA-3’ and 5’-GCACTTTCTTAAAGGAGTGGAATC-3’; for <italic>PfAlaAT</italic>, 5’-GCGCTCTACGACAAAAAGACACTTGA-3’ and 5’-CGTTAGTCCTGCTATAGCTGCGAATT-3’. T<sub>2</sub> seed was used to test for multiple insertions in designated homozygous transgenic lines by testing for hygromycin resistance. T<sub>3</sub> seed was sown on Hyg<sub>(25)</sub> media to select for homozygous lines; PCR was used to verify the presences of the specific <italic>AlaAT</italic> insertions. Three independent Arabidopsis insertion lines for each <italic>AlaAT</italic> construct, in both Col-0 and <italic>alaat1;2</italic> backgrounds, were selected and used for future analyses.

<title>Growth conditions</title>
<p>Plate assays were conducted on modified 0.5 MS media (0.5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.7% (w/v) agar, pH 5.8), at 21°C, 60% humidity, light intensity of ∼170 μE·m<sup>-2</sup>·sec<sup>-1</sup>, and a lighting cycle of 16 light/8 dark unless otherwise specified. In all cases, except initial testing for homozygousity, all plants were grown vertically. For all plate assays, T<sub>4</sub> or T<sub>5</sub> seed was utilized. Sterilized seeds were stratified in 0.15% (w/v) agar for ∼48 hrs; sterilized seeds were sown onto square 100 X 100 X 15 mm petri plates containing 0.5 MS media with modified sources and concentrations of N as outlined below. Plants were sown horizontally across square petri plates approximately 2 cm from the top of each plate; six plants were sown per plate. Control plants and transgenics were sown on the same plates in an alternating fashion. Three independent insertion lines for each <italic>AlaAT</italic> variant were assayed in quadruplicate along with control plants. Chambers were blocked for variations in lighting conditions, resulting in four blocks, with final lighting blocks containing a maximum difference of 20% across a single block with an average light intensity of ∼170 μE·m<sup>-2</sup>·sec<sup>-1</sup>. All genotypes were assessed in every lighting block. Changes in vertical tap root length were measured (cm) during a variety of time periods. The number of lateral roots per plant was counted at both 8 and 11 days after sowing (DAS).</p>
<p>Seeds from both control lines, Col-0 and <italic>alaat1;2</italic>, as well as three independent insertion lines each of <italic>OsAnt1</italic>:<italic>HvAlaAT</italic>, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>HvAlaAT</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>MmAlaAT1</italic>, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>MmAlaAT2</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>PfAlaAT</italic>, in both a Col-0 and an <italic>alaat1;2</italic> knockout background, were used for analysis on 2 mM and 0.25 mM KNO<sub>3</sub> plates. Transgenic plants containing <italic>OsAnt1</italic>:<italic>HvAlaAT</italic>, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>PfAlaAT</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>MmAlaAT1</italic>, in both Col-0 and <italic>alaat1;2</italic> knockout backgrounds, were used for analysis on 2.5 mM glutamate, 2.5 mM alanine and 0.5 MS with: 1) regular light (170 μE·m<sup>-2</sup>·sec<sup>-1</sup>) with 0% sucrose and 1 mM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (regular light, no added C, sufficient N), 2) low light (100 μE·m<sup>-2</sup>·sec<sup>-1</sup>) with 0% sucrose and 1 mM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (low light, no added C, sufficient N) and 3) low light (100 μE·m<sup>-2</sup>·sec<sup>-1</sup>) with 0.2% sucrose and 0.25 mM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (low light, added C, limiting N). Plating, blocking and data collection, as well as chamber conditions for the growth of plants on these plates, was as outlined above.</p>
<p>Plants grown in soilless medium were grown at 21°C, 60% humidity, light intensity of ∼120 μE·m<sup>-2</sup>·sec<sup>-1</sup>, and a light cycle of either 16 hrs light/8 hrs dark or 12 hrs light/12 hrs dark (short days). Sterilized seeds were stratified in 0.15% (w/v) agar for ∼48 hrs. After stratification 3–4 seeds from each line were transferred to 3” deep, separated plastic cells containing 150 mL of sterile sand and fine vermiculite (1:1). The bottom of each cell contained ∼1–2 cm of potting mix to inhibit run off of the sand/vermiculite mixture into the tray. Eighteen cells were allowed per tray and all lines were grown in triplicate (or more), with control plants grown alongside transgenics in each tray. Trays were blocked for variations in lighting conditions, with two lighting blocks per tray, with final lighting blocks containing a maximum difference of 20%. Plants were fertilized with a modified Hoagland’s solution (adapted from [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]) once a week by a bottom fed method and watered one additional time per week for the lifecycle of the plants (50 mL per plant). After cotyledon emergence, plants in individual cells were thinned to a single plant and 400μL of 1% Helix was added to the top of each pot.</p>

<title>GUS staining</title>
<p>T<sub>2</sub> seeds were plated on 0.5 MS + Hyg<sub>(25)</sub> and selected using the protocol modified from Harrison et al. [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]; as described previously. Eight days after sowing, selected transformants were moved to new 0.5 MS + Hyg<sub>(25)</sub> plates, with Col-0 and <italic>alaat1;2</italic> plants grown on 0.5 MS for 24 days. At the end of 24 days, 1–2 plants from each independent insertion line, Col-0 and <italic>alaat1;2</italic> knockout backgrounds, as well as control plants, were placed in 1 mL of fresh GUS staining buffer (2 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronic acid (X-gluc), 50 mM NaHPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.2, 5 mM ferricyanide, 5 mM ferrocyanide and 0.2% Triton X-100) and placed in darkness at 37°C for 2 hrs. Chlorophyll was removed from tissues using a series of ethanol dilutions. Plants were then transferred to a series of glycerin solutions for 30 min time periods. Plants were stored at 4°C until photographed.</p>

<title>qRT-PCR analysis</title>
<p>Three plates, with 6 plants each, of the controls (Col-0 and <italic>alaat1;2</italic>) and transgenic lines, were grown vertically for two weeks on 0.5 MS media for RNA extraction. At the end of two weeks, three biological replicates of three plants each were harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Root and shoot tissues were harvested together. A Retsch Mixer Mill MM301 was used along with 3 mm tungsten beads (Qiagen) to grind tissues for 30 sec. RNA was extracted from 50 mg of tissue using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and an RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen) RNA quantity and quality was assessed via a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (NanoDrop) and visualized by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel.</p>

<title>Protein extraction and AlaAT activity assays</title>
<p>Transgenic lines were sown on 0.5 MS plates, six plants and one genotype per plate, after seed sterilization and ∼48 hr cold induction. Plants were harvested between 14–17 days. In order to obtain sufficient amounts of material for analysis, four biological replicates from each line were harvested, each containing four seedlings. Root and shoot tissue was harvested together. The harvested biological replicates were immediately weighed and ground with a mortar and pestle, on ice, with a pinch of sand and PVPP and extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM cysteine 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mM PMSF) at a ratio of 3:1 to fresh tissue weight (modified from Ismond et al. [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]).</p>
<p>Ground tissues were centrifuged at 4°C and 15.7 rcf for 15 min. The supernatants from two biological replicates each was then transferred to an Amicon Filter Concentrator Column and spun in a swinging rotor bucket centrifuge at 2900 g for ∼50 min, or until the protein-containing supernatant fraction was reduced in volume to 200 μl. The protein samples (two per line in most cases) were stored on ice for use in AlaAT activity assays.</p>
<p>Concentrated protein was diluted 1/5 for all samples. AlaAT activity was assayed using a continuous coupled reaction catalyzed by AlaAT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, Sigma) respectively, with the change in absorbance associated with generation of NAD<sup>+</sup> from NADH monitored at 340 nm, as described by Miyashita et al. [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Assays were carried out in biological duplicate and experimental triplicate at room temperature in a 96 well plate (Corning) over a five minute time period with readings every 11 sec, and were read using a SpectraMax Plus absorbance plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Control plants, Col-0 or <italic>alaat1;2</italic>, were also assayed for AlaAT activity.</p>

<title>WinRHIZO and Soluble sugars analysis</title>
<p>Five plants from each independent insertion line, as well as controls, were grown for 41 days (light cycle of 16 hrs light/8 hrs dark) at which point all rosette leaves &gt;1 cm were harvested from a single plant, weighed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were collected in triplicate from each of the three independent insertion lines for each <italic>AlaAT</italic> transgenic, as well as the controls. Samples were stored at-80°C. Plants were harvested approximately 5 days after the first plants bolted. Pictures of each line were taken at the time of harvest. WinRHIZO Arabidopsis 2013d software (Regent Instruments Inc.) was used to measure the total leaf area of each of the transgenic lines (n = 5).</p>
<p>Soluble sugars were extracted from frozen tissues using a modified methanol/chloroform extraction protocol for non-lyophilized cells [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Frozen tissues were ground using a Retsch Mixer Mill MM301 along with 3 mm tungsten beads (Qiagen cat. no. 69997). 50 mg ground frozen tissue from each sample was used for the metabolite extraction. An additional 2 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O was added to each extraction, above that used in the protocol referenced. The recovered polar phase from each extraction was then left in an oven at 80°C to evaporate and the residue was resuspended in 0.5 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O and used for soluble sugar analysis of glucose, fructose and sucrose. A Glucose (HK) Assay Kit (Sigma), Fructose Assay Kit (Sigma) and Sucrose Assay Kit (Sigma) were utilized for the indirect quantification of all three sugars in 100 μl of the resuspended sugar solution. All sugars were indirectly detected via multiple enzyme reactions (as outlined by the manufacturer). A spectrophotometer (SpectraMax Plus absorbance plate reader, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to measure the final concentration of NADH in solution (A<sub>340</sub>).</p>

<title>Protoplast preparation and uptake of <sup>3</sup>H-tritium and <sup>14</sup>C-alanine</title>
<p>Plants for mesophyll cell protoplast isolation were grown in soilless medium for five weeks, as outlined above with the exception of day length; plants were grown in a shortened photoperiod, with 12 hrs light/12 hrs dark. Prior to harvest, total leaf area of all transgenic and Col-0 plants was determined using WinRHIZO Arabidopsis 2013d software.</p>
<p>Protoplast isolation was slightly modified from the protocol described previously by Yoo et al. [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Approximately 40–50 rosette leaves from ∼18 individual plants per transgenic line were used to obtain tissue for protoplast preparation. Three separate transgenic lines per <italic>AlaAT</italic> insert were analyzed. Rosette leaves that were discoloured or undergoing senescence were not used.</p>
<p>Protoplasts were diluted to a final concentration of 2 X 10<sup>5</sup> cells ml<sup>-1</sup> for uptake. Protoplasts were labelled with a combination of both <sup>14</sup>C-alanine (Alanine, L-[14C(U)], Perkin Elmer) and <sup>3</sup>H-leucine (Leucine, L-[3,4,5-3H(N)], Perkin Elmer). <sup>14</sup>C-alanine was added at 0.5 μCi·ml<sup>-1</sup> and <sup>3</sup>H-leucine was added at 4.4 μCi·ml<sup>-1</sup>. Zero time points were taken for solutions containing protoplasts without radiolabel as well as solutions containing only radiolabel.</p>
<p>Three separate experimental replicates of 1 ml protoplast/isotope label solution were analyzed per transgenic line per time point. Protoplast uptake of both <sup>14</sup>C-alanine and <sup>3</sup>H-leucine was analyzed at 10 min, 45 min, and 2 hrs. At the end of each time point, protoplast solutions were centrifuged for 1.5 min at 187 g and 50 μl of supernatant removed and placed in a scintillation vial (Fisher Scientific) for analysis in the liquid scintillation counter (Beckman, LS 6000TA). Once all time points had been completed, 1 ml of bleach was added to each scintillation vial. Samples were gently swirled overnight at room temperature in the dark.</p>
<p>After approximately 13 hours, samples were removed from the shaker and placed in a fumehood, lids removed, for &gt;3 hrs, then 5 ml hionic fluor (Perkin Elmer, 6013311) was added to each scintillation vial, and lids were replaced.

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Phenotypic similarity between individual plant lines expressing the same AlaAT construct in all plate assay conditions was assessed via one-way ANOVA (α = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Independent insertion lines did not show significant, consistent variation in either background in any of the conditions assayed and therefore data from all three insertion lines for a given <italic>AlaAT</italic> was pooled. Final tap root lengths of control plants and transgenic lines were compared using two-way ANOVA (α = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), analyzing the genotype of plants and the lighting block plants were grown in. Two-way ANOVA (α = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and Bonferroni post-tests were used to compare mean tap root length and genotype respectively, between both controls and transgenics and between different transgenic lines. Statistical significance indicated in all figures is the difference between the controls and transgenics at that time point or in that block and does not denote if the overall genotype is significant. A two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-tests (α = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), were also used to compare dpm counts between transgenic and control lines (n = 3), taking into account both differences in genotype and time point.</p>
<p>Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) were used to analyze differences in AlaAT activity between transgenic and control plants (n = 3–6), as well as compare all lines to Col-0 for the soluble sugar analysis (α = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). (The majority of lines for the soluble sugar analysis were analyzed in biological triplicate, with a few lines analyzed in duplicate.)

<title>GUS expression in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> using a rice <italic>OsAnt1</italic> promoter</title>
<p><italic>OsAnt1</italic>, a root-specific promoter from the rice <italic>aldehyde dehydrogenase 1</italic> gene, had previously been chosen to drive <italic>AlaAT</italic> expression in NUE rice; however, to our knowledge, it had never been used to drive gene expression in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. <italic>OsAnt1</italic> driving <italic>GUS</italic> was transformed into Arabidopsis plants, both Col-0 and <italic>alaat1;2</italic> knockout backgrounds, and analyzed for tissue-specific expression (<xref rid="pone.0121830.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Like expression of this promoter in rice [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], genes driven by <italic>OsAnt1</italic> in Arabidopsis are highly expressed in roots and root tips of seedlings, as well as throughout the vasculature of the plant. No GUS expression was detected in control plants (data not shown). Phenotypic results were consistent between independent insertion lines for both backgrounds.</p>

No expression of any of the transgenes was detected in control lines. No significant difference in the relative expression level of the control transcript, <italic>UBQ6</italic>, was observed between control and transgenic plants (<xref rid="pone.0121830.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref>), verifying the fold alterations observed in the expression of the transgenes relative to the Col-0 and <italic>alaat1;2</italic> backgrounds. A large amount of variation between transgenic lines expressing the same construct was observed. Differences in expression levels between transgenic lines carrying the same construct DNA are not uncommon, as the site of integration and other genetic factors can have a significant impact on the overall expression of the inserted gene, even resulting in silencing [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

<title>Transgenic <italic>AlaAT</italic> over-expressing plants show increased AlaAT enzyme activity</title>
<p>To further validate the expression of the transgenes as well as production of introduced protein, AlaAT enzyme activity assays were conducted. Transgenics in both the Col-0 and <italic>alaat1;2</italic> backgrounds displayed activity from protein fractions that was similar to or significantly greater than that from control plants (<xref rid="pone.0121830.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0121830.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>). Lines which showed significant increases in AlaAT enzyme activity include: OsAnt1:HvAlaAT-1 and-3, 35S:MmAlaAT1–1, -2 and-3, 35S:MmAlaAT2–1, -2 and 35S:PfAlaAT-2 and-3 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="pone.0121830.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

<p>From these results, and the observation that AlaAT activity did not significantly decrease in any of the transgenic lines relative to the controls, several assumptions can be made: 1) the AlaAT activity in the <italic>alaat1;2</italic> knockout line is close to zero [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and the addition of a foreign AlaAT enzyme increases activity in all cases (<xref rid="pone.0121830.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>),2) expression or over-expression of the transgenic AlaAT enzyme(s) does not interfere with the native AlaAT enzyme(s) activity (<xref rid="pone.0121830.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>),3) the foreign AlaAT protein is being made and is active <italic>in vivo</italic> and, 4) mRNA levels determined through RT-PCR do not always correlate with activity levels in full-protein fractions. This last point is particularly interesting in the case of 35S:MmAlaAT1–5, which did not show <italic>MmAlaAT1</italic> transcript but did show significantly increased activity levels relative to the knockout line (<xref rid="pone.0121830.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>). However, in Arabidopsis, it has been reported that only 27–46% of tested proteins will correlate in abundance with that of the mRNA [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore these findings, that many of the <italic>AlaAT</italic> mRNA levels do not correlate with protein activity levels, are not surprising and instead give support that transgenic AlaAT mRNA is being converted to active protein <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

Two-way ANOVA (α = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) indicated that in the Col-0 background, the genotype of the transgenic plants played a significant role in the rate of tap root growth, at these three time points (0–5, 5–8 and 8–12 DAS), for only those lines containing <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>HvAlaAT</italic>, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>MmAlaAT1</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>PfAlaAT</italic> (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). <italic>MmAlaAT1</italic>-expressing plants (Col-0 background) were the only lines to show increased rate of tap root growth in both limiting and non-limiting N conditions between 0–5 and 5–8 DAS (<xref rid="pone.0121830.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0121830.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5H Fig.</xref>).</p>
<p>Final tap root lengths were assessed at 18 DAS, due to onset of plant senescence. Plant genotype was determined to again be highly significant in relation to tap root length in both backgrounds (one-way ANOVA, α = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="pone.0121830.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig.</xref>). Post-hoc analysis indicated that those lines in the null background containing <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>HvalaAT</italic>, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>MmAlaAT2</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>PfAlaAT</italic> were significantly different from <italic>alaat1;2</italic> (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, analysis indicated that none of the lines over-expressing <italic>AlaAT</italic> in the Col-0 background showed increased tap root growth relative to wild-type (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), as was observed in the non-limiting N condition.</p>
<p>Previously, increases in tap root length and number of primary lateral roots have been characterized as “foraging” strategies, indicating N limitation in plants; conversely, inhibition of tap root lengthening and lateral root emergence have indicated N-replete conditions [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It has also been shown that not only the supply of N, but also the demand for N by the plant can play a pivotal role in root architecture (nitrogen economics), resulting in increases in root growth and lateral root emergence in N-rich conditions if the demand for N by the plant (shoot to root signalling) is strong enough [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Given that the root phenotypes observed in this study occurred under both N-depleted and N-replete conditions, it appears that the increases in tap root length and rate of growth are due to increased N demand from the plants, and not due to N foraging responses.</p>
<p>The rate of growth of plants over-expressing AlaAT in the Col-0 background, under N-limiting conditions, indicates possible differences in NUE based on AlaAT variant and promoter. Under N-poor conditions, early tap root growth was significantly higher only in those plants expressing non-mitochondrial AlaAT variants with a constitutive promoter (<xref rid="pone.0121830.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig.</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>MmAlaAT1</italic>-expressing plants (Col-0 background) were the only lines to show increased rate of tap root growth in both limiting and non-limiting N conditions between 0–5 and 5–8 DAS. This suggests that over-expression of this enzyme could have the most significant effect on plant NUE. Overall, it was shown here that, initial expression of <italic>AlaAT</italic> during germination can result in an increased NUE phenotype, depending on <italic>AlaAT</italic> variant and external N conditions, indicating that to achieve maximum NUE, the <italic>AlaAT</italic> variant: promoter combination must be tailored to the environmental N conditions.</p>
<p>A greater understanding of the role of AlaAT and <italic>AlaAT</italic> over-expression has benefitted from the availability of a double knockout background (<italic>alaat1;2</italic>) in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>, which is not currently available in rice or canola. In the Col-0 background, over-expression of any of the <italic>AlaAT</italic> genes would result in a gain of function (GOF) but, determining if this is a gain-of-the-same gene function or gain-of-a-different gene function is not possible. Analysis of the expression of these genes in the <italic>alaat1;2</italic> background showed the same phenotypes (increased tap root growth and increased lateral root number) as over-expression in the Col-0 background. Thus, expression of <italic>AlaAT</italic> in the <italic>alaat1;2</italic> background rescued tap root growth and lateral root growth in the mutant, demonstrating that these phenotypes are the result of a gain-of-the-same gene function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>AlaAT</italic> expression increases number of primary lateral roots</title>
<p>Arabidopsis primary lateral roots have shown to increase in proliferation when exposed to patches of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This increase in lateral root number has been characterized as a key morphological response of Arabidopsis roots colonizing N-rich zones [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

As a result of these opposing N responses, alterations in the ability to either sense external N or in the distribution of internal root NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> could alter these morphological responses. In order to more accurately assess any differences in the ability of AlaAT transgenic plants to respond to N in the environment the number of primary lateral roots per plant was counted at two separate time points. Initially, plates containing only Col-0 were grown and monitored to determine timing of lateral root emergence. It was determined that counting lateral roots should be carried out at both 8 and 11 DAS. In general, <italic>AlaAT</italic>-expressing plants showed an increased number of primary lateral roots in comparison to control plants (<xref rid="pone.0121830.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).

In these N environments, significant differences in tap root growth were not observed by transgenics expressed in the <italic>alaat1;2</italic> background (data not shown). Between 9–11 DAS and 11–15 DAS all transgenic lines expressed in the Col-0 background showed highly significant increases in tap root growth (<xref rid="pone.0121830.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (two-way ANOVA, α = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

Overall, these results are interesting given that previous analyses of Arabidopsis, and other plants grown using either glutamate or alanine as the sole N source have shown inhibition of root or overall plant growth, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

<p>Soluble sugars have many roles in plants apart from acting as direct precursor molecules for glycolysis to produce energy and reducing power [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Sucrose is an important source to sink C transport molecule (via the phloem), and along with the soluble sugars glucose and fructose acts as a signaling molecule connected with, but not limited to, the regulation of N and C metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], metabolite transport [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], seed and embryo development [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], transition to flowering [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and plant stress responses (ie: light intensity) [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].

In order to better understand the growth phenotypes observed when C and N conditions were varied, an analysis of the soluble sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose) was carried out. When the results of each analysis were pooled according to transgenic lines harboring the same construct a distinct pattern was observed. For each of these soluble sugars, transgenic plants showed slightly decreased average concentrations relative to Col-0, however only in plants expressing <italic>OsAnt1</italic>:<italic>HvAlaAT</italic> were these decreases shown to be significant (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test, α = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

The uptake of each radiolabel was assessed in triplicate at three different time points, 10 min, 45 min and 2 hrs, for each independent insertion line. Col-0 and <italic>alaat1;2</italic> mesophyll protoplasts were utilized as controls and a two-way ANOVA (α = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) was used to determine if genotype or time had a significant impact on protoplast uptake of either compound. Overall, it was determined that both genotype and time had a significant effect on the uptake of both amino acids (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The interaction between these two variables was also shown to be highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) for both amino acids (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Post-hoc tests were used to compare the uptake of both radiolabels in the transgenic <italic>AlaAT</italic> over-expressing lines with Col-0 directly. The <italic>alaat1;2</italic> knockout line was also compared to Col-0 using this method.</p>

<p>While these results are based on the uptake by the protoplasts specifically, it should be noted that the amount of label (both <sup>3</sup>H-leucine and <sup>14</sup>C-alanine) left in the supernatant from each experiment confirmed the trends observed for both radiolabels for each genotype and time point. At the 10 min time point, neither amino acid showed any significant differences in uptake between any of the lines analyzed (<xref rid="pone.0121830.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig.</xref>). Forty-five minutes after addition of the label to the protoplasts, significant decreases in uptake of both amino acids were seen in two lines, OsAnt1:HvAlaAT-2 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, both amino acids) and 35S:HvAlaAT-3 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, both amino acids) (<xref rid="pone.0121830.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig.</xref>). None of the over-expressing lines showed significant increases in uptake at this point. The <italic>alaat1;2</italic> line showed the highest uptake of both radiolabelled compounds.</p>
<p>At the 2 hr time point significant alterations in the uptake of the two amino acids in the different <italic>AlaAT</italic> over-expressing lines was observed (<xref rid="pone.0121830.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Two lines showed significant decreases in the uptake of both amino acids: OsAnt1:HvAlaAT-3 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, both amino acids) and OsAnt1:HvAlaAT-3 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, both amino acids). The line 35S:HvAlaAT-3 showed significant decreases in uptake of <sup>14</sup>C-alanine at this time point (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), but not <sup>3</sup>H-leucine. None of the lines expressing either <italic>MmAlaAT1</italic> or <italic>PfAlaAT</italic> showed significant decreases in uptake.</p>
<p>Only one of the lines expressing <italic>HvAlaAT</italic>, OsAnt1:HvAlaAT-1, showed significant increases in amino acid uptake, and this was only for leucine (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The line 35S:MmAlaAT1–3 also showed significant uptake of leucine at this time point (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Lines that showed significant uptake of both amino acids at the 2 hr time point included: 35S:MmAlaAT1–2 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for <sup>3</sup>H-leucine and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for <sup>14</sup>C-alanine), 35S:PfAlaAT-2 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for both amino acids), 35S:PfAlaAT-3 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for both amino acids), 35S:PfAlaAT-1 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for <sup>3</sup>H-leucine and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for <sup>14</sup>C-alanine) and <italic>alaat1;2</italic> (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for both amino acids). Notably, all three transgenic lines carrying <italic>PfAlaAT</italic> showed significantly increased uptake of both alanine and leucine; this was the only <italic>AlaAT</italic> to have all independent insertion lines demonstrate significantly increased uptake of both amino acids (<xref rid="pone.0121830.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). These results indicate that the amino acid/N concentration in <italic>PfAlaAT</italic>-expressing mesophyll cells is significantly altered relative to Col-0 and the other transgenic lines analyzed, presumably due to alterations in N assimilation and mobilization/remobilization within the plant.</p>
<p>The similarity in uptake of cells expressing both <italic>OsAnt1</italic>:<italic>HvAlaAT</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>HvAlaAT</italic> is also of interest for a variety of reasons. While <italic>OsAnt1</italic>:<italic>HvAlaAT</italic> is hypothetically not expressed (or expressed at a very low level) in mesophyll cells, cells containing both of the <italic>HvAlaAT</italic> constructs appeared to behave in a similar manner. This result indicates one of two things: 1) at later stages of development in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> the <italic>OsAnt1</italic> promoter is more highly expressed in leaf tissues than in rice, or 2) high expression of <italic>HvAlaAT</italic> (or possibly any <italic>AlaAT</italic>) in the roots is the main driving force for all successive alterations in plant N metabolism, regardless of expression in shoot tissues. More studies, specifically using different promoters driving <italic>AlaAT</italic> variants in either Arabidopsis or cereal crops, are necessary to decipher between these two possibilities.</p>

<title><italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> plants over-expressing <italic>MmAlaAT1</italic> and <italic>HvAlaAT</italic> constitutively show increased leaf area</title>
<p>A subset of plants grown for the analysis of uptake by mesophyll protoplast cells were analysed for alterations in rosette leaf area. Pictures of Arabidopsis plants to be used for protoplast uptake were analyzed using WinRHIZO Arabidopsis 2013d software to determine average rosette leaf area (cm<sup>2</sup>) between several of the lines (<xref rid="pone.0121830.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Fig.</xref>). All transgenic lines showed increases in rosette leaf area when compared to Col-0. However, relative to Col-0, only lines 35S:HvAlaAT-3 and 35S:MmAlaAT1-1 showed significant increases in rosette leaf area (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test, α = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). NUE rice plants over-expressing <italic>HvAlaAT</italic> have shown increased biomass and yields compared to control plants [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], validating the results observed in this study.

These results validate previous results and further support the use of Arabidopsis to study NUE.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The characterization done here shows the effects of over-expressing <italic>AlaAT</italic> variants in two backgrounds (wild-type and null) under two different promoters and indicates not only that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> can be a useful model for the study of NUE in cereals crops, but also that there are variations in the observed NUE phenotype of Arabidopsis plants expressing different <italic>AlaAT</italic> homologues. There are also variations in the NUE phenotype when the same variant is driven by a constitutive versus tissue-specific promoter. These alterations in NUE phenotype can be observed both physically (tap root growth and shoot leaf area) and physiologically (partitioning of soluble sugars and amino acid uptake), and provide support for previous physical and metabolic phenotypes observed when <italic>HvAlaAT</italic> was over-expressed in both canola and rice. We also show here that the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetic differences between homologous AlaAT enzymes observed in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0121830.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] can result in <italic>in vivo</italic> alterations in overall N and C metabolism. This implies that certain AlaAT variants may be more sensitive to alterations in substrate levels, and therefore regulate the reaction direction more acutely in response to environmental changes and internal alterations in N, C or both N and C. This re-affirms the idea that the desired NUE phenotype may be highly dependent not only on over-expression of <italic>AlaAT</italic>, but also on the <italic>AlaAT</italic> variant, the promoter chosen, and the specific environmental conditions of the plant as well as the plant species/ecotype of interest.</p>
