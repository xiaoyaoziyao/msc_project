<abstract>
<p>Plastic debris has been documented in many marine ecosystems, including remote coastlines, the water column, the deep sea, and subtropical gyres. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), colloquially called the “Great Pacific Garbage Patch,” has been an area of particular scientific and public concern. However, quantitative assessments of the extent and variability of plastic in the NPSG have been limited. Here, we quantify the distribution, abundance, and size of plastic in a subset of the eastern Pacific (approximately 20–40°N, 120–155°W) over multiple spatial scales. Samples were collected in Summer 2009 using surface and subsurface plankton net tows and quantitative visual observations, and Fall 2010 using surface net tows only. We documented widespread, though spatially variable, plastic pollution in this portion of the NPSG and adjacent waters. The overall median microplastic numerical concentration in Summer 2009 was 0.448 particles m<sup>−2</sup> and in Fall 2010 was 0.021 particles m<sup>−2</sup>, but plastic concentrations were highly variable over the submesoscale (10 s of km). Size-frequency spectra were skewed towards small particles, with the most abundant particles having a cross-sectional area of approximately 0.01 cm<sup>2</sup>. Most microplastic was found on the sea surface, with the highest densities detected in low-wind conditions. The numerical majority of objects were small particles collected with nets, but the majority of debris surface area was found in large objects assessed visually. Our ability to detect high-plastic areas varied with methodology, as stations with substantial microplastic did not necessarily also contain large visually observable objects. A power analysis of our data suggests that high variability of surface microplastic will make future changes in abundance difficult to detect without substantial sampling effort. Our findings suggest that assessment and monitoring of oceanic plastic debris must account for high spatial variability, particularly in regards to the evaluation of initiatives designed to reduce marine debris.</p>

<p>Plastic pollution has rapidly increased over the past several decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Barnes1">[3]</xref>. Floating plastic was first documented in the North Pacific and North Atlantic subtropical gyres in the early 1970s, with observations of both microplastic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Carpenter1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Wong1">[10]</xref> and large objects such as bottles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Venrick1">[11]</xref>.

Since the 1990s, there is some question as to whether plastic density has continued to increase, since high spatial and temporal heterogeneity make shorter-term trends difficult to discern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Ryan1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>The spatial distribution of plastic marine debris is influenced by multiple interacting factors.

<p>Assessing the spatial distribution of debris is important to understanding its environmental significance. Therefore, our objective in this study was to examine the abundance and variability of debris during two cruises in the eastern North Pacific. To this end, we asked the following questions: 1) What is the spatial abundance and distribution of pelagic microplastic in comparison to biophysical variables? 2) What is the size-frequency spectrum of oceanic plastic, and how does methodology affect estimates of its abundance?</p>

<title>Study area</title>
<p>This study focused on a subset of the eastern North Pacific between the west coast of the United States and Hawaii, between approximately 20–40°N, 120–155°W. This area was selected for two reasons: a) proximity to the North Pacific Atmospheric High, under which debris is thought to collect; and b) ship time logistics. Cruise tracks and sampling locations are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080020-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Net samples</title>
<p>From 2–20 August 2009, samples (n = 119) were collected on the Scripps Environmental Accumulation of Plastic Expedition (SEAPLEX) cruise on the R/V <italic>New Horizon</italic>. SEAPLEX samples presented here include: manta tows taken at predetermined times, manta and bongo tows taken on station, and visual observations of macrodebris taken between stations. SEAPLEX sampling also includes the manta tows and visual observations described in the <italic>Submesoscale sampling schemata</italic> section below. For manta tows taken at predetermined times, a single tow was taken either every 6 hours (ship local time 0300, 0900, 1500, 2100) or every 3 hours (ship local time 0000, 0300, 0600, 0900, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2100) depending on the ship time available. Because the ship traveled at 18.5 km hr<sup>−1</sup>, these tows were spaced approximately 74–111 km apart.</p>
<p>Three stations were selected to target high-plastic areas in the NPSG, and were compared to one reference station in the California Current off San Diego. The high-plastic stations were selected using visual observations and tow results, and the reference station was pre-selected. While on station, surface (manta) tow (n = 8 per station) and subsurface (bongo) tows (n = 6 per station) were performed as close to station coordinates as possible. Both types of tow were evenly split between day and night. Throughout this cruise, conditions in the NPSG were calm and glassy (Beaufort Sea State 1–2), and conditions in the California Current were also mild (Beaufort Sea State 3–4).</p>
<p>From 19–29 October 2010, samples (n = 28) were collected on the EX1006 leg of the Always Exploring Expedition on the NOAA ship <italic>Okeanos Explorer</italic>. Samples from this cruise include only manta tow samples taken at predetermined times (ship time 0600, 1200, and 1800) during daylight hours. Conditions were mild to moderate, ranging from Beaufort Sea State 2 off Hawaii, to 5 off California.</p>
<p>Manta tows on both cruises were collected using a standard manta net (0.86×0.2 m) with 333 µm mesh towed for 15 minutes at 0.7–1 m s<sup>−1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Brown1">[27]</xref>. Water volume flowing through the net was measured with a calibrated General Oceanics analog flowmeter. The manta net samples the two-dimensional air-sea interface so concentrations are preferentially given in square meters, but when conversion to cubic meters is necessary, the depth sampled is assumed to be the 0.2 m dimension of the net opening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Kramer1">[28]</xref>. The SEAPLEX samples were fixed in 1.8% formaldehyde buffered with sodium borate, and the EX1006 samples were fixed in 95% ethanol. No specific permissions were required for samples, since they were taken in federal or international waters and did not involve protected species.</p>
<p>Subsurface samples were collected on SEAPLEX using a CalCOFI bongo net (pair of circular frames 71 cm in diameter, 202 µm mesh). The bongo net was deployed in an oblique tow with a maximum depth of 210 meters for 15 minutes and retrieved at a constant speed, which ensures equal time at each depth and represents an integrated measure of the water column. As with the manta tow, water through the net was measured with a calibrated flowmeter. Upon retrieval the nets were washed carefully and the contents of one net preserved in 1.8% formaldehyde buffered with sodium borate. Six repeated bongo tows were conducted per station for a total of n = 24.</p>
<p>Each net tow sample was sorted for microplastic at 6–12× magnification under a Wild M-5 dissecting microscope, and plastic particles removed for further analysis. A subset of plastic particles (n = 557) were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and all were confirmed to be plastic. Visual inspection of the plastic particles in this study was therefore deemed to be sufficient to confirm plastic identity.</p>
<p>Plastic particles were soaked in deionized water to remove salts, dried at 60°C, and stored in a vacuum desiccator. Dry mass was measured on an analytical balance. Particles were then digitally imaged with a Zooscan digital scanner with a resolution of 10.6 µm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Gilfillan1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Gorsky1">[30]</xref>. The total number of particles as well as two-dimensional surface area and maximum diameter were measured using NIH ImageJ-based tools in the Zooprocess software, and calibrated against manual measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Gilfillan1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Gorsky1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>Dry mass of zooplankton was obtained from preserved manta tow samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Omori1">[31]</xref>. After fixation in 1.8% formaldehyde for 24 months, samples were split in a Folsom splitter, filtered onto 202 µm Nitex mesh disks and rinsed with isotonic ammonium formate. Filters were dried for 24 hours at 60°C and placed in a vacuum dessicator until weighing. Filters were weighed to the nearest 0.0001 gram on the same analytical balance as the plastic samples. A 20% correction factor was applied in order to compensate for the biomass lost by preservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Omori1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Omori2">[32]</xref>. Ratios were calculated by dividing microplastic dry mass by zooplankton dry mass.</p>

<title>Visual observations</title>
<p>Visual observer counts for macrodebris on SEAPLEX were conducted by a single observer (A.J.T.) on one side of the flying bridge at 10 m eye height above sea level, while the vessel was transiting between stations. Because of the great differences in ship speed between transit areas and station areas, visual counts were limited to the transit areas only. Visual counts do not directly coincide with towed net samples (on station) because the visual counts were originally intended to be compared with marine bird counts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Mumby1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>The observer surveyed on one side of the track-line, based on sighting conditions (e.g., glare and wind). Sampling followed standardized line distance methods as follows in order to produce more accurate abundance estimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Buckland1">[33]</xref>. All marine debris sighted to the horizon was counted and assigned to one of seven pre-determined distance bins based on perpendicular distance from the ship. The distance bins used were 0–10, 10–50, 50–100, 100–200, 200–300, 300–600 and &gt;600 m. Distance to the observed object was determined using a hand held range finder which consisted of a rod marked with the distance bins so that when held with its end up to the horizon would allow for a visualization of the distance bins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Heinemann1">[34]</xref>. Observed debris was also assigned to one of three pre-determined size classes based on its larger dimension: small (2–10 cm), medium (10–30 cm), large (&gt;30 cm). Only three size classes were chosen because of the large amount of material observed and the need to be able to quickly classify and record it in order to allow for greater detection probability.</p>
<p>The color of each piece and a description (material type, dimensions) were also recorded. The favorable environmental and ocean conditions during the cruise allowed for maximum detection of debris size and color. Sizes of debris objects were determined from comparisons with debris pieces of known size, such as tubing, bottle caps or buoys and the longest dimension recorded. To convert observed diameter into two-dimensional area, visually observed objects were assumed to be circular. While describing observed debris based on its longest dimension is not ideal due to the irregular shapes of most pieces of debris, this method was deemed appropriate based on the volume of debris being sighted and has been used in other visual observation studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Ryan2">[21]</xref>. Of the items observed, 95.5% were solid plastic. Line, and polystyrene made up the majority of the rest of the 4.5% and only a few pieces were identified as glass, wood, or other. These were excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>The distance data were used to determine the effective strip width (ESW) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Buckland1">[33]</xref> for each type of debris based on size and color using DISTANCE 6 software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Thomas1">[35]</xref>. We considered three size classes (small, medium, large) and three color classes (white, high visibility, low visibility). Because of the favorable environmental conditions during this cruise we were able to use all marine debris sightings throughout the entire range of sea states encountered (Beaufort range 0–4) after determining that there was no significant decrease in detectability with increasing sea state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Titmus1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>We next calculated the detection function using the model which best described the sighting distance distribution and minimized Aikake's Information Criteria (AIC). Then, we calculated a correction factor which was used to standardize the apparent densities of each of the marine debris groups to the group with the widest ESW <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Ballance1">[37]</xref>. The total number of sightings for each debris group was multiplied by its correction factor to create a corrected number of sightings, and densities for each group were determined by dividing the corrected number of sightings by the effective area surveyed (survey distance×maximum ESW). Distance traveled was determined using the GPS locations of the ship at the start and end of each survey section. Additional details on visual counts can be found in Titmus &amp; Hyrenbach 2011 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Titmus1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>Visual measurements were matched with net tow measurements taken within 25 km of each other (n = 23 pairs). Because both sets of samples were taken along the cruise track transect, these are point measurements without replication, with the exception of the submesoscale sampling schemata described below.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Submesoscale sampling schemata</title>
<p>Two submesoscale sampling protocols (stations spaced at 10 and 18 km) were used on the SEAPLEX cruise. These sampling protocols, done in addition to the net samples above, were designed to examine plastic abundance and variability on a smaller scale (10 s of km) than on the mesoscale (100 s–1000 s of km) cruise-track-wide sampling described above. First a grid pattern was deployed on August 12, 2009 centered around 30°48.6′N, 139°45.9′W. Designed to examine microplastic spatial variation on a 40 km grid, it consisted of 16 manta tows taken 10 km apart in a 4 by 4 grid pattern. The second was a line pattern deployed on August 15, 2009 proceeding west from 34°3.4′N, 141°22.4′W. Designed to compare microplastic and macroplastic abundance and variance, the line consisted of 4 stations of 5 repeated manta tows, for a total of 20 manta tows. The four stations were 18 km apart. Visual transect sampling of plastic macrodebris was performed between tow stations. To compare visual observations with net tow observations, visual observations were combined in over-the-ground bins of 900 meters in length. Due to calm conditions, the average net tow also covered 900 meters of over-the-ground distance. Macrodebris observations for 9 km on either side of a tow station were associated with the net tows from that station.</p>

<p>Sea surface temperature was mapped over the study area using remotely sensed data from MODIS-Aqua and MODIS-Terra. Maps were created from monthly composites of the calendar month in which each cruise took place (August 2009 and October 2010). Chlorophyll was mapped using monthly composites of SeaWiFS Level-2. Both sets of maps were created by Mati Kahru (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Kahru1">[38]</xref>. These satellite images were used post-cruise to assign sampling stations to a water mass (California Current, transition region, North Pacific Subtropical Gyre) for the purposes of comparing the ratio of plastic to zooplankton biomass. Since the water mass assignments are based solely off surface data, they should be viewed as highly approximate.</p>
<p>True wind data were collected on the R/V <italic>New Horizon</italic> during SEAPLEX using an RM Young 85000 ultrasonic anemometer mounted in the starboard side of the ship's superstructure 11 m above the waterline. Data were downloaded from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography MetAcq System where true wind was derived from ship heading, course over ground, speed, and relative wind speed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Smith1">[39]</xref>. True wind data were collected on the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer during EX1006 using an RM Young 05106 aerovane mounted atop the ship's superstructure 17.7 m above the waterline. Data were downloaded from the ship SCS data system where true wind was derived from ship heading, course over ground, speed, and relative wind speed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Smith1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>To compare the particle concentration to true wind speed, the microplastic particle concentration anomaly (from particles collected in manta tows) was compared to the true wind speed anomaly for each cruise. The anomaly was the difference between individual measurements of the particle concentration and the overall mean particle concentration, or between the individual true wind speed measurements and the mean true wind speed for the entire time series. Wind speed data recorded during particle sampling (manta net tows) were extracted from the full record of true wind data from each cruise and used in these analyses.</p>
<p>Fisch (2010) documented potential differences in wind speed between the sensor types used in these two cruises, finding that the ultrasonic anemometer measurements can be 0.3 m s<sup>−1</sup> faster than the aerovane for average speed and 1.0 m s<sup>−1</sup> faster at maximum speeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Fisch1">[40]</xref>. We sampled a range of wind speeds within the average wind speeds experienced in the Fisch study. Therefore, while intercalibration between the two ships was not conducted, it is assumed that it may be possible that the ultrasonic anemometer data from the SEAPLEX cruise may be 0.3 m/s faster than the aerovane data from the EX1006.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The semivariogram, often abbreviated variogram, describes how data covary with distance, and can reveal large-scale spatial patterns in highly variable data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Kaluzny1">[41]</xref>. Semivariogram interpretation is based on the principle that pairs of samples that are closer to each other are more similar than pairs of samples farther apart. The semivariogram function should therefore increase with distance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Yoder1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Doney1">[43]</xref>. Above a certain distance, sample pairs may no longer be correlated, and the semivariogram function may reach a steady value, or “sill.”</p>
<p>We used semivariograms to compare the spatial distribution of microplastic to standard biophysical variables of temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll-<italic>a</italic> fluorescence for the Summer 2009 dataset. Semivariograms could not be calculated for Fall 2010 due to an insufficient sample size. The standard empirical semivariogram is calculated as<disp-formula id="pone.0080020.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0080020.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>N(h)</italic> is the set of all pairwise Euclidean distances <italic>i - j = h</italic>, |<italic>N(h)</italic>| is the number of distinct pairs in <italic>N(h)</italic>, and <italic>z<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>z<sub>j</sub></italic> are data values at spatial locations <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Kaluzny1">[41]</xref>. Because the standard semivariogram equation is sensitive to skewness in the data, we instead calculated the empirical semivariogram using the robust semivariogram estimator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Cressie1">[44]</xref>. This method is based on the square root of the absolute value of the data value differences, <italic>|z<sub>i</sub>−z<sub>j</sub>|<sup>1/2</sup></italic>, rather than the squares of the differences.<disp-formula id="pone.0080020.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0080020.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>Semivariograms were computed with the geoR package (version 1.7-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Ribeiro1">[45]</xref> and fitted with either a linear or Gaussian model.</p>
<p>We conducted a power analysis on the Summer 2009 dataset to estimate the sample sizes that would be necessary to detect changes in microplastic abundance. This was calculated by multiplying the Summer 2009 dataset (n = 119) by a factor of increase (e.g., 20%, 30%, etc.), then using Monte Carlo simulations (1,000 simulations per test) to determine if the Mann-Whitney U test could detect the plastic increase with 95% confidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Mumby1">[46]</xref>. The power was determined by the percentage of the Monte Carlo simulations with a p-value of less than 0.05 – for example, if the null hypothesis was rejected in 80% of the simulations, the power would be 0.8. We also used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the adequacy of sampling for the complete microplastic dataset. To do this, we combined the Summer 2009 and Fall 2010 data and fit them to a negative exponential function. We used the rate of change parameter derived from the data (rate = 1.44) to generate 5 sets of randomly deviating exponential distributions with sample sizes between n = 2 and n = 1,000 (4,995 simulations in total). We then calculated and plotted the standard deviation for each distribution.</p>
<p>We computed all statistics using the R statistical environment (version R-2.13.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-R1">[47]</xref>. Data were non-normal so nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U, Spearman rank correlation) were used. Data from this study are deposited with the California Current Ecosystem LTER DataZoo.</p>

<title>Spatial variation in distribution and abundance of plastic debris</title>
<p>The Summer 2009 cruise track covered 4,400 km, with 1,343 km of visual observations, 119 manta tows, and 24 bongo tows. On this cruise, 3,464 pieces of plastic marine debris were sighted through visual observation, 30,518 microplastic particles were collected by manta tow, and 324 microplastic particles were collected by bongo tow. The Fall 2010 cruise track covered 3,800 km, with 28 manta tows that collected 1,572 plastic particles.</p>
<p>In both years, the highest concentrations of manta-tow collected microplastic were found offshore, rather than adjacent to coastlines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080020-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Median plastic densities, 5<sup>th</sup>–95<sup>th</sup> percentiles, and maximums are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080020-t001">Table 1</xref>. In both years, the size distribution of particles collected by net tow was skewed towards the smaller end of the size spectrum, with the most abundant particles having an area of approximately 0.01 cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080020-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). During Summer 2009 at stations in the California Current and NPSG, significantly higher particle densities were found in the neuston than in the integrated water column from the sea surface to 210 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080020-g003">Fig. 3</xref>; Mann-Whitney U test, p&lt;0.01).

The line consisted of 4 stations of 5 repeated manta tows, for a total of 20 manta tows. The four stations were 18 km apart.

<p>Plastic concentrations were also highly variable over the large scale. Over the 2009 cruise track, the semivariance of plastic concentrations was negatively correlated with sample distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080020-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). A negative correlation suggests that samples that were taken close together were more different from each other than samples that were taken far apart, an illogical result that is most likely an artifact of relatively high variability and low sample size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Kaluzny1">[41]</xref>. In contrast, the semivariance of temperature, salinity, and fluorescence all increased with distance between sampling sites, showing the expected result that samples taken close together were more similar to each other than samples taken far apart, though none reached a sill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080020-g004">Fig. 4b–d</xref>).</p>

Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and p-values were rho = −0.567 and p = &lt;0.0001 for Summer 2009, and rho = −0.427 and p = 0.027 for Fall 2010.

<p>High variability may also cause changes in microplastic abundance to be difficult to detect. A power analysis of the 2009 data found that a high number of samples would be needed to detect increases or decreases in microplastic with reasonable probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080020-g006">Fig. 6a</xref>). For example, using a power of 80%, plastic abundance would need to increase by 90% to be detectable with a sample size of n = 100. Under the same adequacy, detection of a 50% increase in microplastic would require a sample size of n = 240. Overall variance may be somewhat reduced by increasing the sample size, but would remain relatively substantial even with increased sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080020-g006">Fig. 6b</xref>). While a sample size of n = 250 would be preferable, the Summer 2009 sample size of n = 119 was reasonably adequate. However, the Fall 2010 sample size of n = 28 was insufficient to resolve variance.</p>

The extremely high concentrations of microplastic found in this study may be due to calm, glassy conditions that allowed less buoyant particles to rise to the air-sea interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Kukulka1">[20]</xref> and due to a sampling scheme that deliberately targeted high-plastic areas. Nonetheless, our finding of a median plastic concentration nearly double that of the highest plastic concentrations found in past studies suggests that microplastic contamination of the NPSG mixed layer may be more substantial than previously thought.</p>
<p>Our ability to detect high-plastic areas varied with methodology. While visually-detected macroplastic was broadly correlated with net-tow-caught microplastic, these methods did not necessarily correlate on smaller (10 km) scales, and stations with substantial microplastic did not necessary also contain substantial macroplastic. This lack of correlation may be caused by limitations in the visual observation technique, differences in the forces that move different size classes of debris, and high sample variability. Visual estimates may have been hampered by the extremely high densities of marine debris in the smallest observable size class (2–10 cm), leading to an underestimate of overall visually observable debris. In addition, there is debate about how best to categorize the size of debris. In this study, we used only three broad size classes, while others have used a larger number of categories, each covering a smaller range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Ryan2">[21]</xref>. Since additional scales of classification require more time to record, a tradeoff must be made between the number of size classes recorded and an overall estimation of plastic abundance. In the future, visual underestimates in density would likely be resolved by restricting observations to certain types or size classes of macrodebris, or by observing over smaller defined strip widths along the cruise track <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Ryan2">[21]</xref>. There may also be a spatial mismatch in overall debris distribution due to the higher windage of macrodebris compared to microdebris. For example, in a study of estuarine benthic debris, Browne et al. (2010) found that low density macrodebris moved with the wind, but low density microdebris did not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Browne1">[19]</xref>. High sample variability may have been enhanced by a limited number of comparable visual and net tow observations, which a different study design could mitigate.</p>
<p>The calm conditions in Summer 2009 may also have contributed to our finding that microplastic was more abundant in the neuston than in the subsurface water column, since reduced winds resulted in less mixing of plastic particles from the neuston into the subsurface zone. This is supported by our finding that the highest particle concentrations were only detected in low-wind conditions. A similar pattern was found in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre by Kukulka et al. (2012), who estimated that 54% of plastic pieces are mixed below surface tow depths under average wind conditions. However, this pattern may not hold outside the subtropical gyres. For example, in the relatively windy California Current, Doyle et al. (2011) found more debris on the surface than in the subsurface water column <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Doyle1">[51]</xref>. We should note that the difference between surface and subsurface microplastic concentrations may be larger than presented here, since the subsurface bongo nets used finer mesh (202 µm) than the surface-sampling manta nets (333 µm). The calm conditions over much of Summer 2009 also allowed the clear visual observation of debris, including small pieces very close to the ship. Ryan (2013) determined the maximum detection rate to be 10–20 m from the ship, partially because the bow wave of the ship, combined with the sea conditions can hinder observations of debris in the 0–10 m distance bin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Ryan2">[21]</xref>. However, because of the sea conditions experienced during the Summer 2009 cruise, we were able to observe within this closest distance bin, although future studies should consider vessel used and the environmental conditions encountered when determining observation methodology.</p>
<p>Our use of a non-closing net and oblique tow technique means that the depth at which subsurface particles were collected is not known. However, 4.8% of non-vertically migrating planktivorous mesopelagic fishes collected on the same cruise had plastic particles in their stomachs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Davison1">[52]</xref>. Since these particles were too large to have been ingested by these fishes' prey, some plastic particles may be sinking outside the euphotic zone. Sinking may be influenced by biofouling-induced changes in density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-MoretFerguson1">[53]</xref>, although plastic has not been documented to be a significant component of the material collected in sediment traps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Law1">[50]</xref>. Both these studies and the findings reported here emphasize the need for more detailed observations of the vertical distribution of plastic during various wind conditions.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this study is the first size spectrum to include both micro- and macrodebris. Our finding of an overall negative exponential relationship between size and particle abundance has been found in some, but not all previous studies of sea surface microplastic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-HidalgoRuz1">[54]</xref>. Numerically dominant small particles may be more important for risks that depend on encounter frequency, such as ingestion, microbial growth, and ecotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Wright1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Zettler1">[55]</xref>. However, large items may be more important for risks that are surface area dependent, such as entanglement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Laist1">[56]</xref> and the transport of potentially invasive species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Gregory1">[57]</xref>. Such risks may potentially be mitigated by targeted removal of large objects.</p>
<p>Past studies have used the ratio of dry plastic mass to zooplankton biomass to assess the risk of debris ingestion by marine planktonic filter feeders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Moore1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Lattin1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Moore2">[59]</xref>. This approach, dubbed the “plastic to plankton ratio,” is problematic for a number of reasons described in Doyle et al. (2011), such as the high variance of both plastic and zooplankton in space and time, selective sampling by nets, and selective feeding by zooplankton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Doyle1">[51]</xref>. Our data confirm that this ratio is conflated with large-scale patterns of plastic abundance and, to a lesser extent, with time of day, though it should be noted that our sample size in certain areas (e.g., the California Current at crepuscular times) was very low. Though the ratio was not significantly correlated with zooplankton biomass over our sampling region, ephemeral high-biomass events may influence it. For example, ratios in the transition region during our sampling period spanned seven orders of magnitude due to a salp aggregation and spatially patchy microplastic, obscuring both the relative abundances of plankton and plastic.</p>
<p>However, the ratio of dry plastic mass to zooplankton biomass may be useful in assessing microplastic remediation schemes. Multiple plans to remove microplastic from the ocean have been proposed and received substantial public attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Haifley1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Knowles1">[62]</xref>. Using the ratio to examine the relative abundance of microplastic and plankton make the ecological ramifications of large-scale filtration of the neuston more apparent. For example, based on the median NPSG ratio of 1.368, approximately 731 mg of dry zooplankton biomass would be removed from the NPSG for each gram of plastic removed. This corresponds to approximately 330 mg of carbon removed, assuming carbon content is 0.40 of total zooplankton dry mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Beers1">[63]</xref>. Since overall productivity in the NPSG is estimated to be only 473 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Karl1">[64]</xref>, a remediation scheme that removed significant amounts of microplastic would likely have a substantial impact on surrounding plankton standing stocks and, consequently, on nutrient dynamics.</p>
<p>Public concern about plastic debris in marine ecosystems has grown in recent years, resulting in several governmental and non-governmental reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-STAPGEF1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-National1">[65]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Wurpel1">[67]</xref>. More recently, the 2011 Tohoku tsunami <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Bagulayan1">[68]</xref> and 2012 reauthorization of the United States Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act have raised the profile of this issue even more. However, the efficacy of changes in public policy, industry, or consumer behavior will be difficult to determine without accurate assessments of debris abundance. This will require spatial variability to be taken into account, both so that there is sufficient power to resolve trends and so that the differing spatial patterns between size classes of debris can be resolved. The power analyses presented in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080020-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) suggests that a large number of samples are needed to detect trends – for example, detecting a 50% increase in microplastic with 80% probability would require 250 neuston samples. Even a snapshot of plastic abundance requires more than 50 neuston samples. Logistical limitations on sampling design (e.g., limited ship time, sampling processing) will therefore make basin-scale debris assessment difficult.</p>
<p>Future surveys might limit this variability through a tighter focus on specific objectives. For example, surveys concerned with invasive species transport might investigate large objects more likely to carry fouling communities, or surveys concerned with biotic interactions might target submesoscale features with high levels of both biological activity and debris, such as fronts or eddies. Sampling limitations may also be mitigated by working with existing oceanographic monitoring programs such as the Hawaiian Oceanographic Time-Series (HOTS), the California Cooperative Oceanographic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI), or Sea Education Association (SEA). Alternate methodologies, such as the at-sea enumeration method used by SEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080020-Law1">[50]</xref>, may also be useful. Though the challenges of monitoring are considerable, it is clear that microplastic is now pervasive in the NPSG ecosystem and should be considered when assessing ecosystem health and function.</p>
