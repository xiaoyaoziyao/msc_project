<abstract>
<p>Riparian ecosystem along rivers and streams are characterised by lateral and longitudinal ecological gradients and, as a result, harbour unique biodiversity. Riparian ecosystems in the fynbos of the Western Cape, South Africa, are characterised by seasonal dynamics, with summer droughts followed by high flows during winter. The unique hydrology and geomorphology of riparian ecosystems play an important role in shaping these ecosystems. The riparian vegetation in the Western Cape has, however, largely been degraded due to the invasion of non-indigenous plants, in particular <italic>Acacia mearnsii, A. saligna</italic> and <italic>A. dealbata</italic>. This study investigated the effect of hydrology and invasion on the bacterial communities associated with fynbos riparian ecosystems. Bacterial communities were characterised with automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and 454 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. Chemical and physical properties of soil within sites were also determined and correlated with community data. Sectioning across the lateral zones revealed significant differences in community composition, and the specific bacterial taxa influenced. Results also showed that the bacterial community structure could be linked to <italic>Acacia</italic> invasion. The presence of invasive <italic>Acacia</italic> was correlated with specific bacterial phyla. However, high similarity between cleared and pristine sites suggests that the effect of <italic>Acacia</italic> on the soil bacterial community structure may not be permanent. This study demonstrates how soil bacterial communities are influenced by hydrological gradients associated with riparian ecosystems and the impact of <italic>Acacia</italic> invasion on these communities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Riparian ecosystems are broadly classified as the interface between terrestrial and freshwater aquatic ecosystems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Gregory1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Naiman1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Naiman2">[3]</xref>. Riparian ecosystems of the South African fynbos play a crucial role in the health and functioning of the diverse fynbos biome as a whole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Richardson1">[4]</xref>. Fynbos riparian ecosystems have received very little scientific attention compared to the rest of the South African fynbos biome, although they have been shown to contribute disproportionately to ecological processes considering their relatively small land area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Brinson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Ferreira1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Crow1">[7]</xref>. These ecosystems are also the site of several important physical and biochemical processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Naiman2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Ranalli1">[8]</xref>. Riparian ecosystems are unique in the landscape and often exhibit different rates of microbial mediated soil processes compared to upland areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Dcamps1">[9]</xref>. The most important ecosystem service provided by riparian ecosystems is the supply of clean water, which is greatly, influenced by soil microbial processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Fischer1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Brauman1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Riparian ecosystems associated with the fynbos biome can be easily distinguished from the terrestrial fynbos based on hydrology, geomorphology and the structure of the vegetation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Sieben1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Rowntree1">[13]</xref>. The lateral zones commonly occurring in the fynbos riparian ecosystems are classified as the dry bank and wet bank zones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Sieben1">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086560-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The dry bank is infrequently inundated, typically only during periods of high flooding, which happen every few years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Boucher1">[14]</xref>. The water from the river influences the dry bank in the form of ground water during low flow. In the upper catchments (the mountain fynbos riparian ecosystems), high flow and flooding is likely to occur during the rainy winter season <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Boucher1">[14]</xref>. On the other hand, the wet bank zones are classified as the area at the river’s edge, which is under constant influence of the river throughout the year, and is always likely to be moist to wet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Sieben1">[12]</xref>.</p>

<p>The importance of riparian ecosystems and associated plant and microbial biota are now becoming clear due to the increased degradation of riparian ecosystems worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Yelenik1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Esler1">[16]</xref>. The riparian ecosystems of the Western Cape fynbos biome are largely degraded due to the invasion of non-native <italic>A. mearnsii and A. longifolia</italic> originating from Australia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Holmes1">[17]</xref> which have, to a large extent, displaced the native riparian vegetation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Reinecke1">[18]</xref>. <italic>Acacia</italic> species such as <italic>A. saligna,</italic> have been shown to be associated with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which may have a dramatic effect on soil nitrogen stocks and soil microbial community structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Yelenik1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-RodrguezEcheverra1">[19]</xref>. The recovery of the native fynbos vegetation occurs very slowly where Acacias are cleared <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Daehler1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Holmes2">[21]</xref>. This poor recovery sparked interest in the soil dynamics of the fynbos riparian ecosystems, and it has been suggested that soil microbial dynamics may have been modified to the detriment of the restoration of fynbos ecosystem function and structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Holmes3">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that certain bacterial species belonging to the order Rhizobiales may play an important role in the invasiveness of <italic>Acacia</italic> species. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-RodrguezEcheverra1">[19]</xref>. The presence of invasive <italic>Acacias</italic> in South Africa can further be linked to the prevalence of known root associated bacteria, namely <italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</italic>, <italic>B. elkanii</italic>, <italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum</italic>, and <italic>R. tropici</italic> that were found to occur in symbiosis with <italic>A. mearnsii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Joubert1">[23]</xref>. The effect of invasive <italic>Acacias</italic> on soil microbes has also been observed in other Mediterranean ecosystems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Lorenzo1">[24]</xref>. However, most studies, although referring to the importance of soil microbes in the dynamics of invasion by non-native <italic>Acacia</italic>, they have not specifically studied the soil microbial community structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Yelenik1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>The main goal of the study was to investigate the effect of non-indigenous invasive <italic>Acacia</italic> spp. on the microbial community structure in riparian zones in the fynbos biome of South Africa. Sharp ecological gradients, laterally across riparian sites, are also included in the study to determine their influence on the soil bacterial community structure.</p>

<title>Experimental Sites</title>
<p>The ten experimental sites are located in the Western Cape, South Africa, and include natural, cleared and invaded riparian ecosystems. A permit was obtained from the conservation authority CapeNature. Permit number: (AAA005-00137-0028). Sampling sites were selected within the upper foothill and adjacent mountain stream areas. Sites with similar vegetation structure and geomorphology according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Reinecke1">[18]</xref>, were selected in order to standardise sampling conditions. The sites included three pristine reference sites flanking the upper Eerste River (UE), lower Eerste River (LE) and the upper Dwars River (UD) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086560-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086560-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). The riparian vegetation of the Molenaars River (UM), Sir Lowry’s River (S) and Jakkals River (UJ) included sites that were clear of non-indigenous vegetation for at least five years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086560-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086560-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). The cleared Jakkals River site experienced a fire event during the winter season and as a consequence those samples were removed from the analysis. The riparian ecosystem adjacent to the Wit River (W) and Jakkals River (LJ) were invaded by <italic>A. mearnsii</italic> and that of the Dwars River (LD) by <italic>A. longifolia</italic> and <italic>A. mearnsii</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086560-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086560-g002">Figure 2d</xref>). The invaded sites were mostly overgrown with woody <italic>Acacias</italic> and the natural fynbos riparian vegetation was almost entirely displaced. Experimental sites adjacent to the rivers were divided into three lateral zones: the riparian wet bank zone, the riparian dry bank zone and the upland terrestrial fynbos zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086560-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The riparian wet bank zone was the area at the edge of the river that was under direct influence of the river water and was characterized by riparian vegetation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Rowntree1">[13]</xref>. This zone is characteristically inundated during all seasons, but dries out to a certain extent during summer. The riparian dry bank zone was also under the influence of the water from the river, although usually by means of groundwater. Typically, the river water only sporadically inundates the dry bank zone during flooding. The terrestrial zone occurs outside the direct influence of the river and excludes plants typical of riparian vegetation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Rowntree1">[13]</xref>. All upland terrestrial sites in the experimental zones consisted of mountain fynbos due to their resistance to invasion and were characterized by Ericoids and Proteas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Mucina1">[25]</xref>.</p>

<title>Soil Sampling</title>
<p>The first soil samples were collected during March 2010 during the end of the dry autumn season. Sampling plots were positioned to form transects of five, 5 m×5 m plots, located in each lateral zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086560-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Three core samples were taken in the vicinity of the vegetation from each of the five plots using a 25 mm diameter steel cylinder at a depth of 10 cm. This process was repeated for all the plots in the lateral zones and all the experimental sites, resulting in 45 samples per site. The samples were homogenised and DNA extracted within 24h of sampling. The sampling protocol was repeated in August 2010 at the end of the rainy season and again during January 2011 during the dry summer season.</p>

<title>Abiotic Soil Properties</title>
<p>The abiotic soil properties measured included particle size, available phosphate, pH,, nitrate content, ammonium content, total available nitrogen, total soil nitrogen and soil carbon content. Soil samples were sieved (2 mm) to remove roots and organic debris. The nitrate content, ammonium content and moisture content were determined on fresh soil. The total nitrogen and carbon, and pH were determined on air-dried soil. Bray-2 extractable inorganic P (Pi) was determined on fresh soil with the method described by Bray and Kurtz (1945) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Bray1">[26]</xref>. Concentrations of Bray-2 Pi, NO<sub>3</sub>-N, and NH<sub>4</sub>-N were determined colorimetrically with a Genesys 20 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NH<sub>4</sub>-N were extracted with 0.5M K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. For concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NH<sub>4</sub>-N, 10 g of soil (&lt;2mm) were placed in 50 ml plastic vials and 25 ml extractant added. The vials were shaken at medium speed for one hour and filtered. NH<sub>4</sub>-N was analysed based on the Berthelot reaction involving phenol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Keeney1">[27]</xref> and NO<sub>3</sub>-N by nitration of salicylic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Cataldo1">[28]</xref>. Total nitrogen and total carbon were analysed by the dry combustion elemental analyser method. Soil pH was measured electrometrically with the Hanna 211 Microprocessor (Hanna Instruments, Woonsocket, USA) in a 1∶2 (w/v, soil: deionised water) slurry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Robertson1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>All the multivariate data analysis methods were done using Statistica software v.10 (Statsoft, Tulsa USA). The environmental variables used to compare the sites included available P (ug/g), pH (H<sub>2</sub>0), nitrate concentration (ug/g), total available N (ug/g), total soil nitrogen (%), total soil carbon (%) and the C:N ratio.</p>

PCR reactions were done using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (AppliedBiosystems, USA). The reaction mixture contained 0.5 µl (±50 ng/ul) of the purified genomic DNA, 500 nM of each primer and 5 µl of 2× KapaTaq Readymix (KapaBiosystems, South Africa) in a total volume of 10 µl. The PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturing step of 4 min at 95°C followed by 36 cycles of 94°C, for 30 s, 56°C for 45 s and 72°C for 70 s. The reaction was completed with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min and then cooled and held at 4°C. PCR samples were separated on a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized using ultraviolet light. The amplicons from the bacterial specific PCR were run on an ABI 3010×l Genetic analyser to obtain an electropherogram of the different fragment lengths and fluorescent intensities.

<p>Due to recognized limitation associated with community fingerprinting methods, rare phylotypes are generally not detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Bent1">[39]</xref>. Consequently, in addition to ARISA, 454 pyrosequencing was used. Based on results from the ARISA analysis, representative samples from invaded, pristine and cleared sites and including all three lateral zones were selected. The samples which were sequenced fell within the 75% confidence limit for the groupings and were randomly selected. Sequencing was done using samples from all three seasons. The hyper-variable regions of V1 to V3 in the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were amplified from extracted community DNA from all samples using the universal bacterial primers 27F and 340R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086560.s006">Table S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Lane1">[40]</xref>.

PCR reactions were performed using GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, South Africa). The initial PCR was performed under the following conditions: initial denaturation (94°C; 5 min), 25 cycles of denaturation (98°C; 20 sec), annealing (60°C; 15 sec), extension (72°C; 1 min), and a final extension (72°C; 7 min). The PCR products were purified using the DNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo Research, USA) which served as template for the second round of PCR. The PCR mixture in the second round of PCR was the same as that used for the first reaction. However, during this reaction, the reverse primer 340RA was used, and contained the sequencing adaptor A, an identification key, a unique multiplex identifier (MID) and the universal bacterial primer 340F (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086560.s006">Table S1</xref>).

<title>Bacterial OTU Diversity and Richness</title>
<p>The diversity of the bacterial communities (measured as Shannon diversity index) of terrestrial and dry bank lateral zones during all seasons did not differ significantly. The most prominent difference in bacterial diversity was observed in the invaded wet bank zones. In addition to reduced diversity, there was also a reduction in the number of OTUs that could be observed in the invaded sites with the dominance of certain OTUs. This indicates that <italic>A. mearnsii</italic> invasion reduced bacterial diversity, but only under the conditions that occurred in the wet bank zones. The presence of <italic>Acacia</italic> is associated with a decrease in plant diversity which would be expected to cause a reduction in bacterial diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Zhou1">[54]</xref>. The wet bank zones are regularly subjected to flooding and sediment erosion. Studies have shown that such frequent ecological disturbances results in a reduction of bacterial diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Muller1">[55]</xref>.</p>

<title>Bacterial Community Structure</title>
<p>The environmental gradients across riparian lateral zones, had significant structuring effects on the bacterial communities These included the vegetation structure and hydrology, which involves different frequencies of inundation between the dry bank and wet bank. The wet bank harbour more variable bacterial communities, as showed by the dispersion analysis. The wet bank zone is frequently disturbed by high river flows and previous studies have shown that higher levels of disturbance increases the variability of a community in contras to the more stable communities of the terrestrial samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Jiang1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Ferrenberg1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Wang1">[58]</xref>. The structure of the bacterial community of the dry bank zone during the winter season was more similar to that of the wet bank zone, implying that seasonal changes, is this case higher levels of disturbance by flooding, have an effect on the bacterial community structure. The impact of the ecological gradients associated with riparian lateral zones proved to have a larger effect on the structure of the bacterial communities compared to <italic>Acacia</italic> invasion. Landscape-scale ecological influences have previously been shown to be a determining factor of the microbial community structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Krause1">[59]</xref>. The hydrology of the rivers in this study constitutes a large-scale influence that had a similar structuring effect on the microbial community despite spatial separation and some ecological differences between sampling sites. The ecological influence of the river hydrology is a relatively long term and consistent effect although seasonal. These effects, which shape the different riparian lateral zones, are reflected in the differences in the microbial community structure. The bacterial communities within the three lateral zones remain relatively similar over seasons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086560.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This suggests that the long term natural dissimilarity between riparian lateral zones is more important in determining the bacterial community structure than the seasonal differences in this system.</p>
<p>The invasive Acacias affected the structure of the bacterial community of the dry bank and wet bank zones during all the seasons. In invaded sites, the structuring effect of lateral zoning was stronger than the structuring effect of the invasive status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086560-t002">Table 2</xref>). This was, however, not observed in the cleared and natural sites, indicating that the invasive <italic>Acacias</italic> are linked with this community shift. During wet conditions, the effect of invasion is visible in the bacterial community structure of the invaded sites. The similarity of cleared and natural sites may be an indication that the community structure of invaded sites shifts back.</p>

<title>Bacterial Classification</title>
<p>The lower frequency of representatives from the phylum <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> is expected when considering the hydrological properties of the wet bank. The wet banks are generally less well aerated and the phyla <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> consist of a substantial number of obligatory aerobic bacteria, which was evident in the indicator analysis. Sequence analysis showed that members of the phylum <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> were the dominant group in all the soil samples. <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> was, however, significantly overrepresented in the invaded sites. Although function cannot be inferred on bacterial OTUs when observing bacterial genera, higher frequencies of nitrogen-fixing root associated <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> genera were observed in the invaded wet bank samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Bontemps1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Weir1">[61]</xref>. The bacteria most commonly associated with <italic>Acacia</italic> invasion belong to the genus <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-RodrguezEcheverra1">[19]</xref>. This is consistent with the <italic>Acacia’s</italic> root associated bacteria’s ability to fix nitrogen, which has been suggested to play a role in its invasive ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Yelenik1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086560-Morris1">[62]</xref>. The bacterial genera shown to be abundant in the invaded sites also occurred in the natural and cleared sites, although at lower levels.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Natural fynbos riparian ecosystems are characterised by bacterial communities, which are conspicuously structured by the large-scale hydrology of the area. The structuring effect of the lateral zones is only weakly linked with soil environmental parameters. The experimental design however allowed for the observation the effect of large-scale ecological gradients on the microbial communities structure. Indeed, the general macro-ecological characteristics of the lateral zones across the fynbos riparian ecosystems best explain the bacterial community structure that was observed. Invasion by <italic>Acacia</italic> affected both the diversity and the community structure within invaded wet banks and dry banks. The removal of invasive <italic>Acacia</italic> individuals resulted in the shift of the bacterial communities to their reference or natural state. This is evidence that the bacterial communities within the soil may return to a natural structure if the site remains clear of invasive <italic>Acacias</italic>.</p>
