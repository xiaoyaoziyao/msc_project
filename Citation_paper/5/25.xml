<abstract>
<p>Small RNAs, including siRNAs, gRNAs and miRNAs, modulate gene expression and serve as potential therapies for human diseases. Delivery to target cells remains the fundamental limitation for use of these RNAs in humans. To address this challenge, we have developed a nanocapsule delivery technology that encapsulates small DNA molecules encoding RNAs into a small (30nm) polymer nanocapsule. For proof of concept, we transduced DNA expression cassettes for three small RNAs. In one application, the DNA cassette encodes an shRNA transcriptional unit that downregulates CCR5 and protects from HIV-1 infection. The DNA cassette nanocapsules were further engineered for timed release of the DNA cargo for prolonged knockdown of CCR5. Secondly, the nanocapsules provide an efficient means for delivery of gRNAs in the CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate integrated HIV-1. Finally, delivery of microRNA-125b to mobilized human CD34+ cells enhances survival and expansion of the CD34+ cells in culture.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The recent explosion of small RNAs such as double-stranded siRNAs, gRNAs and miRNAs that regulate gene expression or directly edit genes has led to the potential for therapies based upon those RNAs[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The major advantages for their use are ease of design and test for activity. However, despite the wide applications to control gene expression in cells, effective delivery remains a major roadblock for future applications of these RNAs. Viral vectors allow endogenous synthesis of small RNAs and are able to provide sustainable gene regulation for primary human cells; however, cost and safety consideration constrains wide application[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Non-viral delivery systems such as electroporation and cationic chemical agents are popular choices for delivery of small RNAs in the form of DNA expression plasmids or <italic>in-vitro</italic> synthetic RNAs[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Unmodified synthetic RNAs are quickly degraded during delivery; relatively high doses are needed to achieve desired levels of gene modulation. Chemical modification is an effective means to increase the stability of small RNAs, however, extensive screening is required and may sometimes lead to undesired effects. Cationic chemical agents, such as lipofectamine, lipid-like materials, cell-penetration peptide (CPP) and cationic polymers, are widely used for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of synthetic RNAs and showed potential for <italic>in vivo</italic> gene silencing, especially in the liver[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; however toxicity and limitations in delivery efficiency have limited their effectiveness. DNA plasmids that express encoded small RNAs are effective at lower concentrations than synthetic RNAs and generally last longer. However, DNA expression plasmids are much bigger than their corresponding RNAs and have reduced delivery efficiency when electroporation was used[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Smaller expression constructs for siRNA constructed by PCR provide an alternative to plasmids, but delivery requires further development[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, in spite of intensive efforts, the design and synthesis of an effective delivery vehicle for small RNAs remains a challenge.</p>

In order to ensure that each infection assay was performed within the linear range, we used the volume of each virus needed to produce 800,000 relative light units (RLUs) when used to infect Affinofile cells expressing the highest levels of CD4 and CCR5. Cells (5x10<sup>5</sup> cells/well, 6-well plate) were seeded the day before adding the DNA nanocapsules. DNA nanocapsules with different concentrations were added into the cell medium. After incubation at 37°C for 4 hrs, the cells were washed three times with PBS and cultured at the condition (6 ng/ml doxy and 5 mM ponA) for 3, 5 and 9 days. Two days prior to infection, 96-well, black tissue culture plates were coated with 10% poly-L-lysine and then seeded with 293-Affinofile cells transduced with DNA nanocapsules at a density of 10^4 cells/well. 18 to 24 hours later, the induction medium was removed and gently replaced with 100 ul of fresh, warmed culture medium containing env-pseudotyped virus. The infection plates were spinoculated at 2,000 rpm for 2 hours at 37°C, and then incubated for an additional 48 hours at 37°C. Infection medium was then removed, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was assayed using the luciferase assay system (Promega).</p>

<sec id="sec016">
<title>Nanocapsule delivery of DNA cassettes encoding shRNA</title>
<p>We recently reported a nanocapsule platform that efficiently encapsulates and delivers single small interfering RNAs directed to CCR5 (siRNA1005), the cellular chemokine receptor and HIV-1 co-receptor[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The well-characterized potency of siRNA1005 and therapeutic potential against HIV-1 made it an ideal candidate for demonstrating CCR5 knockdown by applying the single molecule nanocapsule delivery technology. We showed that CCR5 can be effectively knocked down by nanocapsules encapsulating siRNA1005. These nanocapsules protect the encapsulated siRNA from nucleases and can effectively deliver siRNA into cells. Here, we improved the technology to encapsulate a DNA molecule encoding a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) which is processed to form the siRNA.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle in use of polymer nanocapsule technology is illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0127986.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>. Starting with the hydrophilic and positively-charged monomers and crosslinkers, these molecules self-assemble along the surface of the DNA cassettes through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding (Step <bold>I</bold>). Then, a thin network of polymer shell is formed around the DNA cassette by subsequent <italic>in situ</italic> polymerization (Step <bold>II</bold>), which effectively confers new surface properties and protects the DNA cassette. At a physiological pH of serum (pH~7.4), the nanocapsules are stable, but at lower pH in endosomes, there is escape into the cytoplasm due to the “proton-sponge” and membrane disruption effects (Step <bold>III</bold>), enabling release of the DNA cassette upon degradation of the shell. The DNA cassette then enters the nucleus where the small RNAs are expressed (Step <bold>IV</bold>).</p>

<p>Polymer nanocapsule technology to encapsulate encoding DNA rather than small RNAs is more challenging given the larger size of the DNA that includes not only the sequences encoding the RNAs, but also transcription promoters and flanking sequences. We designed a model DNA nanocapsule incorporating a short linear DNA cassette expressing sh1005 shRNA by an H1 pol III promoter[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The DNA cassette of only 395 base pairs (bp), produced by PCR from a plasmid construct (<xref rid="pone.0127986.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), has a much smaller size than the entire plasmid (3192 bp). We optimized the formulation of the polymer nanocapsule platform for encapsulation of the test DNA cassette by assaying various formulations for effectiveness in knockdown of a luciferase reporter gene expressed as a fusion mRNA of luciferase and CCR5[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We screened positively-charged monomers (<xref rid="pone.0127986.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="pone.0127986.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), hydrophilic monomers (<xref rid="pone.0127986.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="pone.0127986.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) and crosslinkers (<xref rid="pone.0127986.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="pone.0127986.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>) which alter the size, charge and degradability of the particles. We observed that a longer acid-degradable crosslinker (Glycerol 1,3-diglycerolate diacrylate) than that used for siRNA nanocapsules (1.3-glycerol dimethacrylate) was more effective for knockdown of CCR5-luciferase fusion mRNA by a DNA cassette encoding CCR5-specific shRNA.</p>

Transduction of 293T-cells by the CCR5-shRNA DNA nanocapsules downregulates about 80% of the bioluminescence intensity reflecting the knockout of the CCR5-luciferase fusion mRNA while cells treated with control shRNA EGFP DNA cassette nanocapsules did not exhibit significant decreases in the luciferase activity (<xref rid="pone.0127986.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>). To investigate the sensitivity of DNA nanocapsules against Dnase I, DNA nanocapsules were incubated with Dnase I for 1 hour.

DNA cassette complexed with lipofectamine and DNA nanocapsules were incubated for 1 hour without DNase I and with DNase I, respectively. b) Viability of HEK-293T cells transduced with CCR5 DNA cassette nanocapsules. HEK-293T cells were treated with DNA cassette nanocapsules at 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 pmol for 4 h at 37°C in 100uL of serum-free medium. After 24 h, cell viability was determined with CytoToxGlo kit using a 96-well plate reader. c) Knockdown of CCR5-Luciferase in HEK-293T cells by CCR5 DNA cassette nanocapsules and CCR5 siRNA lipofectamine complex. d) Down-regulation of CCR5 in 293 cells by sh1005 DNA cassette nanocapsules with different ratios (5:0; 3:2; 2:3 and 1:4) of degradable crosslinker (Glycerol 1,3-diglycerolate diacrylate, GDGDA) to non-degradable crosslinker (N,N’-methylenesbisacrylamide, BIS). On day 0, cells were transduced with DNA cassette nanocapsules for 4 hours. On day 3, 5 and 9, cells were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. e) Inhibition of viral infection of Affinofile cells by sh1005 DNA cassette nanocapsules with different ratios (5:0; 3:2; 2:3, 1:4 and mixture of 5:0 (50%) and 2:3 (50%)) of degradable crosslinker (GDGDA) to non-degradable crosslinker (BIS). On day 0, Affinofile cells were transduced with DNA cassette nanocapsules for 4 hours and then cultured in the induction medium (6 ng/ml doxy and 5 mM ponA, respectively). On day 3, 5 and 9, Affinofile cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 10^4 cells/well. 24 hours later, the induction medium was removed and gently replaced with 100ul of fresh, warmed culture medium containing env-pseudotyped virus. The infection plates were spinoculated at 2,000 rpm for 2 hours at 37°C, and then incubated for an additional 48 hours at 37°C. Infection medium was then removed, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was assayed using the plate reader.</p>

<title>Controlled release of DNA cassettes from nanocapsules</title>
<p>Considering the high potency of the DNA cassette nanocapsules, we reasoned that it could be used in applications where sustained activity is beneficial. The nanocapsules above are formulated with crosslinkers degraded under acidic conditions to allow release in endosomes. The DNA cassette nanocapsules were further engineered for controlled release by using a cocktail of acid-degradable and degradable non-acid crosslinkers[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The DNA nanocapsule prepared with 100% degradable crosslinkers (Glycerol 1,3-diglycerolate diacrylate, GDGDA) (<xref rid="pone.0127986.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>) (5:0) was almost degraded completely after 2 hours at pH 5.4, while that prepared with the mixture of degradable crosslinker and non-degradable crosslinker (N,N’-methylene bisacrylamide, BIS) (<xref rid="pone.0127986.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>) (1:4), degradation was completed after 4 hours (<xref rid="pone.0127986.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). In phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.4, these nanocapsules are quite stable at room temperature(<xref rid="pone.0127986.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>) or 4°C(<xref rid="pone.0127986.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>) for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Crosslinkers with different ratios of degradable GDGDA and non-degradable BIS were included in the formulation of a nanocapsule carrying a luciferase-specific shRNA DNA cassette. Knockdown in cells was tested by using an HIV-1 bearing a luciferase reporter[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our results show that the extent of HIV-1 (luciferase) downregulation is dependent upon the crosslinker ratio (<xref rid="pone.0127986.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Nanocapsules with the highest percentage of degradable crosslinker (5:0) showed significant inhibition at the earliest point (Day 3), while the nanocapsules having increasing non-degradable crosslinker showed the best inhibition at later time-points. By mixing two nanocapsules with different ratios (5:0 and 2:3), HIV luciferase expression is maintained at a lower level throughout the 9 day test.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of sh1005 DNA nanocapsules in blocking HIV infection, the resistance of Affinofile cells[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] transduced with nanocapsules to HIV-env-pseudotyped luciferase reporter virus[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was tested (<xref rid="pone.0127986.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Sh1005 nanocapsules with 100% degradable crosslinker blocks 87%, 67% and 47% of infection of Affinofile cells at day 3, 5 and 9, respectively. Nanocapsules with 60%, 40% and 20% of degradable crosslinker blocked 81%, 76% and 54% of infection at day 5 and prevented 61%, 71% and 57% of infection at day 9, respectively. By mixing two nanocapsules with 100% and 40% of degradable crosslinker, respectively, 81%, 74% and 67% of infection was blocked at day 3, 5 and 9, respectively. Thus, the capability to release the DNA cassette intracellularly at controlled rate prolongs the inhibition of infection.</p>

<title>Nanocapsule delivery of DNA cassettes encoding gRNAs to excise the HIV-1 provirus by CRISPR mutagenesis</title>
<p>Targeted gene silencing using engineered nucleases has become a powerful method for biological research and a potential avenue for gene therapy[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Recently, a genome editing method using clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology, was identified in bacteria and archaea[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The advantage of this system over previous genome modifying activities is simplicity- a small guide RNA (gRNA) with homology to the target and a nuclease, Cas9, are all that is required to cleave specific target sequences[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, effective delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents into target cells is the key limitation for therapeutic applications[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Here, two gRNAs designed for mutagenesis of the HIV-1 genome, were used as model gRNAs (<xref rid="pone.0127986.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). By delivering these gRNAs with Cas9 into HIV-1 target cells, the provirus can be ablated. These DNA cassette nanocapsules were adapted for the delivery of a 409bp-DNA cassette encoding gRNA from a pol II U6 promoter, and the plasmid expressing Cas9 was transfected by dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine conjugated branched polyethylenimine (PEI-PE). Our model system for evaluation of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing consists of a CEM T-cell clone in which there is a single integrated HIV vector expressing EGFP from an internal Ubiquitin C (UbC) promoter. Unlike wild-type HIV provirus, where mutation of only the 5’ LTR would ablate transcription, this system provides a more stringent test for CRISPR/Cas9 activity in that loss of EGFP expression requires editing of both LTRs and excision of the intervening sequences. The kinetics of gene editing was determined by a time course for knockout of EGFP expression (<xref rid="pone.0127986.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Knockout increased over time, 2 to 3% at Day 1 after transfection, stabilizing at about 30% by Day 5, and maintained to Day 9. One single transfection resulted in comparable knockout of around 30%, observed in two CEM clones with different vector integration sites (<xref rid="pone.0127986.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Edited DNA fragments from CEM Clone 1 were isolated using primer sets flanking the provirus indicated in <xref rid="pone.0127986.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>. By cloning the 750bp fragment, excised proviral fragments leaving a single LTR footprint were sequenced. 17 out of 20 clones contained various mutations at the predicted cleavage site (<xref rid="pone.0127986.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). The mutation patterns are consistent with non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair observed after CRISPR/Cas9 generated double-strand DNA breaks[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We demonstrate that small DNA molecules, termed DNA cassettes, that encode shRNAs, microRNAs, or gRNAs can be delivered by small polymer nanocapsules (~30nm) with high efficiency to cell lines and primary human hematopoietic stem cells. DNA cassettes encoding small RNAs are more potent than delivery of small RNAs themselves since each DNA molecule can transcribe many small RNAs intracellularly using engineered pol II or pol III promoters. Since the polymer shell protects the DNA cargo, chemical modification of the DNA or RNA is not required to maintain stability of activity. Furthermore, the DNA cassette nanocapsules can be engineered with diverse crosslinkers for controlled release of the DNA cargo for extended activity.</p>
<p>Most applications for delivery of small RNAs use <italic>in-vitro</italic> synthetic RNA delivered by electroporation and cationic agents where small RNA delivery is limited by RNA intracellular concentrations and a short half-life of the RNA. DNA delivery to express transgenes using encoded promoter elements is usually achieved with plasmids. Electroporation is limited by use of naked DNA sensitive to nucleases, with difficulties of scale-up and generally high toxicity[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Cationic agents generally show less efficient delivery with plasmids into primary human cells[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]<sup>,</sup> due to high dosage required and reduced cell viability. DNA expression cassettes used in our delivery technology can elevate the intracellular concentration and duration of activity for small RNAs. Since minimal bacterial plasmid sequences are present on the DNA cassette, potential adverse immune responses to bacterial CpG motifs is mitigated[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
<p>While expression from genomically integrated lentiviral vectors is ideal for those applications where permanent transgene expression is desired, constitutive expression may be detrimental for some purposes such as that illustrated with miR-125b in HSPC[<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127986.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This non-viral polymer nanocapsule delivery platform has fewer concerns for safety since the expression is transient in nature and, as we show, can be further regulated by use of formulations that provide controlled release.</p>
<p>In summary, the polymer nanocapsule technology provides a universal platform that can easily be adapted for delivery and efficient expression of any small RNA for both experimental and, in the future, potential therapeutic applications.</p>
