<abstract>
<p>In order to improve biological control of agricultural pests, it is fundamental to understand which factors influence the composition of natural enemies in agricultural landscapes. In this study, we aimed to understand how agricultural land use affects a number of different traits in ground beetle communities to better predict potential consequences of land-use change for ecosystem functioning. We studied ground beetles in fields with different agricultural land use ranging from frequently managed sugar beet fields, winter wheat fields to less intensively managed grasslands. The ground beetles were collected in emergence tents that catch individuals overwintering locally in different life stages and with pitfall traps that catch individuals that could have a local origin or may have dispersed into the field. Community weighted mean values for ground beetle traits such as body size, flight ability and feeding preference were estimated for each land-use type and sampling method. In fields with high land-use intensity the average body length of emerging ground beetle communities was lower than in the grasslands while the average body length of actively moving communities did not differ between the land-use types. The proportion of ground beetles with good flight ability or a carnivorous diet was higher in the crop fields as compared to the grasslands. Our study highlights that increasing management intensity reduces the average body size of emerging ground beetles and the proportion of mixed feeders. Our results also suggest that the dispersal ability of ground beetles enables them to compensate for local management intensities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To improve the potential of biological control of agricultural pests, it is fundamental to understand which factors influence the composition of natural enemies in agricultural landscapes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref002">2</xref>]. Ground beetle species (Carabidae) are abundant predators on agricultural pests such as cereal aphids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref004">4</xref>] and to optimize the contribution of ground beetles to pest control it is essential to identify drivers that shape their community composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref007">7</xref>]. Agricultural land-use intensity can influence ground beetle species composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref010">10</xref>] as land use affects how suitable habitats are in terms of foraging, reproduction and overwintering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>How ground beetles react to land-use changes and how this shapes communities will depend on a number of properties in different species that are described as traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref013">13</xref>]. Studies focusing on the relationship between ground beetle communities and agricultural intensification can thus be informed by existing knowledge about traits in ground beetle species, which may help linking changes in trait composition to expected changes in ecosystem functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref018">18</xref>]. The traits may explain how not only local land use but also the landscape may be important in shaping communities as ground beetle species can disperse considerable distances either by flight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref019">19</xref>] or cursorial movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus here we aim to study the trait composition of ground beetle communities that either emerge locally in the fields or actively move across fields. Communities of actively moving species may thus include not only species of local emergence but also those that reproduce and forage in habitats other than those used for overwintering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Increasing land-use intensity is known to benefit carnivorous ground beetles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref025">25</xref>], while herbivorous ground beetle species often prefer less intensively managed habitats, such as field margins with grass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref026">26</xref>]. Further, increased land-use intensity reduces the average body size of individuals in ground beetle communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref027">27</xref>], which can be of significance for pest control services as the predation rates can be negatively correlated to the average body size of the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref018">18</xref>]. Moreover, frequent agricultural disturbance generally reduces the average body size of soil arthropod communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref028">28</xref>] and it has been suggested that soil tillage can have a negative effect on large ground beetle species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref029">29</xref>]. It is generally assumed that adult ground beetles overwinter in grasslands, while larval stages mainly overwinter in arable soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref031">31</xref>]. Differences among species concerning overwintering can have fundamental effects on community characteristics when comparing intensively managed crops with less intensively managed grasslands. Ground beetle species have different moisture preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref011">11</xref>] and their emergence can be related to soil moisture levels during the overwintering period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref032">32</xref>]. Soil moisture content is generally higher when agricultural land use is less intensive as in grasslands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref033">33</xref>] suggesting a higher proportion of moisture preferring (hygrophilous) species in those habitats.</p>
<p>Most ground beetles species have flight ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref011">11</xref>], even though many species primarily take flight only for occasional changes of habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref035">35</xref>]. Generally, ground beetles inhabiting unstable environments are suggested to have good dispersal abilities, facilitating movement to more stable habitats when local conditions become unsuitable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref027">27</xref>]. Movement can also be related to trophic level, as predators and parasitoids due to the mobility of their prey may need to move across larger distances as compared to herbivorous species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref036">36</xref>]. For cursorial moving ground beetles it has been indicated that the movement range of ground beetles is roughly proportional to their body length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref037">37</xref>], suggesting that small species with low ability of flight have a restricted dispersal range. Hence, changes in composition of ground beetle communities in response to agricultural land use are likely to be dependent on dispersal abilities of the species.</p>
<p>In this study we aim to understand how agricultural land use influences ground beetle community composition by using traits related to dispersal and habitat preferences. In order to disentangle effects of the local land use and the possibility of dispersal between fields, ground beetles were sampled using two different methods. Unfenced pitfall traps estimated the composition of actively moving ground beetles which is the result of both species activity and abundance in a field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref038">38</xref>] and emergence tents estimated the local emergence of overwintering ground beetles. The ground beetles were collected in three agricultural land-use types ranging from frequently managed sugar beet fields, winter wheat fields to less frequently managed grasslands in an agricultural region of southernmost Sweden. Hence, by comparing the composition of traits of the beetle communities between the two sampling methods in the different types of fields, we determined the key traits that are affected by local land use. We expected that the land use and sampling method would explain the trait distribution in ground beetle communities such as: (1) A lower average body length in more intensively managed crop fields as compared to grasslands since large ground beetles will be negatively affected by disturbances; (2) A higher average body length in actively moving communities as compared to emerging ones since larger ground beetles have a greater cursorial movement rate and will thus dominate catches of unfenced pitfall traps; (3) A higher proportion of species with better flight ability in ground beetle communities in more intensively managed land-use types as species inhabiting these habitats need a better dispersal ability in order to persist; (4) A shift to more carnivore dominated communities in crop fields compared to grasslands reflecting the distribution of resources; (5) A higher proportion of adult hibernators in grasslands, as these are expected to be less common in crop fields; (6) A higher proportion of hygrophilous individuals in grasslands as those soils have a higher water holding capacity.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>The field work was carried out during April-July 2011 in an agricultural area covering approximately 850 km<sup>2</sup> located in the province of Scania in south-western Sweden. We selected 22 locations across the study area, with each location comprising three common land-use types: sugar beet, winter wheat and grassland; in total 66 sites. To select study sites and calculate the proportion of arable land at 1000 m radius surrounding each study site, data from the Swedish IACS (Integrated Administration and Control System) database supplied by the Swedish Board of Agriculture was used in ArcGIS software (ESRI). The landscape surrounding each site in year 2010 was dominated by annually tilled crops (77 ± 1%, mean ± SE). The distance between the neighboring locations was approximately 5160 ± 292 m and distances between sites within locations were 682 ± 48 m between grasslands and crop fields and 297 ± 51 m between sugar beet fields and winter wheat fields. The three agricultural land-use types were chosen to represent different levels of management intensities. As our grasslands were not fertilized or treated with pesticides nor tilled on an annual basis, we classified this land-use type as having the lowest management intensity. In contrast both winter wheat and sugar beet fields were intensively managed in terms of tillage, fertilizers and pesticides with sugar beet fields being most recently tilled. All winter wheat fields were conventionally tilled using moldboard plows during autumn when preparing the soil for seed establishment. The sugar beet fields were conventionally tilled in autumn and a second time in spring when preparing the soil for seed establishment. The sampled grasslands included different types of grasslands established on arable land, excluding meadows and grazed semi-natural grasslands. The grasslands were classified according to the Swedish board of agriculture; certified leys (rotational grasslands, n = 9), non-certified leys (rotational grasslands, n = 7), buffer strips (n = 3) and fallows (n = 3). Certified leys should, according to the Swedish board of agriculture, be covered with ley grasses (e.g. <italic>Phleum pratense</italic> L., <italic>Lolium perenne</italic> L.) and/or leguminous plants (e.g. <italic>Trifolium pratense</italic> L., <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> L.) and be cut or grazed on an annual basis. Non-certified leys, buffer strips and fallows can be covered with a more heterogeneous mix of grasses and herbs and may not be cut or grazed on an annual basis. Mean (± SE) field size was 1.7 (± 0.5) ha for grasslands, 16 (± 2) ha for winter wheat and 18 (± 4) ha for sugar beet. The smaller sizes of the grasslands were due to the limited availability of large grasslands in the intensively managed landscapes of the study region.

<title>Ground beetle sampling</title>
<p>The activity density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref038">38</xref>] of actively moving ground beetles was measured using a single pitfall trap (unfenced) outside the emergence tent at each site. Emerging ground beetles were captured with a pitfall trap within a single emergence tent that was kept at the same position during the whole sampling period in order to obtain a measure of the total productivity of the sampled field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref032">32</xref>]. Specimens from pitfall traps were collected at each site (one grassland, one winter wheat and one sugar beet field respectively), giving a total of three emergence tents and three unfenced pitfall traps at each of the 22 locations. In winter wheat and sugar beet fields the traps were located approximately 30 meters from the field edge and in the grasslands around two meters from the edge, due to the smaller sizes of the grasslands. The emergence tents and the unfenced pitfall traps were approximately two meters apart. The tent had a base area of 0.6 × 0.6 meters, a height of 0.6 meters and a white synthetic fabric with, 16.7 × 5 mesh cm<sup>-2</sup> (MegaView Science<sup>™</sup>). To avoid ground beetles escaping or entering the tent, flaps around the base of the tent were inserted into the soil down to a depth of 10 cm. During the study period, the vegetation inside the tents was regularly cut to approximately a third of the tent height, and the plant cuttings were removed. Each pitfall trap consisted of a plastic cup (9 cm diameter, 6 cm height) with a 15 × 15 cm metal sheet roof placed about 2 cm above the unfenced pitfall trap. The plastic cups, both inside and outside the tent, were dug down into the soil so that the rim was on the same level as the soil surface. The cups were partially filled with 50–70% propylene glycol and a small amount of detergent. All traps were emptied and ground beetles were collected every fortnight from the end of April until the end of July. The ground beetles were transferred to ethanol (70%) for storage. Due to a very high number of ground beetles in the unfenced traps, we only analysed samples from the second sampling period each month.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Ground beetle trait classification</title>
<p>The ground beetles were classified to species level according to Lindroth and Bangsholt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref039">39</xref>] and Luff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref040">40</xref>] with <italic>Amara spp</italic>., <italic>Harpalus spp</italic>. (except <italic>Harpalus rufipes</italic> Degeer) and <italic>Ophonus spp</italic>. only being classified to genus. The trait categorization on each species identified within the study was based on information from Lindroth and Bangsholt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref039">39</xref>], Lindroth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref035">35</xref>] and the public database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carabids.org" xlink:type="simple">http://carabids.org</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref041">41</xref>] and some additional literature (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146329.s001">S1 Table</xref>). We calculated Community-Weighted Means (CWMs) for four categorical traits (flight ability, feeding preference, overwintering state and moisture preference) and one continuous trait (body length) to describe changes in trait composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref043">43</xref>] depending on land-use type and sampling method. CWMs for ground beetles were calculated using the following species coding: (i) Flight ability (poor = -1 or good = 1): species with poor flight ability included those with no or reduced wings, dimorphic species and those for which flight observations are missing or rare, while species with good flight ability included those with fully developed wings and those for which flight has been documented; (ii) Feeding preference (mixed feeders = -1 or carnivorous = 1): species with mixed feeding habits included those that are omnivorous/herbivorous, while carnivorous species included those with mainly carnivorous diet; (iii) Overwintering state (larval = -1 or adult = 1); (iv) Moisture preference (xerophilic = -1, heterophilic = 0 or hygrophilic = 1); (v) Body length (3–24 mm).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>A total number of 7544 individual of 44 species was used for calculating CWMs of the traits (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146329.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Prior to statistical analysis the data sets of each site and method were pooled over the season and the abundance data was used to calculate CWM traits and the resemblance matrix for species composition. For each trait, CWMs were calculated by summing the products of the species trait and the corresponding species abundance and finally dividing the sum of the products by the total ground beetle abundance. We calculated correlation coefficients between traits to determine if they could be treated independently. CWMs of the traits flight ability and diet (Pearson r = -0.59) had the strongest observed correlation coefficients and we assume that each individual trait therefore contained enough independent information to justify further analyses. Due to a few missing samples on some sampling dates a number of sites were removed before the statistical analysis, causing a slightly unbalanced design compared to the originally set of 22 sites from each land-use type (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146329.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Species composition was analyzed based on untransformed abundance values and Bray-Curtis similarity.</p>
<p>Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref044">44</xref>] was used to test for the factors and their interactions on overall CWM trait composition and species composition of ground beetle communities, with the random factor “location” and the fixed factors “land-use type” and “sampling method”. A multivariate model was used to identify model terms for follow-up tests of individual CWM traits and to thereby protect our tests against multiple testing e.g. protected ANOVA approach, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref045">45</xref>]. Only for this model CWM trait values were scaled (mean = 0; sd = 1) and the standardized trait CWMs were then used to calculate a resemblance matrix based on Euclidean distances. All p-values are derived from 9999 permutations of the residuals under a reduced PERMANOVA model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref044">44</xref>]. The following models for individual traits were then only performed for model terms that were significant in the multivariate global test. For tests of individual trait variables, standardization across traits was not needed and raw CWMs were used. All other model specifications are identical to the multivariate model. PERMANOVA post-hoc tests were performed to compare individual levels of the factor “land-use type” in cases where the factor was significant in the main model. Henceforth when we use the term “trait composition” or the individual CWM trait names we refer to the community-weighted means for the traits. The effect of land-use type and method on species composition is illustrated using a Canonical analysis of principle coordinates (CAP, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref046">46</xref>]) with a combined land-use type x method factor to constrain the ordination due to the significant interaction between the two main factors in the PERMANOVA model. To relate the resemblance matrices for species and trait composition we used a non-parametric version of the Mantel test based on Spearman rank order correlations. All statistical analyses were performed using the software Primer-E v6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref047">47</xref>] and the PERMANOVA+ add-on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref048">48</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study shows that ground beetle trait composition is affected by agricultural land use, and can also differ between communities of emerging and actively moving ground beetles. In partial agreement with our hypothesis, the average body length of emerging ground beetles was lower in communities of crop fields than in grasslands. Previous studies across a range of habitats from coniferous forest to crop fields documented that the average body length of actively moving ground beetles and the proportion of species that are capable of flight were reduced by an increase in land-use intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref027">27</xref>]. However, within an agricultural context such patterns do not seem to be valid for the actively moving ground beetles as we show that ground beetles with poor flight ability and with a large body size dominated the communities in crop fields. Thus, our study highlights that patterns of ground beetle trait composition observed previously in land-use gradients across natural, semi-natural and agricultural land may not be generalized in the context of managed land-use types of agricultural landscapes.</p>
<p>The larger difference in species composition between emerging and actively moving communities in crop field as compared to grasslands was mainly driven by higher abundance of <italic>Pterostichus melanarius</italic> and <italic>Bembidion obtusum</italic> in communities of actively moving beetles in crop field as compared to communities of emerging individuals. These two species are generally associated to intensively managed agricultural land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref041">41</xref>]. Three other species (<italic>Poecilus versicolor</italic>, <italic>Harpalus rufipes</italic> and <italic>Amara spp</italic>.) were more abundant in grasslands as compared to crop fields. All three are arguably species/genera with closer association to less intensively managed grasslands as compared to crop fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref041">41</xref>]. Although the resemblance between sites based on species composition was similar to the resemblance between sites based on CWM trait composition, we found that the CWM trait based analysis (discussed below) revealed information that could not have been disclosed by solely focusing on species composition analysis.</p>
<p>It has previously been shown that frequent agricultural disturbances lead to lower average body length of soil communities spanning multiple invertebrate taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref028">28</xref>]. Here we show for the first time that this can be a general pattern also for aboveground arthropods that overwinter in soil. There are several mechanisms that can explain why the average body length of emerging ground beetles is lower at increasing land-use intensity. The mortality due to physical disturbances such as tillage may be higher among larger ground beetles as compared to smaller ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref029">29</xref>]. However, large ground beetles may also migrate to less disturbed overwintering sites more frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref023">23</xref>], as they have higher cursorial movement rates compared to smaller species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref049">49</xref>]. Furthermore it has been suggested that intraguild predation may reduce emergence of small ground beetles in boundary habitats as compared to crop fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref050">50</xref>]. In contrast to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref027">27</xref>] and our own expectation the average body length of actively moving communities did not depend on the land-use intensity. This is probably due to the different range of ecosystems covered in the different studies. Ribera, Doledec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref012">12</xref>] and Blake, Foster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref027">27</xref>] covered gradients of spatially separated landscapes from forest to farmland where species pools are markedly different between habitats. In contrast, the different land-use types in our study share a similar species pool to a large extent and the most dominant species in all land use types was the relatively large species <italic>Pterostichus melanarius</italic> which is known to dominate ground beetle communities in agricultural landscapes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref025">25</xref>]. In general the average body length was higher in communities of actively moving ground beetles as compared to those of emerging ones. This difference in average body length is probably a combined result of lower emergence and higher cursorial movement rates by larger species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>In contrast to our hypothesis, grasslands had higher proportion of ground beetles with good flight ability as compared to winter wheat and sugar beet fields. This result may at first appear to contradict previous findings by Ribera, Doledec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref012">12</xref>] reporting a higher frequency of macropterous species with increasing land-use intensity. However, in our study area the grasslands were not only the least intensively managed habitat but also generally scarce and isolated which may have influenced the community trait composition concerning dispersal ability. Dispersal is generally expected to have a strong impact on the likelihood of survival in fragmented habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref052">52</xref>] and Hendrickx, Maelfait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref053">53</xref>] showed that the number of ground beetle species with good flight ability increased with increasing distances to other semi-natural habitat patches. Moreover de Vries, den Boer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref054">54</xref>] found that heathland ground beetle species with a poor flight ability were more affected by fragmentation than species with a high flight ability. Other recent studies have also demonstrated that species with poor flight ability generally dominate ground beetle communities in crop fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref029">29</xref>] and are unaffected by increasing management intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref016">16</xref>]. Thus, good flight ability does not seem to be the main driver for persistence in crop fields, but can be important for survival in marginalized habitats in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. The flight ability was lower among actively moving ground beetles as compared to emerging ones, which could be explained by the dominance of the two generally brachypterous and flightless species <italic>P</italic>. <italic>melanarius</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>obtusum</italic> in the actively moving ground beetle communities.</p>
<p>Carnivorous ground beetles were more common in communities in intensively managed crop field than in grasslands, which is in line with other studies showing that arthropods with a carnivorous diet can benefit from increasing management intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref024">24</xref>]. The widespread species <italic>P</italic>. <italic>melanarius</italic> dominated ground beetle communities in our study area which agrees with previous studies in agricultural landscapes with high proportions of arable land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref025">25</xref>]. The contrast of a high proportion of carnivorous ground beetles in crop fields and a greater proportion of herbivores and omnivores in grasslands is probably due to differences in the availability of food resources e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref055">55</xref>]. Grasslands have a higher plant species diversity and availability of plant-derived food resources than crop fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref056">56</xref>], thus benefitting herbivorous ground beetle species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref026">26</xref>]. Furthermore, arthropod pest species as e.g. aphids can be abundant food resources and attract ground beetle species to crop fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref058">58</xref>]. Thus, carnivorous ground beetles are not only benefitting from management intensification within a single crop type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref026">26</xref>], but also from more intense management across different agricultural land-use types.</p>
<p>In disagreement to our hypothesis concerning overwintering traits, we did not find that the land-use type affected the proportion of adult hibernators. Instead our results showed that the proportion of adult hibernators was higher in communities of emerging ground beetles as compared to actively moving ones. Thus our results do not support the general assumption that emergence of ground beetles that overwinter as larva are more associated to crop fields than to field boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref030">30</xref>]. Larval and egg stages can be more vulnerable to disturbance e.g. tillage, as compared to adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref059">59</xref>] and even though hibernating larvae may be more common in soils of crop fields they may suffer high mortality due to soil management. The higher proportion of larval hibernators among the actively moving ground beetles as compared to the emerging ones can be explained by the cursorial dispersal of the dominant larval overwintering species <italic>P</italic>. <italic>melanarius</italic>. In contrast to our expectations, hygrophilous ground beetles were not more common in grasslands as compared to crop fields. Thus, even though soil water holding capacity is generally higher in grasslands in the study region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref060">60</xref>], it did not lead to a higher proportion of hygrophilous ground beetles. This indicates that other traits are more important when explaining ground beetle distribution across different agricultural land-use types.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results show that increasing management intensity reduces the average body size of emerging ground beetles and the proportion of mixed feeders. This, in combination with recent results imply that predation rates can be higher in generalist predator communities with individuals of smaller average body size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref018">18</xref>] and suggests that increasing land-use intensity may in fact promote the biological control potential of ground beetles. Our results suggest that the dispersal ability of ground beetles enables them to compensate for local management intensities. To predict this dynamic in more detail in order to provide management advice further studies are needed. Here we show that grasslands might be of lower importance for the biological control potential by ground beetles. However grasslands are still valuable for the conservation of other ground beetle traits and ecosystem services delivered by arthropods in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146329.ref063">63</xref>].</p>
