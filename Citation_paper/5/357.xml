      <abstract>
        <p>How entire microbial communities are structured across stratified sediments from the historical standpoint is unknown. The Baltic Sea is an ideal research object for historical reconstruction, since it has experienced many fresh- and brackish water periods and is depleted of dissolved oxygen, which increases the sediment's preservation potential. We investigated the bacterial communities, chemical elements (e.g. Cr, Pb Na, P, Sr and U) and sediment composition in a stratified sediment core dated by radiocarbon and spanning 8000 years of Baltic Sea history, using up-to-date multivariate statistics. The communities were analysed by 16S rRNA gene terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. The communities of the deep Early Litorina and surface Late Litorina Sea laminae were separated from the communities of the middle Litorina Sea laminae, which were associated with elevated concentrations of U and Sr trace elements, palaeo-oxygen and palaeosalinity proxies. Thus, the Litorina Sea laminae were characterized by past oxygen deficiency and salinity increase. The communities of the laminae, bioturbated and homogeneous sediments were differentiated, based on the same historical sea phases, with correct classifications of 90%. Palaeosalinity was one of the major parameters that separated the bacterial communities of the stratified sediments. A discontinuous spatial structure with a surprising increase in community heterogeneity was detected in Litorina Sea sediments from 388 to 422 cm deep, which suggests that a salinity maximum occurred in the central Gulf of Finland app. 6200â€“6600 years ago. The community heterogeneity decreased from the surface down to 306 cm, which reflected downcore mineralization. The plateau of the decrease was in the app. 2000-year-old sediment layers. Bacterial community data may be used as an additional tool in ocean-drilling projects, in which it is important to detect mineralization plateaus both to determine historically comparable portions of sediment samples and historical events, such as sea-level rise culminations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Despite ongoing ocean and continental drilling programmes, which investigate the history of sea basins, there is a lack of theory on how entire microbial communities are structured across stratified sediments. Generally, microbial species richness and biodiversity are expected to decrease with depth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Bowman1">[1]</xref>. Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Wu1">[2]</xref>, however, detected increased species richness and biodiversity in their deepest sediment layers. It is not known whether the associations between the habitats and microbial communities simply reflect downcore mineralization shifts or also changes in deposition history and, thus, the history of a sea basin.</p>
      <p>The Baltic Sea is an ideal research object for studying the history of a sea basin, since it has been influenced by land uplift and sea-level rises (transgression), resulting in many fresh- and brackish water phases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Berglund1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Zillen1">[4]</xref>. The Early Litorina Sea, a transition between the freshwater Ancylus Lake and the brackish Litorina Sea stage, may have ended app. 8500â€“7400 calibrated years before the present (cal years BP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Berglund1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Andrn1">[5]</xref>. The entire Litorina Sea phase with the sea-level rise culmination (transgression maximum) and the salinity maximum, followed by the present Late Litorina Sea, may have ended app. 4000â€“3000 cal years BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Berglund1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Inflows of saline waters through the Danish Straits most probably caused the development of a halocline limiting the vertical water circulation in the Litorina sea-level rise culmination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Zheng1">[6]</xref>. The halocline resulted in oxygen depletion in the bottom sediments, slowing down the mineralization of the organic matter deposited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Sohlenius1">[7]</xref>. The transgression and salinity maxima occurred in distinct areas of the Baltic Sea at different times; e.g. high salinities occurred in the Baltic Proper and Northern Baltic Sea, app. 6000â€“5000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Emeis1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Widerlund1">[9]</xref> or 6700â€“6400 cal years BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Brenner1">[10]</xref>, respectively. We do not, however, have detailed information on the palaeosalinities of the central Gulf of Finland (GOF).</p>
      <p>The Baltic Sea phases were previously determined, based on proxies such as diatoms, stable isotopes (e.g. <sup>13</sup>Câˆ¶<sup>12</sup>C ratio of total organic carbon (TOC) and Sr isotopes) and lithostratigraphical features (e.g. organic-rich laminae) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Andrn1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Zheng1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Emeis1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Widerlund1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-LopezBuendia1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Miller1">[12]</xref>. Low oxygen conditions at the seafloor and consequently lack of sediment reworking by benthic animals (bioturbation), increase preservation of the laminated structures in sediments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Kemp1">[13]</xref>. Laminae, in turn, in oxic conditions are reworked more homogenous by bioturbation. Sr isotopes were recently used as palaeosalinity proxies in the Baltic Sea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Widerlund1">[9]</xref>. In addition, elevated concentrations of trace elements, such as U and Sr, are considered as signs of palaeosalinity increases and palaeo-oxygen decreases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Zheng1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-LopezBuendia1">[11]</xref>. For instance, U precipitates onto surfaces of depositing particles in oxygen-depleted conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Nath1">[14]</xref>. To date, the best method form confirming the salinity changes between freshwater and brackish water is the diatom record <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Miller1">[12]</xref>. However, diatom preservation declines in many different environmental states, such as bioturbation and coarseness of sediment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Flower1">[15]</xref>. Thus, additional palaeo-environmental tools are needed.</p>
      <p>Although ancient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Coolen1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Coolen2">[17]</xref> microbes belonging to palaeome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Inagaki1">[18]</xref> and present-day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Sorensen1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Aquilina1">[20]</xref> sediment microbial communities have been analysed, using various molecular biomarkers, Mantel correlograms, have not been used previously to investigate how entire bacterial communities are structured in stratified sediments. Multivariate statistics has likewise not been used to study combined microbial, chemical and geological datasets from the palaeo-environmental standpoint.</p>
      <p>We investigated whether the salinity changes in the Baltic Sea basin can be inferred from bacterial community data. We analysed the associations between bacterial community composition and the spatial, sedimentological as well as chemical element parameters and radiocarbon dating in stratified Baltic Sea sediments from the central GOF, spanning a historical period of 8000 years. Using multivariate methods, such as piecewise Mantel correlograms, generalized discriminant analysis and canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP), we showed that the past salinity changes and sudden slowdown of organic material mineralization in the Baltic Sea basin, as well as downcore mineralization, can be inferred from the entire body of bacterial community data.</p>

The numbers are rounded to the nearest integer. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates was based on the Bray Curtis dissimilarity matrix (nâ€Š=â€Š32Ã—158) of bacterial terminal restriction fragments of the 16S rRNA gene. Samples and chemical parameters (purple arrows) were plotted against canonical axis scores 1 and 2. The chemical variables chosen explained 45% of the variation. Test statistics with 9999 permutations resulted in a highly significant <italic>p</italic> value (<italic>p</italic>â€Š=â€Š1e-04), which allows rejection of the null hypothesis that there are no relationships between the bacterial communities and chemical variables. The length of the arrow indicates the strength of the correlation between the sediment samples and chemical parameter. An arrow direction indicates the increasing concentration of the chemical parameter.</p>

        <p>Cr, Pb, Na, P, Sr and U variables were most significantly associated with T-RFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s010">Table S3</xref>) and were therefore chosen to the final model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054326-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Most of the chemical variables (such as Al, Ba, Ca, C, Co, Fe, Mg, N, Tl and V) were collinear, highly depth-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s011">Table S4</xref>) and showed a clear non-linear relationship with T-RFs (Figures S3 and S4) and, thus, were not included in the final model.</p>
        <p>Variance partitioning determined that chemical parameters explained 37.7%, whereas spatial parameters explained only 4.9% of the variation in the bacterial community data of the laminae. Therefore, the chemical parameters, which reflect the quality of organic matter, best explained the changes in bacterial community compositions in the dataset.</p>

(B) Depth classes: pink-filled circles indicate sediment samples from 533.5 to 500.75 cm, yellow from 494.85 to 403.75 cm, black from 393.7 to 301.35 cm, turquoise from 297.5 to 203.50 cm, blue from 199 to 101 cm and red from 96 to 18.25 cm below the seafloor. (C) Sediment composition: black-filled circles indicate laminae, yellow bioturbated and red homogeneous sediment layers. Generalized discriminant analysis was based on Bray and Curtis distances of bacterial terminal restriction fragments of the 16S rRNA gene (nâ€Š=â€Š148Ã—199). Correct classification was a) 90.5%, b) 78% and c) 52.7%. Test statistics with 9999 permutations resulted in a highly significant <italic>p</italic> value for a) and b) (<italic>p</italic>â€Š=â€Š1e-04) which allows rejection of the null hypothesis of no differences among the <italic>a priori</italic> groups. The default option of canonical analysis of principal coordinates, which combines unconstrained and constrained multivariate methods, resulted in a) 24, b) 23 and c) 13 principal component axes that were further analyzed by generalized discriminant analysis. The first and second canonical axes were plotted here.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>CAP analysis of the bacterial communities of the laminae spanning the 8000-year history of the Baltic Sea showed that the communities of the deep Early Litorina Sea and the surficial Late Litorina Sea laminae were grouped together. The Litorina Sea laminae in the middle formed a distinct group. The communities in the Litorina Sea laminae were associated with elevated concentrations of U and Sr. The elevated concentrations of trace elements, such as U, in these layers suggest that they are characteristic of past oxygen deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Zheng1">[6]</xref>. The trace element U is also considered as a sign of palaeosalinity increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-LopezBuendia1">[11]</xref>, together with Sr. The result suggests that the bacterial communities of the Litorina Sea laminae reflect past salinity increase, which affected halocline formation, causing oxygen deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Zheng1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The Early Litorina Sea, the transition phase between the Ancylus lake and Litorina Sea, may have ended app. 8500â€“7400 cal years BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Berglund1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Andrn1">[5]</xref> whereas the entire Litorina Sea phase with the salinity maximum, followed by the Late Litorina Sea, may have ended app. 4000â€“3000 cal years BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Berglund1">[3]</xref>. Based on generalized discriminant analysis, the bacterial communities of the laminae, bioturbated and homogeneous sediments formed three distinct groups representing the presumed Early Litorina Sea, Litorina Sea and Late Litorina Sea periods, with correct classification of 90%. Therefore, we concluded that palaeosalinity is probably one of the major parameters that affected bacterial communities in the sediment core. Thus, our bacterial data show strong evidence supporting the sea transitions of the Baltic Sea.</p>
      <p>To date, the best way to confirm the salinity changes between freshwater and brackish water is the diatom record <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Miller1">[12]</xref>. In lake sediments, diatom preservation declines with increasing pH, temperature, grazing, bioturbation and coarseness of sediment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Flower1">[15]</xref>. Here, we suggest that bacterial community composition data could be used as an additional tool in palaeosalinity estimations, especially if diatom records have not been preserved.</p>
      <p>The bacterial communities in the laminated sediments were not separated from the communities of the bioturbated or homogeneous sediments. A previous parallel DNA and lipid biomarker analysis showed that the biomarkers were either present or absent in a particular sediment layer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Coolen3">[21]</xref>, which suggests that DNA does not migrate vertically. Thus, the most probable explanation for our result is that the quality and chemical composition of the organic matter, as well as the environmental conditions, are the same in the laminated and bioturbated sediments within a sea phase. Therefore, the bacterial community composition was not changed, due to the rough sediment composition characteristics.</p>
      <p>The bacterial communities of the stratified sediments became structured discontinuously with depth. The bacterial heterogeneity decreased in the surficial sediment layers with depth and reached the plateau in the app. 4500-year-old layers, but suddenly increased in the app. 6200â€“6600-year-old sediment layers. The gradual heterogeneity loss in the bacterial communities was presumable, since it is governed by the exhaustion of reactive organic matter in the sediment with time. However, the surprising increase in heterogeneity may reflect the changes in the organic matter deposited and thus past climatic and oceanographic periods of the Baltic Sea.</p>
      <p>The increase in heterogeneity of the bacterial community composition may be explained by the preserving nature of the sediment layers. The high preservation potential of the Litorina Sea sediment was due to an inflow of saline water through the Danish Straits, resulting in a halocline formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Zheng1">[6]</xref>. Consequently, oxygen deficiency slowed down the mineralization of organic matter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Sohlenius1">[7]</xref>. The Litorina transgression maximum, occurred in the eastern GOF between app. 7400â€“7100 cal years BP and 6500â€“6300 cal years BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Miettinen1">[22]</xref>, whereas on the southern coast of the GOF the transgression maximum occurred earlier: between 7600â€“7300 and 6900â€“6500 cal years BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Sandgren1">[23]</xref>, which could represent the maximum sea surface salinity in the region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Sandgren1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>However, so far we have no detailed information on salinity changes in the study area, the central GOF. In our study, the increased heterogeneity of the bacterial community composition record suggests that the high salinity app. 6600â€“6200 years ago influenced the past environments and thus the composition of the material deposited in the central GOF.</p>
      <p>The layers with high preservation potential may support organic matter- decomposing bacterial communities and shelter organic matter, such as DNA itself. A large part of the sedimentary DNA may be extracellular and the mineralization of DNA low in anoxic organic-rich sediments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Corinaldesi1">[24]</xref>. The sedimentary microbial activities in the core studied here may be very slow and the community structure may not have changed to a large extent since the original deposition. We concluded that at least below the plateau of mineralization, the layers were comparable from the palaeo-environmental standpoint.</p>
      <p>The 16S rRNA gene sequences of <italic>Chloroflexi</italic>, <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> and particularly the putative candidate division bacteria JS1 were abundant in clone libraries from all the sea phases. The abundance of <italic>Chloroflexi</italic>, <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> and JS1 methane process signatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Inagaki2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Harrison1">[26]</xref> in the Baltic Sea sediment sample core may have been due to a diffuse methane flux from buried organic material boosting an ongoing biogenic anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). AOM was previously linked with a diffuse methane flux from brackish laminated subsurface sediments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Aquilina1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A microdiverse 16S rRNA gene cluster of certain JS1 bacteria emerged in the Litorina Sea layers. A changed environment causes adaptive evolutionary branching, which can be classified as a separate DNA sequence cluster without even knowing the ecology of the organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Cohan1">[27]</xref>. In our study, the adapted ecotype of JS1 in the saline Litorina Sea layers was seen as a separate microdiverse gene cluster, including a high number of a particular phylotype in the Litorina layer. This suggests that the phylotype predominating in the cluster is or has become evolutionarily well adapted to contemporary or past environments. Coolen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Coolen2">[17]</xref> previously detected change in a JS1 phylotype along different sediment units. These JS1 biomarkers could be used as tools to synchronize the sediment core records sampled worldwide.</p>
      <p>The presence of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> bacteria, which seemed to emerge in the old Early Litorina sediment layer, may be explained by the strong input of terrestrial organic matter 8000 years ago, although contamination cannot completely be ruled out. An inflow of nutrient-rich marine water through the Danish Straits, may have boosted cyanobacterial primary production during the Litorina transgression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-LopezBuendia1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Eronen1">[28]</xref>. Indeed, our study showed that non-nitrogen-fixing unicellular <italic>Synechococcus</italic> was a typical taxon emerging during the Litorina Sea phase. The combined pigment and nitrogen data suggested that filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria were also important primary producers during the Litorina transgression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Westman1">[29]</xref>. However, based on our results filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, such as <italic>Nodularia</italic>, were characteristic of the younger Late Litorina Sea. Filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria may have become common more recently, in the brackish Late Litorina Sea.</p>
      <p>The majority (66â€“68%) of the sequences in each clone library remained undescribed and were classified only at the domain level of bacteria. This stresses how little we still know about subsurface bacterial communities.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Multivariate methods, such as piecewise Mantel correlograms, have not previously been used to investigate the spatial structure of bacterial communities in downcore studies. Seldom, if ever, have the combined datasets of microbial and geological data been studied with multivariate statistics from the palaeoenvironmental standpoint. We showed that entire bacterial communities reflect both ancient and contemporary events, such as salinity changes and ongoing mineralization processes, using multivariate statistic and phylogenetics. Piecewise Mantel correlograms detect mineralization plateaus and thus determine the historically comparable portions of vertical sediment samples. The method may also reveal palaeoenvironmental events, such as relative sea-level rise culminations (sea transgressions). These tools may be useful in ocean-drilling projects, which that examine the history of the earth recorded beneath the seafloor.</p>

        <p>Most of the chemical variables showed a non linear relationship with the bacterial communities when fitted on the bacterial ordination surface (Figures S3 and S4) and were highly depth-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s011">Table S4</xref>). To determine the chemical and bacterial associations, the most explaining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s010">Table S3</xref>), non collinear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s011">Table S4</xref>) and certain non linear chemical variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s002">Figure S2</xref>) were chosen for the final linear model presented here. CAP was performed, using the R package Vegan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Oksanen1">[38]</xref> functions â€˜capscaleâ€™ for CAP, â€˜ordisurfâ€™ for fitting the chemical parameters on the ordination of bacterial communities and â€˜permutestâ€™ for testing the significance.</p>
        <p>To analyse the spatial structure of the bacterial (T-RFs) data with depth (Euclidean distance), a piecewise Mantel correlogram using the R package Ecodist function â€˜pmgramâ€™ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Goslee1">[39]</xref> was performed in an R environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-R1">[40]</xref>. Default options were used to determine the number and width of the distant classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s013">Table S6</xref>). Generalized discriminant analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Anderson3">[41]</xref>, using the R package BiodiversityR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Kindt1">[42]</xref> functions â€˜CAPdiscrimâ€™ for discriminant analysis and â€˜permutationsâ€™ for testing the significance, was done to test the difference between the <italic>a priori</italic> groups of multivariate observations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s012">Table S5</xref>). The <italic>a priori</italic> groups of the bacterial communities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s012">Table S5</xref>) were formed, based on the Mantel correlogram results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054326-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s013">Table S6</xref>), depth and rough sediment composition (laminae, bioturbated homogeneous and homogeneous sediment). The homogeneity of the group variances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054326.s007">Figure S7</xref>) was analysed by a multivariate analogue of Levene's test, an analysis of multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Anderson4">[43]</xref>, using the R package Vegan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Oksanen1">[38]</xref> functions â€˜betadisperâ€™ for group dispersions and â€˜permutestâ€™ for testing the significance.</p>
        <p>Variance in the bacterial communities was partitioned in to pure chemical and depth proportions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-McArdle1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Anderson5">[44]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Anderson6">[47]</xref>. The first partial RDA runs were done, using the program DISTML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054326-Anderson7">[48]</xref>, and were subsequently used in variance partitioning. In all statistical analyses, the Bray-Curtis distances were calculated between observations and 9999 permutations were used for calculating the <italic>P</italic> values.</p>
