      <abstract>
        <p>Classical ecological studies discussing specialization usually focus on species’ performance along one niche axis. This approach may overlook niche differentiation evident in another dimension which could explain species co-occurrence. The present research exemplifies a comprehensive approach to examining local adaptation. Specifically, we examined multiple niche axes by subjecting a model organism to various experimental conditions to monitor responses to extreme stress associated with heat, desiccation and starvation. Our model system comprised two pit-building antlions: the habitat generalist <italic>Myrmeleon hyalinus</italic> and the habitat specialist <italic>Cueta lineosa</italic>. Previous research has shown that the foraging performance of the generalist is better than that of the specialist, even in the latter’s characteristic habitat. We illustrate that this apparent superiority of the habitat generalist does not manifest itself along other niche axes; rather, the habitat specialist holds a set of traits that provide an advantage under harsh environmental conditions. Specifically, <italic>C. lineosa</italic> has an advantage over <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> at high temperatures, exhibiting a higher survival rate and improved foraging success (i.e., high-temperature specialist). <italic>C. lineosa</italic> is also more efficient in its energy budget, losing less mass during starvation and gaining mass more efficiently during feeding. This superior efficiency is a result of physiological adaptations as well as behavioural responses to harsh conditions. In conclusion, our results imply that the habitat specialization of <italic>C. lineosa</italic> has not led it towards an evolutionary dead-end.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Adaptation to local biotic (e.g., competitors and predators) and abiotic (e.g., temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, etc.) conditions is important for the survival and reproduction of any organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Kawecki1">[1]</xref>. Since different organisms have a limited set of environmental conditions under which they can better persist, local adaptations often result in specialization along one or several niche axes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Futuyma1">[2]</xref>. The degree of specialization on each axis may differ between species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Pianka1">[3]</xref>. For instance, one species may be tolerant and reproduce under a wide range of temperatures (generalist), while another will be able to reproduce only within a limited range of temperatures (specialist) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Hoffmann1">[4]</xref>. Classical studies discussing niche breadth differences between species, usually examine only one niche axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Pianka1">[3]</xref>. Obviously, a certain species may be a specialist on one axis (e.g., exploiting and performing well only within a narrow range of habitat types), but a generalist on another (e.g., consuming different food types with equal success, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Morris1">[5]</xref>). Therefore, comparative studies should quantify inter-species variation in niche breadth by examining several different niche axes, both by observation in the field, and experimentally, by exposing the subject organisms to differing levels of environmental stress (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Rion1">[6]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Temperature is one of the most important physical factors that define a species’ fundamental niche. Temperature limits some species’ distributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Clarke1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Stevens1">[9]</xref> because both extreme heat and cold can adversely affect metabolic and life-history traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Cossins1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Prosser1">[13]</xref>. Such effects should lead to optimization of metabolic and demographic traits over the range of temperatures most often experienced by a population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Hoffmann2">[8]</xref>). If this range is narrow, then thermal specialization may evolve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Angilletta1">[14]</xref>. This hypothesis frequently presumes an evolutionary trade-off between capacity to tolerate a broad range of temperatures and peak performance over a narrow range, but this trade-off lacks empirical support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Huey1">[15]</xref>. Selection experiments on the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> have demonstrated that experimental populations always became better adapted to the temperatures at which they evolved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Bennett1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Mongold2">[19]</xref>. However, their correlated responses at other temperatures varied depending on the selective temperature and were not always consistent among replicate populations maintained at the same selective temperature. For example, populations that evolved at 20°C systematically became inferior competitors at temperatures above 40°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Mongold1">[18]</xref>, whereas five of the six populations that adapted to 42°C did not become inferior competitors at low temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Bennett1">[16]</xref>. These evolutionary experiments therefore provide ambiguous support for the existence of trade-offs in performance across the thermal niche.</p>
      <p>High temperatures may be associated with either low or high relative humidity. These differences may be apparent when contrasting different climatic regions, such as desert vs. tropical climates, or even at smaller scales, when contrasting adjacent microhabitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Willmer1">[20]</xref>. In arid habitats, temperature and relative humidity are dramatically affected by shade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Buxton1">[21]</xref>. Areas exposed to direct sunlight are characterized by both high temperature and low relative humidity, while shaded areas, albeit in desert climates, experience lower temperatures and higher relative humidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Lucas1">[22]</xref>. The temperature tolerance of an organism, through behavioral or physiological responses, is expected to be a crucial factor in its habitat and microhabitat choices. For instance, soil and underground environments can provide refuge from the temperature extremes which occur at the surface, while vegetation may ensure that terrestrial habitats are varied in biotic and abiotic conditions, especially for small animals like insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Buxton1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Water availability and temperature are the two most important abiotic variables influencing the distribution and abundance of insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Chown1">[23]</xref>. Much water balance work has been undertaken in desert regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-AddoBediako1">[24]</xref>, demonstrating superior desiccation resistance in species from arid environments. Insects lose water by respiration, excretion and evaporation through their cuticle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Chown1">[23]</xref>. Desiccation resistance is generally accomplished in three ways: increasing body water content, reducing rates of water loss, or tolerating the loss of a greater proportion of body water (desiccation or dehydration tolerance) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Gibbs1">[25]</xref>. The standard method of measuring desiccation resistance is to record the mass change of insects maintained in dry conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Chown1">[23]</xref>. Losses represent water and also dry matter metabolized as CO<sub>2</sub>. Insects maintained in dry air experience starvation and desiccation, whereas those maintained at higher humidity levels experience mainly starvation.</p>
      <p>Small body size is commonly accepted as disadvantageous for insects in terrestrial environments because of their small water storage capacity, combined with a relatively large surface area, that enables faster cutaneous water loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Willmer1">[20]</xref>. However, small body size can enable the organism to experience finer spatial heterogeneity among different microclimatic conditions within the same general habitat, taking advantage of the August average daily temperature: 25.7°C, average daily maximum: 32.8°C, microclimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Willmer1">[20]</xref>. Such an ability to switch microclimates may be restricted in insects characterized by limited movement, such as sit-and-wait and trap-building predators, forcing them to adapt more specifically to their local environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Scharf1">[26]</xref>. For example, pit-building antlions are dramatically affected by their physical environment, showing differences in pit size, body size, growth trajectory and life-history plasticity, depending on the local conditions in their habitat of origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Scharf2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Arnett1">[28]</xref>. Additionally, antlion activity is, to a large extent, constrained by high temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Green1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Different species of antlions show major differences in their microhabitat preferences – soil type, particle size, shade, etc. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Botz1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Klein1">[34]</xref>. Lucas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Lucas1">[22]</xref> compared two species of antlions, <italic>Myrmeleon crudelis</italic> and <italic>M. carolinus</italic>, occupying shaded and open habitats, respectively, and found evidence for physiological adaptations to harsh environments in <italic>M. carolinus</italic>, at the expense of a reduced survivorship when interacting with other species. However, despite their preferences for different soil types, pit-building antlions may also construct pits in less desirable habitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Barkae1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-FarjiBrener1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Lucas2">[36]</xref>. In this study we used two species of pit-building antlions, both highly common in Israel. The habitat generalist, <italic>Myrmeleon hyalinus</italic> Olivier, 1811, inhabits and performs equally well in both sand- and loess-derived soils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Barkae1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Simon1">[37]</xref>, while the habitat specialist, <italic>Cueta lineosa</italic> Rambur, 1842, inhabits only fine-grained soils such as loess <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Simon1">[37]</xref>, while showing reduced foraging performance in coarse-grained sandy soils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Barkae1">[33]</xref>. Sand-derived soils (i.e., coarse-grained texture) in the Israeli Negev desert are surrounded and fragmented by loess-derived soils (i.e., fine-grained texture), forming a wide range of habitat mosaics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Evenari1">[38]</xref>, pp. 43–46). Furthermore, as predicted by the inverse texture hypothesis, in the semi-arid and arid regions of Israel, the former soils are much more productive than the latter ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-NoyMeir1">[39]</xref>. This may explain why <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> larvae originating from desert habitats exhibit strong selectivity to sand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Barkae1">[33]</xref> and why their natural abundance in sand-derived soils is higher than in loess-derived soils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Simon1">[37]</xref>. <italic>M. hyalinus</italic>’ superior performance in both soil types seemed to show only part of the picture. An additional important difference in these species’ natural occurrence is their microhabitat selection: <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> is usually found under trees or bushes (i.e., shaded microhabitat), while <italic>C. lineosa</italic> is found in open areas, exposed to direct sunlight. Since niche theory predicts that co-occurring species should show some level of niche separation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Pianka1">[3]</xref>, we predicted that <italic>C. lineosa</italic> should perform better than <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> along other environmental axes, related to arid conditions – i.e., high temperature, low relative humidity, and poor food abundance.</p>
      <p>Low and stochastic food abundance are characteristic of desert conditions, and animals originating from such conditions are expected to handle starvation periods better than animals from more benign habitats (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Marron1">[40]</xref>). Animals respond to starvation or shortage of prey in two main ways: they can reduce their metabolic rate and wait for prey abundance to increase, or alternatively, they can maintain their current metabolic rate and actively search for better foraging sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Gutman1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Wang1">[42]</xref>. These two strategies are context-dependent; reducing metabolic rate is possibly preferred under harsh (extreme temperatures or low prey encounter rates) or stochastic conditions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Tanaka1">[43]</xref>). Alternatively, increased activity may be preferred under higher prey encounter rates or more predictable conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Scharf1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Gutman1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Scharf3">[44]</xref>. Clearly, these responses may also be related to other individual traits, such as body size or developmental stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Wang1">[42]</xref>. Starvation endurance is an important trait, especially in sit-and-wait predators, which suffer from fluctuations in prey abundance much more than closely related actively searching predators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Riechert1">[45]</xref>. Like other sit-and-wait predators, such as spiders, antlions are capable of dramatically reducing their metabolic rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Lucas3">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Matsura1">[47]</xref>. Since not all species and populations experience the same fluctuations in prey abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Rosenberg1">[48]</xref>, the response to starvation may be dependent on habitat-of-origin. Indeed, Arnett and Gotelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Arnett1">[28]</xref> have illustrated that antlion populations originating from temperate regions had better starvation endurance than populations originating from sub-tropical regions.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that antlion species originating from harsher environments, which experience less favorable conditions and lower prey encounter rates, should be less sensitive to starvation. Specifically, we expected <italic>M. hyalinus</italic>, inhabiting shaded microhabitats, to lose body mass more rapidly during starvation than <italic>C. lineosa</italic>, which inhabits open areas, characterized by higher temperatures, lower relative humidity, and a low and stochastic prey encounter rate. Physiological differences in the ability of individuals to cope with starvation may be attributed to genetic differences, phenotypic plasticity or a combination of both. To test the effect of these factors, individual antlions’ ability to handle starvation stress should be examined under several different habitat conditions (e.g., temperature and relative humidity). If each species’ response to starvation is affected mainly by its local conditions, then we expected both species to respond in similar fashions when exposed to the same climatic conditions. However, it should be mentioned that G×E interactions may effectively 'hide' genetic differences under certain environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-DeVisser1">[49]</xref>. Alternatively, if responses to starvation are genetically fixed or canalized, we expected to see differences in pit-building behaviour and relative growth rate between the species, even when kept under the same conditions.</p>

        <p>We collected <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> larvae under different tamarisk trees located in Nahal Secher (N 31°06′, E 34°49′), a sandy area 15 km south of the city of Be'er-Sheva, Israel, and brought them to the laboratory. <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> is the most abundant pit-building antlion in Israel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Simon1">[37]</xref>. The larvae attain maximal lengths of about 10 mm and body masses of up to 0.06 g before pupating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Scharf2">[27]</xref>. This species performs equally well in sand-derived and loess-derived soils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Barkae1">[33]</xref>. The fact that in our research area sandy soils are more productive than loess-derived soils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-NoyMeir1">[39]</xref>, may explain why this species is found in higher abundance in the former coarse-grained soils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Simon1">[37]</xref>. In addition, we collected <italic>C. lineosa</italic> larvae from the loessial plains near Be’er-Sheva (N 31°16′, E 34°50′). Occurring mainly in the Israeli Negev desert, <italic>C. lineosa</italic> also exists in several small populations located in central and northern Israel, but is restricted to light soils, such as loess <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Simon1">[37]</xref>. This species is a habitat specialist: its performance declines when placed in coarse-grained soils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Barkae1">[33]</xref>. The two antlions are similarly sized and have comparable life cycles. Although they largely overlap in their geographical distribution, they rarely overlap in their microhabitat use. Specifically, <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> prefers shaded microhabitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Simon1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Scharf4">[50]</xref>, while <italic>C. lineosa</italic> is mainly found in open microhabitats exposed to direct sunlight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Simon1">[37]</xref>. Therefore, it is unlikely that interference competition exists between the two antlion species, even in loess-derived soils. However, it is possible that they indirectly compete for their arthropod prey (i.e., exploitation competition). All required permits and approvals for this work were obtained from Israel’s Nature and National Parks Protection Authority, permit no. 2010/37830. In compliance with all the relevant laws and regulations prevailing in Israel, self-regulation and accountability of local programs by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) are not applicable for the use of invertebrates in research (Israel's Animal Welfare Act 1984).</p>

        <title>Experimental Procedures</title>
        <p>The study was comprised of three complementary experiments: 1) Thermal stress experiment, investigating the behavioral responses and growth efficiency of the two species when exposed to increased temperatures, while also testing if these effects are consistent when using more realistic prey items such as ants, under field-representative temperatures. 2) Gradual heating experiment, to test whether the antlions respond differently to gradual heating vs. sudden heating. 3) Starvation and humidity experiment, testing responses to starvation under different relative humidity levels. In all the experiments, fresh antlions were collected in the field and kept separately in round plastic cups (10.5 cm diameter, 7 cm height) filled with 3 cm of sand (for <italic>M. hyalinus</italic>) or loess (for <italic>C. lineosa</italic>). Antlion larvae were fed with mealworms <italic>ad libitum</italic> until the beginning of the experiments (habituation period). Larvae were weighed throughout the experiments to ±0.1 mg (CP224S, Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany).</p>
        <sec id="s2b1">
          <title>Thermal stress experiment</title>
          <p>After the habituation period, all the antlions (<italic>M. hyalinus</italic> and <italic>C. lineosa</italic>, N = 30 per treatment per species) were starved for one week. This procedure was used to standardize the hunger level of the antlions. It ensures that the physiological state of all antlion larvae is approximately the same at the beginning of the experiment. Thereafter, we put the antlions into a controlled environmental chamber (25°C, 30% RH, day:night length 12∶12 h) for three days, after which they were each fed with a single mealworm. The antlions were then exposed to three days of high temperature (30°C, 40°C, 45°C or 50°C), and then fed another mealworm. An exception is one treatment in which the antlions were exposed to 45°C for only 24 hours. A temperature of 45°C for three days was found to be a lethal treatment for <italic>M. hyalinus</italic>, but not for <italic>C. lineosa</italic>, therefore the shorter treatment (in which both species survived) was added. At the end of the period of thermal stress, the temperature was reduced to 25°C for three days, and the larvae were fed again. By the end of each of the three phases, we monitored pit building activity, pit diameter, response to a single mealworm prey (yes/no), response time to prey (within those who responded, similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Scharf5">[51]</xref>), and growth efficiency (i.e., conversion of prey mass to predator mass). Growth efficiency was measured by dividing the difference in antlion body mass before and after feeding by the prey body mass (measured before feeding) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0050884.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Scharf6">[52]</xref>. To this end, the antlions were weighed ca. three hours after feeding, to ensure that most antlions will have consumed their prey. Body mass loss during this three-hour period is negligible, as antlions do not defecate. The meal is not fully consumed, therefore growth efficiency values usually range between 0 (no consumption) and 0.9 (near-complete consumption of the mealworm).</p>
          <p>Survival rate was compared between species for each temperature treatment using Pearson’s Chi-square. The proportion of antlions that constructed pits, and the proportion of antlions that responded to prey, was compared between periods (before, during and after the heating period) within each treatment using Pearson’s Chi-square. Pit diameter, response time to prey and growth efficiency were similarly compared between periods using Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test.</p>
          <p>The second phase of this experiment aimed at examining differences in foraging performance when using natural ant prey, while also simulating more realistic field-representative temperatures. We thus collected fresh antlions and ants (<italic>Pheidole pallidula</italic> and <italic>Messor aegyptiacus</italic>) from the same locations described above. After the habituation period, all individuals were starved for one week. Thereafter, we placed the antlions in a controlled environmental chamber (30% RH, day:night length 12∶12 h) for three days of high temperature (30°C or 40°C), after which they were each fed with a single ant. We measured each antlion’s response time to prey, and whether it succeeded in capturing the ant prey. Response time was compared between species and temperatures using ANOVA GLM, using the residuals after regressing response times against antlion body mass. Prey capture success was compared between species and temperatures using logistic regression. While temperatures in the first phase of this experiment were selected to exert the highest stress possible and examine the lethal temperature limit, milder, more realistic field temperatures were chosen in the second phase: 30°C being close to the mean temperature near Be’er-Sheva during the summer months (August average daily temperature: 25.7°C, average daily maximum: 32.8°C, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-IMS1">[53]</xref>), and 40°C as a representative temperature of open areas, exposed to direct radiation. Soil temperatures in areas exposed to sunlight are higher than the surrounding air temperature: average daily highs of 36.1°C in soil and 33.2°C in air were recorded in Be’er-Sheva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-IMS1">[53]</xref>, and daily highs of 43°C in soil and 33°C in air were recorded in the central Negev <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Fliebach1">[54]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Gradual heating experiment</title>
          <p>After the habituation period, all the antlions (<italic>M. hyalinus</italic> and <italic>C. lineosa</italic>, N = 30 per treatment per species) were starved for one week. Thereafter, all antlions were placed into one of two controlled environmental chambers (30°C, 30% RH, day:night length 12∶12 h) for seven days. In the first chamber, the temperature was kept stable for 3.5 days, after which it was abruptly increased to 40°C for the remaining 3.5 days. In the second chamber, the temperature was gradually and linearly increased (over the entire experimental period) to 40°C. We weighed the antlions at the beginning and end of the experiment and measured their pit diameter periodically. At the end of the experimental period each antlion was fed a single mealworm in order to measure response time to prey and growth efficiency. Antlions were kept in plastic cups (10.5 cm diameter) filled with 3 cm of sand (for <italic>M. hyalinus</italic>) or loess (for <italic>C. lineosa</italic>). To achieve a better understanding of the changes in body mass throughout the experiment, while minimizing pit disturbance, an additional group of antlions was kept in separate cups, under the same experimental conditions. Antlions in this second group were weighed more frequently, but their pit diameter was not measured, because of the frequent disturbance caused by the weighing. Relative growth rate was calculated according to the common formula (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Gotthard1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Gotthard2">[56]</xref>) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0050884.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the disturbed cups, relative growth rate was compared between the earlier, cooler 3.5 days, and the later, warmer 3.5 days by repeated measures ANOVA. In the undisturbed cups, relative growth rate (i.e., mass loss) and pit diameter were compared between species and treatments using repeated measures ANOVA. Growth efficiency and response time were measured only at the end of the experimental period, and were thus analysed using ANOVA.</p>

          <title>Starvation and humidity experiment</title>
          <p>To impose a continuous and steady desiccation stress, we placed antlions from both species (N = 30 per treatment per species) into one of two climate chambers, both set to the same temperature of 30°C (day:night length 12∶12 h), but to different relative humidity levels –30% (9.52 mmHg) vs. 70% (22.22 mmHg). This temperature was selected as it is close to daily average temperatures during the summer months, and takes into account the larvae’s inability to escape warm temperatures by burrowing deeper into the soil. Although field temperatures may reach peaks of over 40°C, they also decrease dramatically during the night. Since we wished to impose a steady but survivable desiccation stress, we chose a temperature closer to the daily mean, rather than the daily maximum. The antlions were starved for 60 days, while control groups were fed one mealworm per week. We weighed the antlions and measured their pit diameter periodically throughout the experiment. Also, at the beginning and end of the starvation period, one pre-weighed mealworm was given to each antlion in order to measure response time to prey, and growth efficiency. Pit diameter, response time, growth efficiency and relative growth rate (or mass loss) were compared between species and treatments using ANOVA GLM.</p>
          <p>All statistical analyses were carried out using STATISTICA, ver. 8.0.</p>

        <p>Survival rate did not differ significantly between species in the milder treatments: survival rates for <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> were 29/30 (96.7%), 30/30 (100%), and 29/30 (96.7%) for 30°C, 40°C and 45°C/24 h respectively, and for <italic>C. lineosa</italic> 28/30 (93.3%), 29/30 (96.7%) and 27/30 (90.0%) for 30°C, 40°C and 45°C/24 h respectively (Pearson’s Chi-square, P = N.S. for all comparisons).

        <p>The tendency to construct pits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050884-t001">Table 1</xref>) was consistent for most temperatures between the pre-heat and heating period (Pearson Chi-Square, P = N.S.).

No differences were found between treatments (F<sub>1,109</sub> = 1.50, P = 0.224).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Classical ecological studies discussing specialization usually focus on species’ performance along one niche axis, overlooking underlying mechanisms of species co-occurrence and coexistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Pianka1">[3]</xref>. This calls for a new effort to explore ecological specialization along more than one niche axis, combined with exposure to different types of environmental stress. As a model system to explore this new direction, we used two antlion species varying in their habitat utilization spectrum, a habitat generalist and a habitat specialist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Barkae1">[33]</xref>. Notably, the foraging performance of the habitat generalist was found to be better than that of the habitat specialist in both sand and loess-derived soil types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Barkae1">[33]</xref>. We aimed at testing whether the habitat specialist has an advantage over the habitat generalist along other niche axes, or if its poorer performance has been leading it towards an evolutionary dead-end. The three additional niche axes examined were high temperature, food abundance (feeding vs. starvation) and desiccation stress. Our results indicate niche separation along the temperature and food abundance axes, but not along the axis of relative humidity. Specifically, we illustrate that the habitat specialist, <italic>C. lineosa</italic>, has an advantage over the habitat generalist, <italic>M. hyalinus</italic>, at high temperatures, exhibiting a higher survival rate, increasing its pit size, and improving both its response time to prey and its prey capture success. From the perspective of thermal adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Angilletta2">[57]</xref>, our results suggest that <italic>C. lineosa</italic> is a high-temperature specialist, relative to the low-temperature generalist <italic>M. hyalinus</italic>. <italic>C. lineosa</italic> is also more efficient in its energy use, losing less body mass than <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> during prolonged starvation, and gaining mass more efficiently than <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> when fed regularly. Remarkably, this advantage of the habitat specialist over the habitat generalist is evident at high and low levels of desiccation stress. These results indicate that the previously reported apparent superiority of the habitat generalist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Barkae1">[33]</xref> does not manifest itself along other niche axes; rather, the habitat specialist holds a set of traits that give it an advantage under harsh environmental conditions. All of the above suggests that microclimate (microhabitat) differences play an important role in maintaining the coexistence of these two species.</p>
      <p>Antlions seemed to experience gradual heating as a harsher treatment than sudden heating, losing more mass in the former. In their natural environment, antlions experience large day/night temperature fluctuations, causing behavioural changes as a response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-VanZyl1">[58]</xref>. It is possible that the gradual change in temperature imposed in our experiment was too moderate to evoke behavioural or physiological responses which could minimize energy expenditure and water loss. The fact that this differential effect of heating rate between treatments was evident only in the frequently disturbed cups may suggest that it can be discerned only when activity levels are high. Indeed, the frequent disturbance of antlions to enable weighing forced them to reconstruct their pits several times, maintaining high activity levels. Differences between the two species were still evident, as <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> suffered more severely from the heating in the warmer phase of the experiment, in terms of body mass loss. In the undisturbed cups, differences between the species were consistent with our other experiments, with <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> constructing larger pits, losing mass more rapidly, and decreasing its pit size over time, compared to the relatively stable pit size of <italic>C. lineosa</italic>. Since the gradual heating is experienced by the antlions as the harsher treatment (faster mass loss), response times also agree with other results: <italic>C. lineosa</italic>, which is better adapted to harsh conditions, responds faster in the gradual heating treatment, while <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> responds faster in the sudden heating treatment. These results reinforce the notion that <italic>C. lineosa</italic> is a high-temperature specialist, while <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> is a low-temperature generalist.</p>
      <p>Classical studies examining local adaptation usually compared organisms or populations originating from different climates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Scharf2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Endler1">[59]</xref>, but this study brings forth the important effect of microclimate – <italic>C. lineosa</italic>, the species usually exposed to high temperatures, also performs better under these conditions, and thus <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> loses its advantage. These findings point towards a separation between the two species along the thermal niche axis. The effect of temperature on foraging activity has also been demonstrated in other insects, most commonly in ants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Jayatilaka1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Zheng1">[61]</xref>. Arid conditions are characterized not only by high temperature, but also by lower relative humidity, leading to increased water loss. We did not find significant differences between the two species in the effect of relative humidity, as both species seemed to suffer similarly from the desiccation stress. <italic>C. lineosa</italic> did not seem to suffer less at low relative humidity, as might be expected, but perhaps exposure to higher temperatures (for a shorter time period), combined with the low relative humidity, may have brought forth different results. Perhaps in a short-term experiment with high temperatures and high relative humidity, <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> would have performed better than under dry conditions. It is important to note that the antlions’ exposure to high temperature in the lab is different than field conditions - under lab conditions the sand in each antlion’s cup heats up in a relatively uniform fashion, and the antlions can’t escape the high temperature by burrowing deeper into the soil, as is evident in field studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-VanZyl1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Marsh1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Geiler1">[64]</xref>. Therefore, the exposure to high temperature is more extreme in the laboratory than in the field. For this same reason, we set the long-term survivable starvation temperature to 30°C, which is closer to the daily mean temperature in the field than to the daily maximum.</p>
      <p><italic>C. lineosa</italic> was also found to be more efficient than <italic>M. hyalinus</italic> – under constant food supply, <italic>C. lineosa</italic> grows faster. Possible explanations for this may include a lower basal metabolic rate or better growth efficiency (i.e., the efficiency of converting prey mass to predator mass). Under starvation, <italic>C. lineosa</italic> lost mass slower than <italic>M. hyalinus</italic>, a result that may indicate a decreased metabolic rate, different metabolic fuel utilization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Kalra1">[65]</xref>) or behavioural changes (i.e., decreased pit-building and maintenance activity). We interpret this separation along the food abundance axis to mean that <italic>C. lineosa</italic> may be able to better handle sporadic feeding, and exploit prey efficiently even when it is encountered intermittently, thus exhibiting a better ability to persist in a variable environment. This ability is specifically important in sit-and-wait predators, which suffer from fluctuations in prey abundance much more than actively searching predators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Riechert1">[45]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Like other sit-and-wait predators, such as spiders, antlions are capable of dramatically reducing their metabolic rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Lucas3">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Matsura1">[47]</xref>. Since not all species and populations experience the same fluctuations in prey abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Rosenberg1">[48]</xref>, the response to starvation may be dependent on habitat-of-origin. Indeed, Arnett and Gotelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Arnett1">[28]</xref> have illustrated that antlion populations originating from temperate regions had better starvation endurance than populations originating from sub-tropical regions. In our experiment, <italic>C. lineosa</italic>, originating from a harsher microhabitat, seems to have a lower basal metabolic rate than <italic>M. hyalinus</italic>, irrespective of food abundance. Note that the conditions antlions experienced in our experiments were extreme, and in some cases even higher than seasonal means in the field. However, we still find our results to be ecologically relevant, since natural selection exerts its most dramatic influence at the edges of the organism’s tolerance limits, even if exposure to these edges happens only once every few generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Grant1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Pelletier1">[67]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To conclude, this work exemplifies a comprehensive approach to examining local adaptation, bringing forth the importance of differences in microclimates in promoting species coexistence, examining several niche axes, and exposing model organisms to extreme experimental conditions, in order to examine the limits of each species’ niche. Future directions for this research should include an exploration of the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying <italic>C. lineosa</italic>’s superior tolerance to high temperatures. These mechanisms could include cuticle lipid composition and permeability to water loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Gibbs2">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Gibbs3">[69]</xref>, differences in metabolic rates and metabolic fuel utilization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Kalra1">[65]</xref>), and different expression levels of heat-related proteins, such as HSPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-kerfelt1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050884-Anckar1">[71]</xref>.</p>
