<abstract>
<p>Genetic modification, including plant breeding, has been widely used to improve crop yield and quality, as well as to increase disease resistance. Targeted genome engineering is expected to contribute significantly to future varietal improvement, and genome editing technologies using zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9/single guide RNA (sgRNA) have already been successfully used to genetically modify plants. However, to date, there has been no reported use of any of the current genome editing approaches in sweet orange, an important fruit crop. In this study, we first developed a novel tool, Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration, for enhancing transient protein expression in sweet orange leaves. We then successfully employed Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration to deliver Cas9, along with a synthetic sgRNA targeting the <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene, into sweet orange. DNA sequencing confirmed that the <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene was mutated at the target site in treated sweet orange leaves. The mutation rate using the Cas9/sgRNA system was approximately 3.2 to 3.9%. Off-target mutagenesis was not detected for <italic>CsPDS</italic>-related DNA sequences in our study. This is the first report of targeted genome modification in citrus using the Cas9/sgRNA system—a system that holds significant promise for the study of citrus gene function and for targeted genetic modification.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetic modification, including plant breeding, has been widely used to improve crop yield, quality and disease resistance. In particular, targeted genome engineering promises to contribute greatly to future varietal improvement. Genome editing technologies that use zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9/single guide RNA (sgRNA) (hereafter named Cas9/sgRNA) have been successfully used to genetically modify plants. Through the fusion of the FokI nuclease domain to a set of customized zinc finger proteins, ZFNs can be used to cleave a target DNA site, which is subsequently subjected to error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) that leads to targeted mutagenesis. ZFNs have thus far been used successfully for genome modification in soybean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Curtin1">[1]</xref>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Qi1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Lloyd1">[6]</xref>, <italic>Zea mays</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Shukla1">[7]</xref>, and tobacco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Townsend1">[8]</xref>. More recently, TALEN technology has emerged as a more attractive approach for genome engineering, owing to its more tractable nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Gaj1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Chen1">[10]</xref>. TALENs can be used to target any desirable site based on a simple code that results from the repeat-variable di-residue (RVD) sequences found within a conserved TALE repeat, with each RVD specifically binding to a corresponding nucleotide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Boch1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Moscou1">[12]</xref>.

<p>Most recently, the Cas9/sgRNA system has been undergoing rapid development and is now regarded as another very promising method for genome engineering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Gaj1">[9]</xref>. In nature, the CRISPR/Cas system serves as the adaptive immune system of prokaryotes. The CRISPR locus contains a characteristic array of repeat sequences interspersed by spacer sequences derived from foreign genetic elements emanating from previous virus or plasmid DNA invasions. In some cases, DNA from a newly invading virus or plasmid DNA will match the DNA in the CRISPR “spacer,” and a CRISPR/Cas9/crRNA-mediated response is mounted and the foreign DNA is destroyed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Wiedenheft1">[19]</xref>. The type II CRISPR/Cas system from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> SF370 has been developed for targeted genome engineering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Cong1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Mali1">[22]</xref>. This system is composed of the Cas9, Cas1, Cas2, and Csn1 proteins, as well as CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA). In response to foreign nucleic acid assaults, tracrRNA is transcribed and hybridizes with pre-crRNA to form a functional crRNA with the aid of the Cas9 protein. The mature crRNA:tracrRNA duplex guides Cas9 to the targeted protospacer region, which is upstream of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The crRNA spacer hybridizes with the protospacer to facilitate Cas9-mediated cleavage within the protospacer. The CRISPR/Cas system has been simplified from a three-component system to a two-component, Cas9/single guide RNA (sgRNA) system, in which the Cas9 protein binds to a synthetic sgRNA that contains a fusion of the crRNA and tracrRNA elements.</p>
<p>The Cas9/sgRNA system is gaining in popularity due to its simplicity and affordability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Strau1">[23]</xref>. Whereas both ZFNs and TALENs demand elaborate designs and the assembly of individual DNA-binding proteins for each DNA target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Curtin1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Zhang2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Gaj1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Li1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Streubel1">[24]</xref>, the Cas9/sgRNA system requires changes only in the recombinant sgRNA for target specificity rather than in the Cas9 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Cong1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Nekrasov1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Shan1">[28]</xref>. Cas9/sgRNA technology has been successfully used for genome editing in rice, wheat, Arabidopsis, tobacco and sorghum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Nekrasov1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Shan1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, none of the aforementioned genome editing approaches have been reported for use in citrus. Citrus is the most economically important and extensively grown fruit tree crop in the world, with sweet orange accounting for approximately 60% of citrus production in 2009 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Xu1">[29]</xref>. Despite its importance, the genetic improvement of citrus is limited by the slow growth and maturation of this crop, as well as by crop pollen incompatibility, polyembryony, and parthenocarpy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Talon1">[30]</xref>. Thus, it is important to develop new methods for targeted citrus genome modification (especially for sweet orange). In this study, we show that a customizable sgRNA can be used to direct the Cas9-mediated, sequence-specific genetic modification of sweet orange using Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration.</p>

<title>Targeted genome engineering in sweet orange using the Cas9/sgRNA system.</title>
<p>(a) Scheme of the binary vectors 1380-Cas9 and 1380-Cas9:sgRNA. A Flag tag and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) were fused to the Cas9 N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively. Cas9 catalyzes the cleavage of the sgRNA-targeting sequence immediately upstream of the PAM. Here, Cas9/sgRNA was employed to target the <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene (red). The <italic>Mfe</italic>I restriction site and the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) are underlined. (b) Selective PCR amplification of mutagenized <italic>CsPDS</italic> genes was used to detect the Cas9/sgRNA-induced mutation <italic>in planta</italic>. PCR amplification was conducted using the primers CsPDS-5-P1 and CsPDS-3-P2, which flank the target site within the <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). Lanes 1-3, the template genomic DNA was digested with <italic>Mfe</italic>I. Lane 4, nondigested genomic DNA was used as a template. The PCR product in lane 1 resulted from Cas9/sgRNA-induced disruption of the <italic>Mfe</italic>I site and was therefore cloned into the PCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Life Technologies) for sequencing. (c) Targeted mutations induced by Cas9/sgRNA in the <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene in sweet orange. Sequences of mutant variants of the <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene obtained from the clones constructed using the PCR product from lane 1 in Fig. 2b were aligned with the wild type sequence (top). The sgRNA-targeted <italic>CsPDS</italic> sequence is shown in red, and the mutations are shown in purple. (d) Measurement of the mutation rate of the <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene induced by Cas9/sgRNA. Genomic DNA was extracted from three samples (co-expression of Cas9 and sgRNA; expression of Cas9 alone; no expression of Cas9 and sgRNA), and subjected to PCR amplification using the primers CsPDS-5-P1 and CsPDS-3-P2. The PCR products were digested with <italic>Mfe</italic>I and analyzed by DNA gel electrophoresis (Lane 1, co-expression of Cas9 and sgRNA; Lane 2, expression of Cas9 alone; Lane 3, no expression of Cas9 and sgRNA). The mutation rate was calculated by dividing the intensity of the uncut band by the intensity of all the bands in each lane.</p>

<p>The GUS activity assay was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Liu1">[33]</xref>, with modifications. Thirty milligrams of leaf tissue was ground in 300 μl of GUS extraction buffer (50 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.0), 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM DTT) using a mortar and pestle. The ground material was centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at top speed (12,000× <italic>g</italic>) in a tabletop centrifuge. After centrifugation, 200 μl of supernatant was collected, and the amount of protein was measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Twenty-five microliters of extract was mixed with 225 μl of GUS extraction buffer containing 1 mM 4-methyl-umbelliferyl glucuronide (MUG), and then the mixture was incubated at 37°C. After 30 min and 90 min, 100 μl of the reaction was added to 900 μl of 0.2 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and the fluorometric values were determined using a VersaFluor Fluorometer (BioRad). The GUS activity is expressed as pmol of 4-methyl-umbelliferone (MU) per μg protein per min.</p>

Fourteen regions out of the 23 that lacked an <italic>Mfe</italic>I site close to the target site were chosen for analysis. Attempts were made to amplify these regions by PCR using the primers listed in Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>. The eight regions amplified by PCR were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, either with or without prior digestion by <italic>Mfe</italic>I.</p>

Importantly, our results indicated that GUS expression was dramatically enhanced in sweet orange leaves using Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>) (i.e., initial inoculation with Xcc followed eight hours later by agroinfiltration with recombinant <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> cells containing a GUS gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>)). In contrast, there was very low GUS activity in sweet orange leaves when agroinfiltration was performed alone, or when leaves were pretreated with tap water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>). Therefore, Xcc pre-treatment is very important for enhanced transient protein expression in citrus leaves.</p>
<p>One possible mechanism to explain the fact that Xcc pre-treatment could significantly increase the transient expression of GUS in agroinfiltrated sweet orange leaves is that in Xcc-inoculated citrus leaves, the PthA4 effector is known to be translocated from Xcc into plant cell nuclei, where it activates downstream target genes. This leads to excessive cell division (hyperplasia) and cell enlargement (hypertrophy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Swarup1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Brunings1">[37]</xref>. Interestingly, citrus epicotyl segments are being widely used as explants for <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated citrus transformation, owing to the higher proportion of actively dividing cells, which are presumed to be more susceptible to T-DNA, in epicotyl tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Febres1">[34]</xref>. It seems possible that in the case of Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration, Xcc is eliciting excessive cell division, which might mimic the fast dividing epicotyl segment. Such rapidly dividing cells may also be more susceptible to <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> transformation, thereby resulting in the enhanced GUS expression observed in treated sweet orange leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

<title>Targeted sweet orange genome modification mediated by Cas9/sgRNA via Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration</title>
<p>To test the potential of the Cas9/sgRNA system to induce genetic modification in citrus, Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration was employed to deliver the Cas9 endonuclease and an sgRNA. We first constructed the binary vector p1380-Cas9:sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>, Fig. S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>), which contains both Cas9 and an sgRNA targeting the <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene. <italic>CsPDS</italic> encodes a phytoene desaturase with homologs in rice, Arabidopsis and <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, which have been successfully genetically modified using Cas9/sgRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Nekrasov1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Shan1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Li2">[38]</xref>. The 35S promoter of CaMV was used to drive the expression of Cas9 and the sgRNA targeting <italic>CsPDS</italic>. Cas9 was fused with a nuclear localization signal at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Cong1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>We expressed Cas9 and the <italic>CsPDS</italic>-targeting sgRNA in sweet orange leaf tissue using Xcc- facilitated agroinfiltration. Four days after agroinfiltration, sweet orange genomic DNA was extracted from the treated leaf areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>) and digested using the <italic>Mfe</italic>I restriction enzyme. The target sequence within the <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene contains an <italic>Mfe</italic>I restriction site, which will be mutated if Cas9/sgRNA works as predicted. Thus, selective amplification of mutagenized <italic>CsPDS</italic> genes was used to verify targeted genome engineering in sweet orange. As expected, the <italic>CsPDS</italic> PCR product (480 bp) was observed in control leaves not treated with <italic>Mfe</italic>I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>, lane 4). However, after <italic>Mfe</italic>I digestion, the 480-bp band was only detected in the <italic>Mfe</italic>I-cleaved genomic DNA of sweet orange leaves co-expressing Cas9 and the <italic>CsPDS</italic>-targeting sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>, lane 1) and not in sweet orange leaves expressing Cas9 alone or control leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>, lane 2 and lane 3). Two additional replicates showed similar results (Fig. S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). This result indicated that Cas9/sgRNA successfully induced mutations in the targeted <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene.</p>
<p>The PCR products were purified from lane1 (co-expression of Cas9 and <italic>CsPDS</italic>-targeting sgRNA) and cloned for sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>, Fig. S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). A total of twenty-eight colonies were selected for sequencing. The sequencing results showed twenty-four clones with indels in the targeted sequence, which abolished the <italic>Mfe</italic>I restriction site within the target region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>, Fig. S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). Further detailed analysis revealed that the indels could be grouped into eleven different types, including deletions (from 1 bp to 12 bp) and nucleotide substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>, Fig. S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). Although the <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene was clearly targeted by Cas9/sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>, Fig. S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>), there were no visible albino spots on the treated sweet orange leaves. This result is consistent with results from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, whose leaves also did not show visible albino spots after Cas9/sgRNA-mediated <italic>PDS</italic> targeting via agroinfiltration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Li2">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>To calculate the efficiency of <italic>CsPDS</italic> mutation caused by Cas9/sgRNA in citrus, PCR products were amplified from the genomic DNA of Cas9/sgRNA-treated and control leaf tissues, digested with <italic>Mfe</italic>I, and subjected to gel electrophoresis. Based on the ratio of the intensities of uncut DNA bands to the total intensity of both cut and uncut bands from three independent experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Shan1">[28]</xref>, the mutation rate was estimated to be 3.2%, 3.4% and 3.9%(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>, Fig. S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). In a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Li2">[38]</xref>, the mutation rate caused by Cas9/sgRNA was 5.6% in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts and 37.7% in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> protoplasts, whereas the mutation frequency was 2.7% in agroinfiltrated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves and 4.8% in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. Thus, the mutation rate in sweet orange leaves is comparable to that induced by Cas9/sgRNA after leaf agroinfiltration in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the 35S promoter of CaMV was employed to drive sgRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>, Fig. S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). It has been previously reported that the 35S promoter of CaMV could be utilized to transcribe the sequence of interest with no extraneous sequence at the 5′ end if the sequence was inserted at the transcription start site of the 35S promoter of CaMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Ding1">[39]</xref>. Using the same scheme, the sgRNA was inserted at the transcription start site of the CaMV 35S promoter (Fig. S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). In comparison to the plant U6 promoter, which constrains the first nucleotide at the transcription start site to be ‘G’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Shan1">[28]</xref>, the 35S promoter of CaMV seems to allow more flexibility in the sgRNA design, owing to a lack of constraint with regard to the first nucleotide. This was confirmed by the results.</p>
<p>We also analyzed potential off-target mutagenesis caused by Cas9/sgRNA. We identified a total of 46 potential off-target sequences by searching the <italic>C. sinensis</italic> genome database using the 20-bp target sequence of the <italic>CsPDS</italic> gene in BLASTN (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). Those off-target sequences contain 13 to 17 nucleotides identical to the <italic>CsPDS</italic>-targeting sequence (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). Fourteen regions out of the 46 identified sequences contained <italic>Mfe</italic>I sites and did not have additional <italic>Mfe</italic>I sites in close proximity to the off-target sequences. Thus, we selected those 14 sequences for <italic>Mfe</italic>I-suppressed PCR analysis. Only 8 sequences were amplified successfully using PCR (Fig. S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). None of the 8 amplicons showed evidence of Cas9/sgRNA-induced <italic>Mfe</italic>I restriction site loss similar to that observed with the <italic>CsPDS</italic> target sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093806-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig. S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093806.s001">File S1</xref>). Thus, off-target mutagenesis was not detected for <italic>CsPDS</italic> in our study, even though we could not rule out potential off-target mutagenesis in other sequences. This is most likely a case-by-case situation that depends on whether high-identity off-target sequences are present in non-targeted genes and whether we could select unique target sequences during our bioinformatic analysis, considering the recent findings of off-target mutagenesis induced by Cas9/sgRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Fu1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data complements recent studies in which the Cas9/sgRNA system was successfully developed to modify the genomes of plants such as Arabidopsis, tobacco, rice, wheat, and sorghum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0093806-Belhai1">[41]</xref>. For the first time, the sweet orange genome has proven to be readily targeted via the Cas9/sgRNA system, with the aid of Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration. It must be kept in mind that this study did not produce stable Cas9/sgRNA-transformed sweet orange. Thus, it is worth confirming that Cas9/sgRNA can also be employed to modify the sweet orange genome in transgenic plants. Given that Cas9/sgRNA works in transgenic citrus, Cas9/sgRNA-mediated citrus genome editing holds significant promise for studies of citrus gene function and for targeted genetic modification. In conclusion, Cas9/sgRNA appears to be a potentially valuable tool for creating new citrus cultivars with beneficial traits for both growers and consumers.</p>
