          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Identifying persistence and extinction thresholds in species-habitat relationships is a major focal point of ecological research and conservation. However, one major concern regarding the incorporation of threshold analyses in conservation is the lack of knowledge on the generality and transferability of results across species and regions. We present a multi-region, multi-species approach of modeling threshold responses, which we use to investigate whether threshold effects are similar across species and regions.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We modeled local persistence and extinction dynamics of 25 forest-associated breeding birds based on detection/non-detection data, which were derived from repeated breeding bird atlases for the state of Vermont. We did not find threshold responses to be particularly well-supported, with 9 species supporting extinction thresholds and 5 supporting persistence thresholds. This contrasts with a previous study based on breeding bird atlas data from adjacent New York State, which showed that most species support persistence and extinction threshold models (15 and 22 of 25 study species respectively). In addition, species that supported a threshold model in both states had associated average threshold estimates of 61.41% (SE = 6.11, persistence) and 66.45% (SE = 9.15, extinction) in New York, compared to 51.08% (SE = 10.60, persistence) and 73.67% (SE = 5.70, extinction) in Vermont. Across species, thresholds were found at 19.45–87.96% forest cover for persistence and 50.82–91.02% for extinction dynamics.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Through an approach that allows for broad-scale comparisons of threshold responses, we show that species vary in their threshold responses with regard to habitat amount, and that differences between even nearby regions can be pronounced. We present both ecological and methodological factors that may contribute to the different model results, but propose that regardless of the reasons behind these differences, our results merit a warning that threshold values cannot simply be transferred across regions or interpreted as clear-cut targets for ecosystem management and conservation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Motivated largely by indications of declining wildlife populations due to habitat loss and fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Andrn1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Simberloff1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Bender1">[3]</xref> ecologists established a vast body of work on species-habitat relationships over the last decades. From these studies, it became apparent that wildlife responses to habitat loss and fragmentation are often non-linear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Fahrig1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Flather1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Villard1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Bascompte1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-With1">[8]</xref>. An increasing number of studies support the main prediction of the extinction threshold hypothesis that there are certain critical amounts of habitat required for population persistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Lande1">[9]</xref>. These thresholds are often defined as a ‘range of habitat cover below which the probability of population persistence decreases dramatically’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Fahrig2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Hill1">[11]</xref>. Documentation of thresholds’ existence led to a rise of interest in determining critical habitat amount or minimum patch size for species or population persistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Andrn1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-McGarigal1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Wenny1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Fahrig3">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Fahrig4">[15]</xref>. More recently, threshold modeling extended to incorporate landscape-scale thresholds, leading to reasonable evidence for thresholds in relationships between species occurrence and habitat cover at landscape extents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Radford1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Radford2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>. In addition, first attempts in determining habitat thresholds in persistence dynamics over time, rather than mere occurrence at a single point in time, have been fruitful and comprise a useful contribution to landscape ecology and conservation alike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although determination of persistence and extinction thresholds are now considered major focal points of research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Lindenmayer1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Digiovinazzo1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Kato1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Rompre1">[23]</xref>, uncertainty and debate on numerous issues continue to persist. These issues include the mechanisms that are driving threshold responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Swift1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Shanahan1">[25]</xref>, confounding factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Ewers1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Smith1">[27]</xref> and the value of applying threshold modeling approaches in conservation planning and management <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Groffman1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Juutinen1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Mnkknen1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Muller1">[31]</xref>. One of the main concerns regarding the incorporation of threshold analyses in conservation is the lack of generality and transferability of results across species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Blanchet1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-dosAnjos1">[34]</xref> and regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Rhodes1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Spatial and interspecific variation in critical thresholds has been widely recognized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts3">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Donovan1">[37]</xref>, but few studies have directly aimed at quantifying the mechanisms driving variation (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Schooley1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Tischendorf1">[39]</xref>). In order to derive conservation targets and generalizations regarding species-habitat relationships, we will need to study spatial and interspecific variation more intensely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Rhodes1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Ockinger1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Davies1">[41]</xref> and conduct studies across more species and larger geographic areas than previously pursued. In order to do so, we might be required to step away from time and budget-limited smaller scale field studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zitske1">[42]</xref> and instead focus on existing data sources for broad-scale analyses. Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref> provide an example of a methodology through which we can assess threshold responses of breeding birds on a broad (state-wide) scale. For their study they make use of breeding bird atlas data. These data provide a unique opportunity to model species distributions and species-habitat relationships, because of the broad scale and number of species for which analyses can be made <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Venier1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Trzcinski1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Brotons1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Smith2">[46]</xref>. In addition, many regions (states, countries) have repeated breeding bird atlas projects, usually spaced 20–25 years apart, thus allowing us to compare between regions and to address spatial variation in long-term persistence rather than occurrence at a single point in time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we present a first multi-region comparison in a larger study that quantifies variation in thresholds found in long-term species-habitat relationships at a landscape scale. We conducted an analysis of threshold responses across a large set of breeding forest birds at the scale of an entire state (Vermont) in a similar fashion to the aforementioned study by Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>. Subsequently, we compared their results to ours in what is to our knowledge the first attempt of a regional comparison of threshold responses. Here, we highlight the potential that the use of state-wide breeding bird atlases has for threshold analyses and how our approach may answer existing questions regarding the generality and transferability of models and results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Rhodes1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Boyle1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Ficetola1">[48]</xref>. In addition, we propose that our approach holds potential for further investigation of traits that may be correlated with species-specific area-sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Blanchet1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Ockinger1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Davies1">[41]</xref> and mechanisms that drive geographic variation in thresholds responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>. In this paper, we do not go into depth on the reasons behind regional variation in threshold responses, but do highlight potential ecological explanations as well as methodological biases that may lead to difference in model outcomes. Finally, we investigate how scale influences threshold responses by comparing models that include habitat cover at different scales. Due to the grid-based design of our data set (i.e. atlas blocks) these kinds of comparisons across scales are straightforward, thus affording a unique opportunity to address the influence of scale on species-habitat relationships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Smith2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Holland1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Thornton1">[50]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Bird distribution atlases present a unique opportunity to study occurrence dynamics on a broad scale and over a relatively long term <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>. We based our analyses on a repeated atlas project, The Atlas of Breeding Birds of Vermont, for which 1976–1981 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Laughlin1">[51]</xref> and 2003–2007 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Renfrew1">[52]</xref> data were available. We thereafter compared our results with a previous analysis by Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref> that is based on data from the 1980–1985 and the 2000–2005 New York State Breeding Bird Atlases. Surveys for these atlases were conducted following a largely similar protocol, allowing analyses without large sampling biases. We will hereby briefly summarize the sampling approach that was used for the Vermont atlases, as fully described in Renfrew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Renfrew1">[52]</xref>, whereas further details on the New York State Atlases can be found in McGowan and Corwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-McGowan1">[53]</xref> and Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Both Vermont Breeding Bird Atlas Projects were based on systematic sampling of predetermined blocks by both volunteer and expert fieldworkers. These fieldworkers were expected to determine both species occurrence and breeding bird status in each of the surveyed blocks. Blocks measured approximately 25 km<sup>2</sup>, and were based on a grid derived from U.S. Geological Survey maps. Due to limited manpower, 179 randomly selected priority blocks were assigned for which adequate coverage was to be achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The overall aim for the Vermont Breeding Bird Atlas Projects was to determine breeding bird occurrence at three different levels of confidence (‘possible breeding’, ‘probable breeding’, and ‘confirmed breeding’) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Laughlin1">[51]</xref>.</p>

      <p>For our purpose, and to keep consistency with the protocol followed by Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>, we considered a bird present when it was listed in an atlas under any of the aforementioned levels of confidence. In order to investigate how this decision with regards to the inclusion of data influences our results we also provide a sensitivity analysis in which we only consider a bird present in the case of ‘confirmed breeding’.</p>
      <p>The Vermont Breeding Bird Atlas Project considered blocks to be satisfactorily surveyed when 75 or more species were observed, while at least 35 had to be confirmed as breeders. This corresponded to observations of roughly 75% of the total number of species likely to occur in an average atlas block, and nesting confirmation for half of these species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Laughlin1">[51]</xref>. Each block was surveyed by volunteers during the breeding season until, over the course of a 1–5 year period, the aforementioned predetermined coverage standard was reached <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Laughlin1">[51]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The second atlas followed a similar approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Renfrew1">[52]</xref> to the protocol outlined in the first atlas. In our analyses, we excluded data from four atlas blocks because they were not fully located within Vermont, and thus did not overlap exactly with our Vermont land cover data, or because the majority of the block consisted of water.</p>
      <p>We assessed the change in occurrence from the first to the second atlas as persistence or extinction for each focal species. As in Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref> we classified birds as persistent in an atlas block when found in both the first and second atlas, and extinct as detected in the first but not the second atlas. Focal species were 25 forest generalists or obligates, and were the same as those studied by Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>. This selection did not include rare species in order to avoid issues of low sample size and detection biases.</p>
      <p>We determined the percentage of forest cover in each atlas block using 1992 National Land Cover Data (NLCD) (for an accuracy analysis see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Stehman1">[54]</xref>). Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref> used this same data set for their analysis in New York. The date of the land cover data is midway between the two atlas projects, and we assumed that loss or gain of forest in Vermont between 1978 (onset, first atlas) and 2007 (last sampling year, second atlas) was small and thus not biasing. We based this assumption on the small change in forest cover in the Northeastern Highlands Ecoregion, which includes Vermont, between 1973 and 2000 (from 85.2% to 81.4% of the total landcover) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Drummond1">[55]</xref>. The HISTO command in the software program IDRISI Taiga <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Eastman1">[56]</xref> provided a numeric frequency histogram from which the percentage of forest cover for each atlas block could be calculated. We combined the percentages of the land cover types “mixed”, “deciduous” and “coniferous” forest to account for the total forest cover in each block.</p>
      <p>We built threshold (segmented logistic regression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Muggeo1">[57]</xref>) and non-threshold (logistic regression) models to describe the relationship between forest cover and occupancy dynamics using R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Muggeo1">[57]</xref>. We used the fitted values of locally weighted nonparametric models (loess plots) with a smoothing parameter of 0.75 to visualize empirical relationships between forest cover (%) and occurrence and to identify initial values for segmented regression models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We explored all possible initial values between 0 and 100% forest cover in 5% steps (e.g. 35%, 40%) when model algorithms failed to converge using our initial starting point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>. We conducted our statistical analyses in R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-R1">[58]</xref>, using standard packages and the ‘segmented’ package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Muggeo2">[59]</xref>. In total, we fitted 50 logistic models (25 species×2 dynamics) and 50 segmented logistic regression models in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We took an information-theoretic approach on selecting the best models describing species-habitat amount relationships using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and delta AIC (Δ<sub>i</sub>). We selected a model as best model if the alternative model had Δ<sub>i</sub> &gt;2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Burnham1">[60]</xref>. Both models could be considered equivalent in their support when Δ<sub>i</sub> &lt;2 between threshold and non-threshold models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Burnham1">[60]</xref>. In this case, we selected the model with the least parameters: the non-threshold model. Subsequently, we determined the fit of the best models to the original data by calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Burnham1">[60]</xref> using the ROCR package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Sing1">[61]</xref>. In general, AUC values vary between 0 and 1, with 1 representing a perfect fit and 0.5 representing that the model fits no better than a random prediction would. Models with AUC values &gt;0.7 are usually considered acceptable, while values &gt;0.8 are considered excellent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Hosmer1">[62]</xref>.</p>

These plots were used to provide a visual check of the actual data and fitted models (in addition to the loess plots). The plots for Blackburnian Warbler are illustrative for a species with strong support for a threshold model, whereas both the data distribution and model plots of Veery are indicative of low support for a threshold model (additional figures for all species can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In the case of Veery, this might simply be due to it being persistent in the majority of atlas blocks.</p>

      <p>Sample size might have pronounced effects on the power to detect thresholds and the percentage of forest cover at which the thresholds are estimated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Jones1">[63]</xref> and could thus potentially explain (part of) differences in results the Vermont (N = 175 atlas blocks) and New York (N = 5074 atlas blocks) analyses. We investigated the effect of sample size by obtaining 5000 random subsets of 175 blocks from the entire New York data set and fitted a segmented regression and logistic regression to each of these subsets. We repeated this procedure for all 25 species and both dynamics (persistence and extinction). Based on the aforementioned selection criteria (AIC, delta AIC) we obtained information on the number of times (out of 5000 simulations) threshold models were selected as the better model and the distribution and range of the associated breakpoints (measured in percentage of forest cover).</p>
      <p>Although spatial autocorrelation is considered an important aspect of analyses such as ours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Augustin1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Lichstein1">[65]</xref>, the atlas blocks used in our analysis were sufficiently spaced apart to exclude this as a source of error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This sample design allowed us to investigate the relationship between persistence, or extinction, and habitat amount on a larger scale. We repeated earlier outlined models of species responses, using forest cover (%) in an atlas block and all the surrounding eight atlas blocks as an independent variable. We compared AIC scores and threshold estimates of these new models with our original models and determined whether forest cover in the wider landscape or merely forest cover in the atlas block was a better predictor of species persistence or extinction.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Logistic and segmented regression models converged for most species and provided us with a base for model selection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055996-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s003">Table S1</xref>).

In addition, no threshold models converged for Black-capped Chickadee (<italic>Poecile atricapilla</italic>) and Hermit Trush (<italic>Catharus guttatus</italic>) with regards to persistence, which is likely due to this species being persistent in all but few atlas blocks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

      <p>For extinction dynamics, we found that 9 out of 25 supported models included a threshold parameter (alternative non-threshold model Δ<sub>i</sub> &gt;2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s003">Table S1</xref>). Six other species showed support for a threshold model (with regard to both AIC and AUC values), but we deemed the standard errors for the breakpoint estimates too large to consider these valid models to incorporate in further analyses. For persistence dynamics, threshold models were selected to describe the habitat-relationships of 5 species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s003">Table S1</xref>). Two more species, Winter Wren (<italic>Troglodytes troglodytes</italic>) and Blue-headed Vireo (<italic>Vireo solitaries</italic>), would have supported threshold models based on mere AIC values, but visual interpretation of plotted data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s001">Figure S1</xref>) did not support the existence of any thresholds and thus we did not include these species in further analyses. We interpret our results as moderate support for threshold response at landscape scale, in contrast to Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref> who used a similar approach and the same set of focal species and found overall strong support for threshold models. They concluded that 15 species showed support for the inclusion of a threshold parameter in extinction responses in New York, and no less than 21 of 25 species supported threshold models for persistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Estimates of threshold forest amounts in extinction responses varied considerably between species, ranging from 50.82% (SE = 5.03) for the Blue-headed Vireo (<italic>Vireo solitaries</italic>) to 91.02% (SE = 5.67) for the Black-and-white Warbler (<italic>Mniotilta varia</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055996-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s003">Table S1</xref>). For persistence, threshold estimates varied from 19.45% (SE = 3.83) for the Yellow-rumped Warbler (<italic>Dendroica coronata</italic>) to 87.96% (SE = 5.83) for the Black-and-white Warbler. Discriminatory power of all selected models was high, with an average AUC of 0.73 (SE = 0.02) for non-threshold models and 0.76 (SE = 0.03) for threshold models. Although threshold models were in general less often selected in our analysis than in Zuckerberg and Porter’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>, we did find that the selected models provided a good fit with 11 out of 14 threshold models having an AUC value &gt;0.7 and 8 out of 14 models having an AUC &gt;0.75 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s003">Table S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Not only did the support for threshold responses in Vermont differ from that of New York <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>, but the estimated threshold values for species also differed between the two states (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055996-t002">Table 2</xref>). Four out of five species that showed support for persistence thresholds in both states had lower associated threshold estimates (threshold at lower proportion of forest cover) in Vermont as compared to New York. On average, the 5 species that supported a threshold model for persistence in both states had an associated threshold estimate of 61.41% (SE = 6.11) in New York and 51.08% (SE = 10.60) in Vermont (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Seven species showed threshold responses in extinction in both states, with average threshold values of 66.45% (SE = 9.15) in New York and 73.67% (SE = 5.70) in Vermont (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

          <p>Depicted are the means of estimated thresholds in forest cover below which the probability of persistence or extinction declined rapidly. We calculated the means across all estimated thresholds of breeding bird species that showed support for threshold models in both states (only 5 species for persistence and 9 for extinction). Error bars show the associated standard error. *The mean of the threshold estimates for New York State was calculated based on thresholds reported by Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Differences in the number of atlas blocks used in the Vermont and New York analyses might be one of the factors contributing to differences in threshold estimates. We obtained threshold models and associated forest cover estimates that were at times very different from the results as presented in Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref> when we randomly selected 5000 subsamples of 175 atlas blocks (the sample size for Vermont) from the entire New York data and subsequently fitted threshold and non-threshold models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s002">Figure S2</xref>). For most species, threshold models were selected as best models for less than half of the subsamples (&lt;2500). More strikingly, the threshold estimates associated with supported threshold models ranged from approximately 5 to 95% forest cover for all species. When we compare the threshold estimate as derived by Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref> with the distribution of threshold estimates from our simulation of subsets we see that our subsampling approach hardly gave different results for some species (e.g. persistence for Veery) but very different ones for others (e.g. persistence for Hermit Trush) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055996-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

          <p>We superimposed an estimate of the proportion of forest cover (the threshold) associated with the maximum kernel density of our sampling results (vertical full line) and the threshold derived by Zuckerberg and Porter (2010) (vertical dotted line). Panel A shows results for models of persistence for Hermit Trush (<italic>Catharus guttatus</italic>), Panel B persistence for Veery (<italic>Catharus fuscescens</italic>), Panel C extinction for Canada Warbler (<italic>Wilsonia canadensis</italic>) and Panel D extinction of Black-capped Chickadee (<italic>Poecile atricapilla</italic>). Results for the species shown were exemplary for situations where the estimated thresholds seemingly matched with (Veery, Black-capped Chickadee) or deviated from (Hermit Trush, Canada Warbler) the proportion of forest cover associated with maximum kernel density. Similar plots for all species can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s002">Figure S2</xref>.</p>

      <p>We included bird presence at all levels of confirmation (‘possible’, ‘probable’ and ‘confirmed’) in our analyses. However, we do note that similar analyses based on only the most conservative data (‘confirmed’) give us considerably different results. Not only did fewer species show support for threshold models for persistence (2 species) and extinction (6 species) dynamics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055996-t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g004">Figure 4</xref>), the critical threshold estimates associated with these models also differed from our original analysis. Threshold models for persistence were supported for Blue-headed Vireo (<italic>Vireo solitaries</italic>) (threshold estimate at 94.50% forest cover (SE = 2.72)) and Scarlet Tanager (82.84%, SE = 6.75). Neither of these species supported a threshold model for persistence in our original analysis (including all levels of occurrence). Three species, Magnolia Warbler (<italic>Dendroica magnolia</italic>) (79.63%, SE = 6.29), Yellow-rumped Warbler (<italic>Dendroica coronate</italic>) (98.20%, SE = 8.12) and Blackburnian Warbler (<italic>Dendroica</italic> fusca) (46.43%, SE = 15.21) supported an extinction threshold model in our conservative approach as well as our initial analysis, but with different threshold estimations. Red-breasted Nuthatch (<italic>Sitta canadensis</italic>) (60.24%, SE = 9.58), Winter Wren (<italic>Troglodytes troglodytes</italic>) (97.41%, SE = 16.07) and Veery (<italic>Catharus fucescens</italic>) (31.52%, SE = 9.30) supported threshold models for extinction only in our more conservative (confirmed breeding only) approach.</p>

      <p>In order to analyze the influence of forest amount in the surrounding landscape on both persistence and extinction dynamics, we created a new set of models that included the average forest cover of the focal atlas blocks plus all eight surrounding blocks as an independent variable. The average forest cover in blocks surrounding atlas blocks was not significantly correlated with the forest cover within atlas blocks (Spearman rank correlation; <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.08, P = 0.30). Only 5 times was a threshold model selected for one of the 50 models that included forest in the surrounding blocks as an extra parameter (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055996-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Regarding persistence, Common Raven (<italic>Corvus corax</italic>, 80.36%, SE = 1.89), and Black-throated Green Warbler (<italic>Dendroica virens</italic>, 83.91%, SE = 9.23<sup>−12</sup>) showed support for a threshold model that included habitat amount at this broad spatial extent. Neither species supported a threshold model for persistence in the original analysis that was based on forest cover in the atlas block alone. Brown Creeper (<italic>Certhia americana</italic>, 59.51%, SE = 2.94), Black-throated Green Warble, 66.31%, SE = 17.71) and Blackburnian Warbler (<italic>Dendroica fusca</italic>, 65.56%, SE = 0.84) showed support for a threshold model in extinction. Two of these species, Black-throated Green Warbler and Blackburnian Warbler, also supported a threshold response for extinction in the original analysis but at slightly different estimates (Black-throated Green Warbler 73.82%, SE = 21.49; Blackburnian Warbler 69.91% (SE = 5.26), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s003">Table S1</xref>).</p>

      <p>Regional and interspecific variation in species responses to habitat loss and fragmentation has previously been recognized and put forward as a warning against generalizing results of threshold studies across species and regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Rhodes1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts3">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Boyle1">[47]</xref>. We adopted a simple yet efficient approach to threshold estimation as proposed by Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref> and extended it to a region (Vermont) adjacent to their original study area (New York). Even though these two regions are largely similar in landscape characteristics such as forest cover and composition, faunal species composition and climate and latitudinal aspects, we found striking differences in the results of our threshold modeling approach. We found less support for the inclusion of a threshold parameter in models of both persistence and extinction responses in Vermont compared to New York. In addition, there were differences between the two regions in the estimate of thresholds in forest cover below which the probability of persistence dramatically declined or extinction increased for species that did support a threshold model in both states.</p>
      <p>Although the design of the current study did not allow us to assess the cause of regional differences in threshold responses directly, we argue that they might be related to the higher forest cover in Vermont (average atlas blocks 73.89%, SE = 0.02) compared to New York (63.10%, SE = 0.35) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Arguably, high forest cover in the broader surrounding landscape might indicate that forest-associated bird species are able to maintain breeding populations in atlas blocks with low forest cover, because resources (e.g. food resources) can be found in the surrounding atlas blocks with a higher forest cover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Radford2">[17]</xref>. In general, atlas blocks with relatively high forest cover are abundant throughout the state of Vermont, whereas a considerable number of atlas blocks with low percentages of forest cover exist in New York (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

          <p>The frequency of atlas blocks with a particular proportion of forest cover in each of the states. The histograms illustrate that many atlas blocks in both states have high (e.g. more than 0.6, or 60%) levels of forest cover, but also indicate that forest cover across the Vermont atlas blocks is more or less homogeneous (high cover) while atlas blocks in New York have a more variable range of forest cover (i.e. there are many blocks with low forest cover as well). The forest cover of the priority atlas blocks in Vermont seems a representative sample of the forest cover of all atlas blocks in Vermont.</p>

      <p>Another possible explanation for the ability of bird species to apparently persist at lower amounts of forest cover in Vermont as compared to New York, might be related to the ability for bird species to disperse to and from patches within the atlas blocks with lower forest cover. For example, birds might be more likely to be detected as breeding individuals in occasional atlas blocks with low forest cover, due to the existence of source populations in high forest cover atlas blocks in the vicinity. In addition, patches of forest habitat within atlas blocks with low forest cover might be less isolated in Vermont than in New York because surrounding atlas blocks offer patches within dispersal distance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Radford2">[17]</xref>. Finally, we might reason that forest composition and structure (forest quality) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Radford1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Rhodes1">[35]</xref>, the quality of the matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Kennedy1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Ricketts1">[67]</xref> and the level of fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Andrn2">[68]</xref> differ between the two study regions and contribute to differences in threshold responses in New York and Vermont. Although fragmentation might play a role in species-habitat relationships it is becoming widely accepted that habitat amount per se is a better predictor of species distributions and responses than fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Fahrig2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Smith1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Smith2">[46]</xref>. Despite this notion, we do argue that incorporating a measure of fragmentation should be part of follow-up studies in order to address whether differences in levels of fragmentation can explain part of the regional differences that appear in threshold estimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Andrn2">[68]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We may have found less support for threshold models in Vermont because the forest cover in most of the surrounding landscape falls above species habitat thresholds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>. The detection of landscape-scale species-habitat relationships is likely to be lower in regions with high proportions of potential habitat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Andrn2">[68]</xref>. Pardini et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Pardini1">[69]</xref> support this by showing that clear habitat-abundance and habitat-richness effects seem to be lacking in regions with high forest cover. Indeed, most of our study area might have forest cover above the critical values at which thresholds are usually found (10–30%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Fahrig1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Radford2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Lindenmayer1">[20]</xref>), obviating the need for a larger study including more study regions.</p>
      <p>Species that were considered to follow threshold responses differed in the estimates of threshold values, with persistence thresholds ranging 19.45–87.96% and thresholds in extinction ranging from 50.82% to 91.02% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s003">Table S1</xref>). This variation in species-habitat relationships has been widely recognized (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Radford2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Swift1">[24]</xref>) and been attributed to variation in area-sensitivity as a function of life-history traits such as dispersal capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Davies1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Lees1">[70]</xref>, reproductive capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Vance1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Andrn3">[72]</xref> and habitat specialization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Pardini1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Andrn3">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Devictor1">[73]</xref>. Interestingly, in contrast to many previous studies that indicate which species were more area-sensitive than others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts3">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Pardini1">[69]</xref>, we did not find consistency in area-sensitivity across regions. For example, when we ranked species according to their threshold estimates for persistence, we found (e.g.) Yellow-rumped Warbler on the high end of the ranking with a threshold value of 73.61% in New York but on the lower end in Vermont (19.45%). The reverse was true for Black-and-white Warbler, having a threshold estimate around 39.79% forest cover in New York but 87.96% in Vermont.</p>
      <p>There are many plausible explanations for the results we found and the lack of consistency in threshold values across regions. As mentioned earlier, differences in levels of fragmentation, habitat amount in the wider landscape, quality of the forest and the surrounding matrix are all factors that might be correlated with variation in threshold response. Yet, some of the variation could simply come from problems in defining ‘habitat’ properly. We used a coarse variable (‘forest’) in order to facilitate comparisons with earlier work by Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref>, even though the breeding distribution of many of our focal birds might be better predicted by more specific variables such as ‘evergreen’, ’mixed’ or ‘deciduous’ forest or even subcomponents thereof (particular tree species, prevalence of structural components such as standing dead wood) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts4">[74]</xref>. Indeed, variation in these more specific characteristics might be large between and within regions, and might thus result in different outcomes in threshold model studies.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, thresholds in extinction and persistence did not always seem to occur at the same percentage of forest cover. This difference was most notable in Yellow-rumped Warbler with a threshold in persistence at 19.45% (SE = 3.83) and 78.67% (SE = 3.76) for extinction. Due to an overall low number of species that supported threshold models, we are not able to explore this difference further in our current study, but we argue that differences in thresholds of extinction and persistence might be related to time-lags in regime shifts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Pardini1">[69]</xref>. Species might seem to persist at percentages of forest cover that are lower than those where peaks in extinction probability occur because of a time-lag in the extinction process. We aim to address this interesting observation further in follow-up studies, in line with arguments that any study that addresses long-term population dynamics should address the phenomenon of time-lags <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Swift1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One important factor in the comparison of thresholds in Vermont and those found in New York is the effect of sample size on our model outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Jones1">[63]</xref>. The sample size (number of atlas blocks) in Vermont is low (175) compared to New York (5074). We addressed this issue of low sample size by simulating random subsets of 175 atlas blocks from the New York data set and fitting models to these subsets. Interestingly, we found support for a threshold model for less than half of all random subsets and found a wide range of threshold estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055996.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The latter might be due to the wide range of forest cover found in the atlas blocks in New York (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g006">Figure 6</xref>), with some of the random subsets containing mainly blocks with low forest cover and others mainly blocks with high forest cover. This is arguably less of a problem in Vermont, where forest cover throughout the atlas blocks seems uniformly high and where the ‘subsample’ of 175 priority atlas blocks seems a good representation of the forest cover in all atlas blocks in Vermont (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055996-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, it remains an issue that needs to be addressed. We are aware, and have shown here, that sample size may be one potential reason for the difference in outcome in support for thresholds and in associated forest cover estimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Jones1">[63]</xref>. Therefore, this is an additional factor that we have to take into account when we try to extrapolate from one study or species to the next or when we try to infer conservation and management targets based on studies of threshold responses.</p>
      <p>Bird atlas data constitutes different levels of confidence in occurrence (possible, probable, confirmed), and our model results depend on which data we include in our analyses. Considering only the most conservative level of occurrence confirmation (confirmed breeding) in our analysis may arguably improve the accuracy of estimating persistence or extinction thresholds. Basing our analysis on a conservative subset of our data (confirmed only) led to higher threshold estimates in those species that supported a threshold model, indicating that the percentage of forest required for persistence might actually be higher than previously noted here and in other studies. However, we did not extend this analysis here for three reasons. First, we wished to follow a protocol similar to the analysis by Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref> in order to draw consistent and valid comparisons. Second, we found threshold models to be supported in our ‘conservative scenario’ for only 8 species-dynamic combinations (2 persistence, 6 extinction). Finally, detectability of confirmed breeding occurrences might be quite variable and might limit analyses to only those common species that are easily confirmed as breeders. Nevertheless, we suggest that any study that utilizes breeding bird atlas data should incorporate a consideration of the different results that data inclusion decisions may have. Most importantly however, we suggest that these more conservative estimates of forest requirements once more indicate that we might not be able to directly link the outcome of a threshold estimation model to the narrow conservation goals that are sometimes proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Rompre1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Smith2">[46]</xref> noted that forest bird occurrence varies directly with habitat amount in the surrounding landscape regardless of landscape size. We did not test for such a relationship, but did observe a lack of evidence for threshold responses when we included habitat in a larger (∼225 km<sup>2</sup>) focal region in our models. The effects of habitat availability at this larger landscape extent might be diminished by a heterogeneous habitat distribution, given that forest cover in atlas blocks was not significantly correlated with forest cover in the surrounding blocks. Similar effects of declining area-sensitivity with increasing landscape scales have been recorded by Desrochers et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Desrochers1">[75]</xref>.</p>
      <p>What we have shown is a) an approach for comparison that can easily be repeated on an unprecedented broad scale and will eventually allow comparison across larger numbers of study areas and species than has been attempted previously, and b) a clear indication that threshold effects and/or amounts are not necessarily supported for the same species in even adjacent areas. If further studies are as promising, our methodology will provide insight into interspecific and regional variation of landscape level, long-term threshold dynamics. Ecosystem managers and conservationists would be able to derive generalities on threshold estimate predictions and gain insight into which characteristics are influencing the minimum habitat requirements for their specific region or focal species of interest. Novelties of our approach include: 1) the ability to address long-term thresholds in persistence and extinction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref> rather than occurrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts3">[36]</xref>; and 2) analyzing threshold responses with the use of extensive broad-scale sources of data that are already widely available. This extension of an earlier approach by Zuckerberg and Porter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Zuckerberg1">[19]</xref> allows for comparisons of threshold models at scales that were previously unobtainable due to costs of field work and time consumption. In addition, we also show that 3) species vary in their threshold responses with regard to habitat amount, and that differences between regions are pronounced. This warrants the advice put forward by many ecologists that threshold values cannot simply be transferred across regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Rhodes1">[35]</xref> or interpreted as clear-cut targets for ecosystem management and conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Betts4">[74]</xref>. We also warn that 4) sample size (in our study number of atlas blocks) might have large effects on the outcome of threshold studies (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Jones1">[63]</xref>) and that this might be one factor driving differences between threshold studies. Finally, our results indicate that 5) thresholds in long-term persistence and extinction dynamics can be found across a wide range of habitat cover or area. Generalizations such as “For most species with large home ranges (such as birds), the threshold may generally be located between 30% and 40% of the habitat… in order to protect the most sensitive species and to deal with uncertainty associated with thresholds, to maintain at least 40% of residual habitats” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055996-Rompre1">[23]</xref> may oversimplify threshold analyses and may be counter-productive to conservation efforts.</p>
      <p>We argue that while searching for thresholds in species-habitat relationships remains a valid goal for ecologists and conservationists, the differences in threshold estimates and response between species and regions are of greatest interest. Analyses that address these differences may contribute to conservation by determining which species are most at risk of being affected by habitat loss. Future research should be directed towards broad-scale comparisons in order to gain insights into consistency of species-habitat relationships, driving factors of both interspecific and regional variation, and general mechanisms underlying species-specific area-sensitivity.</p>
