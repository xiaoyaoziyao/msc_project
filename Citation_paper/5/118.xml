<abstract>
<p>In order to understand the degradation potential of plastics in the marine environment, microorganisms that preferentially colonize and interact with plastic surfaces, as opposed to generalists potentially colonising everything, need to be identified. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that i.) plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microorganisms are closely attached to the polymeric surface and ii.) that specificity of plastics biofilms are rather related to members of the rare biosphere. To answer these hypotheses, a three phased experiment to stepwise uncover closely attached microbes was conducted. In Phase 1, nine chemically distinct plastic films and glass were incubated <italic>in situ</italic> for 21 months in a seawater flow through system. In Phase 2, a high-pressure water jet treatment technique was used to remove the upper biofilm layers to further, in Phase 3, enrich a plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” community. To proof whether microbes colonizing different plastics are distinct from each other and from other inert hard substrates, the bacterial communities of these different substrates were analysed using 16S rRNA gene tag sequencing. Our findings indicate that tightly attached microorganisms account to the rare biosphere and suggest the presence of plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microorganisms/assemblages which could benefit from the given plastic properties or at least grow under limited carbon resources.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the middle of last century the increase of global plastics production is accompanied by an accumulation of plastic litter in the marine environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref002">2</xref>]. Persistent plastic items are rarely degraded but become fragmented over time and are dispersed by currents and wind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref004">4</xref>]. Consequently, marine plastic litter can be found in marine waters all over the globe.</p>
<p>In contrast to interactions of larger organisms with plastics, which are mainly characterised by the consequences of ingestion or entanglement, the interaction of microorganisms and plastics are of completely different nature. Plastics function as habitats and are rapidly colonized by marine microorganisms which form dense biofilms on the plastic surface, the so called “Plastisphere” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref005">5</xref>]. Therefore, plastic litter is a substrate which can serve as a vector for the widespread distribution of a variety of organisms, including harmful algae species, barnacles, bryozoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref007">7</xref>] as well as potentially pathogenic <italic>Vibrio</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref008">8</xref>]. The persistence of plastics in marine environments is a matter for debate, and estimates range from hundreds to thousands of years depending on the chemico-physical properties of the plastic type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref004">4</xref>]. “Biofouling refers to the undesirable accumulation of a biotic deposit on a surface” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref009">9</xref>] and can play a major role in controlling plastic buoyancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref010">10</xref>]. Additionally, biofouling also lead to deterioration resulting in fragmentation of larger plastic items and may also result in degradation of the polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on culture-independent approaches, the current state of knowledge regarding the “Plastisphere” is as follows; microbial communities on marine plastic debris differ consistently from the surrounding seawater communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref015">15</xref>], the plastics community composition is driven by spatial and seasonal effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref013">13</xref>], the community composition varies with the substrate type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>], and plastics biofilm composition is dependent on the habitational conditions, e.g. harbour vs. offshore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref017">17</xref>]. Overall, the composition of marine plastics biofilms is probably resulting from a unique interaction of various factors such as the substrate type, the surrounding environment, the geographical location and the seasonal variation of environmental parameters. However, it is well established that several prokaryotic families build the general plastic biofilm community. These include <italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Erythrobacteraceae</italic>, <italic>Hyphomonadaceae</italic> and <italic>Rhodobacteraceae</italic> found in the North Sea, the coastal Baltic Sea, multiple locations in the North Atlantic, and freshwater systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent studies investigated the specificities of plastics communities comparing different types of plastics with other substrates such as wood or glass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref019">19</xref>]. Comparing the PET and glass associated microbiome, Oberbeckmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref014">14</xref>] could not detect significant differences in community composition after 5 to 6 weeks of incubation. In contrast, Kirstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>] found significant differences between the community composition associated to diverse plastics and glass investigating mature biofilms (15 month). However, the differences in community composition were generally low, indicating that the shared core of the various biofilms is rather substrate unspecific. Furthermore, the strongest contribution to the total dissimilarity between the diverse substrates was often given by less abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs). All this points towards the importance of rather rare species in plastic associated marine biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>]. Considering that the competition pressure in mature biofilms can be particularly high (e.g. for space or nutrients), uncovering those rare species is a necessary first step to identify microbes that are closely associated/interact with the polymeric surface, which will select for species able to survive better when the competition pressure decreases.</p>
<p>To date, researchers of the “Plastisphere” have discussed the potential of plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” organisms/assemblages to be involved in biodegradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref021">21</xref>]. Here, a plastic “specific” organism/assemblage is discriminating a respective plastic type from another substrate type. Several microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, were isolated from various environments and were reported to have a degradative effect on specific plastic types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref023">23</xref>]. Regarding assemblages, recently Syranidou and colleagues developed tailored micro-consortia suggesting that those are capable of degrading weathered polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) fragments, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Microbes generally have the potential to degrade complex organic compounds in various environments. This is raising the question, why significant differences between diverse plastics and other inert substrates could not be detected comparing young marine biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref019">19</xref>] or were found to be generally low between mature marine glass and diverse plastic biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>]. Kirstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>] has evidence for a general marine biofilm core community of abundant bacterial taxa, which serve as shared core among diverse substrates, indicating that plastic “specific” microorganism might be represented by rather rare species. Assuming that these specificities of plastic biofilms are referring to microbes of the rather rare biosphere and that plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microorganisms are closely attached to the polymeric surface; a three phase stepwise uncovering experiment was conducted. In Phase 1, nine distinct plastic films and glass as control were incubated in situ for 21 months in a natural seawater flow-through system. In Phase 2, a high-pressure water jet treatment technique was applied to remove the upper loosely attached biofilm layers, to unveil potential plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microorganisms. Thereafter, in Phase 3, those treated films were used as a source for colonisation of the same type of sterile plastic strips. Illumina sequencing of the hypervariable V3/V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was applied to analyse and compare the prokaryotic communities attached to the various substrates. In addition attached cells were visualized via Scanning Electron microscopy.</p>

<title>Biofilm formation</title>
<p>A three phased experiment to stepwise uncover closely attached rare microbes was conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215859.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In Phase 1, biofilm formation was performed on 9 distinct plastic substrates such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE) (ORBITA-FILM GmbH), low-density polyethylene (LDPE) (ORBITA-FILM GmbH), polypropylene (PP) (ORBITA-FILM GmbH), polystyrene (PS) (Ergo.fol norflex GmbH), polyethylene- terephthalate (PET) (Mitsubishi Polyester Film), polylactic acid (PLA) (Folienwerk Wolfen GmbH), styrene-acrylonitryle (SAN) (Ergo.fol norflex GmbH), polyurethane prepolymer (PESTUR) (Bayer), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (Leitz) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215859.s005">S1 Table</xref>). The term substrate refers here, to a surface on which an organism grows or is attached and which might serve as a carbon source. These substrates, highly abundant in the marine environment and on glass slides as a neutral control for 21 month in the dark (max. light intensity 0.1033 μmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s) in a natural seawater flow-through system located at the “Biologische Anstalt Helgoland” approximately 60 km off the German coastline. North Seawater was directly pumped through the system (flow rate of approx. 5800 l/day).</p>

<title>Removal of the “upper” biofilm layers by high pressure treatment</title>
<p>In order to remove the upper biofilm layers in Phase 2 of our stepwise experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215859.g001">Fig 1</xref>), a high-pressure treatment technique was developed to remove the loosely attached biofilm layers. This was performed with a mini high-pressure cleaning device (Lico-Tec; Arnstorf, Germany) established to shot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215859.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) sterile seawater (0.2 μm filtered and autoclaved) vertically onto the biofilm associated to the different substrates. Seawater was shot with a working distance of 1 cm for 2 minutes at 4 bar. Next, to evaluate and compare how many cells were still attached on each substrate after the high-pressure treatment, cell counting of all samples was performed. Therein, staining with propidium iodide (PI) and SYBR Green allowed distinguishing between membrane intact and membrane damaged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215859.g002">Fig 2G and 2H</xref>). The treatment was repeated 9 times on each plastic foil with every sample in triplicates. Fluorescence microscopy was investigated with the optical microscope Axioplan2, imaging (Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). Detection of the total cell number stained with fluorescent dye SYBR Green was performed with the filter set 09 (Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). To evaluate the proportion of damaged cells, the filter set 20 has been applied (Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). Detailed information on the development of the high-pressure treatment technique, staining, and visualization can be found in the supplement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215859.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215859.s006">S2 Table</xref>).

<title>Selective enrichment on distinct plastics</title>
<p>In order to enrich the uncovered potential plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microorganisms a re-colonization experiment was designed. Therefore a strip of ~ 1 cm<sup>2</sup> with associated 21 month old biofilm of each of the substrates was treated for 2 minutes at 4 bars with the high-pressure device by moving the strip slowly under the stream. These strips with the remaining closely surface attached microorganisms were transferred into sterile glass Petri dishes with 40 ml sterile filtered and autoclaved North Seawater. For each of the nine plastic types and glass, new ethanol sterilised strips of the same size were added to these Petri dishes and incubated at 18°C in the dark. All different substrate strips were sterilized in 70% ethanol and air dried before being placed in the Petri dishes. After six weeks the re-colonization source was removed (short-term). Due to manageable sample numbers only the second stage of experiments in Phase 3, the long-term incubation was carried out in replicates. Fresh sterile seawater was provided every four weeks. After 60 days one strip of each substrate was taken for visualization via SEM. After five months of incubation five replicates of each long-term incubated substrate were taken for DNA extraction followed by 16S gene tag sequencing.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Scanning electron microscopy</title>
<p>Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize the colonized plastics. Strips of each re-colonized substrate of about 0.5 cm<sup>2</sup> with the attached cells were fixed at 4°C in sterile seawater containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 50 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2). Samples were stored in the fixative at 4°C (4–10 days) until processing for scanning electron microscopy. The samples were stepwise dehydrated with ethanol bath series of 10 min each at concentrations of 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, followed by 3 baths of 10 min in 100% ethanol. Samples were immediately critical point dried (BAL-TEC CPD 030). All samples were sputter coated (BAL-TEC SCD 005) with gold-palladium before observing with a field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-7500F) with the in-lens detector (SEI-detector) at 5kV and a working distance of 8 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>].</p>

<title>DNA extraction &amp; 16S Illumina tag sequencing</title>
<p>After five month of selective enrichment, the DNA of microbial biofilms of the nine different short- and long-term incubated substrates was extracted using the PowerBiofilm DNA Isolation Kit (MOBIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, including mechanical pulping (FastPrep FP 120, ThermoSavant,Qbiogene, United States) for 40 seconds on level 4.0. DNA quantity was determined photometrically with a PicoGreen assay (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) in duplicates using a Tecan Infinite M200 NanoQuant microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland).</p>
<p>16S rRNA gene tag sequencing of the V3 / V4 fragment of the 16S rRNA was performed at LGC Genomics GmbH (Berlin, Germany). DNA fragments were amplified using amplification primers 341F (<monospace>5’-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3</monospace>’) and 785R (<monospace>5’-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3’</monospace>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref027">27</xref>]. Primers also contained the Illumina sequencing adapter sequence and a unique barcode index. Resulting amplicons were paired-end sequenced 2 x 300 bp on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Paired-end reads were merged using BBMerge 34.48 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bbmap.sourceforge.net/" xlink:type="simple">http://bbmap.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>) and processed through the SILVAngs pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref028">28</xref>]. Sequences were de-replicated at 100% identity and further clustered with 98% sequence identity to each other. Representative sequences from operational taxonomic unit clusters (OTUs) were classified up to genus level against the SILVA v128 database using BLAST as first described by Ionescu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref029">29</xref>]. Sequences having an average BLAST alignment coverage and alignment identity of less than 93% were considered as unclassified and assigned to the virtual taxonomical group “No Relative" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref028">28</xref>]. Finally, 1,307,882 (99.77%) classified sequences were obtained. For following downstream analyses, classifications on the genus-level were used to generate the final abundance matrixes. All classifications contained the sum of all sequences represented by OTUs with the equal taxonomic path. The raw sequence data is available in the European Nucleotide Archive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref030">30</xref>] under the accession number PRJEB30284, using the data brokerage service of the German Federation for Biological Data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref031">31</xref>], in compliance with the Minimal Information about any (X) Sequence (MIxS) standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref032">32</xref>].</p>

<p>Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to test for statistically significant variance among the source and re-colonized communities attached to the different substrates. PERMANOVA was carried out with fixed factors and 9999 permutations at a significance level of p &lt; 0.05. Homogeneity of dispersion (PERMDISP) was applied, to test whether data in significant PERMANOVA results were not over dispersed, using 9999 permutations at a significance level of p &lt; 0.05.

Next, OTUs contributing most (&gt; 3%) to the total dissimilarity between different plastic groups (SIMPER analysis) were subjected into cluster analysis. This trimmed data set resulted in 23 OTUs to that the moderate square root transformation was applied. To determine which groups of plastics cluster together in respect of plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” taxa, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using Bray Curtis similarity (S17) using square root transformed relative abundances. To test our hypothesis that specificities of plastics biofilms might be related to members of the rather rare biosphere the plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” OTUs were compared with a former dataset of 15 month old biofilms origin of the same experimental set up (Sequence data deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive under the accession number PRJEB22051).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Identification of microbes that preferentially colonize and interact with plastics surfaces remains challenging as the differences in community composition of mature biofilms are generally low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>]. Furthermore, young biofilms (2–6 weeks) appear to be rather unspecific between different plastic types or other inert substrates like glass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref019">19</xref>]. Here, we present a three phase experimental approach to uncover potential plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microbes. Our findings indicate that tightly attached microorganisms might account to the rather rare biosphere and suggest the presence of plastic “specific” microorganisms/assemblages which could possibly benefit from the given plastic properties.</p>
<sec id="sec015">
<title>Water jet treatment &amp; selective enrichment</title>
<p>As the main hypothesis of this study was that plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microorganisms are tightly attached to the polymeric surface, a technique to remove the upper loosely attached part is the first step to facilitate further analysis. There are numerous studies trying to achieve a complete sanitation of biofilms but, to the best of our knowledge, no method can successfully achieve entire detachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref035">35</xref>]. The persistency of biofilms towards removal techniques, as inauspiciously as it may be for sanitation issues, is of great advantage to investigate these strongly adherent cells on the substrate. Techniques to remove the cohesive layers of the biofilm, while leaving the adhesive layer attached to the substrate on purpose, are not published. Since chemical or enzymatic action can break adherent bonds, removal of the coherent biofilm layers requires mechanical action which does not seem to have much influence on the biofilms integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref037">37</xref>]. Microscopic investigations revealed that strongly attached microbes were able to survive the high-pressure water Jet treatment on all plastics with the largest extent of adhesive cells on PP followed by LDPE, PS, HDPE, PESTUR, PVC, SAN, PLA, PET and at least on glass. Already in 1979, Fletcher and Loeb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref038">38</xref>] examined substrates with a hydrophilic and positive to neutral surface charge, revealing a moderate number of cells, while only very few cells stayed attached to hydrophilic and negatively charged surfaces such as glass. This might explain the variation in cell numbers between the diverse substrates as well as the low cell numbers found on glass compared to those on the nine different plastic types after the high pressure removal in this study.</p>
<p>Differentiated communities (short-term <italic>vs</italic>. long-term) developed within the third phase of the experiment after five month under nutrient limited conditions in the sterile seawater incubation. PERMANOVA pairwise comparison indicated that all microbial communities on their respective substrate differed significantly to each other. Although all substrates were treated similarly, it should be noted that differences in community profiles could be induced by the considerable difference in remaining cell numbers on diverse substrates after the high-pressure water Jet treatment. However, the detected differences still imply that the substrate shaped the community as a result of the adherence strength of the biofilm to the respective substrate surface. Comparing short-term (six weeks) and long-term (five month) incubated communities revealed shifts towards communities with lower richness over time for all plastic types but glass, which points towards a selection of microbes, that are either specialised to low nutrient conditions or the respective plastic type. On the class level, three different changes were observed between short- and long-term incubated communities; a shift from high to low abundant classes, and vice versa, but also classes being characteristic for a plastic type, implying that the plastic type is responsible for shaping the community composition. Biofilm communities include a heterogeneity in form of organisms with various metabolic capacities and different physiological properties which generates on the one hand competition but also provides on the other hand opportunities for cooperation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref039">39</xref>]. Hence, some of the observed changes in community composition might be related to organisms playing a specific role in interspecies interactions (cooperation) in plastic-degrading microbial assemblages.</p>

<title>Unveiled potentially plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microbes</title>
<p>The three phases stepwise uncovering of potential plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” bacteria resulted in 23 final OTUs contributing highly to the total dissimilarity between the nine plastic types. Generally, the chemical composition (e.g. polyesters, polyolefines) and physico-chemical properties of different plastic types, including the ones used in this study, are highly diverse in order to meet the different needs of thousands of end products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref040">40</xref>]. The plastic foils used as substrate in the present study, are commonly produced for e.g. packaging and construction. It was hypothesized that plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microorganisms are tightly attached to the polymeric surface and might be represented by rare but active species, since differences of mature biofilms between distinct plastic types were found to be generally low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>]. Comparing our two datasets revealed that 70% of the uncovered potential plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” OTUs of the present study, were assigned to the rather rare biosphere (&lt;0.1%) of the biofilms investigated six month earlier (15 month old biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>]). Former research reports that rare phylotypes tend to stay rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref042">42</xref>]. Other studies suggested that rare but active populations might be controlled by top-down forces (e.g. predation) or competition (e.g. space, nutrients) within the biofilm and to underlie environmental controls (e.g. temperature) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref043">43</xref>]. Having the potential to increase in abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref044">44</xref>], our findings clearly support the idea that potential plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” species are, at least partly, controlled by competitive interactions in mature dense biofilms.</p>
<p>Several studies have investigated microbial communities on marine plastics under various conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref045">45</xref>]. After subtracting OTUs also abundant on glass, in total 68 OTUs were found specifically associated with the different plastics and, out of those, 23 mostly discriminating the chemically distinct plastics. Several researchers, reported about multiple families in common on a variety of marine plastics in different locations e.g. <italic>Nannocystaceae</italic>, <italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Planctomycetes</italic>, <italic>Saprospiraceae</italic>, <italic>Erythrobacteraceae</italic>, <italic>Hyphomonadaceae</italic> and <italic>Rhodobacteraceae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref045">45</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref018">18</xref>] also detected members of this family on diverse substrates, PE and PS just being one of them. <italic>Phyllobacteriaceae</italic> were found to be significantly more abundant on plastics, despite showing overall high relative abundances in the study of Oberbeckmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref018">18</xref>]. In our study <italic>Phyllobacteriaceae</italic> contributed to the similarity between the polyolefins HDPE, LDPE and PP.</p>
<p>Since bacterial families are large, the uncovered plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” genera were compared with former studies and found four genera already recognized on marine plastics as <italic>Roseovarius</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref045">45</xref>], <italic>Erythrobacter</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref045">45</xref>] <italic>Ulvibacter</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref014">14</xref>] and <italic>Parvularcula</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref045">45</xref>]. The repetitive detection of these genera associated to marine plastics in various approaches suggests that further investigations on their role in plastic biofilms are required. However, since our experimental design focused on the enrichment of tightly attached and rather rare taxa, they might have been present but not recognized in previous research. For example, in the study of Kirstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref016">16</xref>] the genera <italic>Roseovarius</italic> and <italic>Erythrobacter</italic> accounted to the rare biosphere (&lt;0.1%) in the mature biofilms (15 month) and were therefore further not considered. Interestingly, in other studies <italic>Roseovarius</italic> and <italic>Erythrobacter</italic> were detected in relatively young (2 weeks) or in biofilms of unknown age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref045">45</xref>].</p>

<title>Sensing the surface–plastic properties</title>
<p>Sensing of a non-soluble surface followed by the successful colonization are the first steps for marine bacteria to develop a community, potentially leading to plastic biodegradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref047">47</xref>]. Beside surface properties like hydrophobicity and roughness, surface chemodynamics like surface conditioning or nutrient enrichment also play a role in forming distinct biofilm communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215859.ref047">47</xref>]. This questions whether we, and other researcher, were detecting <italic>“plastic specific”</italic> organisms or <italic>“plastic specific coatings”</italic> organisms needs to be addressed in future studies. In the present study, bacterial taxa able to survive on glass likely used dissolved organic carbon present in the sterile seawater as carbon source, and consequently did not benefit from plastics surface properties or chemical composition. All other OTUs detected on the various plastic types were therefore potentially plastic <italic>“specific”</italic>. Due to short read lengths of 16S rRNA gene tag sequencing, a conclusive identification on the species level of the unveiled plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” OTUs was not possible so far. Since successful surface colonisation does not prove a special role as e.g. plastic degradation, the next step must be the systematic isolation and identification of those plastic <italic>“specific”</italic> organisms and to further test for the potential of one species or consortium to degrade the respective plastic type. On the community level, the next steps should be the disclosure of the mechanisms that allow the plastic “specific” assemblages to survive, their possible metabolic pathways and enzymes involved.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study represents a systematic and robust experimental approach uncovering potential plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microbes and is therefore a step forward in understanding the substrate specificity of the “Plastisphere”. For the first time, a high-pressure water Jet treatment technique was used to remove the cohesive layer of mature biofilms, while leaving the adhesive layer on the plastics surface. Our results indicate the presence of plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microorganisms/assemblages which could possibly benefit from the given plastics properties. Furthermore, our findings clearly indicate that plastic “<italic>specific</italic>” microorganisms might account to the rather rare biosphere and are tightly surface attached. Underrepresentation, due to low read counts, might be an explanation why specificities between plastics biofilms in natural marine environments were not detected so far in young biofilms or seem to be generally low in mature biofilms.</p>
