<abstract>
<p>We present a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model for the quintessential keystone predator, the rocky-intertidal sea star <italic>Pisaster ochraceus</italic>. Based on first principles, DEB theory is used to illuminate underlying physiological processes (maintenance, growth, development, and reproduction), thus providing a framework to predict individual-level responses to environmental change. We parameterized the model for <italic>P. ochraceus</italic> using both data from the literature and experiments conducted specifically for the DEB framework. We devoted special attention to the model’s capacity to (1) describe growth trajectories at different life-stages, including pelagic larval and post-metamorphic phases, (2) simulate shrinkage when prey availability is insufficient to meet maintenance requirements, and (3) deal with the combined effects of changing body temperature and food supply. We further validated the model using an independent growth data set. Using standard statistics to compare model outputs with real data (e.g. Mean Absolute Percent Error, MAPE) we demonstrated that the model is capable of tracking <italic>P. ochraceus</italic>’ growth in length at different life-stages (larvae: MAPE = 12.27%; post-metamorphic, MAPE = 9.22%), as well as quantifying reproductive output index. However, the model’s skill dropped when trying to predict changes in body mass (MAPE = 24.59%), potentially because of the challenge of precisely anticipating spawning events. Interestingly, the model revealed that <italic>P. ochraceus</italic> reserves contribute little to total biomass, suggesting that animals draw energy from structure when food is limited. The latter appears to drive indeterminate growth dynamics in <italic>P. ochraceus</italic>. Individual-based mechanistic models, which can illuminate underlying physiological responses, offer a viable framework for forecasting population dynamics in the keystone predator <italic>Pisaster ochraceus</italic>. The DEB model herein represents a critical step in that direction, especially in a period of increased anthropogenic pressure on natural systems and an observed recent decline in populations of this keystone species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Improving our ability to anticipate responses of natural systems to environmental change is among the most pressing challenges facing modern ecological theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Denny1">[1]</xref>. Efforts have been confounded by the inherently complex nonlinear dynamics of such systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Monaco1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Mumby1">[4]</xref>. However, the physiological responses of individuals may be considered as the underlying basis of all ecological dynamics, thus providing a solid foundation for advancing the field of ecological forecasting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Denny1">[1]</xref>. Studies at the organismal level have emphasized that some of the first responses to climate change may lie not in mortality but in changes in growth and reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Petes1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Newell1">[6]</xref> and in the strength of species interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kordas1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Wethey1">[9]</xref>. Particularly promising are bioenergetics studies that quantify flows of energy and mass through an individual, which in turn dictate levels of physiological performance including feeding, growth and reproduction. This provides a mechanistic framework that can help characterize physiological responses to current and projected environmental drivers as a consequence, for example, of increasing temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kearney1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Predictive frameworks based on bioenergetics have been used for a wide range of species from a variety of taxa, and range in complexity from fairly simple to very elaborate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>. However, given the complex nature of some of the threats currently faced by natural systems (e.g. climate change, ocean acidification, pollution), where intertwined direct and indirect effects can impact multiple species simultaneously, the most efficient approach may be to concentrate on ecologically important players, whose dynamics can exert cascading effects on populations and communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kordas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Connell1">[12]</xref>. Following this reasoning, keystone species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Mills1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Paine1">[14]</xref> may serve as ideal candidates for investigating and modeling the physiological mechanisms that ultimately mediate ecological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sanford1">[15]</xref>. Particularly, keystone predators – consumers that can remove competitive dominants or otherwise have impacts on an ecosystem disproportionate to their abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Paine1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Duggins1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Fauth1">[17]</xref> – have received much attention. Despite our generally good understanding of the links between the physiological condition of many species and their interactions with their environment (i.e. eco-physiology), few quantitative physiological models have been developed for keystone predators, and specifically there is a pressing need for models of feeding, growth and reproduction, and their response to changes in environmental drivers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Andr1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we describe a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB), an individual-based mechanistic energetics model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman2">[19]</xref>, for the quintessential keystone predator, the rocky-intertidal sea star <italic>Pisaster ochraceus</italic> (Brandt 1835) (hereafter, <italic>Pisaster</italic>). By preferentially foraging on a dominant space-competitor, the mussel <italic>Mytilus californianus</italic>, <italic>Pisaster</italic> has profound impacts on intertidal community assemblages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Paine1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Menge1">[20]</xref>. Exploiting the virtues of DEB theory, we describe a model that can (1) predict <italic>Pisaster</italic> growth at larval and post-metamorphic stages when prey are abundant and available <italic>ad libitum</italic>, (2) characterize shrinkage when food is removed, and (3) illuminate dynamics in physiological processes driven by cumulative effects of temperature and prey availability. This model represents a critical first step in exploring, and forecasting how variation in environmental drivers will likely affect the physiological performance and rates of foraging of this keystone predator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sanford2">[21]</xref>. Such an understanding is especially timely given the recent widespread mortality of <italic>Pisaster</italic> being observed on the Pacific coast of North America (Eric Sanford, pers. comm.).</p>
<p>While several bioenergetics models seeking to relate metabolic organization to aspects of physiological performance exist, DEB theory is gaining increased popularity because of its ability to model underlying physiological processes (maintenance, growth, development, and reproduction) based on first principles, that are common to all life forms including different taxa and life stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sousa1">[22]</xref>. Unlike net-production models (e.g. scope for growth), which maintain that assimilated energy is partitioned between maintenance and growth/reproduction, DEB theory assumes that energy is first stored as reserves, and then distributed among physiological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Filgueira1">[23]</xref>. This topology offers solutions for multiple biological problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>, three of which we emphasize here given their importance for <italic>Pisaster</italic>. Firstly, we rely on the capacity of the DEB to mechanistically describe the whole life cycle of a generalized organism without having to modify the structure of the model throughout ontogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Nisbet1">[24]</xref>. This is accomplished by explicitly accounting for energetic requirements associated with the life-history processes of maturation and maturity maintenance. Incorporating these costs is non-trivial from both physiological and ecological standpoints, as highlighted by a growing body of literature revealing that challenges faced by individuals early in life can impair performance at later stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Gebauer1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Richmond1">[29]</xref>. Since the keystone role of <italic>Pisaster</italic> is restricted to its benthic life stages, efforts to model the influence of environmental variables on its physiological condition have mainly focused on post-metamorphic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sanford1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pincebourde1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Gooding1">[31]</xref> but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-George1">[32]</xref>). Notably, however, an important portion of its existence occurs as a planktotrophic larva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Strathmann1">[33]</xref>. The model presented here exploits the capacity of DEB theory to account for maturation and maturity maintenance and, building upon available data for both larval <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-George1">[32]</xref> and post-metamorphic stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Feder1">[34]</xref>, provides a means for simulating growth trajectories of <italic>Pisaster</italic> throughout ontogeny.</p>
<p>Secondly, a reserve compartment provides organisms with a physiological buffer against environmental fluctuations, by which vital rates and dynamics of structural mass are partially independent of changes in prey availability. DEB theory thus offers a framework for accounting for time history aspects of environmental signals. Weight-loss and shrinkage (i.e. reduction in structure to pay for somatic maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>) are common for some intertidal organisms such as annelids, echinoderms, and cnidarians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Feder1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Linton1">[37]</xref> frequently having to cope with severe energy limitations due to abiotic (e.g. waves, heat and desiccation stress) and biotic conditions (e.g. competition, low prey availability). In an attempt to improve the accuracy of the model with respect to starvation, we include an additional parameter calibrated using data from controlled laboratory observations.</p>
<p>Thirdly, organisms rarely face single stressors in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sokolova1">[38]</xref>; instead, the environment tends to challenge individuals through cumulative effects of multiple factors. As has been well established, the relative importance of predatory species on their communities is largely determined by their sensitivity to varying conditions of body temperature and food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Freitas1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Burrows1">[43]</xref>. Surprisingly, despite widespread recognition of the critical ecological role of keystone predators, few models have been developed that account for the interactive effects of these variables on their physiological condition. Developing such models is particularly necessary for species experiencing extreme variability in environmental conditions. Throughout its wide range of distribution along the west coast of North America (between Alaska and Baja California), <italic>Pisaster</italic> encounters large temporal and spatial variation in temperature and prey availability, so a model capable of accounting for the cumulative effects of simultaneous changes in these variables should prove especially useful. If we are to predict responses of individuals to natural and/or anthropogenic pressures it is therefore crucial to account for multiple sources of stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Howard1">[44]</xref>. Due to logistic and conceptual challenges, designing experiments that provide comprehensive, yet easy-to-interpret data has troubled eco-physiologists hoping to bridge the gaps between empirical observations and estimates of fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sokolova2">[45]</xref>. Based on individual bioenergetics, DEB theory provides a general (i.e. non taxon-specific) framework that can be utilized to uncover physiological mechanisms by which multiple stressors combine to impact performance in organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sokolova2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-FlyeSainteMarie1">[46]</xref>. To incorporate these effects, the model described here is based on empirically-derived estimates of temperature sensitivity, feeding functional response, and starvation dynamics of <italic>Pisaster</italic>.</p>
<p>The DEB model builds on both observational studies, which provide information of the basic biology of <italic>Pisaster</italic>, and manipulative studies addressing the effects of changes in body temperature on metabolic, feeding, and growth rates. These data were obtained both from the literature and from our own experiments, which were especially designed for DEB modeling purposes. Our aim is to provide an individual-based mechanistic model that can characterize the physiological condition of <italic>Pisaster</italic> throughout ontogeny, and in response to cumulative effects of changes in body temperature and prey availability across its geographic range.</p>

<title>Model Description</title>
<p>Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory describes energy and mass flows in an individual organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) throughout its life history. In its purest form DEB considers an archetypal individual that is representative of all individuals of the species, although several authors have extended the theory to examine intraspecific variability, such as occurs along latitudinal gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Freitas1">[39]</xref>. The model herein was first developed following the assumptions of a standard DEB model (i.e. one reserve compartment, one structure compartment, isomorphic growth). While excellent comprehensive descriptions of the standard DEB model and its fundamentals are provided elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sousa1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-vanderMeer1">[47]</xref>, we offer a basic explanation of the formulations that orchestrate our generalized model in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104658.s001">Appendix (S1)</xref>. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the model tracks dynamics of four state variables (reserve, structure, maturation, and reproductive buffer), which depend on energy flows (units of J d<sup>−1</sup>; represented by arrows). Energy assimilated from food at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, first enters the reserve compartment. Energy can then be mobilized at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and allocated depending on the parameter kappa (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman2">[19]</xref>, which amounts to a fixed fraction of energy used for somatic maintenance at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, plus growth at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The remainder, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, goes to maturity maintenance at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, plus reproduction at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

The parameter kappa (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is the proportion of mobilized energy diverted to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while the rest (1−<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is used for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>The standard DEB model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104658.s001">Appendix S1</xref>) was modified to incorporate relevant aspects of <italic>Pisaster</italic> life-history. Specifically, we accounted for growth during larval stage, the ability of individuals to shrink (i.e. compensate for somatic maintenance costs using structure) when starved, and species-specific rules for energy expenditure in spawning. The steps taken to incorporate these aspects into the standard model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104658.s001">Appendix S1</xref>) are detailed below.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>2.1. <italic>Pisaster ochraceus</italic> DEB model structure</title>
<p>Since relevant information for the different life-stages of <italic>Pisaster</italic> was available in the literature, it was possible to build a model that encompasses the whole life-span of a generalized individual, accounting for changes in morphology, energy allocation rules, and growth patterns that follow when transitioning between stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Jusup1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Nisbet2">[50]</xref>.</p>
<p>Including a larval stage implies deviations from the standard DEB model due to violations of the isomorphy assumption arising from the stark morphological differences between <italic>Pisaster</italic> larval and post-metamorphic stages (planktonic ciliated swimming larva vs. benthic juvenile and adult). Standard DEB models use one shape coefficient, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, to convert physical lengths, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (e.g. larval length), to structural lengths, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (a useful theoretical measure of size that directly relates to the state variable structure and is not influenced by the organism’s shape), through the equation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Because morphology differs between the larval and post-metamorphic stages, the relationship between physical and structural length needs to be described independently for each stage, which we do here by estimating two shape coefficients, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. Violating the isomorphy assumption also implies that surface-area is proportional to volume<sup>1</sup> instead of volume<sup>2/3</sup>– as for isomorphs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman3">[51]</xref>. As a consequence, growth during larval development is accelerated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-George1">[32]</xref>, which is therefore better described by an exponential rather than the asymptotic von Bertalanffy growth model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman3">[51]</xref>. Indeed, using data from George <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-George1">[32]</xref> and Pia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pia1">[52]</xref>, we found that larval surface-area was proportional to volume<sup>0.97</sup>, an exponent that is not statistically different from 1.0. It has been argued that, as a result, the processes of assimilation and mobilization rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104658.s001">Appendix S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0104658.e066">equations 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0104658.e086">3</xref>, respectively) increase during larval development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Jusup1">[48]</xref>. Since somatic maintenance is proportional to volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104658.s001">Appendix S1</xref>, Eq. 4), there is no limit to the increase in structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman3">[51]</xref>, in agreement with observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-George1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Jusup1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pecquerie1">[49]</xref>.</p>

<p>The covariation method can accommodate diverse data sets that provide information about the basic biology of the target species, including size/age at transitions between life stages, growth, feeding, or reproductive output measurements, as well as data sets generated to estimate DEB theory quantities. We used the covariation method to (1) estimate DEB parameters for which we had no real data (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and to (2) optimize the estimates obtained for parameters we determined empirically (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104658-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Pairs of individuals were then transferred to 60-L aquaria filled with 1-µm filtered seawater at ambient temperature (∼12°C). Experimental water temperatures were achieved by keeping the aquaria in climate-controlled rooms. The two highest treatment temperatures were reached using 100-W aquarium heaters (Marineland Visi-Therm, USA). Water temperatures were changed at a rate of ∼1°C h<sup>−1</sup>.

Water chemistry (salinity, pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate) was monitored every other day using a saltwater test kit (API, USA), and partial water changes were performed when needed (every 1–2 d). Individuals were then placed in cylindrical watertight chambers (2.88 L) filled with aerated, 1-µm filtered seawater, at its corresponding treatment temperature. A magnetic stir-bar kept the water circulating during measurements.

Simulating ideal conditions (<italic>f</italic> = 1), the model predicted “birth” (first feeding larval stage) at 4.2 d after fertilization, when the larval size is 0.02 cm wide (vs. training values 9 d and 0.03 cm, respectively); settlement around day 59.9, when larval width is ∼0.38 cm (vs. training values 50 d and 0.37 cm, respectively); and puberty around day 264, when wet weight is ∼66.7 g (vs. training values 5 y and 70–90 g, respectively). The same simulation projects an estimate for <italic>RO</italic> of 0.21 (vs. training value 0.23). These predictions, along with the maximum size reported for <italic>Pisaster</italic> (20-cm arm length; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Feder1">[34]</xref>) allowed estimation of growth curves for both larval and post-metamorphic stages. The model’s ability to precisely track changes in larval body size (MAPE = 12.27%, RMSE = 0.005 cm) is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g005">Figure 5</xref>. The comparison between observed and predicted growth data for the adult life stage further revealed the model’s good performance (overall RMSE = 1.01 cm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The training data for this adult stage were collected at two temperatures: 9 and 12°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sanford2">[21]</xref> (section 3.1.1.). When running our model at each of these temperatures, agreement between observations and predictions was slightly better at 12°C (RMSE = 0.82 cm) than 9°C (RMSE = 1.18 cm). Although Sanford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sanford2">[21]</xref> did not find differences in growth between individuals kept at 9 and 12°C, our model’s built-in thermal sensitivity (independently estimated) predicts the 3°C difference in temperature would cause a significant change in growth (from 27 to 42% of maximal value). The lack of coherence between these model predictions, which suggest large changes on growth between temperatures on the steep part of the thermal performance curve, and Sanford’s data, which showed no difference in growth between 9° and 12°C, remains unexplained.</p>

<p>The model’s overall capacity to describe changes in wet weight appeared less satisfactory than for arm length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). The indicator of relative error, MAPE, reaches 24.59% (RMSE = 147.56g, MAE = 93.81g) when comparing observed data with the simulated growth trajectory obtained using the average parameter values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). The model’s lack of skill in predicting wet weight in <italic>Pisaster</italic> is further evidenced by the large spread of the family of growth curves from the Monte Carlo simulations that accounted for the variability in parameter estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the relative influence of the DEB parameters on <italic>Pisaster</italic> size at age 2 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104658-t001">Table 1</xref>). Generally, the effect of increasing parameter values on the model output was approximately mirrored by the effect of decreasing the parameter values, and vice versa, indicating that most parameters had linear effects on growth. Effects were only nonlinear for thermal sensitivity parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. An increase in the value of the former had a strong negative effect on the model output (sensitivity −0.99), while a reduction caused a weak positive effect (sensitivity 0.04). In contrast, while increasing the value of the latter did not affect the model output, reducing it produced a strong negative effect (sensitivity −0.99, not shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104658-t001">Table 1</xref>). This analysis revealed that the model was most sensitive to both increases in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and reductions in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<title>6.1. Model sensitivity</title>
<p>Future applications of this model should recognize that different parameters have a different relative influence on the model’s output. Thus, depending on users’ specific study objectives, one should consider the precision with which certain parameter values were determined, and whether further tuning is required. Our model sensitivity analysis provided a useful means for assessing this. Those parameters with high sensitivity have a big impact on the output of the model (e.g. thermal sensitivity parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and therefore future efforts should focus on methods for improving their estimation. In contrast, because parameters with low sensitivity should have little influence on the output of the model, their estimation could be treated with less care. Consequently, despite the large variability observed in some of the parameters, their relative importance could be minor if their sensitivity is low (e.g. maturity-maintenance rate coefficient, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>

<title>6.2. Reserves and starvation</title>
<p>The model allows discriminating between the contributions from reserves, structure, and gonads to the total wet weight of an individual experiencing different levels of food availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Notably, the contribution of the reserve to the animal’s body mass is very small, albeit enough to fuel its metabolic demands. Similarly, a study conducted with the Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (<italic>Thunnus thynnus</italic>) found a low contribution from reserves (7%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Jusup1">[48]</xref> which, according to the authors’ analysis, explains their limited ability to survive starvation and the need to forage voraciously. Despite the even smaller reserve compartment in <italic>Pisaster</italic> (3.8%), its ability to readily draw energy from structure appears as a strategy to cope with naturally uncertain food conditions. The observation that individuals facing food limitation not only show a steady body mass loss but also a reduction in arm length (i.e. structural length) suggests that individuals readily draw energy from the structure compartment to supplement energy allocation from reserves. Now consider a well fed individual (∼250 g wet mass) suddenly deprived of food; the model predicts an exponential decrease in body mass, in accordance with our empirical observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g009">Figure 9B</xref> illustrates the very short period needed to empty the reserve compartment (∼67 d to reach 1% of the maximum reserve density). Then, as mobilized energy cannot satisfy the maintenance requirements, structure is used as an energy source contributing to the subsequent mass loss. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g009">Figure 9</xref> also shows the contribution of gonads to total body mass, which fluctuates annually between 0 and 20.7% in a well-fed individual. Structure, in turn, comprises most of <italic>Pisaster</italic> weight: up to 96.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>). Food deprivation further impacts the amount of gonads produced during this initial period, which falls to zero after the annual spawning event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>).</p>

<p>It should also be mentioned that the contribution to total wet weight from the model’s reserve compartment does not reflect the relative contribution from pyloric caecum, which is traditionally regarded as the sea star energy reserve organ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Nimitz1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Harrold1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pearse2">[75]</xref>. Although DEB reserves do not account for a large portion of the weight of <italic>Pisaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g009">Fig. 9</xref>), pyloric caecum is known to reach relative values comparable to reproductive output (∼0.15–0.20 of total body mass) when prey is available <italic>ad libitum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sanford3">[61]</xref>. This seeming contradiction may be explained by the location of the DEB reserve compartment in the energy flow pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), which differs from the role of the pyloric caecum in sea stars. Although the pyloric caecum can be considered as an energy storage organ, our assumption is that it is located down-stream from the reserve compartment, in closer proximity to the reproductive buffer. We make this argument based on two lines of evidence. First, DEB theory assumes that when food supply is constant, the DEB reserve density should not vary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sousa1">[22]</xref>. The cyclic nature of the pyloric caecum in <italic>Pisaster</italic>, even when prey is available <italic>ad libitum</italic> and individuals’ feeding does not fluctuate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pearse1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Mauzey1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pearse2">[75]</xref>, conflicts with the idea of equating the DEB reserve compartment with pyloric caecum. Second, studies have shown strong relationships between the volumes of pyloric caecum accumulated during the feeding period of <italic>Pisaster</italic>, and the gonadal tissue produced subsequently during the spawning period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pearse1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sanford3">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pearse2">[75]</xref>. Thus, while it is possible that maintenance is paid in part by pyloric reserves, especially during starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Nimitz2">[56]</xref>, most of that energy is allocated to gonadal growth. For simplicity, we did not include a pyloric caecum compartment in the model. Future versions of DEB models for <italic>Pisaster</italic> or any other sea star could consider its dynamics explicitly although notably, model results did not appear to be sensitive to its absence. Because the dynamics in pyloric and gonadal indexes are driven by photoperiod regimes, these models would benefit by incorporating photoperiod in their structure.</p>
<p>To better predict changes in size following starvation, specifically when energy diverted to somatic maintenance and growth is not enough to cover the former, we subjected individuals to complete food deprivation and monitored weight-loss over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). These data allowed us to define and estimate a new parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which not only describes energy flows from structure to pay for somatic maintenance, but also provides a good match between observed and simulated reductions in size due to starvation. Although the literature suggests that mobilizing energy from structure to pay for somatic maintenance should be less efficient than from reserves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sousa1">[22]</xref>, our data revealed a lower value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104658-t001">Table 1</xref>). This might be a consequence from the drop in activity and metabolism shown by individuals during prolonged starvation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, animals lost weight smoothly throughout the duration of the starvation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Previous studies both with vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Cherel1">[76]</xref> and invertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Ren1">[54]</xref> have shown that the rate of weight loss changes from steep to shallow once reserves are depleted and structure is used as substrate. The observation that reserves make up a small portion of <italic>Pisaster</italic> biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g009">Fig. 9</xref>) is likely masking the change in rate of weight loss expected based on the literature. Finally, it must be recognized that shrinkage of structure directly translates into a decrease in maintenance costs, consequently allowing the organism to stay alive. This is a key adaptive trait in challenging environments such as the rocky intertidal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sebens1">[35]</xref>. Efforts to account for the effect of starvation on organisms that routinely undergo periods of reduced feeding thus represents a crucial step if we are to predict real world dynamics.</p>

<title>6.3. Model performance</title>
<p>Because of varying levels of skill amongst different growth metrics, it is important to highlight the instances when the model predictions can be expected to be reliable, and when they should be viewed with caution. The model accurately predicted larval width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) and arm length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>) trajectories. An important strength of DEB is indeed its ability to incorporate the entire life-history of an organism using the same parameter values. Like other species modeled through DEB – including bivalves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-RicoVilla1">[77]</xref> and fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Jusup1">[48]</xref>, <italic>Pisaster</italic> undergoes morphological changes between larval and post-metamorphic stages. Accounting for this in the model required application of stage-specific shape coefficients (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to transform structural lengths to physical lengths and a shape correction function (Eq. 1) to capture growth acceleration. These adjustments provided a good correspondence between real and simulated larval growth. Note that, although the time period covered by the real data is only half of that required for larval competency, the model projection (59.9 d) is close to observations from the literature (∼50 d for well-fed larvae) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Vickery1">[70]</xref>. While our validation exercise was limited to laboratory conditions with abundant food supply, the feeding functional response embedded in the model structure allows assessments under scenarios of reduced energy availability. If food is limited, the model predicts longer times to larval competency, although maturity level at metamorphosis remains constant. These predictions are consistent with Hart’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Hart1">[78]</xref> study of the urchin <italic>Strongylocentrotus droabachiensis</italic>, and suggest a mechanism for understanding the wide distribution in settlement times previously reported for <italic>Pisaster</italic> (76–228 d) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Strathmann2">[79]</xref>. The model, however, ignores potentially important features of <italic>Pisaster</italic> embryonic and larval developmental stages. For instance, it does not account for the capacity of their larvae to clone when food is abundant and of high quality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Vickery1">[70]</xref>. Additionally, the model assumes that energy density, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is equal between mothers and offspring, contradicting previous experimental observations revealing that bigger females produced small, low-quality eggs, and small females produced larger, high-quality eggs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-George1">[32]</xref>. Although we disregarded these aspects for simplicity, including them in future versions of the model would certainly increase its potential for bridging the gap between individual and population level processes for <italic>Pisaster</italic>.</p>
<p>Our simulated growth for juveniles and adults also showed good correspondence with empirical data, although precision varied with the size metric considered (predictions for arm length were more precise than for wet weight) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Several mechanisms may partially explain the reduced precision in predicting wet weight trajectories. First, it is quite common that the weight-at-age data are more scattered than the corresponding length-at-age data, meaning that the former is impossible to capture with the same level of precision as the latter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Karasov1">[80]</xref>. From a DEB perspective this is not surprising given that weight contains contributions from three state variables (including the structural length) each being a source of the prediction error that adds to the overall amount of the scatter. The physical length, on the other hand, is predicted solely from the structural length, meaning that the corresponding prediction error is the only source of the scatter. Second, precision may be reduced by assuming <italic>ad libitum</italic> food, reserve density remains constant and structural mass increases smoothly with time. Gonadal tissue, however, fluctuates yearly due to spawning events triggered by photoperiodic cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pearse1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pearse2">[75]</xref>. By assuming that all mature individuals release their gonads accumulated during the previous year, based entirely on energetic criteria, the model does not capture individual and population level variability in the timing of spawning given by unaccounted potential cues (e.g. body temperature, presence of conspecifics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Himmelman1">[81]</xref>, or by photoperiod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pearse1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pearse2">[75]</xref>). Due to the large portion of body mass that can be attributed to gonads during spring-summer period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Fraser1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sanford3">[61]</xref>, discrepancies in the exact timing of spawning between the model and empirical data can translate into large differences in wet weight at specific times. Note that, when accurate estimates of spawning time are a key modeling goal, reducing the time resolution of the model from days (default) to weeks would improve the value of model’s skill metric; in addition, using a day-length cue for spawning would also improve skill metric. The model’s precision may be even less in case individuals fail to spawn on spring-summer (after accumulating gonads), and/or if the handling time of prey items varies, affecting their capacity to process energy efficiently. Both scenarios are possible under lab and certainly field conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Feder1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>An additional source of error when modeling wet weight trajectories may come from the observation that relative investment in gonads negatively correlates with food availability across sites in <italic>Pisaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sanford3">[61]</xref>, which deviates from DEB theory’s assumption that the relative investment (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is constant. Sanford and Menge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sanford3">[61]</xref> hypothesized that such an adaptation may increase the likelihood for larvae produced at poor sites to reach worthier locations. For simplicity, and because the mechanism is not completely understood, our model ignores this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Because of the ecological importance of the age at puberty, it is worth touching on the large discrepancy between the modeled and observed values (264 d and 5 y, respectively). Two aspects may be determining the mismatch. First, the observed value is an estimate calculated using field observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Menge2">[71]</xref>, where environmental conditions (notably food and temperature) are uncertain and individuals probably do not forage constantly. In contrast, our estimate is based on growth measurements collected in controlled, constant lab settings, where <italic>Pisaster</italic> could feed <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Second, the difference between observed and modeled age at puberty may be due to the uncertainty in the estimates of some of the DEB parameter values. For example, our estimate for maturity maintenance rate coefficient was 0.0000029±0.018 (mean±SD) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104658-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>6.4. Environmental dependency</title>
<p>Throughout its wide geographic range, <italic>Pisaster</italic> often copes with extremely challenging conditions inherent to the rocky intertidal. Stress may arise from both physical and biological forces whose impacts vary spatially and temporally. Here we focused on body temperature and food availability because of their overarching influence on physiological and ecological performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Karasov1">[80]</xref>. First, our thermal sensitivity experiment yielded a complete thermal performance curve for respiration rate (hereafter, TPC) for <italic>Pisaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). A number of different approaches have been proposed to analytically characterize TPCs ([e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Shi1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Angilletta1">[83]</xref>), most of which typically arrive at the same general shape; namely, an increase in performance with temperature, followed by a leveling off at an intermediate temperature (optimal performance), and a subsequent drop leading to minimum performance and death at extreme temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Angilletta2">[84]</xref>. The five parameters we estimated here determine this general shape. TPCs are becoming an increasingly popular tool to readily assess the effect of temperature on relevant ecological and physiological performance traits, as well as for predicting impacts of climate change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Monaco1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Angilletta2">[84]</xref>. When used in a DEB framework, one can further discriminate among the effects of temperature on the various physiological processes being modeled (maturity, maintenance, growth, reproduction). Since the relative importance of these processes may vary depending on the organism’s maturity (e.g. reproduction is only a defining trait after maturity has been reached), being able to quantify their responses to temperature separately should prove useful when working across life-stages. Note, however, that our thermal sensitivity parameters were estimated based on oxygen consumption measurements, and we rely on the assumption that all physiological rates respond to temperature following the same formulation. While empirical evidence sustains this assumption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>, we recommend testing it against independent measurements of feeding or growth rates at a range of temperatures, particularly at extreme ends of the curve, where different processes are expectedly less coupled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Sanford1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Levinton1">[85]</xref>. In addition, our model assumes that temperature exerts the same effect on metabolism, regardless of whether individuals are aerially exposed at low tide or submerged at high tide. We based this on a recent study conducted on <italic>Pisaster</italic>, which showed that thermal sensitivity is virtually equal between submerged and exposed animals subjected to a range of temperatures; Q<sub>10</sub> values being 2.18 and 2.12, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Fly1">[86]</xref>. However, despite finding similar sensitivities, the study also revealed a significant reduction in oxygen consumption rates (metabolic depression) for sea stars exposed to air compared to those kept submerged in water at the same temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Fly1">[86]</xref>. The mechanism by which some intertidal organisms reduce metabolism during aerial exposure is unclear, and therefore we did not consider it in the model. Note, however, that if animals are exposed daily, cumulative metabolic depressions may potentially have important consequences for long-term energy budgets. It should also be pointed that, since our TPC was described based on aquatic conditions, our model may not work when body temperature during aerial exposure exceeds the peak of our curve (∼295 K, or 22°C). Since aerial body temperatures above that threshold are known to occur for <italic>Pisaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Fly1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pincebourde2">[87]</xref>, models employed to describe its condition during periods of aerial exposure should add an additional set of thermal sensitivity parameters. While the value for Arrhenius temperature (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) would not change, the parameters that define the curve’s shape at extreme temperatures (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>,</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) should be re-estimated based, for example, on information of critical temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pincebourde2">[87]</xref>. Finally, temperature sensitivity parameters are likely to vary as a function of both prevalent body temperatures at the collecting sites/intertidal height (i.e. acclimatization) and details related to experimental design (e.g. acclimation time; chronic vs. acute) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Pincebourde2">[87]</xref>. Future studies must therefore carefully consider these and other caveats reported elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Schulte1">[88]</xref>, in order to avoid misinterpreting modeling results.</p>
<p>Moreover, our feeding experiment yielded a scaled Type II functional response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104658-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) which, based on a half-saturation coefficient, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0104658.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, provides means for assessing the effect of changing food density on the rate of energy intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Kooijman1">[11]</xref>. To our knowledge, this curve had not been described for <italic>Pisaster</italic> before.</p>

<title>6.5. Conclusions</title>
<p>In a period of increasing anthropogenic pressure, anticipating changes in the dynamics of ecological systems represents a complex, yet necessary challenge that ecologists must face in order to prevent further collapses of natural resources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0104658-Mumby1">[4]</xref>.
