        <p>Evasion of apoptosis is implicated in almost all aspects of cancer progression, as well as treatment resistance. In this study, resistance to apoptosis was identified in tumorigenic lung epithelial (A549) cells as a consequence of defects in mitochondrial and autophagic function. Mitochondrial function is determined in part by mitochondrial morphology, a process regulated by mitochondrial dynamics whereby the joining of two mitochondria, fusion, inhibits apoptosis while fission, the division of a mitochondrion, initiates apoptosis. Mitochondrial morphology of A549 cells displayed an elongated phenotype–mimicking cells deficient in mitochondrial fission protein, Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). A549 cells had impaired Drp1 mitochondrial recruitment and decreased Drp1-dependent fission. Cytochrome c release and caspase-3 and PARP cleavage were impaired both basally and with apoptotic stimuli in A549 cells. Increased mitochondrial mass was observed in A549 cells, suggesting defects in mitophagy (mitochondrial selective autophagy). A549 cells had decreased LC3-II lipidation and lysosomal inhibition suggesting defects in autophagy occur upstream of lysosomal degradation. Immunostaining indicated mitochondrial localized LC3 punctae in A549 cells increased after mitochondrial uncoupling or with a combination of mitochondrial depolarization and ectopic Drp1 expression. Increased inhibition of apoptosis in A549 cells is correlated with impeded mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. We suggest mitochondrial fission defects contribute to apoptotic resistance in A549 cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cancer is a major public health problem around the world. Current strategies in cancer therapy (chemo- and radiotherapy) rely on killing tumor cells by mechanisms largely mediated by the activation of apoptosis. Apoptosis is a conserved cellular process that controls normal development and tissue homeostasis by eliminating damaged cells. Inhibition of apoptosis contributes to the tumorigenic conversion of normal cells by extending their viability, favoring the accumulation of transforming mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Ryang1">[1]</xref>. Resistance to apoptosis is linked to increased invasive and metastatic potential in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Glinsky1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A classic cancer hallmark is apoptotic resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Fulda1">[3]</xref>. How tumor cells evade apoptotic cell death is currently unknown, but increasing tumor sensitivity to apoptosis is a therapeutic goal. The absence of spontaneous apoptosis and treatment-induced apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) suggests that deficiencies in the apoptotic process may be responsible for their resistance to anti-cancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Shivapurkar1">[4]</xref>. Gene mutations and altered expression of apoptosis regulators are detected in lung cancer. Differences in sensitivity to therapeutics that induce apoptosis may be related to the expression of apoptosis regulators in lung cancer. Anti-apoptotic modulating therapy is being extensively investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Fulda1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Intrinsic apoptosis is characterized by permeabilization of mitochondria, release of cytochrome c, and activation of the caspase cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>. Mitochondrial control of apoptosis occurs upstream of caspase activation and is mediated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>. Bcl-2 proteins also influence mitochondrial dynamics, a process that balances mitochondrial fission and fusion events to regulate the shape, structure and function of the mitochondrion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles whereby their shape corresponds to the metabolic status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Rossignol1">[6]</xref>, the health of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Youle1">[7]</xref> and balance between fusion and fission is required for homeostasis. Normally, mitochondrial fission mediator Drp1 fragments mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>. Drp1 is a large GTPase that controls membrane tubulation and fission in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>. Cells undergoing mitochondrial fission will have shorter mitochondrial length when compared to cells that are undergoing mitochondrial fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Chen1">[8]</xref>. Although these events are transient, cells deficient in a mitochondrial dynamics protein or under stimuli will maintain their state-dependent mitochondrial morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Rossignol1">[6]</xref>. Excessive mitochondrial fission (fragmentation) is essential for intrinsic apoptosis–it is necessary for cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Inhibition of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission impairs and partially inhibits intrinsic apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Youle1">[7]</xref>. Concomitant with mitochondrial membrane permeabilization during apoptosis, Drp1 forms oligomers and is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane to mediate fission in a GTP-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>. Fission events mediate apoptosis by regulating the release of pro-apoptotic factors to the cytosol. Inhibition of Drp1 prevents mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and cytochrome c release, and promotes elongated mitochondrial morphological phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission prohibits cytochrome c translocation and delays cell death, thus providing a link between mitochondrial dynamics and the induction of apoptosis.</p>
      <p>Mitochondrial dynamics not only impact intrinsic apoptosis, but also redirect autophagic degradation. Extensive cross-talk exists between mitophagy and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Boya1">[9]</xref>. Inhibition of fission mediators such as Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which impairs intrinsic apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Estaquier1">[10]</xref>, has been shown to decrease mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Twig1">[11]</xref>. Downregulation of autophagy during tumor progression has been noted in many studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Tan1">[12]</xref>. Increased tumorigenicity has been shown to decrease protein degradation in lung epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Lee1">[13]</xref>. The negative regulator of autophagy, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), is frequently activated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Balsara1">[14]</xref> and mTOR inhibitors have been shown to limit tumor proliferation in NSCLC models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Kim1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Resistance to apoptosis is linked to mitochondria and proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics. However, it remains unknown if tumor cells gain resistance to apoptosis by altering mitochondrial dynamics. In this study, we characterized mitochondrial dynamics and the downstream process of apoptosis in lung cancer cells. Differences in mitochondrial morphology and function were observed in A549 cells. We provide evidence in lung cancer cells suggesting an imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics exists, whereby defects in Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission inhibit the downstream process of autophagy and contribute to apoptotic resistance.</p>

        <p>Mitochondrial membrane potential was estimated in a 96-well plate using a fluorescent plate reader (Tecan). Cells (10<sup>4</sup> per well) were loaded with 10 nM TMRE for 30 minutes at 37°C in normal growth media. The TMRE loading medium was removed and cultures were placed in phenol red free, serum free media and incubated for an additional 15 minutes to allow for the TMRE fluorescent signal to reach steady state. Fluorescence intensity was then captured 1/min for 5 minutes to establish a baseline. After 5 minutes, 6 µM oligomycin (Cell Signaling) was added to induce hyperpolarization of Δψ<sub>m</sub>. In the presence of oligomycin, 10 µM CCCP was added at 18 minutes to the cells to cause depolarization of the ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>. TMRE expression is plotted as a relative ratio ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> showing mean and SEM, where F indicates fluorescence intensity and F<sub>0</sub> indicates baseline values before stimulation. All cell lines analyzed displayed oligomycin-induced hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Fluorescence intensities are background subtracted (554/576 nm).</p>
        <p>Mitophagy was measured using confocal microscopy to detect colocalization of mito-YFP transfected positive cells with immunostaining against mouse monoclonal anti-LC3B (Novus Biologicals) with AlexaFluor® 594 secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen). Cells (5×10<sup>4</sup> per well) were transfected in suspension with 0.5 µg mito-YFP using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and seeded on LabTekII borosilicate glass chambers (Nunc) for 24 h. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were immunostained with rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3B antibody (Novus Biologicals) and visualized with AlexaFluor® 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (590/617 nm). The number of distinct mitochondria localized LC3-positive punctae per cell was counted. Autophagosome formation was noted by LC3 punctae.</p>

Distinct differences in the morphology, including the length of mitochondria, were observed between lung epithelial cell lines that vary in tumorigenic potential (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045319-t001">Table I</xref>) and relative tumorigenic potential of each cell line was validated after performing cell migration experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045319.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Ayyasamy1">[23]</xref>. The non- and weakly tumorigenic NL20 and NL20TA cells had a heterogeneous phenotype but the tumorigenic Calu1 and A549 cells displayed predominantly the elongated form of mitochondria. A trend was noted whereby the non-tumorigenic cells (NL20) had the shortest mean mitochondrial length (mean±SEM; 5.2±0.4 µm) and the longest mean mitochondrial length was observed in A549 cells (mean±SEM; 8.0±0.8 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Increased Mitochondrial Mass in A549 Cells</title>
        <p>Mitochondrial mass was estimated in live cells using Mitotracker Green FM, which accumulates in mitochondria regardless of mitochondrial membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Agnello1">[24]</xref>. After normalization for cell volume, it was observed that A549 cells had increased mitochondrial mass compared to the other lung epithelial cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To further validate this relationship, the expression of a mitochondrial encoded protein, mitochondrial complex IV subunit I (the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain) was compared to nuclear encoded mitochondrial-associated proteins, TIM23 (translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane 23) and frataxin by two independent methods, immunoblot and ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g002">Figure 2B,D</xref>; respectively). A549 cells had increased levels of complex IV subunit I protein when compared to NL20 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g002">Figure 2B–E</xref>). The selective accumulation of mitochondria in A549 cells was not mimicked by other organelles upon analysis of protein expression (ER, calnexin; golgi, syntaxin 6; cytosol, GAPDH) by western blot (data not shown). Additionally, mitochondrial biogenesis markers TFAM (mitochondrial transcription factor A) and PGC1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha) were examined to further investigate mitochondrial mass in the cell lines. Examination of these markers at the gene expression level does not suggest that increases in mitochondrial mass observed in A549 cells are attributed to increased mitochondrial biogenesis.

        <p>As tumor cell lines have previously been shown to be influenced by multidrug resistance transporters (MDR), cells were pre-treated with 50 µM verapamil to block MDR activity during TMRE loading to determine if MDR proteins in the plasma membrane had an effect on TMRE influx. Following oligomycin/CCCP treatment of verapamil treated cells, MDR did not influence the intracellular accumulation of TMRE when compared to non-verapamil treated cells (data not shown); as this fluorescent rhodamine substrate does not accumulate in drug resistant cells. In this study, A549 cells had less change in Δψ<sub>m</sub> as measured by TMRE fluorescence following CCCP treatment and MDR activity does not influence this activity.

        <p>These data suggest that a deficiency in Drp1 protein levels contributes to decreased mitochondrial fission events in A549 cells. FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) was used to quantify mitochondrial connectivity, which infers mitochondrial fission events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Sandebring1">[16]</xref>, in living NL20 and A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g004">Figure 4E–H</xref>). FRAP curves were summarized by calculating the mobile fraction of mitochondrial-directed yellow fluorescent protein (mito-YFP), which estimates mitochondrial connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Sandebring1">[16]</xref>. FRAP experiments confirm that A549 cells have decreased mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g004">Figure 4F–H</xref>). Mobile fraction values show that mitochondria in NL20 cells have significantly lower functional connectivity (more fission) when compared to A549 cells basally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Downregulation of Drp1 by overexpression of a dominant negative version of Drp1 (Drp1 K38A) equilibrated the mitochondrial connectivity between the two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Following Drp1 overexpression (+Drp1-myc), mitochondrial fission is enhanced in A549 cells such that mobile fraction values are more comparable to basal NL20 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045319.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

        <title>Drp1 Localization in A549 Cells</title>
        <p>To further examine decreased Drp1-dependent fission in A549 cells, we looked at Drp1 localization following subcellular fractionation via immunoblot. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were examined for endogenous Drp1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g005">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Drp1 protein was not observed in the mitochondrial fraction of A549 cells suggesting that Drp1 is not actively recruited to the mitochondria for fission. In contrast, NL20 cells showed recruitment of Drp1 to the mitochondrial fraction, which infers mitochondrial fission is occurring in NL20 cells as suggested by the mitochondrial morphological analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g004">4A</xref>) and confirmed by FRAP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g004">Figure 4F–H</xref>). In mammalian cells, Drp1 is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane following apoptotic induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>.

From this observation, we inferred that A549 cells have decreased Drp1 mitochondrial recruitment that can be enhanced by apoptotic stimulation.

Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were examined for cytochrome c release in NL20, NL20TA, Calu1 and A549 cells with and without CCCP-induced uncoupling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045319.s003">Figure S3A</xref>,B). Specifically, A549, the most tumorigenic cell line in this panel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045319.s001">Figure S1</xref>), displayed impairment in cytochrome c release following CCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045319.s003">Figure S3B</xref>,C). STS-treated A549 cells showed a similar lack of cytochrome c release when compared to NL20 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045319.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Immunoblots were quantified to show cytochrome c protein levels in fractionation experiments without and with STS-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Under basal and STS conditions, A549 cells had increased cytochrome c protein levels in the mitochondrial fraction when compared to NL20 cells. These data suggest A549 cells have decreased Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission and the downstream process of cytochrome c release is impaired. To further support this idea, overexpression of DRP1 in A549 cells rescued STS-treatment induced release cytochrome c in this cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g005">Figure 5E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045319.s003">Figure S3C</xref>) demonstrating that impaired cytochrome c release observed in A549 cells is due to a deficiency in Drp1. Expected mitochondrial morphological phenotypes were observed following STS-treatment and in combination with Drp1-myc overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045319.s005">Figure S5</xref>), supporting the cytochrome c release immunoblot data in NL20 and A549 cells.</p>

        <title>Impaired Mitophagy in A549 Cells</title>
        <p>There is a relationship between mitochondrial fission and the induction of mitochondrial selective autophagy, also known as mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Twig2">[31]</xref>. During mitophagy, the pre-autophagosome engulfs mitochondria to form an autophagosome. Concurrently, the cytosolic protein microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-I, 18 kDa) is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3-II, 16 kDa) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Tanida1">[32]</xref>. LC3-II is then recruited to autophagosomal membranes prior to fusion with the lysosome, which then proteolytically degrades autophagosomal internal components including LC3-II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Tanida1">[32]</xref>. As such, lysosomal turnover of the autophagosomal marker LC3-II reflects autophagic events, such as mitochondrial selective degradation by autophagy, and detecting LC3 by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence is the standard for monitoring autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Twig1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Klionsky1">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that defects in mitochondrial fission decrease mitochondrial degradation or mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Twig1">[11]</xref>. Autophagy was assessed by immunoblot and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We monitored steady state LC3-I to LC3-II conjugation by immunoblotting for endogenous LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Thomas1">[20]</xref>. Less LC3-II conjugate was observed in untreated A549 cells when compared to NL20 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g007">Figure 7B–D</xref>), which suggests basal autophagy is decreased in A549 cells relative to NL20 cells. Serum starvation, which induces autophagy, was used as a positive control. No significant difference in the amount of LC3-II following serum starvation was observed between NL20 and A549 cell lines following serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, EBSS), suggesting that A549 cells possess the functional capacity for autophagy. Cells were also treated with Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which prevents lysosomal degradation and results in the increased accumulation of LC3-II and autophagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Thomas1">[20]</xref>. NL20 cells showed efficient autophagic flux as demonstrated by the presence of more LC3-II banding than LC3-I following BafA1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Because the level of LC3-II is not greater than LC3-1 in BafA1 treated A549 cells, A549 does not show efficient autophagic flux and we can infer that autophagy is impaired prior to degradation by the lysosome in this cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). To further support this data an LC3 turnover assay was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g007">Figure 7A</xref>; lanes 4,8), which combines serum starvation and lysosomal inhibition to monitor flux <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Mizushima1">[34]</xref>. A complete turnover of LC3-II was noted in NL20 cells, whereas A549 cells had similar LC3-II expression levels as observed with only Bafilomcyin treatment. These results further support autophagy being limited in A549 cells. To confirm this observation in another technique, autophagosomes were noted by the detection of LC3 punctae and mitophagy was inferred by the colocalization of LC3 punctae with mito-YFP expression using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). A significant difference in the percentage of cells with &lt;6 mitochondrial localized LC3 punctae was identified between basal and CCCP-treated A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). This observation shows that depolarization of the mitochondria after CCCP treatment does not significantly induce mitophagy in A549 cells. However, following Drp1 overexpression in A549 cells and subsequent treatment with CCCP, the percentage of cells undergoing mitophagy increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). These data suggest that A549 cells have impaired mitophagy.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, A549 cells displayed elongated mitochondrial phenotypes basally and hyperfused mitochondria following downregulation of Drp1, consistent with phenotypes observed in cells that are deficient in mitochondrial fission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Mopert1">[35]</xref>. Additional similarities to cells lacking Drp1 were noted in A549 cells, such as resistance to mitochondrial depolarization and impaired cytochrome c release from the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>. Drp1 activity can be altered by mitochondrial recruitment, post-translational modification and its oligomerization state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>. This study shows decreased expression and recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondrial fractions in A549 cells relative to non-tumorigenic NL20 cells, and decreased Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission. Drp1 associates with mitochondrial fission sites upon oligomerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>. Because Drp1 was observed in mitochondrial fractions following apoptotic stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045319-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>), we presumed Drp1 oligomerization was intact in A549 cells. To determine if phosphorylation of Drp1 was involved in the observed inhibition of mitochondrial fission in A549 cells, we examined the phosphorylation status DRP1 in both A549 and NL20 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045319.s006">Figure S6</xref>). We noted a significant increase in the phosphorylation of Drp1 in A549 cells, which would inhibit GTPase activity and subsequent fission events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>. This phosphorylation data supports the hypothesis that A549 cells have decreased mitochondrial fission.</p>
      <p>Defects in mitochondrial dynamics have been implicated in numerous degenerative neurological disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Chen2">[36]</xref>. The disruption of an antagonistic response by Drp1 in mitochondrial dynamics could potentially impact many key cellular events, such as development, apoptosis, autophagy, synaptic plasticity and cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Chang1">[37]</xref>. Extensive cross-talk exists between autophagy and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Maiuri1">[38]</xref>; in non-tumorigenic cells, the deletion of genes regulating autophagy is associated with decreased apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Boya1">[9]</xref>. Accordingly, alterations in apoptosis and autophagy were observed in tumorigenic A549 cells.</p>
      <p>Efficient removal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy requires fission of the mitochondrial network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Twig1">[11]</xref>. Turnover of damaged mitochondria stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis to replenish each cell with a stable pool of functional mitochondria. With respect to metabolic function, changes in mitochondrial mass can be indicative of mitochondrial proliferative potential or turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Narendra1">[39]</xref>. In A549 cells, we observed an increased mitochondrial mass, which may indicate a lack of mitochondrial degradation by mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-RodriguezEnriquez1">[40]</xref>. We inferred defects in mitophagy by decreased LC3-II protein expression observed in A549 cells. Decreased mitophagy is influenced by Drp1 expression, as mitophagy is rescued in A549 cells following Drp1 overexpression.</p>
      <p>Recent literature supports our findings whereby mitochondria elongate and are spared from autophagic degradation and sustain viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Gomes1">[41]</xref>, purposing that regulated changes in mitochondrial morphology determine the fate of the cell during autophagy. As the role of autophagy in tumor progression and treatment is controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Kimmelman1">[42]</xref>, perhaps regulation of mitochondrial morphology is indeed the determinant factor in the cellular response to autophagy.</p>
      <p>The data presented fit our hypotheses, which suggest that elongated mitochondrial lengths observed in A549 cells correlate with decreased mitochondrial fission events, and subsequent decreases in both apoptotic initiation and autophagy in this tumorigenic cell line. This work is novel in that we have identified defects in mitochondrial dynamics, namely in the mitochondrial fission mediator Drp1, which contribute to tumorigenic conversion in lung cancer cells. To summarize, tumorigenic A549 cells exhibit mitochondrial dynamic imbalances, which downregulate pro-apoptotic signaling in these tumorigenic lung epithelial cells allowing deregulated cells to survive. We also demonstrate decreased Drp1 protein expression and increased Drp1 protein phosphorylation in A549 cells, relative to the normal lung epithelial cell line NL20, which allows substandard mitochondria to accumulate causing defects in mitochondrial clearance, which potentially impacts further mitochondrial function and tumorigenesis.</p>
      <p>Decreased Drp1 expression and activity observed in A549 cells could be due to transcriptional regulation. Drp1-dependent fission has been shown to be inhibited by miR-30 family members through suppression of its modifier, the <italic>p53 tumor suppressor</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Li1">[43]</xref>. It is noteworthy that A549 cells express the wild-type version of <italic>p53</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Lehman1">[44]</xref> and p53 protein expression in these cells is not statistically different from NL20 cells (data not shown). In addition to post-transcriptional gene silencing, other RNA polymerase modifiers may be regulating Drp1 gene transcription and subsequent activity.</p>
      <p>Other possible hypotheses of Drp1 regulation include further post-translational modifications. As we have inferred, like others have demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Cribbs1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Chang2">[46]</xref>, Drp1 mediated fission is negatively regulated by phosphorylation. Drp1 function has also been shown to be modulated in part by calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Sandebring1">[16]</xref>. Tumorigenic A549 cells could potentially have decreased phosphatase enzymatic activity or constitutively active Drp1 phosphorylation, both of which would limit GTP-dependent mitochondrial fission. Moreover, sumoylation of Drp1 has been shown to positively regulate its activity and mitochondrial morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Harder1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Zunino1">[48]</xref>. Downregulation of sumoylation players may also putatively inhibit mitochondrial fission in tumorigenic cells. Drp1 is also modified by ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045319-Suen1">[5]</xref>, a process that targets the protein for destruction. This modification could potentially influence the turnover of Drp1, which might explain the significant decrease in protein expression observed in A549 cells when compared to controls.</p>
      <p>Future studies in A549 cells will examine the influence of Drp1 modifiers including the cristae-remodeling pathway, controlled in part by Opa1, on the downstream processes of mitochondrial dynamics, autophagy and apoptosis in tumorigenic lung epithelial cells.</p>

          <p><bold>Analysis of Drp1 phosphorylation.</bold> (A) Cell lysates from NL20 and A549 cells were separated by phospho-enrichment (P; lanes 1,3) and compared to total lysates (T; lanes 2,4). With immunoblot, endogenous Drp1 was found in both phospho- and total fractions. Immunoblotting for Drp1 pSer637 was also included. Controls for purification include immunoblotting for non-phosphorylated HSP60 and phosphorylated HTRA2. Markers in kDa. (B) The ratio of phospho- to total Drp1 was quantified (B) from two independent experiments between the two cell lines. Mean and SEM shown. T-test analysis (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0071).</p>
