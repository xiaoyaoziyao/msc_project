      <abstract>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that chemotactic factor stromal-cell derived factor 1α (SDF1α) promotes cell recovery from hypoxic injury via its main receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type (CXCR) 4. However, the role of its new receptor CXCR7 on cell repair against hypoxia and cell response to SDF1α remains largely unknown. In this study, neurons induced from hippocampal progenitor cells were pre-conditioned in hypoxia for 4h and subsequently monitored to investigate the function of SDF1α on cell repair after hypoxia. Neurons were assessed for their cell morphology, actin filament polymerization and migration capability. SDF1α protein levels increased significantly 1 h after hypoxia compared to control (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01), and it reached a peak at 24 h after hypoxia. Moreover, addition of SDF1α promoted neurite outgrowth and actin filament polymerization both in normoxic and hypoxic cells compared to untreated cells. Cell migration showed a time-dependent increase with SDF1α stimulation in both groups, and hypoxic cells illustrated a significant augment at 0.5 h, 1 h and 12 h after SDF1α application compared to normoxic cells (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). CXCR7 expression also increased with time dependence after hypoxia and demonstrated a two-fold upregulation compared to control at 24 h after hypoxia. With CXCR7 silencing, axon elongation and actin filament polymerization induced by SDF1α were inhibited sharply both in normoxic and hypoxic cells. CXCR7 silencing also leads to reduced hypoxic cell migration at 0.5 h, 1 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h after SDF1α application (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01), but it failed to reduce normoxic cell migration induced by SDF1α at 0.5 h, 1 h and 12 h (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). 24 h SDF1α stimulation led to higher ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared to control, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation increased more in hypoxic cells than that in normoxic cells. This study suggested that CXCR7 plays an important role on cell repair processing induced by SDF1α, and CXCR7 silencing attenuates cell adaptive response to acute SDF1α stimulation (≤12 h) after hypoxia.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that neurons are able to withstand hypoxia by triggering endogenous survival and neuroprotective pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Feast1">[1]</xref>. These processes are always related to the recruitment of modulators that trigger some events promoting repair mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Wang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Timotijevic1">[3]</xref>. Recent studies have illustrated that a chemokine stromal cell derived factor 1α (SDF1α) is up-regulated in bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells and synovial fibroblast cells to fulfill its role on cell protection against hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Liu1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Hitchon1">[5]</xref>. It increases neuron survival and protects them from hypoxia-induced cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Gillard1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Meucci1">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, neural chemokine SDF1α mediates axon elongation and neurite growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Opatz1">[8]</xref>. SDF1α may serve as a protective factor to promote cell repair after hypoxia, however, the exact effect of SDF1α on cell repair after hypoxia is still unclear.</p>
      <p>Many studies have shown that SDF1α binds to C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) to exert its role on neurite outgrowth and cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Opatz1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Ma1">[9]</xref>. This view was challenged with the discovery that the orphan receptor RDC1, now designated as CXCR7 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 7), is also able to bind SDF1α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Balabanian1">[10]</xref>. Many lines of evidence indicate that CXCR7 has an important role in regulating cell signaling in culture and in vivo. However, the function of CXCR7 in neurons toward SDF1α is under intense debate. While some reports have suggested that CXCR7 is necessary to regulate CXCR4 protein levels, thereby adapting chemokine responsiveness in migrating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-SanchezAlcaniz1">[11]</xref>, other studies indicate that CXCR4 and CXCR7 have distinct roles and signal transduction in regulating interneuron movement and laminar positioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Wang2">[12]</xref>. These results, along with similar observations in other tissues, led to the notion that CXCR7 modulates the effects of SDF1α by regulating chemokine gradients or counteracting with CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Levoye1">[13]</xref>. Nevertheless, analysis of CXCR7 function is limited to studies that demonstrate its function in normoxic culture conditions. The exact mechanisms involved in cellular response to SDF1α after hypoxia still require further investigation. Recently, CXCR7 has been shown to activate MAP kinases in transfected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Rajagopal1">[14]</xref>. Additionally, a study showed that SDF1α mediates some signaling upon binding to CXCR7, leading to an increase in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Kumar1">[15]</xref>. This leads to a plausible hypothesis that ERK1/2 may be involved in the cellular response to SDF1α-CXCR7 axis after hypoxic stimulation.</p>
      <p>Here we have investigated the function of chemokine SDF1α on hippocampal cell repair after hypoxia by determining cell morphology, actin filament polymerization and migration capability. We found that CXCR7 silencing attenuates these processes by decreasing cell responsiveness to acute SDF1α stimulation. Moreover, ERK1/2 phosphorylation increased with SDF1α stimulation after hypoxia, whereas ERK1/2 phosphorylation decreased by pre-treatment with CXCR7 ShRNA. Thus, CXCR7 may trigger cell signaling in order to fulfill its role in modulating cellular response to SDF1α.</p>

        <title>Cell Harvesting and Culture</title>
        <p>Primary hippocampal progenitor cells were obtained from newborn SD rats as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Brewer1">[16]</xref>. Briefly, animals were euthanized under anesthesia. Bilateral hippocampi were carefully dissected on a cold stage and digested in 0.25% trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 5 min. Then the cells were collected and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The precipitant cells were gathered, washed and inoculated into culture plates at a density of 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in serum-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 2% B27, 20 ng/ml bFGF, 20 ng/ml EGF, kept in an incubator at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> fully humidified atmosphere and fed half-fresh medium every 3 days. After about 7 days, the progenitor cells grew into ﬂoating neurospheres. These were mechanically separated into single cells and then passaged every 7 days. On passage 3, fetal bovine serum was added to the medium, and then the neurospheres adhered to the bottom of the culture dish and differentiated into neurons or glia-like cells. To further reduce growth of non-neuronal cells, cytosine arabinoside (AraC, 1 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cultures within 24 h of plating. The single cells were incubated for 7 days to get the mature hippocampal neurons. On the seventh day of culturing, the neurons underwent hypoxia with 3% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 92% N<sub>2</sub> for 4 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Wang3">[17]</xref>. After the hypoxic period, the neuronal cells were returned to the original normoxic culture conditions at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air to carry out experiments at different culture times.</p>

This optimal concentration was determined by a migration assay with normoxic cells stimulated by SDF1α at varying doses (1, 25, 50, 100 ng/ml) for 30 min (data not shown). Before migration testing, cells were divided into four parts with different treatments followed by SDF1α stimulation: (1) cells treated with hypoxia, (2) cells treated with CXCR7 ShRNA, (3) cells treated with CXCR7 ShRNA followed by hypoxia, and (4) cells left untreated. Cells seeded in the top chambers were incubated for 0.5, 1, 12, 24 and 36 hours with SDF1α stimulation, respectively. Then, non-migrating cells were removed from the top chamber, and migrated cells were fixed in methanol and stained with 2% toluidine. The number of cells that had migrated to the underside of the insert membranes was calculated by counting six random independent fields.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have used hippocampal cells cultured in vitro as a model system to investigate the function of atypical chemokine receptor CXCR7 in cellular response to SDF1α after pre-conditioning in hypoxia. We found that CXCR7 is required in hippocampal cells to regulate cell adaptive functions with chemokine SDF1α stimulation, including cell morphology, actin filament polymerization and migration capability. However, these functions emerge as significant properties of hypoxic cells, because the interference of CXCR7 altered cell migration ability in hypoxic cells much more than in normoxic cells. These results provide a clear demonstration that an atypical chemokine receptor can modulate cell response to classical chemokine SDF1α after hypoxia.</p>

Thus, SDF1α seems to be involved in cell adaptive changes to acute hypoxia but not to chronic hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Schneider1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results have shown that 24 h application of SDF1α repaired neurite outgrowth and neural network damaged by hypoxia. We also found that SDF1α may change or recombine cell cytoskeleton by increasing actin filament polymerization, thus resulting in cell adaptive survival after hypoxia. This is consistent with previous studies that SDF1α improves neurite outgrowth and axon elongation in corticospinal tract axons and cultured cerebellar granule neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Arakawa1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Tanaka1">[26]</xref>. Drastic changes in neuronal shape occur immediately after the exit of neuronal cells from mitotic cycles during embryonic and postnatal development. Thus, it is conceivable that SDF1α might be necessary for reparative capabilities after hypoxia as a mitogen and potential target for morphogenesis and neuroprotective strategies.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that SDF1α increases the motility of upper rhombic lip cells and promotes the migration of granule cell progenitors and interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Yu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Lysko1">[28]</xref>. However, whether SDF1α could affect cell migration under hypoxic conditions still needs further investigation. A recent study illustrated that SDF1α could direct the migration of neural progenitor cells under hypoxic circumstances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Xu1">[29]</xref>, and guide migration after focal cerebral ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Robin1">[30]</xref>. Our observations suggested that SDF1α enhanced cell migration especially when cells were treated with hypoxia. Though our observations provided evidence that cells have a high sensitivity to respond to SDF1α at early stages after hypoxia, we still wonder if it is hypoxia or SDF1α that mainly increased cell migration.</p>
      <p>It has been shown that CXCR7 is expressed in most neurons of human brain cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Shimizu1">[31]</xref>. In the embryonic rat cortex numerous cells also express CXCR7, which is found to be very abundant in neurons forming the cortical plate during initial stages of corticogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-SanchezAlcaniz1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Wang2">[12]</xref>. In our work we found CXCR7 was expressed in hippocampal cells and was increased significantly with application of SDF1α for 24 hours. Indeed, CXCR7 is evenly distributed in DRG neurons both at early and at late stages of cultivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Opatz1">[8]</xref>. Moreover, previous studies have suggested that hypoxic preconditioning increases CXCR7 expression in mesenchymal stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Liu2">[32]</xref>, and only CXCR7 activity was functionally linked to survival signaling in mouse neural progenitor cell cultures during hypoxia exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Bakondi1">[33]</xref>. In our experiments, both CXCR7 positive cells and CXCR7 protein expression increased at 12 h after hypoxia. CXCR7 expression in the brain has been shown to increase after stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Schonemeier1">[34]</xref>, and seems to exert a prominent role in the immediate regulation of cell transduction pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Sengupta1">[35]</xref>. Thus it is possible that CXCR7 might be necessary for cell adaptive functions after hypoxia.</p>
      <p>Our work showed no significant difference between untreated cells and CXCR7 ShRNA transfected cells with acute stimulation of SDF1α, but a remarkable difference was shown after 24 h application of SDF1α. This result was partly consistent with a study in which CXCR7 is involved in neuronal cell migration of rat forebrain, independent of the main receptor CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Tiveron1">[36]</xref>, and CXCR7 mutants also show a reduced rate of interneuron migration and laminar positioning defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Wang2">[12]</xref>. This suggests that CXCR7 may be necessary, but not sufficient for cell migration, as pre-treatment of CXCR7 ShRNA could not block the time-dependent promotion of SDF1α until 24 hours later.</p>
      <p>Indeed, CXCR7 was necessary for survival signaling in mouse neural progenitor cells during hypoxic exposure. A recent study suggests that down-regulation of CXCR7 results in reduced interneuron responsiveness to SDF1α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Wang2">[12]</xref>. Our observations showed that CXCR7 silencing caused neurite outgrowth defects and migration capacity decline significantly. Taken together with previous data, we found that hypoxia increased cell responsiveness to acute SDF1α stimulation, but this responsiveness was abrogated by pretreatment with CXCR7 ShRNA. These results mentioned above strongly suggested that CXCR7 was critical and required in cell response to available SDF1α, thereby modulating neurite outgrowth and cell migration.</p>
      <p>The ERK1/2 signaling pathway is critical for cell survival and migration. Previous studies have shown that Raf/ERK up-regulation enhances the migration of cultured cortical and cerebellar granule cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Bakondi1">[33]</xref>, and that the ERK1/2 pathway is involved in neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity and cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Yang1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Ortega1">[38]</xref>. As a mitogen and chemokine, SDF1α induces ERK1/2 activation in activated T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Reichardt1">[39]</xref>. Our results, consistent with these studies, also showed a significant increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by 24 h SDF1α stimulation.</p>
      <p>A recent study showed that hypoxia induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Kremer1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Lin1">[41]</xref>, which is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis in hippocampal cells during hypoxia exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Biswas1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-Hota1">[43]</xref>. In our work, we also found phosphorylated ERK1/2 increased significantly after hypoxia. Stimulation with SDF1α strongly promotes the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in migrating interneurons, but fails to elicit phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in cells obtained from CXCR7 mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055290-SanchezAlcaniz1">[11]</xref>. Thus we wondered whether CXCR7 was involved in ERK1/2 phosphorylation activated by SDF1α after hypoxia. Our data using cultures of hippocampal cells supported this hypothesis. We found that ERK1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited after CXCR7 silencing, either with treatment of hypoxia or SDF1α stimulation. Thus, it is conceivable that SDF1α, acting through its receptor CXCR7, increased cell adaptive function via activation of ERK1/2.</p>
      <p>We believe that our findings may have important implications to repair cell function after hypoxia. CXCR7 has been involved in multiple steps induced by SDF1α stimulation, including neurite outgrowth, actin filament polymerization and cell migration. If one important function of CXCR7 is to alter cell response toward SDF1α, as reported here, then modulating this receptor may contribute to repair activities from hypoxia. While we show effects between control cultures in approximately 20% oxygen and the hypoxia treated cells, however, caution must be exercised in extending the observations to in vivo responses to low oxygen levels (e.g. 3% Oxygen), which is close to physiological levels within tissues of an intact organism.</p>
