<abstract>
<p>Understanding the implications of different management strategies is necessary to identify best conservation trajectories for ecosystems exposed to anthropogenic stressors. For example, science-based risk assessments at large scales are needed to understand efficacy of different vector management approaches aimed at preventing biological invasions associated with commercial shipping. We conducted a landscape-scale analysis to examine the relative invasion risk of ballast water discharges among different shipping pathways (e.g., Transoceanic, Coastal or Domestic), ecosystems (e.g., freshwater, brackish and marine), and timescales (annual and per discharge event) under current and future management regimes. The arrival and survival potential of nonindigenous species (NIS) was estimated based on directional shipping networks and their associated propagule pressure, environmental similarity between donor-recipient ecosystems (based on salinity and temperature), and effects of current and future management strategies (i.e., ballast water exchange and treatment to meet proposed international biological discharge standards). Our findings show that current requirements for ballast water exchange effectively reduce invasion risk to freshwater ecosystems but are less protective of marine ecosystems because of greater environmental mismatch between source (oceanic) and recipient (freshwater) ecoregions. Future requirements for ballast water treatment are expected to reduce risk of zooplankton NIS introductions across ecosystem types but are expected to be less effective in reducing risk of phytoplankton NIS. This large-scale risk assessment across heterogeneous ecosystems represents a major step towards understanding the likelihood of invasion in relation to shipping networks, the relative efficacy of different invasion management regimes and seizing opportunities to reduce the ecological and economic implications of biological invasions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aquatic invasive species are nonindigenous organisms that establish and spread in a new environment, frequently resulting in negative impacts on biodiversity [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], ecological structure and function [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and imperilment of fauna [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As the severity of impacts is influenced by multiple interacting drivers that are difficult to predict, prevention through vector management has often been cited as the best conservation strategy [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite these recommendations, little attention has been directed at understanding efficacy of different vector management approaches, particularly at landscape scales, impeding the progress of science-based regulation and precluding assessments evaluating current and future ecological risk.</p>
<p>The unintentional release of nonindigenous species (NIS) in ballast water moved by transoceanic ships has long been recognized as a primary vector of aquatic invasions [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As a result, many countries have enacted ballast water management at landscape scales (i.e., at the scale of global or national shipping networks; [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) to reduce the risk of species invasion and concomitant ecological change. Currently, the main requirement entails ballast water exchange (BWE), where vessels replace ballast water loaded at a foreign port with offshore oceanic water in an effort to reduce the abundance and diversity of coastal plankton transported between ports, thereby decreasing the likelihood of invasion because the number of individuals discharged in ballast water (propagule pressure) is an important determinant of invasion success [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The efficacy of BWE as a management strategy, however, is highly variable. Empirical studies indicate that BWE purges 70–100% of planktonic organisms entrained at the source port depending on ship type, method and location of exchange, and type of organism [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Ballast water exchange is considered most protective for freshwater recipient ports due to osmotic shock induced by the alternation of marine and fresh waters [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and less effective for vessels conducting coastal exchange (50–200 nautical miles offshore) in comparison to mid-ocean exchange (&gt; 200 nautical miles offshore) since plankton densities can be high in nearshore waters [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, BWE is not a viable option for intra-regional vessels that remain within 50 nautical miles of shore; however, few studies have examined the ecological implications of BWE across landscape scales and global shipping networks involving many permutations of taxa, propagule pressure, and ecological conditions of source and recipient locations.</p>
<p>Due to concerns about limited ecological protection afforded by BWE, pending ratification of an international convention, vessels will soon be required to manage ballast water to meet numeric discharge standards limiting the density of organisms released to recipient ecosystems (the D-2 standards; [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). It is expected that most vessels will install on-board multi-stage treatment systems such as filtration + electro-chlorination [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which are expected to physically remove large particles and chemically inactivate small particles in ballast water to meet the D-2 standards: less than 10 viable organisms ≥ 50 μm in minimum dimension per m<sup>3</sup> (nominally ‘zooplankton’) and less than 10 viable organisms ≥ 10 μm and &lt; 50 μm in minimum dimension per mL (nominally ‘phytoplankton’) [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Since plankton densities can be highly variable after BWE, in theory, treatment should offer risk reduction by consistently reducing plankton density to low levels. In addition, treatment is considered a safer and more broadly applicable management tool for transoceanic, coastal and domestic vessels. Concerns have been raised, however, that the D-2 standards are not stringent enough, as a proportion of ships can meet the standards without any ballast water management [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Further, concerns about the loss of the salinity barrier imposed by BWE have prompted Canadian and American regulators to propose enhanced requirements (BWE plus treatment) for vessels arriving to fresh water.</p>
<p>In general, the probability that a particular species will become established decreases as propagule pressure decreases [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], however, invasions are a stochastic process and the shape of the propagule pressure-establishment relationship is highly context-dependent [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The relationship is further complicated by the wide range of possible combinations of the number of individuals released per event, the frequency of release events, and the specific physical-chemical requirements and ecological interactions between arriving propagules and the recipient community [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As a result, it has not been possible to allocate a numeric invasion probability with confidence for specific inoculum densities. Even though the relative importance of different combinations has not been quantified, it has been postulated that invasion success is greater for multiple release events over time and space than for single, high-density releases, since repeated introductions may allow founding populations to overcome stochastic demographic and environmental limitations [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Using a mechanistic approach, the objective of this study is to evaluate the relative invasion risk to diverse ecosystems at landscape scales (i.e., across different directional shipping networks arriving to freshwater, brackish, and marine ports in Canada and the Laurentian Great Lakes) in relation to current and proposed vector management regimes. We estimate potential for arrival and survival of NIS and the change in these metrics anticipated under future requirements for ballast water treatment, recognizing that relative invasion risk is dependent on both the density of NIS carried by individual ships and the cumulative arrival of ships across time.</p>

<title>Estimating NIS arrival potential</title>
<p>A comprehensive database of the number and volume of ballast water discharges by merchant vessels (≥50m length with ballast capacity ≥8 m<sup>3</sup>) at ports in Canada and the Great Lakes was compiled using data extracted and cross-referenced from multiple Canadian and American government sources [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Because data were not available for the same year in all regions, comparative analyses were conducted using a 12-month time frame of recent data (2006, 2007 or 2008), representing an annual estimate of the arrival potential of NIS. Merchant vessels were grouped into geographic pathways based on their region(s) of operation (<xref rid="pone.0118267.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0118267.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Biological data (density, diversity, biogeographic status of species in ballast water) were obtained from coordinated surveys conducted by the Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN) and Fisheries and Oceans Canada over three years (2007 to 2009). Standardized protocols were used across the country to assess multiple taxonomic groups (diatoms, dinoflagellates and invertebrates) in ballast water sampled from different shipping pathways [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], including unpublished data from Munawar, Fisheries and Oceans Canada. On average, 40 samples were collected for each region for zooplankton and 20 samples for phytoplankton (<xref rid="pone.0118267.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For the East Coast, ballast water samples were collected in the ports of Sept-Îles, Port Cartier, Baie-Comeau (Quebec), St. John (New Brunswick), Canso, Halifax, Hantsport and Liverpool (Nova Scotia). For the West Coast, ships were sampled at the Port of Vancouver. In the Great Lakes, ships were sampled in Nanticoke, Hamilton (Ontario, Canada) and Toledo (Ohio, United States) [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Ships were selected on an opportunistic basis.</p>

<p>Arrival potential was assessed separately for zooplankton and phytoplankton at two timescales: the number of NIS discharged per event and the cumulative number of NIS discharged per year. Since plankton densities sampled from ballast water displayed high variation across ships within a given pathway, we conducted a simple resampling process to generate a mean arrival potential statistic for each timescale. First, we constructed a probability distribution of the observed density of NIS from tank samples within a given shipping pathway. Next, we randomly selected a density value from the probability distribution, which was multiplied by a randomly selected value of ship discharge volume. The result of this multiplication was one trial of the total number of NIS released to the recipient ecosystem associated with a single shipping event. This process was repeated across all of <italic>n</italic> discharges in a given year, and then across 1000 iterations. The mean value at each timescale represents the average number of NIS discharged (i.e., mean abundance of NIS released per event; mean released cumulatively within a given year). Five categorical bins ranging from lowest to highest arrival potential were created by determining the 20th, 40th, 60th, 80th, and 100<sup>th</sup> percentiles from the entire distribution of values from the resampling process (e.g., for annual arrivals, percentiles were calculated from the 11,000 annual data points calculated for all pathways) [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We utilized the mean arrival values (which are influenced by right-tail skew in the distribution) derived during the Monte Carlo process to assign pathways into the percentile bins because discharges with very high NIS density, although rare, can be very important for invasion success [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>

We focused our analysis on salinity and climate (i.e., water temperature) because these are fundamental variables for the survival and reproduction of aquatic organisms (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and because including additional factors that are related to invasion risk for only a subset of all potential NIS can affect the sensitivity of the environmental similarity measure [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Global annual mean salinity was determined for each coastal source and recipient port using the online World Ocean Atlas database [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], while salinity of inland ports (e.g., Great Lakes ports) was obtained from Keller et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Global ports were classified into salinity categories as follows: 0.0–5.0 parts per thousand (‰) as “fresh water”; 5.1–18.0 ‰ as “brackish”; 18.1 ‰ and higher as “marine”. To reflect the environmental effect of BWE, based on Canadian regulations requiring vessels to exchange ballast water resulting in a minimum final salinity of at least 30 ‰ [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the source salinity was changed to 30 ‰ for all vessel transits that conducted BWE to reflect that the source of the ballast water was no longer from a coastal port, but from the ocean. A matrix approach was used to determine similarity of salinity between all source-recipient pairs [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The score has three metrics and ranged from “lowest” similarity of salinity for a port-pair with highly divergent salinities (e.g., freshwater—marine) to “highest” similarity if both ports had the same salinity classification (e.g., freshwater—freshwater). Following Spalding et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and Keller et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], climate categories were assigned according to latitudinal port position as follows: Tropical (0°–20°N/S), Warm-Temperate (20°–40°N/S), Cold-Temperate (40°–60°N/S), and Polar (&gt;60°N/S). Again a matrix approach was used to determine climate similarity between each source-recipient port-pair. The score has three metrics and ranged from “lowest” climate similarity for a port-pair with highly divergent climates (e.g., Polar-Tropical) to “highest” similarity if both ports were located in the same or adjacent climate category. The overall survival potential for each vessel transit was estimated based on the lowest score of either salinity or climate matching to reflect the influence of the most limiting environmental variable. The final survival potential for each shipping pathway was then assigned the level (highest, intermediate or lowest) having the greatest number of observations across voyages [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

<title>Estimating relative invasion risk</title>
<p>The potentials for arrival and survival were combined into a final relative invasion risk for each pathway using a risk matrix (<xref rid="pone.0118267.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), modified from Chan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The risk was calculated using a 5 (arrivals) x 3 (survivals) matrix that reduces the final ratings to three levels. For example, given a lowest arrival potential and a highest survival potential, the overall introduction potential would be intermediate, because highest survival probabilities are offset by the small number of arriving individuals. Invasion risk was calculated separately for each pathway in each region, considering both annual and per-event arrivals and differential propagule pressures of zooplankton and phytoplankton.</p>

<title>Future invasion risk</title>
<p>Since Canada (and all other countries bound by the international convention, once fully ratified) will soon transition to a new ballast water management regime that is expected to enhance protection against ballast-mediated NIS, we repeated the process of estimating invasion risk using estimates of zooplankton/phytoplankton NIS densities expected after ballast water treatment. The anticipated NIS densities were estimated assuming the proportion of taxa (i.e., NIS vs. other taxa) will remain the same when the total abundance of all organisms is reduced to meet the D-2 standards. In addition, a salinity correction (30 ‰) was applied only for international transits (transoceanic or coastal) arriving to freshwater ports in line with requirements for “BWE plus treatment” on the Great Lakes [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>

<p>Merchant vessels conducted roughly 11,000 ballast water discharge events at 309 Canadian and Great Lakes’ ports, discharging 116,159,585 m<sup>3</sup> of ballast water during the twelve-month period assessed.

<title>Future risk with the IMO D-2 standards</title>
<p>Application of the IMO D-2 standards is expected to decrease abundances of zooplankton NIS for all pathways up to 99% in magnitude (<xref rid="pone.0118267.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). In comparison to the current scenario, all pathways were ranked as lowest future arrival potential for zooplankton NIS on both annual and per event timescales. Although the ten pathways assessed already have mean densities of phytoplankton NIS below the future discharge standard, abundances of phytoplankton NIS may be expected to further decrease from 0.4% to 97% after application of IMO D-2 standards, since the variance in abundance will be reduced (<xref rid="pone.0118267.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, 2D</xref>). In comparison to the current scenario, there are few changes in the ranking of marine international pathways for annual arrival potential (i.e., Atlantic International Coastal U.S. decreases its risk to intermediate), and no rankings change for per-event scenarios.</p>
<p>With the transition to treatment, rather than BWE, future survival potential based on similarity of salinity and climate is expected to decrease to intermediate for domestic pathways (i.e., Eastern Coastal Domestic) and one international pathway transiting between Canada and U.S. (i.e., Atlantic International Coastal U.S.) (data not shown). Again, the survival potential is driven by salinity of source-recipient locations. In the future scenario, where BWE is no longer required for vessels arriving to marine ports, environmental similarity decreases since many of the source ports are freshwater (see supplementary information, <xref rid="pone.0118267.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>, Raw data used for the relative invasion risk assessment).</p>

In comparison to the current scenario, the final relative invasion risk for zooplankton NIS decreased for seven pathways, but for phytoplankton NIS, decreased for only one pathway (Eastern Coastal Domestic).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present relative risk framework incorporates NIS arrival and survival metrics to generate a landscape-scale portrait of the relative invasion risk across freshwater and marine ecosystems in Canada and the Great Lakes under current and future management regimes. Our findings show that current requirements for BWE reduce invasion risk to freshwater ecosystems, but are less effective in reducing risk to marine ecosystems because of greater environmental mismatch between source (oceanic) and recipient (freshwater) ecoregions. Future requirements for ballast water treatment are expected to reduce risk of zooplankton NIS introductions across ecosystem types but may be less effective in reducing risk of phytoplankton NIS. The proposed requirement for BWE plus treatment for vessels arriving to freshwater ports in the Great Lakes is expected to maintain very low survival potential of introduced organisms while systematically reducing propagule pressure; these expected benefits are supported by recent empirical tests [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
<p>This risk assessment indicates that international transoceanic ships show lowest invasion risk in the Great Lakes. Given that arrival potential by this pathway was similar or greater than that of all other pathways, our model confirms that the salinity mismatch induced by BWE is highly protective of this freshwater region [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast, our model illustrates that domestic shipping (Lakers) can pose very high risk by facilitating secondary transfers of NIS, which can introduce novel genotypes in established populations, leading to greater impacts of NIS [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and patterns of dispersal that extend beyond a natural baseline.</p>
<p>The present model indicates the importance of short-sea coastal pathways on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts (currently exempt from BWE due to geographic proximity of ports), which appear to transport large numbers of NIS into Canadian marine waters at both timescales. Although, this pathway operates within a limited geographic extent, several source ports are considered primary introduction areas or “hotspots” (i.e., Great Bay, New Hampshire or Puget Sound, Washington) [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], with a high number of NIS that could be secondarily transported to Canadian ports. In both North America and Europe, recent studies have also pointed to coastal traffic as a critical vector introducing NIS [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p>
<p>The model in the present study also reveals a high environmental similarity between source and recipient ports located along ocean coasts which are linked by pathways with global ports. This environmental similarity analysis is restricted to fundamental variables such as salinity and temperature in contrast with previous species-specific risk assessments. Using these two variables (salinity and climate as temperature proxy), we found that more than 80% of comparisons have highest environmental match. Over the coming century, sea surface warming at high latitudes is estimated to increase the level of environmental match between ports [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Consequently, an increase in shipping traffic connecting regions with high environmental match will expose regions of Canada to a larger number of NIS with high probability to establish populations, especially as a result of climate change.</p>
<p>This risk assessment suggests that shipping pathways managed by BWE do not necessarily exhibit lower risk than pathways without BWE; in part due to the number of transits—pathways with lower mean abundances of NIS can still pose a higher risk if there are many individual vessel transits. As noted in the introduction, the effect of BWE can be highly variable across individual ship transits [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In fact, in some studies BWE appears to have increased the risk of introduction potential of NIS, particularly for phytoplankton on the northwest Atlantic coast (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118267.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Roy et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] also reported that diversity of phytoplankton NIS was higher on ships that had undertaken BWE, with some species being of oceanic origin. Similarly, on the Pacific coast, Cordell et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported that BWE had no significant influence on coastal zooplankton species, but increased the abundance of oceanic zooplankton species. Causes for BWE inefficiency may include structural limitations inside ballast tanks that restrict exchange of water, or offshore transport of coastal taxa [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Additionally, enforcement efforts (e.g. ballast water logs inspection, salinity measurements, salt flushing) are considerably lower for Canada’s marine coasts compared with the Great Lakes region [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Our future risk projections indicate that ballast water treatment at the level of the D-2 standards will dramatically reduce arrival potential for zooplankton NIS for all pathways in all regions but will have a lesser effect on arrival potential for phytoplankton NIS (reducing expected abundances of NIS for only five pathways). Hence, these results could be an indication that phytoplankton standards may not be as robust as zooplankton standards. According to the best available science at the time of drafting the D-2 standards, the limit for phytoplankton was set three orders of magnitude lower than the mean density observed in unmanaged ballast water while for zooplankton the limit was set two orders of magnitude lower [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The apparent dichotomy in our efficacy projections may be because our risk assessment evaluates the probability of NIS being introduced, whereas the D-2 standard does not discriminate between nonindigenous and more cosmopolitan taxa. In addition, recent advances in methods for the sampling and analysis of ballast water samples may have resulted in a shift of median plankton densities observed, compared to studies completed more than a decade ago. Evaluating the appropriateness of any particular ballast water discharge standard is a management exercise that involves risk tolerance, and is beyond the scope of this scientific risk assessment. The take home message of our analysis therefore should be that transition from BWE to treatment will result in improved protection against aquatic NIS across ecosystems and shipping pathways, with greater risk reduction expected for zooplankton as compared to phytoplankton.</p>
<p>The results presented in this research are based on recent shipping patterns and environmental metrics; any changes to one or both factors will lead to changes in relative invasion risk. Efforts to increase trade and shipping traffic would result in higher propagule arrival and could establish new connections with global source ports sharing high environmental similarity with recipient ports. Further, climate change scenarios predict both thermal and physical changes that could impact analyses of environmental similarity between source-recipient port-pairs. A reanalysis of environmental similarity between donor and recipient port-pairs, using environmental variables projected under climate change scenarios, may be useful to further refine predictions of future invasion risk [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p>
<p>Although biological invasions are highly stochastic, quantifying the arrival and survival of nonindigenous propagules across heterogeneous ecosystems represents a major step towards understanding the likelihood of invasion in relation to shipping networks, the relative efficacy of invasion management regimes, and seizing opportunities to reduce the ecological and economic implications of species invasion. Large-scale models assessing the invasion process can provide a general framework in order to better predict potential success of invading species [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] by including stochastic events [<xref rid="pone.0118267.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].
