Interactions between viruses and their hosts impact several important biological processes in the world's oceans such as horizontal gene transfer, microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycling. Interrogation of microbial metagenomic sequence data collected as part of the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Expedition (GOS) revealed a high abundance of viral sequences, representing approximately 3% of the total predicted proteins. Cluster analyses of the viral sequences revealed hundreds to thousands of viral genes encoding various metabolic and cellular functions. Quantitative analyses of viral genes of host origin performed on the viral fraction of aquatic samples confirmed the viral nature of these sequences and suggested that significant portions of aquatic viral communities behave as reservoirs of such genetic material. Distributional and phylogenetic analyses of these host-derived viral sequences also suggested that viral acquisition of environmentally relevant genes of host origin is a more abundant and widespread phenomenon than previously appreciated. The predominant viral sequences identified within microbial fractions originated from tailed bacteriophages and exhibited varying global distributions according to viral family. Recruitment of GOS viral sequence fragments against 27 complete aquatic viral genomes revealed that only one reference bacteriophage genome was highly abundant and was closely related, but not identical, to the cyanomyovirus P-SSM4. The co-distribution across all sampling sites of P-SSM4-like sequences with the dominant ecotype of its host, <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> supports the classification of the viral sequences as P-SSM4-like and suggests that this virus may influence the abundance, distribution and diversity of one of the most dominant components of picophytoplankton in oligotrophic oceans. In summary, the abundance and broad geographical distribution of viral sequences within microbial fractions, the prevalence of genes among viral sequences that encode microbial physiological function and their distinct phylogenetic distribution lend strong support to the notion that viral-mediated gene acquisition is a common and ongoing mechanism for generating microbial diversity in the marine environment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science, and Office of Biological and Environmental Research (DE-FG02-02ER63453), the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Discovery Channel and the J.

Sequencing of <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> and <italic>Synechococcus</italic> phage genomes has led to exciting new revelations about the extent of lateral gene transfer between viruses and their hosts.

origin, i.e. those originating from autonomous viral particles or viable and/or remnant prophages, from the overwhelming majority of microbial sequences. The metagenomic data generated from the microbial fraction of water samples was examined for the presence of viral sequences by comparison to the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database. A sequence was given a viral assignment only if the top BLAST homolog was a protein whose origin was clearly attributed to a virus. This analysis resulted in the identification 154,662 viral peptide sequences, 79.3% of which belonged to a multiple sequence assembly scaffolds that were taxonomically assigned as viral. Viral sequences having only their top BLAST hit (E-value≤1e-10) to known viral proteins (the minimum criterion for viral sequence definition) comprised the largest percentage of viral sequences (53.6%), while sequences that had their top 4, 3 and 2 BLAST hits to known viral sequences were 26.1%, 7.0% and 13.2% of the total respectively. Based on this criterion, viral sequences represented approximately 3% of the predicted proteins contained within the GOS microbial dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Yooseph1">[39]</xref>. Taking into account that viral genes predicted within metagenomic data and cultured bacteriophage genomes have been shown to share a greater degree of similarity with bacterial rather than viral genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Breitbart3">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Rohwer1">[44]</xref>,we believe that the number of viral sequences identified within the microbial size fraction is largely underestimated. This is due to the conservative method used to separate the mixture of microbial and viral data and to the relatively limited representation of marine phage genomes in the public sequence databases.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Classification of viral sequences through protein clustering</title><p>We used a sequence similarity-based clustering of proteins from the GOS dataset and previous public protein datasets to assign putative protein function, explore diversity of protein families and measure the degree of novelty added by the GOS sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Yooseph1">[39]</xref>. Included in this analysis were the 154,662 viral peptide sequences described here. Of these, 117,123 (76%) fell within 380 protein clusters containing at least twenty sequences. The remaining 24% of sequences were contained within clusters with less than twenty members. The average cluster contained 258 peptide sequences and clusters ranged in size from 20 to 3,020 peptides. Protein cluster membership was useful to assess the accuracy and potential function of viral sequences described above and to also understand the evolutionary history of these proteins.</p><p>We only considered viral sequences from the GOS dataset that had top BLAST hits to known viral proteins, although many exceeded this criterion (i.e. had multiple BLAST hits to known viruses). The great majority of clustered viral sequences were most similar to known bacteriophage, with smaller representation from eukaryotic viruses (89% total) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001456-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001456.s011">Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001456.s012">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001456.s013">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001456.s014">S5</xref>), indicating that the majority of sequences identified here as viral were clustered in a fashion consistent with this taxonomic assignment.

Previous metagenomic investigations of aquatic viral communities have primarily focused on the viral-sized fraction of water samples with the exception of Delong et al. (2006) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-DeLong1">[37]</xref> and Venter et al. (2004) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Breitbart1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Angly1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Venter1">[40]</xref>. In contrast, this is the first study of significant magnitude to conduct simultaneous exploration of microbial and viral sequence space, within the same size fraction, collected from a global set of aquatic samples. We have presented strong evidence for the significant occurrence and geographically widespread distribution of environmentally important viral genes of host origin in aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, examination of viral sequences residing within the microbial fraction of GOS data revealed novel observations regarding distributional patterns of viral families over significant environmental gradients and potential interactions between highly abundant bacteriophage and host organisms.</p><p>Although viruses are generally much smaller in size than their hosts, there are a number of reasons why viral sequences can be detected within the microbial fraction of seawater. First, viruses exceeding a particular filter size cutoff (generally 0.1 µm–0.22 µm) in particle size will automatically be retained due to their geometry; and such viruses have been identified in increasing numbers through oceanic and freshwater sampling efforts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Claverie1">[51]</xref>. However, despite the presence of viruses capable of infecting diverse groups of eukaryotic hosts, the overwhelming majority of viruses in marine ecosystems are bacteriophages which are generally less than 0.2 µm in size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Wichels1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Borsheim1">[56]</xref>. Many “free-living” phages, or those that are not in physical contact with their host cells, would easily pass through a small pore-size membrane filter. However, phages that are in association with their host cells through either the lytic infection cycle or as prophages are likely to be captured as part of the greater microbial community. Additionally, non-specific interactions between viral particles and the microbes retained on filters may result in the detection of viral DNA on filters, especially as the filters become more loaded with biomass during large volume filtration. Since only a small proportion of GOS viral sequences were prophage-related, it appears that the majority of the viral sequences identified within the microbial fraction of data originated from actively replicating viral particles.</p><p>Viral genome sequencing and targeted amplification studies have led to the important discovery that phage encode environmentally relevant genes of host origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Mann2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan3">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Lindell2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Rohwer1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Millard1">[57]</xref>. The general consensus that has emerged from these previous investigations is that the acquisition of host genes by viruses involved in metabolic processes such as photosynthesis, as well as carbon and phosphate metabolism may provide fitness advantages to the phage by maintaining critical pathways during the infection and replication processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan3">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Lindell1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Millard1">[57]</xref>. Previous studies have focused on the occurrence of specific host-derived viral gene families (primarily <italic>psbA</italic> and <italic>psbD</italic>) within phage isolates and natural viral populations collected from a limited number of geographic locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan3">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Zeidner1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Millard1">[57]</xref>. Prior to this study, nothing was known regarding the prevalence or distribution of viral genes of metabolic significance throughout the world's oceans. Through our analyses of GOS viral sequences, we have provided compelling evidence that environmentally significant viral genes of host origin are not only widely distributed over a vast array of aquatic ecosystems, but that the viruses carrying these genes can comprise significant proportions of aquatic viral communities.</p><p>Our analyses of host-derived viral sequences suggests that viruses likely play a more substantial role in environmentally relevant metabolic processes than previously recognized such as the conversion of light to energy, photoadaptation, phosphate acquisition, and carbon metabolism. Prior to this study, only a very limited number of phage genomes were know to carry the metabolic genes (with the exception of <italic>psbA</italic> and <italic>psbD</italic>) detected in our samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan2">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Mann2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Millard1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Rohwer2">[58]</xref> and limited data existed on their occurrence and distribution in environmental samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan3">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Zeidner1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-DeLong1">[37]</xref>. Quantitative PCR analysis of the host-derived viral genes presented here indicated that these they are not only present in the viral fraction of aquatic samples, but also highly abundant. We are uncertain if the viral genes present in our data were actively expressed at the time of sampling. However, experimental evidence does exist for the expression of viral <italic>psbA</italic> and <italic>hli</italic> genes in culture and viral <italic>psbA</italic> genes in the environment, suggesting that host-derived viral genes actively contribute to host cellular processes in some capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Lindell2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sharon1">[59]</xref>. It is unlikely that we would have observed such a high occurrence and broad geographical distribution of these viral genes if they provided no ecological advantage to the virus, and were simply the result of accidental DNA packaging. Rather, it is hypothesized that viral acquisition, retention, and expression of certain host genes results in an overall increase in fitness by supporting maximal viral replication and potentially expanding host ranges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan3">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Lindell2">[32]</xref>.</p><p>In many cases, analysis of GOS and publicly available viral sequences indicated that the viral sequences had undergone significant evolution since their time of acquisition. Supporting this hypothesis, Zeidner et al. (2005) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Zeidner1">[33]</xref> concluded that cyanophage <italic>psbA</italic> sequences evolve at an increased evolutionary rate compared to cyanobacterial sequences based on models of nucleotide and codon evolution. Furthermore, an in depth analysis of cultured cyanophage and environmental viral <italic>psbA</italic> and <italic>psbD</italic> sequences suggested that these viral genes have diversified since their time of acquisition and potentially serve as a genetic reservoir for their hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan3">[30]</xref>. With the exception of <italic>psbA</italic>, <italic>psbD</italic> and <italic>hli</italic>, little attention has been directed at the detection and phylogenetic analysis of viral gene families of host origin involved in aspects of photosynthesis or other forms of cellular metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan3">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Lindell1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Zeidner1">[33]</xref>. We have observed similar patterns in the phylogenetic distributions of viral <italic>talC</italic> and <italic>pstS</italic> genes as those observed for <italic>psbA</italic> and <italic>psbD</italic> in that viral genes tend to form coherent clusters. As more viral genes of host origin are detected in environmental samples and cultured phage genomes, their evolutionary relationships with host genes should become clearer.</p><p>The ubiquitous distribution of myovirus sequences suggests that these tailed phages are capable of sustaining impressive populations by infecting a diverse range of host cells, distributed over a wide geographic area. Cyanomyophages have been experimentally shown to have broader host ranges than cyanopodo or cyanosiphophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Sullivan3">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, our data indicate that the vast majority of myovirus sequences in the GOS data originated from cyanophages, suggesting that these phages may be partially responsible for the high levels of cyanobacterial diversity observed across GOS samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Rusch2">[41]</xref>. Based on the statistically significant relationship between <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> and the P-SSM4-like phage sequences and estimates of phage infection, our data support the suggestion that P-SSM4-like phages may influence the abundance, distribution and diversity of one of the most dominant components of picophytoplankton in oligotrophic oceans. In contrast, the collective abundance and distributions of GOS podo and siphovirus sequences were significantly lower and more geographically constrained than those attributed to myoviruses, supporting the notion that local geographic conditions influence the composition of viral assemblages in marine ecosystems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Angly1">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Large-scale metagenomic analyses of marine microbial communities have resulted in findings that have substantially increased our understanding of how microbes interact with their environment and the ecological implications of such interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-DeLong1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Yooseph1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Rusch2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Venter2">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Tyson1">[60]</xref>. From a metagenomic standpoint, little attention has been focused on the co-occurrence of microbial and viral communities. Our coincident analysis of the microbial and viral sequences that were generated from the microbial fractions of environmental samples has provided us with a unique global perspective on the nature of (primarily) marine virus-host interactions and has stimulated intriguing questions with respect to the evolutionary trajectories of viruses and their hosts. Metagenomic examination of the viral fraction of samples collected as part of the GOS expedition will no doubt complement the discoveries made to date and will likely stimulate a whole new set of hypotheses on its own. As we continue to explore marine microbial and viral diversity and gene complement, we may need to redefine how we view ocean biodiversity and function.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Sample Collection through Assembly of Sequence Data</title><p>A detailed description of the sampling sites and collection methods included in this study is discussed in Rusch et al. (2007) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Rusch2">[41]</xref>. To summarize, approximately 200 L of seawater was collected from each of 37 new sites along a transect from Halifax, Nova Scotia through the South Pacific Gyre. Although the majority of the samples collected were surface seawater, a few unique samples were collected from environments such as a hypersaline lagoon, a shallow hydrothermal seep and a freshwater lake. Water samples were pre-filtered through a 20 µm nytex screen prior to size fractionation by serial filtration through 3.0 µm, 0.8 µm, and 0.1 µm membrane filters (Pall Life Sciences, East Hills, NY). A separate viral fraction was concentrated by tangential flow filtration (TFF) using a Pellicon housing (Millipore, Bedford, MA) fitted with a Biomax-50 (polyethersulfone) cassette filter (50 Kda pore size). Filters were vacuum sealed with 5 ml of sucrose lysis buffer (20 mM EDTA, 400mM NaCl, 0.75 M Sucrose, 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and frozen at −20°C on the vessel until shipment back to the Venter Institute, where samples were transferred to a −80°C freezer until DNA extraction. Accompanying physical-chemical data was collected with a YSI Model 6600 multiparameter instrument. Detailed methods describing DNA isolation, library construction, template preparation, automated cycle sequencing and metagenomic assembly can be found in Rusch et al. (2007) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Rusch2">[41]</xref> and Venter et al.

However, results described here are based on patterns observed in multiple assemblies. Moreover, as a consequence of the stringent assembly parameters and the remarkable genetic diversity present in the GOS dataset, more than half of the assemblies that were given a “viral” taxonomic assignment (see below) were in fact trivial assemblies consisting of a single read or a pair of mated reads. Instances of specific protein families described in the results were checked to verify that they were distributed approximately uniformly among such trivial assemblies and true scaffolds composed of data from multiple clones. Thus, potential concerns regarding systematic assembly artifacts can be allayed: most if not all of the results described here could be demonstrated independent of the assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Taxonomic Assignment of Scaffolds</title><p>Scaffolds were given taxonomic assignments according to Yooseph et al. (2007) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Yooseph1">[39]</xref>. Briefly, the top four BLAST matches (E-value&lt;1e-10) of GOS ORFs to NCBI nr were considered, the kingdom of origin for each match was determined and the kingdom votes for each scaffold were subsequently pooled. Each ORF on a scaffold contributed up to four votes. ORFs with fewer than four BLAST matches contributed fewer votes and ORFs with no BLAST matches contributed no votes.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Fragment Recruitment</title><p>A detailed description of the fragment recruitment process can be found in Rusch et al. (2007) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Rusch2">[41]</xref>. In brief, a fully sequenced genome or scaffolds from the GOS assembly was used to “recruit” GOS sequence reads in order to determine how similar or different they are with respect to one another. Using the assembled GOS data as the reference, the distribution of deeply covered viral sequences contained within 420 scaffolds longer than 5kb were examined. An example of the BLAST-based information that was generated for all viral scaffolds, including scaffold length (all scaffolds had to be ≥5 kb for further examination), the overall taxonomic assignment of the scaffold (viral or bacterial), and the proportion of all bases that could be attributed to viruses is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001456.s019">Table S10</xref>. All scaffolds that were taxonomically assigned to viruses were subjected to further analysis. In addition, all publicly available, fully sequenced marine phage genomes were used in the recruitment process in order to determine their representation within the GOS dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Protein Clustering and Site Abundance Estimates</title><p>Protein clusters were produced as part of a global protein exploration study and a full description of the clustering process and parameters are detailed in Yooseph et al. (2007) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Yooseph1">[39]</xref>. Briefly, a sequence similarity based clustering of a comprehensive set of known proteins, together with GOS sequences, was used to predict proteins in the GOS data set and to organize sequences into related groups. The clustering utilized similarity over large portions of sequence length, rather than just domains, and length-based thresholds were incorporated to address fragmentary sequences and to minimize grouping of unrelated proteins. The methods to determine site abundance estimates are described in Rusch et al. (2007) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001456-Rusch2">[41]</xref>. Briefly, the scaffolds containing the genes of interest were identified, and a vector representing the number of sequences contributed by every sample was generated per gene.

Sub-groups within each gene family were identified through phylogenetic analysis (neighbor-joining) and manual inspection of the alignments. Consensus sequences, including degenerate positions, were calculated for each sub-group using a PERL script designed for this purpose. Briefly, if the most common nucleotide at an aligned position was prevalent 60% of the time, then it was reported in the consensus. Alternatively, a degenerate code would be reported within the consensus based on the most common two, three, etc…nucleotides at an aligned position. Conserved gap positions within consensus sequences were removed.</p><p>Quantitative PCR (qPCR) primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001456.s017">Table S8</xref>) were designed from the consensus sequences using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, CA). Software parameters, which normally select for the smallest acceptable PCR amplicon in order to maximize PCR efficiency, were also tailored to minimize the number of ambiguous bases. The majority of primers had no more than one ambiguous base. For each qPCR experiment, an oligonucleotide was synthesized that encoded the entire amplicon or the amplicon minus the sequence between the 3′ ends of the two primers for use as standards and positive controls. qPCR experiments were performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), a primer concentration of 500 nM and 10<sup>−2</sup> and 10<sup>−3</sup> dilutions of template DNA (2.5–5.0 ng). Reactions were run on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). PCR amplification conditions included an initial 10 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C, 30 seconds at 54°C and 70 seconds at 72°C, followed by an additional 30 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C and 60 seconds at 60°C. Positive amplification results were only reported if copy number within the template DNA exceeded copy number within the no template (negative) control by a factor of 10 or more. Additionally, positive results were only reported if copy number in the 10<sup>−2</sup> dilution was 3–30 times greater than the 10<sup>−3</sup> dilution. Due to the use of absolute quantification standards, the data are reported as the number of copies per liter of water. Calculations for these values were made using the Sequence Detection System Software.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Data Release</title><p>The 154,662 viral peptide sequences and viral scaffolds discussed in this paper are available for download via the Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Marine Microbial Ecology Research and Analysis (CAMERA) website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.camera.calit2.net/cameraweb/detailPage.htmaccCAM_PUB_Williamson08a" xlink:type="simple">http://web.camera.calit2.net/cameraweb/detailPage.htmaccCAM_PUB_Williamson08a</ext-link>).
