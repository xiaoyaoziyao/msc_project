<abstract>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of complex etiology characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons, particularly in the substantia nigra. Parkin, a tightly regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes the survival of dopaminergic neurons in both PD and Parkinsonian syndromes induced by acute exposures to neurotoxic agents. The present study assessed the potential of cell-permeable parkin (CP-Parkin) as a neuroprotective agent. Cellular uptake and tissue penetration of recombinant, enzymatically active parkin was markedly enhanced by the addition of a hydrophobic macromolecule transduction domain (MTD). The resulting CP-Parkin proteins (HPM<sub>13</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>) suppressed dopaminergic neuronal toxicity in cells and mice exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDH) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). These included enhanced survival and dopamine expression in cultured CATH.a and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells; and protection against MPTP-induced damage in mice, notably preservation of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells with enhanced dopamine expression in the striatum and midbrain, and preservation of gross motor function. These results demonstrate that CP-Parkin proteins can compensate for intrinsic limitations in the parkin response and provide a therapeutic strategy to augment parkin activity in vivo.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. These striking clinical features have focused efforts to understand the mechanisms responsible for neuronal death and reasons why dopaminergic neurons are differentially affected. An extensive literature implicates oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and protein misfolding in disease etiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Exner1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Martin1">[2]</xref>, as illustrated by loss-of-function mutations in genes such as <italic>parkin</italic> (<italic>PARK2</italic>), <italic>PINK1</italic> (<italic>PARK6</italic>) and <italic>DJ-1</italic> (<italic>PARK7</italic>) and by the action of toxic agents that induce Parkinson-like diseases in both animals and man.</p>
<p>The parkin protein, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and catalyzes K48 and K62 linked mono- and poly-ubiquitinations involved in protein turnover and trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Walden1">[3]</xref>. Parkin substrates include proteins known to accumulate in the neurons of parkin knockout mice; although K62-ubiquitination suggests parkin functions extend beyond protein degradation. The PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is activated by mitochondrial depolarization and influences parkin recruitment to distressed mitochondria and their subsequent removal by mitophagy. DJ-1, although associated with diverse functions, appears to play a parallel protective role to that of parkin/PINK1 in oxidative stress response. Agents capable of inducing stable Parkinson-like symptoms include chemical neurotoxins, notably 1-methyl-4-phenyl- 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rotenone and 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA) and α-synuclein, a protein that accumulates in Lewy bodies, a clinical signature of human PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Duty1">[4]</xref>. These agents promote neuronal degeneration/dysfunction through a combination of oxidative stress and mitochondrial respiratory impairment.</p>
<p>Despite the complexity of PD etiology, parkin appears to play a broadly protective role in maintaining neuronal function and viability. These protective effects extend to a variety of neurotoxins, mitochondrial poisons and misfolded proteins including: dopamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Jiang1">[5]</xref>, rotenone and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Rosen1">[6]</xref>, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), excitotoxin (kainic acid) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Staropoli1">[7]</xref>, unfolded protein stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Imai1">[8]</xref>, β-amyloid precursor protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Rosen1">[6]</xref>, Pael receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Imai2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Yang1">[10]</xref>, proteasome inhibitors and α-synuclein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Petrucelli1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-LoBianco1">[12]</xref>. Enforced parkin expression also suppresses pathological consequences of PINK1 and DJ-1 gene deficiencies. PINK1 appears to act upstream of parkin, since PINK1 does not complement parkin deficiency. However, both parkin and PINK1 rescue a fragmented mitochondria phenotype of DJ-1 knockout cells, suggesting PINK1/parkin act in parallel with DJ-1 to maintain mitochondrial integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Exner1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>These broad cytoprotective activities illustrate the benefits of genetically augmenting parkin levels, and suggest methods to enhance parkin expression and/or activity could provide useful therapies in the treatment of PD. Unfortunately, gene therapy is not a practical option. Moreover, it is not clear if the benefits associated with higher steady-state levels of parkin expression can also be achieved under transient, non-steady state conditions. To address these issues, we developed cell-permeable parkin proteins that we then tested for cytoprotective activity in cultured neuronal cells and in an acute mouse model of PD.</p>

<title>Development of Cell-Permeable Parkin Proteins</title>
<p>Multiple hydrophobic macromolecule transduction domains (MTDs) have been used to enhance the delivery of protein cargoes to mammalian cells and tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Liu1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim3">[22]</xref>. Similarly, MTD01, MTD10, MTD13, MTD151, and MTD174 were found to enhance the uptake of a His-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in RAW cells as assessed by flow cytometry (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102517.s001">Figure S1A</xref></bold>). Relative levels of protein uptake were 0.8 to 3.6 times that of a protein (HM<sub>m</sub>E) containing the membrane translocation sequence (MTS) from FGF4 (Hawiger, 1999) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102517.s003">Table S1</xref></bold>). By contrast, only minimal levels of protein uptake were observed with a protein (HSP) with an arbitrary peptide sequence in place of the MTD. Similar results were obtained in NIH3T3 cells, using fluorescent microscopy to monitor protein uptake (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102517.s001">Figure S1B</xref></bold>). MTD sequences also enhanced protein delivery to a variety of murine tissues after IP administration (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102517.s001">Figure S1C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>MTD01, MTD10, MTD13, MTD151, MTD174, were subsequently tested for the ability to enhance parkin uptake. Recombinant parkin proteins containing a 6xHis-tag alone (HP) or together with MTD01 and MTD13, were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102517-g001"><bold>Figures 1A, left panel and 1B</bold></xref>). However, as we were not satisfied with protein solubility and/or yield, additional parkin proteins were expressed that contained no MTD or MTDs 10, 13, 151 or 174 without a 6xHis-tag (designated P, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>13</sub>, PM<sub>151</sub>, and PM<sub>174</sub>, respectively). In addition, the <italic>PARK2</italic> sequence in these vectors was modified to employ <italic>E. coli</italic> codon preferences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102517-g001"><bold>Figures 1A, right panel and 1C</bold></xref>). The 6xHis-tagged proteins were purified under denaturing conditions by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity chromatography and allowed to refold; whereas the untagged proteins were extracted from inclusion bodies and purified by Q-sepharose anion exchange chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102517-g001"><bold>Figure 1C, right panel</bold></xref>). In each case, proteins lacking the 6xHis tag were expressed at higher levels from codon-optimized vectors and produced greater yields of soluble proteins as compared to 6xHis tagged proteins encoded by the human <italic>PARK2</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102517-g001"><bold>Figures 1B and C</bold></xref><bold>; bottom panels</bold>). All of the recombinant parkin proteins possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity as assessed by using an auto-ubiquitination assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102517-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref> and data not shown).</p>

<title>Auto-ubiquitination activity of recombinant parkin proteins.</title>
<p>E3 ligase activity of purified recombinant parkin proteins was assessed by an auto-ubiquitination assay. 1 µg of each of the indicated proteins was incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with 1 µM E1, 50 µM E2, 1 mM histidine-tagged Ubiquitin and 10 mM Mg-ATP, and the reaction products were fractionated by SDS PAGE and immunoblotted against an anti-Ubiquitin antibody. Parkin proteins (P, HP, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>13</sub>, PM<sub>151</sub> and PM<sub>174</sub>) are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102517-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

<p>Purified parkin proteins were labeled with FITC, and protein uptake was tested either in RAW and NIH3T3 cells by flow cytometry (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102517.s002">Figure S2A</xref></bold>) and fluorescent confocal microscopy (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102517.s002">Figure S2B</xref></bold>), respectively. Since recombinant parkin proteins were positive charged and sticky, it was hard to remove completely the cell surface-bound proteins, resulting in difficulty to distinguish the internalized quantity from surface-bound proteins. We also monitored systemic delivery of CP-Parkin proteins (after IP administration) in a variety of murine tissues (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102517.s001">Figure S1C</xref></bold>). By contrast, 6xHis-tagged parkin without an MTD sequence (HP) did not accumulate in any of the cells or tissues examined. Brain sections and lysates also contained up to 6-fold higher levels of HPM<sub>01</sub>, HPM<sub>13</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> as compared to levels of HP or endogenous parkin proteins as assessed by immunohistochemical staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102517-g003"><bold>Figures 3A and B</bold></xref>) or Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102517-g003"><bold>Figures 3C and D</bold></xref>). These experiments established MTD01, MTD10 and MTD13 as vehicles for parkin protein delivery both in cultured cells and in animal tissues.</p>

<title>CP-Parkin Protects Cultured Neuronal Cells from 6-Hydroxydopamine-Induced Apoptosis and Stimulates Dopamine Synthesis</title>
<p>Neuroprotective activities of cell-permeable parkin were tested using an in vitro model of dopamine-induced cytotoxicity. Mouse dopaminergic neuronal cell CATH.a (a catecholaminergic cell line of CNS origin) and SH-SY5Y (derived from a human brain tumor) undergo apoptosis upon treatment with dopamine or dopamine metabolites including 6-hydroxydopamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Masserano1">[23]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102517-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, treatment of CATH.a cells for 1 hr with 50 µM 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced nearly 100% of the cells to undergo apoptosis as assessed by a fluorescent terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The apoptosis was almost completely blocked by treating cells for 2.5 hrs (starting after 6-OHDA removal) with 2.5 µM HPM<sub>13</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102517-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). By contrast, HP, a 6xHis tagged parkin protein that lacks an MTD sequence and did not enter cells, was not cytoprotective. Similar results were obtained in SH-SY5Y cells except the cells were exposed to 100 µM 6-OHDA for 6 hrs followed by 2.5 µM PM<sub>10,</sub> a parkin protein with a different MTD sequence and lacking the 6xHis tag for 2.5 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102517-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001).</p>

<p>These experiments do not distinguish the extent to which loss of TH staining (and restoration by CP-Parkin) reflects MPTP-induced neuronal cell loss or suppression of TH expression.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1 are widely expressed and oxidative stress, mitochondrial poisons and misfolded proteins presumably affect many cell types, other features of the neuronal phenotype have been proposed to explain the differential vulnerability of dopaminergic (and other) neurons observed in PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Sulzer1">[27]</xref>. These include dopamine metabolism itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Stokes1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lipski1">[29]</xref> and electrophysiologic features of neurons in the substantia nigra, characterized by slow, broad-spike, autonomous pacemaking with low Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Surmeier1">[30]</xref>. Both processes induce oxidative stress, placing steady-state burdens on cellular anti-oxidant defenses and mitochondrial homeostasis, which in turn are thought to enhance the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Sulzer1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of protein-based therapy to deliver enzymatically active, cell-permeable (CP) parkin proteins as neuroprotective agents in an acute intoxication model of dopaminergic neuronal loss. CP-Parkin proteins containing MTDs displayed enhanced cellular uptake and tissue penetration as compared to proteins lacking an MTD, and they suppressed Parkinson Disease-associated phenotypes in 6-OHDA- and MPTP-treated cells and animals. In particular, CP-Parkin suppressed 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis in CATH.a and SH-SY5Y cells, stimulated dopamine expression in cultured CATH.a cells, preserved tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells in the striatum and midbrain, enhanced dopamine expression, and preserved gross motor functions (swim test) in MPTP-treated mice.</p>
<p>The levels of cytoprotection achieved by CP-Parkin were comparable to those reported after enforced expression of the parkin gene in neuronal cell lines and in animal models of PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Jiang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Staropoli1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Petrucelli1">[11]</xref>. This suggests that the activity of systemically delivered HPM<sub>13</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> protein approaches theoretical limits associated with augmented parkin function in the different models examined. These results demonstrate that cytoprotective benefits of parkin do not require prolonged prior exposure but can be achieved relatively quickly, under non-steady state conditions.</p>
<p>Cell-permeable proteins used in the present study possessed a low intrinsic auto-ubiquitination activity characteristic of the wild type protein, and the auto-ubiquitination activity was unaltered by the addition of amino-terminal 6xHis or carboxyl-terminal MTD sequences. These results are consistent with previous studies in which parkin appeared to tolerate a variety of amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences while maintaining normal enzymatic and regulatory functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Chung1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Trempe1">[34]</xref>. Although, we were unable to assess potential contributions of the MTD sequence on the biological activity of CP-Parkin due to problems expressing MTD sequences in soluble form, we have observed no effects in cells or tissues treated with other cargos containing MTD sequences, e.g. EGFP (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102517.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Moreover, all of the biological effects attributed to CP-Parkin in cells and mice were similar to those associated with enforced <italic>PARK2</italic> gene expression.</p>
<p>Parkin ubiquitination ligase activity is intrinsically repressed due to structural features of the protein that occlude the E2 and catalytic sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Trempe1">[34]</xref>. Enzyme activity is regulated by mitochondrial relocalization, post-translational modifications and ligand binding to the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Chung1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Ko1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Kondapalli1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Chaugule1">[38]</xref>. In addition, the enzyme can be constitutively activated either by deletion of amino-terminal sequences containing the Ubl and zinc-finger RING0 domains or by various missense mutations responsible for juvenile autosomal recessive PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Trempe1">[34]</xref>. The latter mutations destabilize the protein as a consequence of enhanced auto-ubiquitination. It will be important to test cell-permeable parkin proteins–engineered either to be constitutively active or to resist auto-ubiquitination–for enhanced cytoprotective activity.</p>
<p>In principle, protein-based therapeutics offers a way to control biochemical processes in living cells under non steady-state conditions and with fewer off target effects than conventional small molecule therapeutics. However, systemic protein delivery in animals has proven difficult due to poor tissue penetration and rapid clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Fischer1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Heitz1">[40]</xref>. Protein transduction exploits the ability of specific basic, amphipathic and hydrophobic protein sequences to enhance the uptake of proteins and other macromolecules by mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Fischer1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Heitz1">[40]</xref>. Some success has been achieved using sequences derived from hydrophobic signal peptides to deliver biologically active peptides and proteins to a variety of tissues (including liver, lung, pancreas, lymphoid tissues and brain). The hydrophobic macromolecule transduction domains (MTDs) used in the present study were selected from a screen of more than 1,500 signal peptide sequences. Although the MTDs we developed do not have a common sequence or sequence motif they were all derived from the hydrophobic (H) regions of signal sequences (HRSSs) that also lack common sequences or motifs except their hydrophobicity and the tendency to adopt alpha-helical conformations. The wide variation in H region sequences may reflect prior evolution for proteins with membrane translocating activity and subsequent adaptation to the SRP/Sec61 machinery, which utilizes a methionine-rich signal peptide binding pocket in SRP to accommodate a wide-variety of signal peptide sequences. The persistence of H region sequence variability presumably reflects unknown cargo-specific advantages. Similarly we know that specific MTDs work better than others with specific cargos, particularly with regard to maintaining protein solubility, and have published several such examples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Liu1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Liu2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Moore1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Jo1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim3">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Liu4">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim4">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>The development of MTD sequences has been largely empirical, starting with a screen for sequences able to enhance EGFP reporter protein uptake. Individual sequences were further modified to eliminate charged and polar amino acids, increase predicted α-helical content and limit the number of consecutive hydrophobic residues. These hydrophobic MTD sequences appear to penetrate the plasma membrane directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Veach1">[17]</xref> after inserting into the membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Ramamoorthy1">[44]</xref>. In particular, translocation of the FGF4 MTS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Veach1">[17]</xref> occurs after the peptide inserts into the membrane in a “bent” configuration with hydrophobic sequences adopting an α-helical conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Ramamoorthy1">[44]</xref>. MTD-dependent uptake of proteins was bidirectional as evidenced by cell-to-cell transfer. Cellular uptake was also sensitive to low temperature, did not require microtubule reorganization, was not enhanced by agents that disrupt the plasma membrane, and did not utilize ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim2">[21]</xref>–features consistent with direct membrane penetration. Cell-permeable p18<sup>INK4c</sup> traversed synthetic membranes consisting of cholesterol and phospholipid and was capable of bidirectional movement across membranes as assessed by cell-to-cell protein transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim2">[21]</xref>. Finally, as reviewed elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim4">[43]</xref> the presence of an MTD sequence does not preclude uptake by other mechanisms, including adsorptive and fluid-phase endocytosis. As a consequence, the uptake of MTD-containing cargoes is not exclusively cytoplasmic.</p>
<p>Hydrophobic MTD sequences have been used to deliver biologically active peptides and proteins to variety of tissues and tumor xenografts. Striking therapeutic benefits using these MTDs have been reported using a small peptide to protect against otherwise lethal inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Liu1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Liu2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Moore1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Liu5">[42]</xref> and using larger cell-permeable proteins including suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) to protect animals against lethal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Jo1">[18]</xref>, the NM23 metastasis suppressor to inhibit the seeding and growth of pulmonary metastases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim1">[20]</xref>, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p18<sup>INK4c</sup>, to inhibit the growth of tumor xenografts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim2">[21]</xref>, the RUNX3 tumor suppressor to suppress the growth of subcutaneous gastric tumor xenografts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim3">[22]</xref> and the angiogenesis inhibitor, Endostatin, to reduce the growth of human tumor xenografts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Lim4">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study we show that the hydrophobic MTD sequence is strictly required for efficient Parkin uptake by cells and for systemic delivery <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, the widespread tissue distribution and neuroprotective activity of CP-Parkin after intra-peritoneal administration illustrates the ability of MTD-containing proteins to penetrate multiple cell and tissue barriers. By contrast, bulk entry mediated by basic protein transduction domains occurs by absorptive endocytosis and macropinocytosis. While the latter approach has suffered from poor tissue penetration and protein bioavailability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Fischer1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Heitz1">[40]</xref>, several groups have used the Pep-1 and HIV Tat transduction sequences to deliver a variety of protein cargoes (including SAG, Frataxin, Hsp27, Cdk5, Hsp70, Metallothionein III, and DJ-1) and have reported neuronal protection in acute animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Ahn1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102517-Sohn1">[53]</xref> although these studies did not assess the impact of protein therapy on motor functions.</p>
<p>The enhanced cytoprotection and preservation of motor function achieved by CP-Parkin suggests endogenous parkin levels become rate-limiting under conditions of acute intoxication and possibly during the development of progressive PD in the elderly. In short, intrinsic parkin responses appear to be restrained, presumably at the level of basal expression, enzymatic activation and/or post-activation protein turnover initiated by auto-ubiquitination. Such functional restraint and tight biochemical regulation suggest a requirement to guard against gratuitous or compartmentally misplaced ubiquitin ligase activity. Consequently, efforts to modulate parkin activity therapeutically either by constitutively activating the enzyme or by suppressing auto-ubiquitination may be hampered by off-target effects.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that exogenously administered parkin proteins can compensate for intrinsic limitations in the parkin response to enhance cytoprotection and preserve motor function following acute intoxication and provide a therapeutic strategy to augment parkin activity and preserve motor function following acute intoxication.</p>

A second enzyme conjugated anti-dopamine antibody directed against a different epitope produces reaction products proportional to the amount of antigen as compared against a standard curve.</p>

<title>Tyrosine Hydroxylase Expression</title>
<p>Brains from protein (PM<sub>10</sub>) treated mice (IP, 200 µg/day×5 consecutive days) after lesioning with MPTP were isolated. Striatum and midbrain were rapidly dissected out, the hemispheres divided and the cortex removed from the surrounding structures. The tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hrs and cryosected (20 µm). Dopaminergic neuronal cell marker in brain - tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was immunostained with anti-TH (1∶1,000, Millipore, Ramona, CA) monoclonal antibody, followed by biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1∶500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and developed with ABC kit (Vectastain kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).</p>

<title>Assessment of Motor Activity</title>
<p>Gross motor functions of MPTP-lesioned mice were assessed by using a swim test. Mice were placed in a 37°C water bath and video recorded. Unlesioned mice swam using all 4 legs 98% of the time. The percent of time of each group (MPTP only, MPTP+HP or MPTP+HPM<sub>13</sub>) spent swimming (4 legged) was measured and expressed as a percent of the unlesioned control.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All experimental data using cultured cells were expressed as means ± S.D. for at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated using a two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test or ANOVA method. Experimental differences between groups were assessed using paired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests. For animal experiments, ANOVA for comparisons between and within groups were used to determine the significance. Differences with <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</p>

<p><bold>MTD sequences with enhanced protein transduction activity.</bold> A screen of hydrophobic signal sequences identified hydrophobic sequences (Original Sequence) from the indicated protein sources with enhanced macromolecule transduction activity. These sequences were then modified (MTD Sequence) to produce MTD01, MTD13, MTD10, MTD151 and MTD174. Relative CP stands for relative cell-permeability of MTD-EGFP protein to MTS-EGFP protein determined by RAW264.7 cell uptake. MTS is derived from FGF4. MTDs were derived from the hydrophobic regions of predicted signal peptides from the indicated proteins. Helix refers to the secondary structure of the MTD sequence as appended to the cargo proteins (EGFP or parkin), as determined by the NPSA (network protein sequence analysis) program. Sequence numbers are from the Genbank and NCBI entries. Original sequence indicates the hydrophobic region of the signal sequence of the proteins. The numbers associated with the original sequence represent the amino acid numbers of the original protein.</p>
