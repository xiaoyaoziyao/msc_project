<abstract>
<p>Studies of animal personality attempt to uncover underlying or “latent” personality traits that explain broad patterns of behaviour, often by applying latent variable statistical models (e.g., factor analysis) to multivariate data sets. Two integral, but infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e., uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect (<italic>local independence</italic>), and ii) personality traits are associated with behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of individuals (<italic>measurement invariance</italic>). We tested these assumptions using observations of aggression in four age classes (4–10 months, 10 months–3 years, 3–6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N = 4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303). However, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by latent levels of aggressiveness. Furthermore, aggressiveness towards people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus, sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because inaccurate “aggressive personality” trait attributions can be costly to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Studies of non-human animal personality demonstrate that animals show relatively consistent between-individual differences in behaviour, and that the behavioural phenotype is organised hierarchically into broad behavioural dimensions or personality traits (e.g. sociability, aggressiveness or boldness) that further exhibit inter-correlations to form behavioural syndromes (e.g. boldness with aggression; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref005">5</xref>]). To interpret the complexity inherent in behavioural phenotypes, personality traits and behavioural syndromes are frequently inferred using latent variable statistical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref006">6</xref>], which reduce two or more measured variables (the <italic>manifest</italic> variables) into one or more lower-dimensional variables (the <italic>latent</italic> variables), following work in human psychology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Many animal personality studies use <italic>formative</italic> models, such as principal components analysis, that construct composite variables comprised of linear combinations of manifest variables. However, formative models impose only weak assumptions about the relationships between latent variables and manifest variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref011">11</xref>]. For instance, formative models do not require manifest variables to be correlated with one another or illustrate internal consistency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref011">11</xref>]. Because behavioural variables comprising personality traits are expected to correlate with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref004">4</xref>], the utility of formative models to revealing underlying personality traits has been criticised in both animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref013">13</xref>] and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref015">15</xref>]. Instead, researchers are increasingly using <italic>reflective</italic> models, such as factor analysis, including confirmatory approaches such as structural equation modelling (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref018">18</xref>]). Reflective models regress measured behaviours on one or more latent variables, incorporating measurement error and possibilities to compare <italic>a priori</italic> competing hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Whilst reflective models offer a powerful framework to examine the latent variable structure of animal behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref019">19</xref>], they impose certain assumptions on the interpretation and modelling of latent variables that have received scrutiny in human psychology but are rarely discussed in studies of animal personality. Two foundational assumptions are <italic>local independence</italic> and <italic>measurement invariance</italic>. Local independence implies that manifest variables should be independent of each other conditional on the latent variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref021">21</xref>]. For example, given a continuous latent variable <italic>θ</italic> (e.g. boldness) and two binary manifest variables <italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>Y</italic><sub>2</sub> that can take the values 0 and 1, the item response theory model asserts that <italic>P</italic>(<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> = 1,<italic>Y</italic><sub>2</sub> = 1|<italic>θ</italic>) = <italic>P</italic>(<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> = 1|<italic>θ</italic>)<italic>P</italic>(<italic>Y</italic><sub>2</sub> = 1|<italic>θ</italic>). As such, the latent variables should ‘screen off’ any covariance between manifest variables. Measurement invariance implies that the latent variables function the same (i.e. are invariant or equivalent) in different subsets of a population or in the same individuals through time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref025">25</xref>]. In the previous example, this means that the expected values of the manifest variables <italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>Y</italic><sub>2</sub> should remain the same across different groups, <italic>π</italic> (e.g. sex or different populations), for any fixed value of the latent variable <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> e.g. <italic>E</italic>(<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> | <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) = <italic>E</italic>(<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> | <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>,<italic>π</italic>). For studies of personality, violations of local independence or measurement invariance highlight instances where the personality traits do not completely explain variation in the manifest variables, which may lead to misleading conclusions about the differences between individuals as a function of trait scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>The goal of this study was evaluate local independence and measurement invariance in behavioural data on domestic dogs (<italic>Canis lupus familiaris</italic>). Dog personality has been of scientific interest for decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref030">30</xref>], both to predict the behaviour of dogs at future time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref031">31</xref>] and to elucidate behavioural traits pertinent to dogs’ domestication history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref035">35</xref>]. Research on personality in dogs has led to different numbers and composition of hypothesised personality traits with little consensus on how such traits should be compared within and between studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref038">38</xref>]. Dog personality studies frequently involve collection of data on a wide range of behaviours and, as a result, latent variable models are popular to reduce behavioural data into personality traits or dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref029">29</xref>]. Importantly, the predictive value of personality assessments in dogs has been inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref043">43</xref>], perhaps most prominently in shelter dog personality assessments (e.g. see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref031">31</xref>] for a review). Assessments of aggression are of particular concern, where aggression has been divided into different aggressiveness traits, such as owner-, stranger-, dog- or animal-directed factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref045">45</xref>]. Improving inference about aggressiveness in dogs is important because dog bites are a serious public health concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref046">46</xref>], especially for animal shelters rehoming dogs to new owners, and aggressive behaviour is undesirable to many organisations using dogs for various working roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>Evaluating local independence and measurement invariance could help refine applied personality assessments on dogs. Local independence may be violated in standardised test batteries (a common assessment method; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref050">50</xref>]) because the sequential administration of different behavioural subtests means that how dogs responds to one sub-test may influence their subsequent behavioural responses, as well as the responses of the dog handlers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref031">31</xref>]. Identifying local independence could, thus, highlight which sub-tests can be interpreted as providing independent information. Local independence is also relevant to the development and analysis of dog personality questionnaires completed by dog owners, because the order in which the questions are presented or redundancy in the content of questions can lead to dependencies between participant responses not explained by the questionnaire’s intended focus on the dog’s behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>Scientists are also concerned with understanding personality differences in dogs across a variety of conditions, including ontogeny, age, sex, breed and neuter status (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref054">54</xref>]). Evaluating measurement invariance in personality assessments would allow researchers to confirm whether differences between individuals or groups of individuals in personality assessments reflect credible differences in personality trait scores or whether additional, unaccounted for factors are driving the differences. While it may be unrealistic for measurement invariance to hold in all instances, it is important to establish whether it holds for personality traits across basic biological variables such as age and sex, which are generally applicable to dog populations undergoing personality assessment and have previously been found to show interactions with personality traits, including playfulness, sociability, curiosity and aggressiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref055">55</xref>]. However, apart from van den Berg <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref018">18</xref>] who assessed measurement invariance across breed groups, no studies have confirmed measurement invariance or local independence for personality traits.</p>
<p>In this paper, we assessed local independence and measurement invariance of aggressiveness in shelter dogs using a large sample of data on inter-context aggressive behaviour. First, we decomposed observations of aggression towards people and dogs across contexts into separate aggressiveness traits. Secondly, we assessed whether aggression in different contexts remained associated beyond that explained by latent levels of aggressiveness, testing local independence. Thirdly, we investigated whether the probability of aggression in different contexts assumed to be underpinned by the same aggressiveness trait was measurement invariant with respect to sex and age groups.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Observational data on the occurrence of aggression in 4,743 dogs were gathered from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home’s (UK) observational and longitudinal dog behaviour assessment records (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183595.t001">Table 1</xref>). The data were from a sample of dogs (N = 4,990) at the shelter’s three rehoming centres during 2014 (including dogs that arrived during 2013 or left in 2015). We selected the records from all dogs that were at least 4 months old, excluding younger dogs because they were more likely to be unvaccinated, more limited in their interactions at the shelter and may have been kennelled in different areas to older dogs. Although dogs were from a variety of heritages (including purebreds and mongrels), the analyses here did not explore breed differences because the accurate visual assessment of breed in dogs with unknown heritage has been refuted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref058">58</xref>].</p>

<title>Shelter environment</title>
<p>The shelter was composed of three different UK rehoming centres: a high-throughput, urban centre based at Battersea, London with capacity for approximately 150–200 dogs; a semi-rural/rural centre based at Old Windsor with capacity for approximately 100–150 dogs; and a rural centre based at Brands Hatch with capacity for approximately 50 dogs. All dogs arrived in an intake area of their respective rehoming centre and, when considered suitable for adoption, were moved to a ‘rehoming’ area that was partially open to the public between 1000 h and 1600 h. All kennels were indoors. Kennels varied in size, but were usually approximately 4m x 2m and included either a shelf and bedding alcove area, or a more secluded bedding area at the back of the kennel (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref059">59</xref>] for more details). At different times throughout the day, dogs had access to indoor runs behind their kennels. In each kennel block area, dogs were cared for (e.g. fed, exercised, kennel cleaned) by a relatively stable group of staff members, allowing the development of familiarity with staff members and offering some predictability for dogs after arrival at the shelter. Although data on the number of dogs in each kennel were incomplete, in the majority of cases dogs were kennelled singly for safety reasons. The shelter mainly operated between 0800 h and 1700 h each day. All dogs were socialised with staff and/or volunteers each day (often multiple times) except on rare occasions when it was deemed unsafe to handle a dog (when training/behavioural modification proceeded without physical contact). Dogs were provided water ad libitum and fed commercial complete dry and/or wet tinned food twice daily (depending on recommendations by veterinary staff). Dogs received daily tactile, olfactory and/or auditory enrichment/variety (e.g. toys, essential oils, classical music, time in a quiet ‘chill-out’ room).</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>In the observational assessment procedure, trained shelter employees recorded observations of dog behaviour in a variety of contexts as part of normal shelter procedures. Behavioural observations pertaining to each context were completed using an ethogram specific to that context and recorded in a custom computer system. Multiple observations could be completed each day, although we retained only one observation in each context per day (the least desirable behaviour on that day; see below). The ethogram code that best described a dog's behaviour in a particular context during an observation was recorded by selecting it from a series of drop-down boxes (one for each context). Although staff could also add additional information in character fields, a full analysis of those comments was beyond the scope of this study. The ethogram for each context represented a scale of behaviours ranging from desirable to undesirable considered by the shelter to be relevant to dog welfare and ease of adoption. Contexts had between 10 and 16 possible behaviours to choose from, some of which overlapped between different contexts. Among the least desirable behaviours in each context was aggression towards either people or dogs (depending on context). Aggression was formally defined as “<italic>Growls</italic>, <italic>snarls</italic>, <italic>shows teeth and/or snaps when seeing/meeting other people/dogs</italic>, <italic>potentially pulling or lunging towards them</italic>”, distinguished from non-aggressive but reactive responses, defined as “<italic>Barks</italic>, <italic>whines</italic>, <italic>howls and/or play growls when seeing/meeting other people/dogs</italic>, <italic>potentially pulling or lunging towards them</italic>”.</p>
<p>Observation contexts included both onsite (at the shelter) and offsite (e.g. out in public parks) settings. For the analyses here, we excluded offsite contexts (which had separate observation categories) because these were less frequently recorded and offsite records were more likely to be completed using second-hand information (e.g. from volunteers taking the dog offsite). We focused on observations of aggression in nine core onsite contexts that were most frequently completed by trained staff members: i) <italic>Handling</italic>, ii) <italic>In kennel</italic>, iii) <italic>Out of kennel</italic>, iv) <italic>Interactions with familiar people</italic>, v) <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic>, vi) <italic>Eating food</italic>, vii) <italic>Interactions with toys</italic>, viii) <italic>Interactions with female dogs</italic>, ix) <italic>Interactions with male dogs</italic>. For the <italic>In kennel</italic> and <italic>Out of kennel</italic> contexts, recording of aggression towards both people and dogs was possible. If both occurred at the same time, aggression towards people was recorded. Therefore, <italic>In kennel</italic> and <italic>Out of kennel</italic> were each divided to reflect aggression shown towards people and towards dogs only, respectively. This resulted in 11 aggression contexts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183595.t002">Table 2</xref>) used as manifest variables in structural equation models to investigate latent aggressiveness traits. The average number of days between successive observations across these contexts and across dogs was 3.27 (SD = 2.08), and dogs had an average of 9.77 (SD = 13.41) observations within each context (N = 416,860 observations in total across dogs, contexts and days). Observations were recorded in the category that best described the scenario. Nonetheless, certain contexts could occur closely in space and time, which were investigated for violations of local independence, as explained below.</p>

<p>We aggregated behavioural observations across time for each dog into a dichotomous variable indicating whether a dog had or had not shown aggression in a particular context at any time while at the shelter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s002">S1 Table</xref>). This was performed because the overall prevalence of aggression was low, with only 1.06% of all observations across days involving aggression towards people and 1.13% towards dogs. Thus, the main difference between individuals was whether they had or had not shown aggression in a particular context during their time at the shelter. We interpret aggressiveness here as a between-individual difference variable.</p>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Validity of behaviour recordings</title>
<p>Validity of the recording of behaviour was assessed separately from the main data collection as part of a wider project investigating the use of the observational assessment method. Ninety-three shelter employees trained in conducting behavioural observations each watched (in groups of 5–10 people) 14 videos, approximately 30 seconds each, presenting exemplars of 2 different behaviours from seven contexts (to keep the sessions concise and maximise the number of participants). For each context, behaviours were chosen pseudo-randomly by numbering each behaviour and selecting two numbers using a random number generator. Experienced behaviourists working at the shelter filmed the videos demonstrating the behaviours. Videos were shown to participants once in a pseudo-random order. After each video, participants recorded on a paper answer sheet the behaviour they thought most accurately described the dog's behaviour based on the ethogram specific to the context depicted. Two of the videos illustrated aggression: one in a combined <italic>Interactions with new</italic> and <italic>familiar people</italic> context (combined because familiarity between specific people and dogs was not universally known) and one in the <italic>In kennel towards dogs</italic> context. The first video had an ethogram of 13 possible behaviours to choose from, and the second had 11 behaviours. The authors were blind to the selection of videos shown and to the video coding sessions with shelter employees.</p>

<title>Missing data</title>
<p>Data were missing when dogs did not experience particular contexts while at the shelter. The missing data rate was between 0.06% and 5% for each context, except for the <italic>Interactions with female dogs</italic> and <italic>Interactions with male dogs</italic> categories which had 17% and 18% of missing values, respectively (because structured interactions with other dogs did not arise as frequently). Moreover, 16% and 8% of dogs were missing weight measurement and neuter status data, respectively, which were independent variables statistically controlled for in subsequent analyses. We created 5 multiply imputed data sets (using the <italic>Amelia</italic> package; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref061">61</xref>]), upon which all following analyses in the sections below were conducted and results pooled. The multiple imputation took into account the hierarchical structure of the data (observations within dogs), all independent variables reported below, and the data types (ordered binary variables for the context data, positive-continuous for weight measurements, nominal for neuter status; see the R script). The data were assumed to be missing at random, that is, dependent only on other variables in the analyses.</p>

<title>Structural equation models</title>
<p>We used structural equation modelling to assess whether aggression towards people (contexts: <italic>Handling</italic>, <italic>In kennel towards people</italic>, <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic>, <italic>Interactions with familiar people</italic>, <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic>, <italic>Eating food</italic>, <italic>Interactions with toys</italic>) and towards dogs (contexts: <italic>In kennel towards dogs</italic>, <italic>Out of kennel towards dogs</italic>, <italic>Interactions with female dogs</italic>, <italic>Interactions with male dogs</italic>) could be explained by two latent aggressiveness traits: aggressiveness towards people and dogs, respectively. Since positive correlations between different aggressiveness traits have been reported in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref055">55</xref>], we compared a model where the latent variables were orthogonal to a model where variables were allowed to covary. Models were fit using the <italic>lavaan</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref062">62</xref>], with the weighted least squares mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator and theta/conditional parameterisation, as recommended for categorical dependent variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref064">64</xref>]. The latent variables were standardised to have mean 0 and variance 1. The results were combined across imputed data sets using the ‘runMI’ function in the <italic>semTools</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref065">65</xref>]. The fit of each model was ascertained using the comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker Lewis index (TLI), where values &gt; 0.95 indicate excellent fit, as well as the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) where values &lt; 0.06 indicate good fit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref007">7</xref>]. Parameter estimates were summarised by test statistics and 95% confidence intervals (CI).</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Local independence</title>
<p>We tested the assumption of local independence by re-fitting the best-fitting structural equation model with residual covariances specified between context variables. To maintain a theoretically driven approach (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref066">66</xref>] regarding the best practice of including residual covariances in structural equation models) and model identifiability, we only tested a predefined set of covariances based on which contexts shared close temporal-spatial relationships. First, we allowed covariances between <italic>Handling</italic> with <italic>In kennel towards people</italic>, <italic>Interactions with familiar people</italic>, <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with toys</italic>, respectively, since the <italic>Handling</italic> context could directly succeed these other contexts. The residual covariance between <italic>Handling</italic> and <italic>Eating food</italic> was not estimated because shelter employees would be unlikely to handle a dog while the dog ate its daily meals. The residual covariance between <italic>Handling</italic> and <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> was not estimated because any association between <italic>Handling</italic> and <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> would be mediated by either the <italic>Interactions with familiar people</italic> or <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> context. Therefore, secondly, we estimated the three-way covariances between <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic>, <italic>Interactions with familiar people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic>. Similarly, and lastly, we estimated the three-way covariances between <italic>Out of kennel towards dogs</italic>, <italic>Interactions with female dogs</italic> and <italic>Interactions with male dogs</italic>. No covariances were inspected between <italic>In kennel towards dogs</italic> and other aggressiveness towards dogs contexts since large time gaps were more likely to separate observations between those contexts.</p>

<sec id="sec012">
<title>Measurement invariance</title>
<p>To test for measurement invariance in each of the latent traits derived from the best fitting structural equation model, we investigated the response patterns across aggression contexts related to the same latent aggressiveness trait using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression models. These models were analogous to the 1-parameter item response theory model, which represents the probability that an individual responds correctly to a particular test item as a logistic function of i) each individual’s latent ability and ii) the item’s difficulty level. This model can be expressed as a hierarchical logistic regression model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref068">68</xref>], whereby individual latent abilities are modelled as individual-specific intercepts (i.e. ‘random intercepts’), the propensity for a correct answer to an item <italic>i</italic> is its regression coefficient <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, and credible interactions between items and relevant independent variables (e.g. group status) indicate a violation of measurement invariance. Here, the dependent variable was the binary score for whether or not dogs had shown aggression in each context and the average probability of aggression across contexts varied by dog, representing latent levels of aggressiveness. Context type, dog age, dog sex and their interactions were included as categorical independent variables. Age was treated as a categorical variable, with categories reflecting general developmental periods: i) 4 months to 10 months (juvenile dogs before puberty), ii) 10 months to 3 years (dogs maturing from juveniles to adults), iii) 3 years to 6 years (adults), and iv) 6 years + (older dogs). Broad age categories were chosen due to potentially large differences in developmental timing between individuals. Age was categorised because we predicted that aggression would be dependent on these developmental periods.</p>
<p>Models included additional demographic variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183595.t001">Table 1</xref>) that may mediate the probability of aggression: body weight (average weight if multiple measurements were taken), total number of days spent at the shelter, the rehoming centre at which dogs were based (London, Old Windsor, Brands Hatch), neuter status (neutered before arrival, neutered at the shelter, not neutered) and source type (relinquished by owner, returned to the shelter after adoption, stray). Categorical variables were represented as sum-to-zero deflections from the group-level intercept to ensure that the intercept represented the average probability of aggression across the levels of each categorical predictor. Weight and total days at the shelter were mean-centered and standardised by 2 standard deviations. Due to the potentially complex relationships between these variables and aggression (e.g. interactive effects between neuter status and sex; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref052">52</xref>]), which could also include violations of measurement invariance, we decided not to interpret their effects inferentially. Instead, they were included to make the assessment of measurement invariance between sexes and age groups conditional on variance explained by potentially important factors.</p>
<p>For comparability to other studies in animal personality, behavioural repeatability was calculated across contexts in each model using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), calculated as <inline-formula id="pone.0183595.e001"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0183595.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0183595.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M1"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula id="pone.0183595.e002"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0183595.e002g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0183595.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M2"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> represented the between-individual variance of the probability of aggression (i.e. the variance of the random intercepts), and <inline-formula id="pone.0183595.e003"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0183595.e003g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0183595.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M3"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> was <italic>π</italic><sup>2</sup>/3, the residual variance of the standard logistic distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref069">69</xref>].</p>
<p>Models were computed using the probabilistic programming language Stan version 2.15.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref070">70</xref>], using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, to sample from the posterior distribution. Prior distributions for all independent variables were normal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, attenuating regression coefficients towards zero for conservative inference. The prior on the overall intercept parameter was normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 5. The standard deviation of dog-specific intercept parameters was given a half-Cauchy prior distribution with mean 0 and shape 2. Each model was run with 4 chains of 2,000 iterations with a 1,000 step warm-up period. The Gelman-Rubin statistic (ideally &lt; 1.05) and visual assessment of traceplots were used to assess MCMC convergence. We checked the accuracy of the model predictions against the raw data using graphical posterior predictive checks. For plotting purposes, predicted probabilities of aggression were obtained by marginalising over the random effects (explained in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Regression coefficients were expressed as odds ratios and were summarised by their mean and 95% Bayesian highest density interval (HDI), representing the 95% most probable parameter values. To compare levels of categorical variables and their interactions, we computed the 95% HDI of the differences between the respective posterior distributions.</p>
<p>Models were run on each imputed data set and their respective posterior distributions were averaged to attain a single posterior distribution for inference. Adopting a Bayesian approach allowed the estimation of interaction parameters (i.e. testing measurement invariance) without requiring corrections for multiple comparisons as in null hypothesis significance testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref071">71</xref>]. Nonetheless, models included a large number of estimated parameters. Two strategies were employed to guard against over-fitting of models to data. First, we selected the model with the best out-of-sample predictive accuracy given the number of parameters based on the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC; using the R package <italic>loo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref072">72</xref>]). Four variants of each model were computed: two-way interactions between contexts and age and contexts and sex, respectively (model 1), a single interaction with sex but not with age (model 2), a single interaction with age but not with sex (model 3), and no interactions (model 4). All models included the mediating independent variables above. Second, to avoid testing point-estimate null hypotheses, the effect of a parameter was only considered credibly different from zero if the odds ratio exceeded the region of practical equivalence (ROPE; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref073">73</xref>]) around an odds ratio of 1 from 0.80 to 1.25. An odds ratio of 0.80 or 1.25 indicates a 20% decrease or increase (i.e. 4/5 or 5/4 odds), respectively, in the odds of an outcome, frequently used in areas of bioequivalence testing (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref074">74</xref>]), which we here considered to be small enough to demonstrate a negligible effect in the absence of additional information. If a 95% HDI fell completely within the ROPE, the null hypothesis of no credible influence of that parameter was accepted; if a 95% HDI included part of the ROPE, then the parameter's influence was left undecided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref073">73</xref>].</p>

<p>Separate models were run for contexts reflecting aggressiveness towards people and aggressiveness towards dogs. All models converged.

<title>Aggressiveness towards people</title>
<p>The odds of aggression towards people, across categorical predictors and for an average dog of mean weight and length of stay at the shelter, were 0.022 (HDI: 0.021 to 0.024), a probability of approximately 2%. On average, aggression was most likely in the <italic>In kennel towards people</italic> context (OR = 0.054; HDI: 0.049 to 0.058) and least probable in the <italic>Interactions with toys</italic> context (OR = 0.008; HDI: 0.007 to 0.009).</p>
<p>Aggression was less likely across contexts for females than males (OR = 0.719; HDI: 0.668 to 0.770), although there were also credible interactions between sex and contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s004">S3 Table</xref>). Whereas males and females had similar odds of aggression in the <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> context, smaller differences were observed between <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Handling</italic> (OR = 0.578; HDI: 0.481 to 0.682), <italic>Eating food</italic> (OR = 1.812; HDI: 1.495 to 2.152) and <italic>Interactions with familiar people</italic> (OR = 1.798; HDI: 1.488 to 2.126) contexts in females compared to males. Additionally, whereas aggression in the <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> context was similar between males and females, larger differences were observed between <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> and <italic>Handling</italic> (OR = 0.616; HDI: 0.530 to 0.702), <italic>Eating food</italic> (OR = 0.594; HDI: 0.506 to 0.686) and <italic>Interactions with familiar people</italic> (OR = 0.598; HDI: 0.513 to 0.687) contexts in females compared to males.</p>
<p>Apart from lower odds of aggression in 4 to 10 month olds compared to 10 month to 3 year old dogs (OR = 0.638; HDI: 0.565 to 0.705), there was no simple influence of age group on aggressiveness. Between the 4 to 10 months old and 3 to 6 years old groups, differences between the odds of aggression across contexts varied due to an increase of aggression in certain contexts but not others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s005">S4 Table</xref>). Aggression in <italic>In kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> contexts particularly increased, leading to larger differences between, for example, <italic>In kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Eating food</italic> (OR = 0.524; HDI: 0.400 to 0.642) and <italic>Eating food</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> (OR = 1.721; HDI: 1.403 to 2.059) contexts for 10 month to 3 year olds compared to 4 to 10 month olds, and between <italic>In kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> (OR = 0.470; HDI: 0.355 to 0.606) and <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> (OR = 2.051; HDI: 1.608 to 2.543) contexts in 3 to 6 year olds compared to 4 to 10 month olds. In 3 to 6 year old compared to 10 month to 3 year old dogs, aggression increased in the <italic>Handling</italic> and <italic>Eating food</italic> contexts but decreased in the <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> context, resulting in larger differences between, for instance, <italic>Handling</italic> and <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> (OR = 0.526; HDI: 0.409 to 0.631) and <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> (OR = 2.349; HDI: 1.891 to 2.925), and smaller differences between <italic>Eating food</italic> and <italic>Interactions with familiar people</italic> (OR = 0.576; HDI: 0.468 to 0.687).</p>
<p>Dogs over 6 years old demonstrated qualitatively different response patterns across certain contexts than all other age groups. While aggression was most probable in <italic>In kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> contexts for dogs aged 4 months through 6 years, dogs over 6 years old were most likely to show aggression in the <italic>Handling</italic> context, leading to interactions between, for example, <italic>Handling</italic> and <italic>In kennel towards people</italic>, and between <italic>Handling</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> contexts compared to the other age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s004">S3 Table</xref>). Aggression when <italic>Eating food</italic> and in <italic>Interactions with toys</italic> contexts also increased compared to that expressed by younger dogs, resulting in credible differences between, for instance, <italic>Eating food</italic> and <italic>Interactions with familiar people</italic> contexts between dogs aged 10 months to 3 years and over 6 years (OR = 0.379; HDI: 0.300 to 0.465) and between <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with toys</italic> contexts between over 6 year olds and all other age groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s004">S3 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Aggressiveness towards dogs</title>
<p>The odds of aggression towards dogs, across categorical predictors and for an average dog of mean weight and length of stay at the shelter, was 0.176 (HDI: 0.168 to 0.184), corresponding to a probability of approximately 15%. Dogs were most likely to show aggression in the <italic>Interactions with male dogs</italic> context (OR = 0.297; HDI: 0.198 to 0.217) and least likely in the <italic>In kennel towards dogs</italic> context (OR = 0.099; HDI: 0.094 to 0.104; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g002">Fig 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s005">S4 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>No credible mean-level differences existed between females and males (OR = 1.187; HDI: 1.128 to 1.250). However, the difference in aggression between the <italic>Interactions with female dogs</italic> and <italic>Interactions with male dogs</italic> contexts was smaller for females (OR = 1.542; HDI: 1.400 to 1.704; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g002">Fig 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s005">S4 Table</xref>), as were the differences between <italic>Interactions with male dogs</italic> and <italic>In kennel towards dogs</italic> (OR = 0.661; HDI: 0.590 to 0.732) and <italic>In kennel towards dogs</italic> and <italic>Out of kennel towards dogs</italic> (OR = 1.420; HDI: 1.269 to 1.587). Females were also more likely to show aggression in <italic>Interactions with female dogs</italic> than <italic>Out of kennel towards dogs</italic> compared to males (OR = 1.444; HDI: 1.301 to 1.603).</p>
<p>Dogs aged 4 to 10 months old had credibly lower odds of aggression towards dogs than older dogs across contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g002">Fig 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s005">S4 Table</xref>). However, contexts and age also showed interactive effects. In particular, aggression in <italic>Interactions with female dogs</italic> and <italic>Interactions with male dogs</italic> contexts tended to increase relative to other contexts. For instance, the relationship between <italic>Interactions with female dogs</italic> and <italic>Out of kennel towards dogs</italic> contexts reversed in direction between 4 to 10 month and 10 month to 3 year olds (OR = 0.595; HDI: 0.495 to 0.688) as did the relationship between <italic>Interactions with male dogs</italic> and <italic>Out of kennel towards dogs</italic> contexts (OR = 0.499; HDI: 0.422 to 0.575). The relationship between <italic>In kennel towards dogs</italic> and <italic>Out of kennel towards dogs</italic> contexts also changed across age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g002">Fig 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s005">S4 Table</xref>). Four to 10 months old were more likely to show aggression in <italic>Out of kennel towards dogs</italic> than <italic>In kennel towards dogs</italic> contexts, but the difference was smaller in 10 months to 3 year olds (OR = 0.608; HDI: 0.505 to 0.728) and in over 6 year olds (OR = 0.396; HDI: 0.316 to 0.481). The latter relationship was reversed in 3 to 6 year olds compared to 4 to 10 month old dogs (OR = 0.277; HDI: 0.227 to 0.331) and 10 month to 3 year old dogs (OR = 0.456; HDI: 0.396 to 0.516).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have examined local independence and measurement invariance of aggressiveness traits in shelter dogs. Observational recordings of aggression directed towards people and dogs across different shelter contexts were explained by two positively correlated latent variables, and behaviour across contexts was moderately repeatable. These results are consistent with the concept of animal personality, which is used to describe behaviour that shows moderately consistent between-individual differences across time or contexts, and is characterised by multiple observed behaviours being decomposed into lower-dimensional behavioural traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref004">4</xref>]. However, we found violations of local independence between contexts with close temporal-spatial relationships and measurement invariance with respect to sex and age groups, highlighting potential measurement biases.</p>
<p>Local independence implies that the association between manifest variables is greater than that explained by the latent variable. For aggressiveness towards people, aggression in the <italic>Handling</italic> context was negatively related with the <italic>In kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> contexts, while positive covariances were present between <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> contexts. Violations of local independence may arise through shared method variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref075">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref078">78</xref>] or unmodelled latent variables influencing manifest variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref080">80</xref>]. If a dog showed aggression when an unfamiliar person approached, it may be less likely to be handled by that person, which may explain the negative residual covariations between the <italic>Handling</italic> and <italic>In kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> contexts, respectively. These contexts were, in fact, positively correlated when latent levels of aggressiveness were not accounted for (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s005">S4 Table</xref>). In addition, the positive residual correlation between <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> may be mediated by additional traits of interest to personality researchers, such as fearfulness or anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref081">81</xref>], if dogs who are fearful of interacting with unfamiliar people are more likely to show aggression beyond that described by a latent aggressiveness trait.</p>
<p>While authors have argued that greater standardisation and validation of personality assessments is key to ensuring the accurate measurement of underlying traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref049">49</xref>], it may be untenable to avoid dependencies between testing contexts. Displays of aggression in one sub-test will likely change how people conduct future sub-tests with the same dog, regardless of test standardisation. Human psychologists have argued that violations of local independence are a natural consequence of the organisation of behaviour as a complex dynamic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref082">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref083">83</xref>], which unfolds with respect to time- and context-dependent constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref084">84</xref>]. Thus, awareness of local independence and its violation could facilitate closer understanding of the dynamics driving personality test responses beyond explanations purely based on personality traits.</p>
<p>While different subsets of a population may differ in mean levels of trait expression, interactions between behavioural responses and those subsets indicate that the same phenomenon is not under measurement across groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref024">24</xref>]. We found that the probability of aggression across contexts was dependent on sex and age conditional on latent levels of aggressiveness (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g002">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s004">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183595.s005">S4</xref> Tables). Female dogs, for example, were more likely than males to show aggression in <italic>Out of kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people</italic> contexts relative to other contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Females also demonstrated similar odds of aggression during <italic>Interactions with female dogs</italic> and <italic>Interactions with male dogs</italic>, whereas males were more likely to show aggression towards male than female dogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). As with local independence, different behavioural variables unaccounted for in this study may result in violations of measurement invariance. While dogs up to 6 years old were most likely to show aggression in <italic>In kennel towards people</italic> and <italic>Interactions with unfamiliar people contexts</italic>, dogs over 6 years old demonstrated aggression most commonly in the <italic>Handling</italic> context. Dogs over 6 years old also showed an increase in aggression in the <italic>Eating food</italic> and <italic>Interactions with toys</italic> contexts relative to other age groups. These results suggest that older dogs in shelter populations may be less tolerant during close interactions with people (i.e. handling, people in the vicinity of their food and toys) compared to other contexts, which may driven by other quantifiable factors such as pain or sensitivity (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref029">29</xref>]).</p>
<p>Although we have identified violations of both local independence and measurement invariance, we remain cautious about hypothesising <italic>a posteriori</italic> about their causes. Personality traits in animal behaviour are typically defined operationally, based on the statistical repeatability of quantifiable behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref077">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref085">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref086">86</xref>]. As discussed in human personality psychology, operational definitions can be ontologically ambiguous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref087">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref088">88</xref>]. That is, while operational definitions facilitate experimentation in animal personality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref004">4</xref>], they do not necessarily designate biological mechanisms underlying trait expression. For example, Budaev and Brown remark that boldness, defined as a propensity to take risks, could encompass a range of distinct personality traits, each with a different biological basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref075">75</xref>]. Whilst reflective latent variable models allow researchers to test hypotheses about the relatedness of measured behaviours via one or more underlying traits, they have also been criticised as ambiguous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref082">82</xref>]. For example, it is uncertain what reflective latent variables may represent in biological organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref087">87</xref>] or even whether they are features individuals possess or simply emergent features of between-individual differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref089">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref090">90</xref>]. Such considerations highlight the importance of research on the proximate mechanisms of personality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref085">85</xref>] and longitudinal data analyses to separate between- from within-individual behavioural variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref091">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref092">92</xref>].</p>
<p>A number of authors have emphasised the poor predictive value of aggression tests in shelter dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref050">50</xref>] and that low occurrence of aggression specifically can make its accurate measurement difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref040">40</xref>]. The probability of observing aggression on any particular day was low in this study (approximately 1%), and the number of dogs who, on average, showed aggression to people at least once while at the shelter was much lower than the number that showed aggression towards dogs, on average (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183595.g002">2</xref>). Nonetheless, our evaluations of validity indicated that between 40 and 45% of the shelter employees mistook observations of aggression for non-aggressive responses (e.g. over-excitement and frustration when seeing people/dogs), meaning that the true probability of aggression was potentially under-estimated (although incorrectly coding other behaviours as aggression also occurred, albeit rarely). Moreover, our assessments of validity were based on shelter staff evaluations of brief video recordings that may be less reliable than the live, spontaneous behavioural recordings upon which our main analyses were based, resulting in a lower percentage of correctly identified instances of aggression. For the two videos being evaluated, the shelter employees had 13 and 11 different behavioural codes, respectively, to choose from to describe the behaviours observed. Thus, while employees as a whole were undecided about whether the motivation for the behaviour was aggressive or non-aggressive, the vast majority of employees described the behaviour as reactive, despite potentially erring on the side of caution by labelling aggressive behaviours as non-aggressive. Comparable estimates of validity are not present in the literature on dog personality, but are particularly important in shelter settings where accurate recording of aggression is paramount. It is also worth noting that how to assess validity has received much debate (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref087">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref093">93</xref>]). In this study, we used expert judgement as a benchmark to which shelter employees’ responses were compared, but validity is frequently assessed in dog personality by inspecting patterns of correlation coefficients between similar and dissimilar behaviours (e.g. convergent or divergent validity; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref029">29</xref>]). This is less directly interpretable than reporting the percentage of answers that were correct, as used here. Moreover, the predictive validity of personality assessments in dogs have been inconsistent (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref042">42</xref>]). More discussion of the concept of validity, and how best to assess it, is warranted in studies of dog personality.</p>
<p>Infrequent occurrence and/or recording of aggression may also limit accurate predictions of future behaviour. Patronek and Bradley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref050">50</xref>] demonstrate using simulation that the low prevalence of aggression inflates the chance that aggression shown in a shelter assessment represents a false positive. In general, our results support this conclusion in the sense that aggression may be shown differentially across contexts not explained by latent levels of aggressiveness. Violations of local independence and measurement invariance as found here indicate, further, that it is not only the difference between false and true positives and negatives, but the validity of inferring homogeneous personality traits by which to compare individual dogs, that needs careful consideration. Consequently, we agree with recommendations to establish the efficacy of longitudinal, observational assessments rather than relying on a single assessment made using a traditional test battery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183595.ref050">50</xref>]. This approach will prioritise the cumulative understanding of a dog's context-dependent behaviour and help to guide decisions about the potential risk a dog poses to humans and other animals.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has tested the assumptions of local independence and measurement invariance of personality traits in shelter dogs. Using structural equation modelling, aggression across behavioural contexts was explained by two correlated latent variables and demonstrated repeatability. Nevertheless, significant residual covariances remained between certain behavioural contexts related to aggressiveness towards people, violating the assumption of local independence. In addition, aggression in different contexts showed differential patterns of response across sex and age, indicating a lack of measurement invariance. Violations of local independence and measurement invariance imply that the aggressiveness towards people and dogs traits did not completely explain patterns of aggression in different contexts, or that inferences based on these hypothesised personality traits may in fact be misleading. We encourage researchers to more closely assess the measurement assumptions underlying reflective latent variable models before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors influencing, personality.</p>
