<abstract>
<p>Diet influences health as a source of nutrients and toxins, and by shaping the composition of resident microbial populations. Previous studies have begun to map out associations between diet and the bacteria and viruses of the human gut microbiome. Here we investigate associations of diet with fungal and archaeal populations, taking advantage of samples from 98 well-characterized individuals. Diet was quantified using inventories scoring both long-term and recent diet, and archaea and fungi were characterized by deep sequencing of marker genes in DNA purified from stool. For fungi, we found 66 genera, with generally mutually exclusive presence of either the phyla Ascomycota or Basiodiomycota. For archaea, <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> was the most prevalent genus, present in 30% of samples. Several other archaeal genera were detected in lower abundance and frequency. Myriad associations were detected for fungi and archaea with diet, with each other, and with bacterial lineages. <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and <italic>Candida</italic> were positively associated with diets high in carbohydrates, but negatively with diets high in amino acids, protein, and fatty acids. A previous study emphasized that bacterial population structure was associated primarily with long-term diet, but high <italic>Candida</italic> abundance was most strongly associated with the recent consumption of carbohydrates. <italic>Methobrevibacter</italic> abundance was associated with both long term and recent consumption of carbohydrates. These results confirm earlier targeted studies and provide a host of new associations to consider in modeling the effects of diet on the gut microbiome and human health.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Humans live in association with immense populations of bacteria, viruses, fungi and archaea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Ursell1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Faust1">[8]</xref>. Many groups have now contributed surveys using deep sequencing to characterize these populations, revealing that the human microbiome differs radically at different body sites and among individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Kuczynski1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Gill1">[12]</xref>. Differences in body sites are associated with availability of nutrients, water, oxygen, and other site-specific features. The origin of differences between individuals is less clear, however, potentially reflecting distinct colonization early in life and different environmental exposures such as antibiotic use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Koenig1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Costello1">[15]</xref>. Another environmental exposure, ubiquitous but incompletely understood, is diet.</p>
<p>Recently, we reported correlations of long-term dietary patterns in 98 individuals and the bacterial lineages present in the gut microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Wu1">[10]</xref>. Two genera, <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, were shown to have reciprocal patterns of abundance, paralleling several reports from others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Arumugam1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Smith1">[18]</xref>. Abundant <italic>Prevotella</italic> correlated with consumption of carbohydrates, while abundant <italic>Bacteroides</italic> correlated with consumption of choline, fats, and amino acids. A short term controlled feeding study showed changes in the gut microbiota associated with the dietary interventions, but not a change in the overall structure of the bacterial community analyzed, supporting a role for long-term diet in determining the structure of the gut microbiome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Wu1">[10]</xref>. Another study recently reported that the diversity of the gut microbiota was linked with long-term diet, where a more diverse diet was correlated with an increased gut bacterial diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Claesson1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Bacteria are abundant members of the gut microbiome, but not the only residents. Bacteriophage particles within the intestinal tract are present in potentially greater numbers than bacterial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Reyes1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Reyes2">[21]</xref>. Recently changes in bacteriophage communities in gut have been correlated with dietary interventions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Minot2">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Archaea are also present in human gut, the most frequently occurring of which is <italic>Methanobrevibacter smithii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Miller1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Eckburg1">[25]</xref>, a methane producer from byproducts of bacterial fermentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Matarazzo1">[23]</xref>. Reported colonization rates by methanogenic archaea range from 25% to 95% of humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Stewart1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Dridi2">[27]</xref>. In microbial ecosystems such as the human gut, when H<sub>2</sub> accumulates due to bacterial catabolism, archaeal growth is stimulated associated with incorporation of H<sub>2</sub> into methane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Matarazzo1">[23]</xref>. Support for such syntrophy in the mammalian gut has been shown in a gnotobiotic mouse model, where co-colonization by <italic>M. smithii</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> promoted increased growth of both species compared to mono-colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Samuel1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Yeasts have been detected in human stool samples at least since 1917 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Anderson1">[29]</xref>, and by the mid 20th century their presence in the human intestine had been proposed to have a saprotrophic role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Gumbo1">[30]</xref>. Gut fungi may also be involved in pathogenic processes. Anti-<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> antibodies are detected in inflammatory bowel disease cohorts and are used as a predictor of disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Murdoch1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Seibold1">[32]</xref>. Recent work using a murine model has suggested that normally mutualistic or commensal fungi species may exacerbate intestinal inflammation in mice with sensitized genotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Iliev1">[33]</xref>. In mice, over 14 fungal genera have been reported to be present within the mucus layer lining the intestinal epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Scupham1">[34]</xref>. Available data is likely incomplete, because of reliance mostly on culture-based methods. Recent reports using next generation sequencing also suggest diverse fungal communities in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Hamad1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Ott1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we hypothesized that the gut archaea and fungi are influenced by both diet and the other microorganisms present. Here we investigated these ideas in a cohort of 96 healthy individuals who were previously characterized for their bacteria/diet relationships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Wu1">[10]</xref>. Fungi were characterized by sequencing the Internal Transcribed Spacer region 1 (ITS1) of the rRNA locus and the archaea by sequencing a segment of the 16S rRNA gene. Short-term diet was characterized using a Recall questionnaire, and long-term diet characterized using a Food Frequency questionnaire. Analysis showed notable correlations of the three Domains of life with each other, and with dietary components–thus these data begin to specify potential multi-domain trophic interactions in the human gut microbiota.</p>

<title>Samples for Analysis of the Relationship between Human Diet and Gut Microbial Populations</title>
<p>A total of 98 samples were collected from healthy volunteers, and sequences from 96 of these samples were used in this analysis after quality filtering. The archaeal and fungal components of the microbiota were assessed using the 16S rRNA gene and the ITS1 rRNA gene tags, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-DeLong1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Ghannoum1">[40]</xref>. The bacterial population of these samples was characterized previously by 454 pyrosequencing of V1V2 segments of the 16S rRNA gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Wu1">[10]</xref>. Volunteers were screened to be free of chronic gastrointestinal disease, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus or immunodeficiency diseases, to have a normal bowel frequency (minimum once every 2 days, maximum 3 times per day), and body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 35.</p>

<title>The Archaea of the Gut Microbiome</title>
<p>A total of 99,131 archaeal sequence reads were obtained, resulting in the detection of 5 genera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A total of 44 of the 96 samples analyzed were positive for at least one species. <italic>Methanobrevibacter sp</italic> was detected in 30 samples, and <italic>Nitrososphaera sp</italic> was detected in 16 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

<title>The archaeal and fungal components of the human gut microbiome.</title>
<p>The heatmaps show the relative proportions of microbial lineages detected by pyrosequencing. The lineages are marked on the right, with Phylum (abbreviated), Class, and Genus. Archaeal genera are shown in (A), representative bacterial genera in (B), and fungal genera in (C). The top two rows show the DNA yield from PCR amplification reactions, which serves as a rough indicator of abundance. Proportions were calculated within each amplicon (archaeal 16S, bacterial 16S, or fungal ITS) for each sequencing study separately. The abbreviations for phyla were as follows (Eur: Euryarchaeota; Tha: Thaumarchaeota; Act: Actinobacteria; Bac: Bacteroidetes; Fir: Firmicutes; Asc: Ascomycota; Bas; Basidiomycota). Other Ascomycota and Other Basidiomycota are composed of genera which were detected in only one sample (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s010">Table S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s002">Figure S2</xref> for a complete list of detected genera and their prevalence).</p>

<p>The detection of <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> was surprising and so was investigated further. Comparison of amplification efficiency suggested that the <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> when present was relatively abundant, while the <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> was less abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g001">Figure 1</xref>, top). <italic>Nitrosophaera</italic> was not detected after sequencing control amplifications with archaeal primers using products of blank DNA purifications as template (no positives out of eight tested). To validate the detection of <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic>, we used a nested PCR assay to detect the AmoA gene, which encodes the ammonia mono-oxyenase enzyme, and is distinctive for <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic>. We found an association between an AmoA positive PCR and <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> detection in the samples (p = 0.014, Fisher’s exact test). The association, while significant, was not invariant, probably because of difficulties in detection due to the low level of <italic>Nitrosophaera</italic> in the samples, and possible presence of AmoA in other microbes or food materials. Inspection of published work showed detection of <italic>Nitrosophaera</italic> in metagenomic sequences from one of two individuals studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Eckburg1">[25]</xref>, and in both 16S and metagenomic sequences in another cohort <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Yatsunenko1">[41]</xref>. These data do not distinguish whether <italic>Nitrosophaera</italic> is replicating in the human gut or a transient present in food.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>The Fungi of the Gut Microbiome</title>
<p>The fungal sequencing effort yielded 332,659 sequence reads, resulting in detection of 66 genera and 13 additional lineages that could not be classified to the genus level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s002">S2</xref>). Fungal sequences were detected in every sample analyzed. Only 12 fungal genera were detected in 9 or more samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were mostly inversely correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The most prevalent genus in this sample set was <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> (present in 89% of the samples), followed by <italic>Candida</italic> (57%) and <italic>Cladosporium</italic> (42%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Co-occurrence Analysis using the Dice Index</title>
<p>Microbial communities in diverse settings have been shown to form syntrophic communities, in which metabolic waste products from one microbe provide nutrients for another. Thus an initial analysis of these samples was carried out to determine which microbes co-occur, as scored by the Dice index. For this, we only used data of relatively abundant genera (within Domain sample proportion of 0.01 or greater).</p>
<p>Numerous associations were detected. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows these interactions, incorporating data over all three Domains. Co-occurrence is indicated by the color code. Inspection of the figure shows several examples of co-occurrence involving a high proportion of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g002">Figure 2</xref>, lower left corner, warmer colors). <italic>Bacteroides</italic> occurred commonly with <italic>Parabacteroides</italic>, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic>. <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> occurred commonly with <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> as well as <italic>Bacteroides</italic>. In contrast, co-occurrence of <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> was low, as mentioned above.</p>

<title>Analysis of co-occurrence among microbial lineages scored using the Dice index.</title>
<p>Dice indexes across all genera pairs present at a proportion &gt; = 0.01 are shown as a heatmap. Clustering was carried out using Ward’s criteria, based on the Euclidian distance between each genus pair using their Dice index across all other genera. Domain membership is color-coded on the left. Data are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s012">Table S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s013">S10</xref>.</p>

<p><italic>Candida</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> were both associated with the group containing the above bacteria. Several other fungi achieved levels sufficient for inclusion in the analysis, but showed less clearcut co-occurrence with other community members. <italic>Methobrevibacter</italic> showed modest levels of association with the above group of bacteria, but was similarly also associated with <italic>Prevotella</italic> and several other bacterial groups. <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> showed only modest associations with other lineages. The frequent co-occurrence of some of these microorganisms suggests candidate interactions among gut microbes for further investigation.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Covariation among Microbial Lineages</title>
<p>We next examined covariation among the three Domains, taking into account the relative abundance of each lineage in addition to presence-absence information. For the fungi and bacteria, multiple lineages were seen, and multiple different lineages were present in all samples, allowing use of correlation-based methods. However, for the archaea, only two lineages were detected with substantial frequency, <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and <italic>Nitrosophaera</italic>, and these were mostly mutually exclusive. Thus for the archaea, samples were divided into three categories (containing one of the two archaea or no archaea), and co-occurring bacteria and fungi scored. For those few cases where both archaea were seen in a single sample, there was always a substantially greater abundance of one, so the sample was assigned based on the predominant lineage.</p>
<p>As a first global test of association among the three Domains, we conducted a Permanova test using the newly developed Generalized Unifrac distance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Chen1">[42]</xref>, which showed significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s004">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s005">S2</xref>). To characterize the lineages involved, we used a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test to determine which bacterial and fungal genera co-varied with the archaeal categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<title>Inter-generic relationships.</title>
<p>The heatmaps quantify the intergeneric relationships. (A) Normalized z-score of the bacterial and fungal proportions for samples grouped according to their archaeal status (<italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> positive, <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> positive, or archaea negative). Asterisks indicate Kruskall-Wallis significant comparisons after FDR adjustment (FDR of 25, 20, 15, and 10% are marked with 1, 2, 3 or 4 asterisks, respectively). Domain membership is color-coded on the left. (B) Spearman correlations between Fungi and Bacteria. Asterisks in red indicate FDR adjusted significant correlations (FDR 20%) and the remaining raw p-values are shown to illustrate general patterns within the data (p-values &lt; = 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001 are marked with 1, 2, 3 or 4 asterisks, respectively).</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0066019.g003" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Several lineages co-varied with <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>, including the commonly encountered bacteria <italic>Ruminococcus</italic>, and rarer lineages such as <italic>Oxalobacter</italic> and <italic>Papillibacter</italic>. Of the fungi, <italic>Candida</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> were both positively associated with <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>. Both fungal genera were negatively associated with <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>Prevotella/Bacteriodes</italic> ratio was implicated as important for the gut microbiome structure in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Wu1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Arumugam1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Yatsunenko1">[41]</xref>, so we assessed correlations with fungal and archaeal taxa. We performed a PermanovaG test using the <italic>Prevotella</italic>/<italic>Bacteroides</italic> ratio and the generalized Unifrac matrices obtained from the fungal composition data. A significant relationship was observed (p = 0.0146) indicating a potential influence of the <italic>Prevotella/Bacteriodes</italic> ratio on fungi. A post-hoc test with the individual weighted and unweighted unifrac matrices showed that there was a significantly correlation between the <italic>Prevotella/Bacteriodes</italic> ratio and the weighted Unifrac distances (p = 0.0133), but not with the unweighted Unifrac matrix. Thus the <italic>Prevotella</italic>/<italic>Bacteroides</italic> ratio correlated with the amounts of fungi present, but not the types. For the archaea, <italic>Bacteriodes</italic> was significantly negatively correlated with <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>, but positively correlated with both <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> and no archaea. <italic>Prevotella</italic> showed a reciprocal pattern, but it did not achieve significance, probably because of the lower numbers of <italic>Prevotella</italic>-positive samples in the data set.</p>
<p>We also used a PermanovaG test to determine whether the proportion of fungal phyla (Ascomycota or Basidiomycota) correlated with the gut bacterial lineages. Both Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were significantly correlated with the bacterial lineages (p = 0.0202 and p = 0.0037, respectively). A post-hoc Permanova test with the individual weighted and unweighted Unifrac matrices was significant only when using the weighted Unifrac matrix (p = 0.0205 and p = 0.004, for the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, respectively). A targeted analysis of the Fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) showed a negative association of <italic>Candida</italic> with <italic>Bacteriodes</italic>. Together these results indicate that the types of fungal species in the gut were not correlated with the bacterial taxa present, but rather their relative proportions.</p>

<title>Associations with Diet</title>
<p>We next investigated correlations between diet and the archaeal and fungal taxa. Dietary information was collected using diet inventories that scored usual (long-term) diet, and recent (short-term) diet. For each inventory, a clustering method was used to identify co-varying groups of dietary components, thereby reducing the number of variables and reducing penalties for multiple comparisons in the statistical analysis. We found that many of the clusters formed natural categories, such as carbohydrates, animal protein, and amino acids. Correlations between diet and bacteria have been reported previously for this data set <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Wu1">[10]</xref> and were recapitulated here after using the pre-clustered dietary data (below). As a first step, Permanova tests were carried out using the nutrient cluster data and the weighted and unweighted Unifrac distance matrixes to determine whether the fungal and archaeal lineages were also associated with diet. Multiple significant associations were detected and are cataloged in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s006">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s007">S4</xref>.</p>
<p>Relationships between archaea and nutrients were explored using a Kruskall-Wallis test on the Permanova-selected nutrient cluster measurements. As above, samples were separated into archaea-negative, <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>-positive or <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic>-positive groups. A higher intake of carbohydrates was correlated with <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>-positive samples. This trend was observed in comparisons to both the long-term and short-term dietary data. For the long-term diet, samples with <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> or no archaea were enriched for clusters representing vegetable fat and poly-unsaturated fats. Samples with no archaea were enriched for a cluster representing total fat and total mono-unsaturated fats in the recent diet data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Fungal and bacterial proportions were also scored versus usual diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) or recent diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Only diet categories with at least one significant association are shown. As reported previously, bacterial proportions were most strongly correlated with components of the long term diet–<italic>Bacteriodes</italic> was more abundant in individuals eating high levels of animal protein, amino acids, and fats, while <italic>Prevotella</italic> was higher among those eating higher proportions of carbohydrates. For fungi significant correlations were observed only with the recent diet inventory, differing from the observations with bacteria. In the recent diet data, <italic>Candida</italic> was positively correlated with carbohydrates and negatively with total saturated fatty acids. A trend in the same direction was seen for <italic>Candida</italic> in the usual long-term diet, but it did not achieve significance. <italic>Aspergillus</italic> was negatively correlated with short chain fatty acids in the recent diet data. No trends were seen with <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>. Thus, these data indicate that fungal abundance is particularly strongly associated with the composition of recently consumed foods.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we investigated the relationships of diet and the fungi and the archaea of the human intestinal microbiome. Previously we reported, for this same set of samples, that patterns in the bacterial part of the gut microbiome correlated with long-term diet. Here we characterized the sample set by sequencing marker genes of the archaeal rDNA 16S and the fungal ITS1 region. Many interactions among microorganisms and nutrients were identified. <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and <italic>Candida</italic> were positively correlated with the ingestion of carbohydrates. This was most notable in short-term diet data for both groups, and in fact only achieved significance at all for <italic>Candida</italic> in the short-term diet data. These data support specific proposals for the interactions of members of the gut microbiome with dietary components and with each other.</p>
<p>We detected no fewer than 62 fungal genera and 184 species level OTUs, paralleling and extending a study of one subject, which also yielded a high number of fungal lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Hamad1">[35]</xref>. Which of these lineages are true gut residents, and which are transients in food is unknown. Six individuals had sequences belonging to genus <italic>Agaricus</italic>, the white button mushroom, which is consumed as food. This genus was among those filtered out of the analysis due to low prevalence in the dataset, suggesting that fungal DNA in food may be mostly degraded during digestion. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the high prevalence of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> in the fungal data is due to the ingestion of yeast-containing foods such as bread and beer.</p>
<p><italic>Nitrososphaera</italic>, which were encountered with unexpected frequency in our data, are different enough from other archaeal groups to be placed in their own phylum, the <italic>Thaumarchaeota</italic>. Members of the <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> genus are able to oxidize ammonia and degrade urea, which presumably would also feed nitrogen into the gut microbial community. <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> may have been previously underappreciated in microbiome studies due to its low abundance. Here, it was detected in 16% of the samples analyzed, though in low abundance, in a mutually exclusive pattern with <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>. The basis of possible antagonism between <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> is unknown. <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> also showed a positive association with the ingestion of proteins and amino acids, both for usual and recent diet. The correlation was not sufficient to survive correction for multiple comparisons, but may nevertheless indicate utilization of ammonia and or urea to meet their energy and carbon requirements. Alternatively, we cannot exclude the possibility that <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> was ingested with foods, possibly associated with meats.</p>
<p>Previously, interactions among microbial lineages of the gut were proposed to separate human populations into “enterotypes”, leading to considerable controversy. Arumugam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Arumugam1">[16]</xref> described three interacting networks of microbial lineages, centered on the presence of <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Bacteriodes</italic>, and <italic>Ruminococcus</italic>, together with other interacting taxa. However, subsequent work indicated that the most prominent feature of the data was an inverse correlation between the <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> genera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Yatsunenko1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Wu1">[10]</xref>. Here we show a positive association of <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and <italic>Candida</italic> with the <italic>Prevotella</italic> group, and each of these was further correlated with a diet high in carbohydrates. A negative correlation of <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> was also observed, paralleling the original Arumugam et al. paper. However, we also observed a strong positive relationship between <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and <italic>Ruminococccus</italic>, which were initially described to belong to distinct enterotypes. Thus our findings associate archaea and fungi with aspects of the enterotype concept.</p>
<p>The intergeneric relationships described here, together with the nutrient correlations, support models for specific interactions among microbes in the human gut. An example of syntrophism has been previously described for <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and methanogens, where the methanogens consume H<sub>2</sub>, allowing <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> to produce twice as many ATP molecules from the same amount of substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Stams1">[43]</xref>. One possible syntrophic guild specified in our data includes <italic>Candida</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066019-g006">Figure 6</xref>). <italic>Candida</italic> is able to degrade starches, especially after pre-treatment with amylases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Iannotti1">[44]</xref> such as the human-encoded amylases present in the mouth and small intestine. Thus, in one model, <italic>Candida</italic> may assist in breaking down starch in carbohydrate rich foods, which in turn liberates simpler sugars to be fermented by bacteria such as <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcus.</italic> Fermentation byproducts produced would then be consumed by <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> with the subsequent production of CO<sub>2</sub> and/or CH<sub>4</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Stams1">[43]</xref>. Alternatively, <italic>Prevotella</italic> might degrade starch (pre-treated or not by human alpha amylases) and mannan containing polysaccharides from food to smaller poly- and monosaccharides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Downes1">[45]</xref>. <italic>Prevotella</italic> would then take up the smaller mono and polysaccharides, catabolizing them to produce succinate and other byproducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-KovatchevaDatchary1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-vanGylswyk1">[47]</xref>. All such hydrolysis is extra cellular, which would provide <italic>Candida</italic> with simpler sugars for fermentation (potentially down to acetate). <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> might then consume the succinate produced by <italic>Prevotella</italic> and produce H<sub>2</sub> or acetate<sup>−/</sup>H<sup>+</sup> for consumption by <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Iannotti1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Purushe1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-KovatchevaDatchary1">[46]</xref>.</p>

<p>The samples described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Wu1">[10]</xref> were used in this study. Bacterial 16S sequences data and diet data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Wu1">[10]</xref> was used here. Briefly, healthy volunteers were screened to be free from any chronic gastrointestinal disease, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus or immunodeficiency diseases, to have a normal bowel frequency (minimum once every 2 days, maximum 3 times per day), and body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 35.

<p>Pyrosequencing was carried out using barcoded composite primers constructed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-McKenna1">[50]</xref>. PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate using the Accuprime system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Each reaction contained 50 nanograms of DNA and 10 picoMol of each primer. Archaeal specific 16S rDNA primers and ITS1 fungal primers were adapted from the literature and used to amplify a rDNA 16S fragment; the final PCR cycling conditions were optimized to maximize specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Gardes1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Lepp1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-DeLong1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Ghannoum1">[40]</xref>,(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s008">Tables S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066019.s009">S6</xref>).</p>

<title>Sequence Analysis</title>
<p>Sequences obtained were decoded and quality controlled using the QIIME pipeline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Caporaso1">[54]</xref>. OUT’s were formed at 97% and 95% similarity for archaeal and fungal sequences respectively, and were considered for further analysis if they had a minimum of 5 sequences detected across all samples. Taxonomy was assigned to OTU representative sequences using the RDPclassifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Cole1">[55]</xref> for archaeal sequences and BROCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Dollive1">[36]</xref> for fungal sequences. All taxonomy assignments were manually curated to check for accuracy and nomenclature using BLASTn against GenBank’s NR/NT database. For Archaea, the taxonomic assignment given by RDP to 2 out of the 12 archaeal OUT’s detected was corrected due to low coverage of those groups on RDP. For ITS, of the 290 OUT’s detected, 10 were missing mid-level (between phylum and genus) taxonomic information, which was filled in, and 5 yielded differing mid level taxonomies, of which only one of per genus was used. Two ITS OUT’s were automatically classified down to genus using BROCC, but had their taxonomy assignment brought up to Order level upon inspection of BLAST results (both OUT’s were present in one sample each). OTU sequence counts for each sample were aggregated at genus level. All downstream analysis was done at the Genus level using R unless otherwise noted. Genera were considered in the analysis if present in at least 9 out of the 96 available samples, and its absolute sequence count was equal to or greater than 10. For the ITS amplicon, samples were included in downstream analysis if they yielded at least 200 sequences. All novel sequence data was deposited at NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive under accession number SRP021021.</p>

<title>Inter-generic Relationships</title>
<p>Effects of bacteria on fungi, effects of the fungi on bacteria, and effects of archaea on bacteria and fungi were investigated using a Permanova test.

Within sample genus proportions were used to calculate Spearman correlations between bacterial genera and fungal genera. As only one or very few archaeal genera were detected in any sample, sequence proportions would be greatly skewed, invalidating any potential correlation results.

<title>Diet Analysis</title>
<p>Dietary information from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Wu1">[10]</xref> was used in this analysis. Usual diet was obtained using the Willett food frequency questionnaire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Willett1">[59]</xref>. Recent diet was obtained from 3 interviews recalling all consumed food on 3 days within the week preceding the sample acquisition (NHANES method, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066019-Centers1">[60]</xref>). All interviews were carried out by trained nutritionists. Nutrient measurements across individuals obtained from the dietary questionnaires were used in a clustering procedure to reduce the number of comparisons to be made. First, Spearman correlations were calculated pairwise for all nutrient variables available and this correlation matrix was used as input in a clustering analysis, and 20 clusters (approximately 10% of the total number of nutrients available) were selected. Nutrients within each cluster were submitted to a Principal Component Analysis and the first principal component values were extracted and used as a surrogate dietary measurement (Nutrient Cluster Measurement). These nutrient cluster measurements were used in a Permanova analysis together with the taxonomy based, weighted and unweighted Unifrac distances calculated using the R packages Ade4 and GUniFrac. Clusters which were significant in the Permanova analysis were further used to calculate Spearman rank correlations using the proportion for each bacterial and fungal genus across all samples. The Nutrient Cluster Measurements for each sample were also classified according to their archaeal status and then submitted to a Kruskall-Wallis test to determine archaea/diet relationships. P-values with a False Discovery Rate of 25% or less were considered significant.</p>
