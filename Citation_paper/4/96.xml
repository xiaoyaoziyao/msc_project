        <p>The Sprouty (Spry) family of proteins represents endogenous regulators of downstream signaling pathways induced by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Using real time PCR, we detect a significant increase in the expression of <italic>Spry4</italic> mRNA in response to NGF, indicating that Spry4 could modulate intracellular signaling pathways and biological processes induced by NGF and its receptor TrkA. In this work, we demonstrate that overexpression of wild-type Spry4 causes a significant reduction in MAPK and Rac1 activation and neurite outgrowth induced by NGF. At molecular level, our findings indicate that ectopic expression of a mutated form of Spry4 (Y53A), in which a conserved tyrosine residue was replaced, fail to block both TrkA-mediated Erk/MAPK activation and neurite outgrowth induced by NGF, suggesting that an intact tyrosine 53 site is required for the inhibitory effect of Spry4 on NGF signaling. Downregulation of Spry4 using small interference RNA knockdown experiments potentiates PC12 cell differentiation and MAPK activation in response to NGF. Together, these findings establish a new physiological mechanism through which Spry4 regulates neurite outgrowth reducing not only the MAPK pathway but also restricting Rac1 activation in response to NGF.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The best-characterized member of the neurotrophins is nerve growth factor (NGF), which supports the differentiation and survival of specific populations of sensory, sympathetic, and central nervous system neurons via the activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkA. Once activated, TrkA receptors trigger intracellular signal transduction cascades, including those mediated by Ras/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), PI3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, PLC and other pathways regulated by Rho family of small GTPases. Activation of these pathways allows NGF to regulate neuronal differentiation and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Segal1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Huang1">[2]</xref>. At the same time, receptor tyrosine kinases also trigger a complex chain of molecular events, named negative signaling, that reduce the strength and duration of positive signals to finally modulate the cellular physiology. Previous studies have revealed that receptor tyrosine kinase signaling is tightly regulated through the coordinated action of several protein inhibitors that function at multiple levels of the signaling cascade and at different time-points after receptor engagement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Dikic1">[3]</xref>. While positive signaling effectors are relatively well understood, signaling attenuation still remains elusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Dikic1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Ledda1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>During the last years, the Sprouty (Spry) family of proteins (Sprouty1–4) has emerged as negative signaling regulators of many trophic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Mason1">[5]</xref>. Sprouty was first described as an inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-stimulated tracheal branching during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Hacohen1">[6]</xref>. Subsequent studies revealed that mammalian genome contain four <italic>Sprouty</italic> genes encoding proteins of 32–34 kDa. It has been reported that trophic factors regulate the activity of Sprouty inducing its expression and promoting the phosphorylation of Sprouty proteins on critical tyrosine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Mason1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The emerging picture from Sprouty's studies indicates that they specifically inhibit Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway activated by a wide range of trophic factors, including FGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Hacohen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Impagnatiello1">[7]</xref>, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Gross1">[8]</xref>, GDNF (Glial cell line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Ishida1">[9]</xref>, PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Gross2">[10]</xref> and VEGF (Vascular Epithelial Growth Factor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Ayada1">[11]</xref>, but do not affect MAPK activated by EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Sasaki1">[12]</xref>. The molecular mechanism through which Sprouty antagonizes MAPK remains unclear, and may depend on the cellular context or the RTK involved. Interestingly, Sprouty2 was reported to potentiate biological effects induced by EGF, inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor ubiquitination and downregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Wong1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Rubin1">[15]</xref>. These findings suggest that the role of Sprouty in RTK signaling is still controversial, because they may regulate RTK signaling in a negative or positive manner.</p>
      <p>The regulation of neuronal physiology and the development of the nervous system require a tight spatial and temporal control, which is partly achieved by negative feedback loops, involving the expression of inhibitory proteins that counteract neurotrophic factor receptor signaling. Despite of the essential contribution of NGF for neuronal development and function, the molecular mechanisms that control NGF-induced TrkA signaling are not totally understood. Previous work has shown that expression of Sprotuy4, but not Sprouty1 or 2, could be induced after NGF treatment of PC12 neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Gross2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Sasaki1">[12]</xref>. However, despite this evidence, the functional contribution of Sprouty4 to NGF signaling and biology has not been explored, yet. In view of this, we decided to investigate whether Sprouty4 might play a prominent role controlling TrkA signaling and biological responses to NGF.</p>
      <p>In this study, we determine that Sprouty4 is a TrkA-induced gene that restricts Erk/MAPK pathway and inhibits Rac1, but not Akt, activation in response to NGF. At the molecular level, we identify the Tyr-53 of Sprouty4 as an essential determinant for this inhibitory activity. Here, we also show that Sprouty4 negatively regulates NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells and primary sensory neurons.</p>

        <title>NGF induces Sprouty4 expression in neuronal cells</title>
        <p>Recent studies on the mechanisms that restrict RTK signaling revealed the importance of negative-feedback control of receptor function as a mechanism to ensure signaling thresholds compatible with a physiological response. Based on this concept, we analyzed whether Spry4 is induced on neuronal cells after NGF stimulation. Using real-time PCR, we examined the expression pattern of <italic>Spry4</italic> mRNA in PC12 cells in response to NGF. This quantitative analysis revealed a significant induction of <italic>Spry4</italic> mRNA in this neuronal cell line responsive to NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, left panel). The <italic>Spry4</italic> mRNA induction was additionally observed by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032087.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). In contrast, neither <italic>Spry1</italic> nor <italic>Spry2</italic> mRNAs were detected by RT-PCR in PC12 cells in the absence or presence of NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, right panel). Spry4 protein up-regulation was additionally confirmed by immunoblotting of PC12 cell lysates treated with NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>Previous work showed that Erk/MAPK activation pathway by mitogenic stimuli induces Spry4 in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Sasaki1">[12]</xref>. To examine this possibility, PC12 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of a specific inhibitor of Erk/MAPK pathway, PD98059, before stimulation with NGF. The mRNA level of Spry4 was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR from samples prepared 4 h after ligand stimulation, and compared with cells that were not treated with PD98059. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, left panel, pharmacological inhibition of the MAPK pathway with PD98059, abrogated the NGF-induced <italic>Spry4</italic> mRNA expression, suggesting that an intact MAPK pathway is required for Spry4 up-regulation in response to NGF. The inhibitory activity of PD98059 was controlled in parallel, measuring MAPK activation by immunoblotting of PC12 cell extracts stimulated for 10 min with NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, right panel).</p>
        <p>To address whether Spry4 may play a physiological role in NGF/TrkA-driven dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron development, we examined whether Spry4 and the NGF receptor, TrkA, are co-expressed in DRG neurons, a neuronal subpopulation highly responsive to NGF. Primary dissociated DRG neurons obtained from E14.5 rats were assessed by immunofluorescence using anti-Spry4 and anti-TrkA antibodies. The staining revealed a striking co-localization of Spry4 and TrkA expression in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Using real-time PCR, we examined the pattern of mRNA expression of <italic>Spry1, Spry2 and Spry4</italic> in response to NGF in primary DRG neurons. In these experiments, we only detected a significant increase in the expression of <italic>Spry4</italic> mRNA in response to NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Thus, the specific induction of <italic>Spry4</italic> mRNA detected in DRG neuronal cultures treated with NGF indicates that Spry4 may play a physiological role in NGF/TrkA-driven DRG neuron development and function.</p>

        <title>Sprouty4 specifically inhibits NGF-induced Erk/MAPK and Rac1 activation</title>
        <p>To establish whether Spry4 could modulate NGF/TrkA signaling, we investigated its role on different intracellular signaling pathways induced by NGF. TrkA receptors transmit intracellular signals through several of the canonical pathways activated by other RTKs, including the Ras/MAP kinase, PI3K/Akt, PLC and other signaling pathways controlled by Rac1 GTPases. To determine whether Spry4 could regulate the Erk/MAPK pathway downstream of TrkA, we transiently transfected HA-tagged Erk2/MAPK plasmid with control or Myc-tagged Spry4 vector into PC12 cells. After 36 h, cells were serum-starved and stimulated with or without NGF for 10 min. The level of Erk2 activation was evaluated by HA-immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with a specific antibody against phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2/MAPK. PC12 cells expressing Spry4 showed a significant reduction in Erk2/MAPK activation compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g002">Fig. 2A and 2B</xref>). Similar results were obtained by comparing NGF-dependent endogenous MAPK activation in lysates prepared from parental PC12 cells and clones overexpressing Spry4 (PC12-Spry4 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). On the contrary, Spry4 could not reduce NGF-induced Akt activation in response to NGF in the same clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to explore at which level Spry4 could restrict MAPK activation, we co-expressed a constitutively active V12-Ras together with Spry4 in PC12 cells. In this experiment Spry4 was able to reduce ligand-independent MAPK activation by constitutively active V12-Ras, indicating that Spry4 impairs MAPK activation acting downstream Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>

        <title>Sprouty4 inhibits neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells and DRG neurons in response to NGF</title>
        <p>As it is known that TrkA signaling contributes to NGF-mediated survival and differentiation of various neuronal populations, we next investigated whether Spry4 could modulate neurite outgrowth of neuroblast-like PC12 cells in response to NGF. For this purpose, PC12 cells were transfected with control or Myc-tagged Spry4 plasmid in combination with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector. Cells were maintained in the presence of NGF for 72 h and stained with anti-myc antibodies to confirm that all GFP-positive cells express Spry4. To exclude the possibility that the effects seen overexpressing Spry4 were due to apoptosis, the morphology of the nuclei was controlled using the nuclear staining DAPI. Interestingly, overexpression of Spry4 inhibited NGF-induced PC12 neurite outgrowth. A significant reduction in cells bearing neurites was observed after transfection with Myc-tagged Spry4 plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g004">Fig. 4A and 4B</xref>, and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032087.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).

        <title>Sprouty4 Tyr-53 is essential for its inhibitory activity</title>
        <p>To further understand the mechanisms through which Spry4 inhibits NGF signaling, we generated a PC12 cell line expressing a mutant Spry4 in which tyrosine 53 was substituted by Alanine (PC12-Spry4-Y53A cells). Interestingly, this tyrosine is conserved among the four Sprouty family members (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>) and it was reported to have a dominant negative effect enhancing trophic factor-dependent Erk/MAPK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Sasaki1">[12]</xref>. To assess the role of this point mutation, parental PC12 and PC12-Spry4-Y53A cells were stimulated with NGF for 10 and 120 min and then Erk/MAPK activation was measured using anti-phospho-ERK antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, PC12 cells expressing Spry4-Y53A showed a substantial increase in Erk/MAPK activation compared to control cells, indicating that this Y53A substitution generates a non-functional Spry4 mutant, that loses its ability to block NGF-dependent Erk/MAPK pathway.</p>
        <p>Then, we investigate the effect of Spry4 Y53A mutant on NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth. For this purpose, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with control or Myc-tagged Sprouty4 Y53A plasmid in combination with an enhanced GFP. Cells were maintained in the presence of NGF for 72 h and stained with anti-myc antibodies to confirm that all GFP-positive cells express Spry4. Overexpression of Spry4 Y53A could not inhibit NGF-promoted neurite outgrowth, but rather slightly enhanced it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g006">Fig. 6C, 6D</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032087.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we provide evidence that Spry4, a NGF-regulated gene, restricts Erk/MAPK signaling and inhibits Rac1, but not Akt, activation in response to NGF. At molecular level, we identified the Spry4 Tyr-53 as an essential determinant for this inhibitory activity. We also found that Sprouty4 negatively regulates NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells and primary sensory neurons. Hence, we propose that Spry4 acts downstream of TrkA through a negative feedback loop to regulate neuronal differentiation by inhibiting Erk/MAPK signaling and Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

      <p>PC12 cells and sensory neurons had provided to be good models to investigate NGF and FGF-induced neurite outgrowth. While in the present study, we demonstrate that endogenous Spry4 is a physiological negative feedback regulator of NGF-induced neuronal differentiation, previous studies proposed Spry2 and Spry4 as the critical regulators of Erk/MAPK activation related to neuronal cell differentiation in the context of FGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Sasaki1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Lao1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>High-affinity neurotrophin receptors, TrkA, TrkB and TrkC are expressed in distinct populations of DRG neurons where they control axonal development, target-innervation and neuronal survival mediated by NGF, BDNF and NT3, respectively. In particular, the NGF receptor, TrkA, is expressed in 80% of DRG neurons during the third embryonic week in rodents and their proportion drops to 40% postnatally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Ernsberger1">[22]</xref>. Since our results indicate that Spry4 is involved in the differentiation of the TrkA-positive neuron subpopulation, it remains open the question whether other sprouty-family members could be modulating differentiation of other DRG neurons expressing TrkB or TrkC. The fact that Spry2 and Spry3 have been reported to control BDNF signaling in central nervous system neurons suggests that they could also have an analogous function modulating DRG neuronal differentiation by BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Gross1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Panagiotaki1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Sprouty proteins have been shown to attenuate Erk/MAPK activation induced by a plethora of trophic factors, including FGF, HGF, VEGF, BDNF and GDNF. However, the molecular points at which Sprouty proteins disconnect RTK signaling pathways are still controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Li1">[24]</xref>. Hence, even when many reports concluded that Spry may function downstream RTKs but upstream of Ras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Gross2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Lee1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Leeksma1">[27]</xref>, other studies demonstrated that Spry could inhibit RTK signaling at the level of Raf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Yusoff1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Sasaki2">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In particular, mouse Spry4 inhibits VEGF-induced, Ras-independent ERK/MAPK activation at the level of Raf1, but has no effect on EGFR-induced, Ras-dependent activation of Raf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Ayada1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Sasaki3">[30]</xref>. Previous studies demonstrated that NGF activates Erk/MAPK pathway through a Ras-dependent mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Reichardt1">[31]</xref>. Here, using a constitutively active Ras construct (V12 Ras), we found that Spry4 was able to block Ras-dependent Erk/MAPK activation, indicating that in our system Spry4 acts downstream Ras, probably at the level of Raf1.</p>
      <p>As it was previously observed with FGF and GDNF signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Ishida1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Sasaki1">[12]</xref>, overexpression of a dominant negative Spry4 Y53A mutant induced an increase in MAPK activation and cell differentiation in response to NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g006">Fig. 6 B–D</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032087.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Together, these dominant negative effects suggest that Spry4 mutant could be inhibiting other endogenous Sproutys forming homo-and/or hetero-dimers with them. Interestingly, clear differences in tyrosine phosphorylation of the Sprouty proteins by a given growth factor were observed. Thus, Spry1 was reported to be tyrosine phosphorylated by FGF and PDGF, Spry2 by FGF and EGF, whereas Spry4 was not tyrosine phosphorylated in response to any of these factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Mason2">[20]</xref>. Consistent with previous data, we were not able to detect Spry4 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to NGF. According to this, our data demonstrate that Tyr-53 in itself, but not its phosphorylation is required for the inhibitory activity of Spry4 on NGF signaling.</p>
      <p>The regulatory molecules that control the rate of neurite growth and the signals that determine when and where the axons and dendrites have to grow are still largely unknown. Interestingly, Gross <italic>et. al</italic> (2001) reported that overexpression of Spry1 and Spry2 in PC12 cells blocked neurite outgrowth and branching induced by NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Gross2">[10]</xref>. However, these authors failed to detect Spry1 and Spry2 in PC12 cells even after NGF treatment. This finding suggests that Spry1 and Spry2 are not physiologically involved in the morphological differentiation of PC12 cells. Therefore, it appears likely that other Sprouty family member may be up-regulated by NGF to control neurite outgrowth. Here, we characterize Spry4 as a physiological inhibitor of NGF-induced neurite elongation of PC12 cells and primary DRG neurons. Endogenous Spry4 expression was rapid and strongly up-regulated in PC12 cells and DRG neurons upon NGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032087-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In contrast, we could not detect up-regulation of <italic>Spry1</italic> nor <italic>Spry2</italic> mRNAs upon NGF treatment.</p>
      <p>Here, we demonstrate that Spry4, restricts neurite outgrowth induced by NGF without affecting survival. In agreement with this, Srpy4 was able to block Erk/MAPK and Rac1 but not Akt signaling pathway in response to NGF. In agreement with our data, various reports confirmed the role of other Sproutys in the control of neurite growth and branching induced by neurotrophic factors, such as FGF, BDNF and GDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Gross1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Ishida1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Sasaki1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Panagiotaki1">[23]</xref>. In these studies, the authors have also linked the inhibitory effects of Spry2 to the Erk/MAPK pathway. However, Gross et al. have reported that in differentiated central nervous system neurons overexpression of Spry2 favored neuronal apoptosis, whereas its downregulation had a neuroprotective effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Gross1">[8]</xref>, suggesting that the apoptotic cell death might be due to the inhibition of a PI3K/Akt pathway, which is involved in neuronal survival. Edwin et al. reported that Spry2 requires the tumor suppressor phosphatase, PTEN, to inhibit Akt activation induced by the mitogen factor EGF. However, this inhibition of Akt activation by Spry2 is related to anti-proliferative and not to apoptotic effects. Thus, a clear link between apoptotic cell death and Akt inhibition by Spry2 has not been demonstrated yet. The fact that Spry2 antagonizes Akt activation and cell proliferation in response to EGF is consistent with the increase observed in the number of neurons produced by the loss of Spry in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Kramer1">[32]</xref>. More recently, Panagiotaki et al (2010) found that Spry3 also inhibits axonal morphogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> and prevents filopodia formation in spinal cord neurons inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways activated by BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Panagiotaki1">[23]</xref>. Remarkably, Spry3 acts as a very weak inhibitor of Erk/MAPK pathway downstream of BDNF/TrkB signaling. Thus, Sprouty proteins seem to behave as specific modulators of different RTK cascades and not as general inhibitors of RTK-induced MAPK pathway.</p>
      <p>Neurite growth is an established marker of neuronal differentiation that requires the coordinated action of different signaling pathways. Consistent with this, NGF-induced neurite outgrowth have been reported to require a sustained MAPK activation as well as activation of Rac1-related pathways that play a key role regulating cytoskeletal changes. Here, we observed that Spry4 inhibition of TrkA signaling also induces a concomitant reduction of Rac1 activation. Together, our findings provide an insight into the mode of action of Spry on neurotrophin signaling and biology. Work from recent years has revealed that Spry targets are more diverse than originally assumed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Ayada1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Poppleton1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Panagiotaki1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Akbulut1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Tsumura1">[34]</xref>. In this regards, the present inhibition of Rac1-related pathways by Spry4 also contribute to highlight the versatility of this Sprouty family member to regulate diverse trophic factor-induced signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>Our findings indicate that by modulating Spry4 function, NGF and TrkA receptors can regulate Rac1 and Erk/MAPK signaling pathways required for neurite outgrowth. The accurate regulation of neurotrophin signaling is crucial for the normal development of the nervous system. In the developing nervous system, neurite outgrowth is an essential process underlying the formation of highly specific patterns of neuronal connectivity. Abnormalities in neurite formation and extension have been speculated to cause disorganization of neuronal network and eventual neural disorders. Hence, the abnormal expression of Sproutys in different neuronal types, blocking neurotrophic factor signaling, might be associated to neurological diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Sofroniew1">[35]</xref>. Interestingly, mutations in the S<italic>pred1</italic> gene, which codify for a structural and functional protein related to Sprouty, has been identified in pathologies characterized by macroencephaly and mental retardation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Brems1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032087-Spurlock1">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Therefore, further characterization of the mechanisms through which Sprouty proteins are regulated in neurons may contribute to understand the underlying causes of many neurodegenerative diseases and neurological syndromes.</p>
