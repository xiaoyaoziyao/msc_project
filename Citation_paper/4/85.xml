      <abstract>
         <p>Neurodegeneration is often associated with DNA synthesis in neurons, the latter usually remaining for a long time as tetraploid cells before dying by apoptosis. The molecular mechanism preventing G2/M transition in these neurons remains unknown, but it may be reminiscent of the mechanism that maintains tetraploid retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in a G2-like state during normal development, thus preventing their death. Here we show that this latter process, known to depend on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), requires the inhibition of cdk1 by TrkB. We demonstrate that a subpopulation of chick RGCs previously shown to become tetraploid co-expresses TrkB and cdk1 in vivo. By using an in vitro system that recapitulates differentiation and cell cycle re-entry of chick retinal neurons we show that BDNF, employed at concentrations specific for the TrkB receptor, reduces the expression of cdk1 in TrkB-positive, differentiating neurons. In this system, BDNF also inhibits the activity of both endogenous cdk1 and exogenously-expressed cdk1/cyclin B1 complex. This inhibition correlates with the phosphorylation of cdk1 at Tyr15, an effect that can be prevented with K252a, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor commonly used to prevent the activity of neurotrophins through their Trk receptors. The effect of BDNF on cdk1 activity is Tyr15-specific since BDNF cannot prevent the activity of a constitutively active form of cdk1 (Tyr15Phe) when expressed in differentiating retinal neurons. We also show that BDNF-dependent phosphorylation of cdk1 at Tyr15 could not be blocked with MK-1775, a Wee1-selective inhibitor, indicating that Tyr15 phosphorylation in cdk1 does not seem to occur through the canonical mechanism observed in proliferating cells. We conclude that the inhibition of both expression and activity of cdk1 through a BDNF-dependent mechanism contributes to the maintenance of tetraploid RGCs in a G2-like state.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Reactivation of cell cycle and DNA synthesis in neurons represents a common feature of certain neuropathological states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Wang1">[1]</xref>, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and ischemia/hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Burns1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Herrup1">[5]</xref>. Interestingly, neurons that duplicate their DNA are rarely observed to undergo mitosis, and they remain for long time with double the normal amount of DNA in their nuclei before dying by apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Herrup1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Herrup2">[6]</xref>. In contrast to the enormous effort made by several laboratories during the last decade to study the molecular basis for neuronal cell cycle reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Konishi1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo1">[12]</xref>, the mechanism used by neurons to prevent G2/M progression once that the cell cycle has been reactivated is basically unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Herrup1">[5]</xref>. The understanding of this mechanism could facilitate the development of novel approaches to avoid aberrant mitotic events in pathologically-generated tetraploid neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Ogawa1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Wen1">[14]</xref>, thus facilitating their survival.</p>
      <p>We have previously demonstrated that the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF), acting through the common p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), induces cell cycle reactivation in a small population of chick differentiating retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Cell cycle re-entry in these neurons occurs as they migrate from the apical portion of the neuroepithelium, where they are born, to the basal neuroepithelium, where the ganglion cell layer (GCL) arises <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref>. These neurons are known to express E2F1 and E2F4 in the absence of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and, after DNA duplication, they remain in a G2-like state in the GCL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref>. The mechanism preventing G2/M transition in differentiating RGCs that duplicate their DNA depends on the presence of endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref>, which is known to be expressed by the pigment epithelium that surrounds the retina, and the retina itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade1">[16]</xref>. In the absence of BDNF, differentiating tetraploid RGCs upregulate cyclin B2 expression, undergo G2/M transition, and die by apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade4">[19]</xref>, a process that can be blocked with cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade2">[17]</xref>. Cell cycle reentry in differentiating RGCs and maintenance of these cells in a G2-like state can be considered as part of a physiological process taking place in the developing nervous system aimed at inducing somatic tetraploidy in specific neuronal types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-LpezSnchez1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-LpezSnchez2">[21]</xref>. Overall, these observations are compatible with BDNF being also responsible for the maintenance in a G2-like state of pathologically-generated tetraploid neurons, thus preventing their death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade5">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Neurotrophins, including NGF, BDNF, neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and NT4/5, are trophic factors with multiple functions in both the developing and adult nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Skaper1">[23]</xref>. These factors are known to transduce their signals through two different types of receptors: p75<sup>NTR</sup> and the members of the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Dechant1">[24]</xref>. While p75<sup>NTR</sup> can be activated with low affinity by all neurotrophins, signaling of each of the four mammalian neurotrophins can also be mediated through activation of one of the three members of the Trk family: TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, which are high affinity receptors for NGF, BDNF/NT4, and NT3, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Skaper1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Dechant1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>G2/M transition in proliferating cells is regulated by cdk1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Lees1">[25]</xref>, suggesting that this cyclin B-dependent kinase may play an important role in BDNF-dependent G2/M arrest. In this study we show that TrkB is expressed in a subpopulation of differentiating RGCs susceptible to become tetraploid in vivo. We also show that cdk1 colocalizes with TrkB in these neurons, and that BDNF, likely acting through the neurotrophin receptor TrkB, decreases the expression and activity of cdk1 in differentiating chick retinal neurons (DCRNs) that have reactivated the cell cycle in response to NGF. We also provide evidence that the mechanism used by BDNF to prevent cdk1 activity in NGF-treated DCRNs is likely based on TrkB-dependent, Wee1-independent Tyr15 phosphorylation of cdk1.</p>

         <p>Electroporation of retinal explants was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref>. Briefly, E6 chick retinas were dissected away from the pigment epithelium and fragmented into small pieces of around 10 mm<sup>2</sup>. These retinal fragments were laid onto a glass coverslips and subsequently immersed in 4 µl PBS containing different plasmid combinations. Electroporation was performed with four 50 milliseconds pulses of 25–27 V, at a 200 milliseconds frequency. After electroporation, the explants were grown in suspension for 3–4 h in 50% Dulbecco-Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/50% F12 HAM (Sigma) with N2 supplement (Sigma) (DMEM/F12/N2). Explants were then collected, dissociated, and cultured as described below. To facilitate EGFP visualization, cells were immunostained with and anti-GFP antibody. As an average, 0.5–1% of DCRNs were observed to express GFP in these cultures.</p>

         <p>To verify whether the BDNF neurotrophic receptor TrkB is expressed by the RGCs in vivo during the period of neuronal tetraploidization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref>, E6 chick embryos were fixed and dorso-ventral cryosections containing the central retina were subjected to immunohistochemistry with a TrkB-specific antibody. In the E6 embryonic retina, TrkB-specific immunoreactivity was observed in a subpopulation of differentiating RGCs, as defined by the expression of βIII tubulin and their localization close to the vitreal surface, where the prospective GCL resides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Most of the TrkB-positive RGCs were observed to lack Rb expression (69 out of 86 neurons, n = 2 embryos), and those positive for Rb expressed it at extremely low levels as compared with precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

         <p>We hypothesized that the G2/M arrest induced by BDNF in differentiating RGCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref> should be mediated through a putative effect of its neurotrophic receptor TrkB on cdk1. Therefore, the precise localization of cdk1 in the E6 chick retina was studied using cdk1-specific antibodies. Cdk1 immunostaining was detected in the cytoplasm of a subset of retinal cells as well as in a minority of nuclei often located at the apical side of the neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) where mitosis takes place, as expected from the nuclear translocation of cdk1 during prophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-DeSouza1">[42]</xref>. A similar pattern was observed with two alternative antibodies that recognize an additional epitope within the C-terminus of the molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g002">Fig. 2B,D</xref>). To verify whether cdk1 is expressed in differentiating, p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive RGCs double immunostaining was performed with antibodies specific for cdk1 and p75<sup>NTR</sup> in cryosections from E6 chick retinas.

This analysis demonstrated that BDNF is able to significantly reduce the levels of cdk1 in DCRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g004">Fig. 4A,B</xref>), an effect that was not due to the selective response of a subpopulation of DCRNs to BDNF, as revealed by cdk1-specific immunohistochemistry (data not shown).

         <title>BDNF Reduces cdk1 Specific Activity in DCRNs</title>
         <p>The relatively small decrease of cdk1 expression in response to BDNF is likely insufficient to fully prevent G2/M transition in DCRNs. To test whether BDNF can also alter the specific activity of cdk1 in these neurons, an in vitro kinase assay, based on the capacity of cdk1 to phosphorylate in vitro an Rb-specific peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Suzuki1">[40]</xref>, was performed. To this aim cell extracts from DCRNs cultured for 20 h in the presence of 100 ng/ml NGF to facilitate cell cycle re-entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade2">[17]</xref>, and treated for 30 min before cell extraction with either 2 ng/ml BDNF or vehicle were used. In this assay, cdk1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-cdk1 antibody that specifically recognizes this cdk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Poon1">[39]</xref> and the kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates was then normalized to the level of cdk1 present in the input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g005">Fig. 5B, left panel</xref>). This analysis demonstrated that the addition of BDNF to the retinal cells resulted in a significant reduction of endogenous cdk1 specific activity, already after 30 min of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g005">Fig 5B, right panel</xref>). The effect of BDNF was specific for cdk1 since parallel kinase assays performed with non-immunoprecipitated cell extracts, which may also contain other cdks capable to phosphorylate the Rb-specific peptide used for this assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Suzuki1">[40]</xref>, did not result in significant differences of general cdk activity in response to BDNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).

         <title>Post-translational Regulation of cdk1 by BDNF</title>
         <p>The decrease of cdk1 specific activity triggered by BDNF in DCRNs could be due to the known inhibitory effect of this neurotrophin on cyclin B1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade2">[17]</xref>. Nevertheless, additional post-translational mechanisms could also participate in the reduction of cdk1 specific activity by BDNF. To test this hypothesis, E6 retinal cells were co-electroporated with both cdk1 and cyclin B1 pIRES2-EGFP expression vectors, and then cultured for 20 h under neurogenic conditions in the presence of different combinations of 100 ng/ml NGF and 2 ng/ml BDNF. Global analysis of cdk1 activity could not be performed in these cultures since only a small proportion of DCRNs was observed to become electroporated (see Materials and Methods). Therefore, we decided to use the mitotic index of transfected DCRNs as an indirect measure of cdk1 activity in these neurons, since the activation of ectopic cdk1 in cells co-expressing cyclin B1 is expected to increase the proportion of cells in mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Norbury1">[43]</xref>. This analysis demonstrated that NGF favored the presence of mitotic figures in the transfected cells and that the presence of BDNF dramatically prevented this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). We also analyzed the apoptotic effect of cdk1/cyclinB1 overexpression in DCRNs treated with different combinations of 100 ng/ml NGF and 2 ng/ml BDNF. As expected from previous studies showing that BDNF prevents cell cycle re-entry-dependent cell death in DCRNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade2">[17]</xref>, BDNF was able to inhibit NGF-dependent cell death in cdk1/cyclin B1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that BDNF can modify the activity of cdk1 independently of its capacity to regulate cdk1 and cyclin B1 expression since this neurotrophin was able to induce G2/M arrest and prevent cell death in DNRNs exogenously expressing the cdk1/cyclin B1 complex.</p>

         <title>BDNF Induces Tyr15 Phosphorylation of cdk1, thus Inhibiting its Activity</title>
         <p>To decipher the molecular mechanism used by BDNF to prevent cdk1 activity in NGF-treated DCRNs, we became inspired by a previous study showing that TrkB activation leads to cdk5 phosphorylation in Tyr15 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Cheung1">[44]</xref>. Cdk5, a member of the cdk family that lacks capacity to regulate the cell cycle, becomes activated upon Tyr15 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Cheung1">[44]</xref>. In contrast, phosphorylation of cdk1 at Tyr15 is known to functionally inhibit its kinase activity, thus preventing G2/M transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Norbury1">[43]</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that BDNF, through its TrkB receptor, could lead to Tyr15 phosphorylation of cdk1, thus inhibiting its kinase activity. Western blot cannot be used for unambiguous quantification of phospho-cdk1 levels in cell extracts since the sequence of cdk1 flanking Tyr15 is conserved in cdk2, and the anti-phospho-cdk1 antibodies cannot discriminate between phospho-cdk1 and phospho-cdk2. Immunoprecipitation of cdk1 with a specific antibody, followed by western blot using an anti-phospho-cdk1 cannot be performed either. Indeed, two different antibodies against phospho-cdk1 were observed to detect intense, unspecific bands of molecular weight similar to cdk1 in three different sources of Protein A/G beads (data not shown). Therefore, the hypothesis that BDNF leads to Tyr15 phosphorylation of cdk1 was tested using sandwich ELISA. This assay, able to quantify the amount of both total cdk1 and Tyr15-phosphorylated cdk1, was performed in cell lysates derived from DCRNs maintained for 20 h in the presence of either 100 ng/ml NGF or vehicle, and treated with either 2 ng/ml BDNF or vehicle 30 min before cell extraction. Two different antibodies were used for the sandwich ELISA assay, an anti-cdk1-specific antibody employed for coating and another antibody recognizing the phospho-Tyr15 site of cdk1. As a control, the sandwich ELISA assay was able to specifically detect as low as 10 fg of cdk1-GST chimeric protein, as compared to 10 fg of GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Moreover, our sandwich ELISA assay can detect cdk1 phosphorylated in Tyr15 since the signal obtained with the anti-cdk1 antibody recognizing phosphoTyr15 was significantly reduced in cell lysates incubated with CIP as compared with control cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). The sandwich ELISA assay demonstrated that the addition of 2 ng/ml BDNF to DCRNs previously treated with 100 ng/ml NGF significantly increased the levels of phosphoTyr15 in cdk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>), thus explaining the capacity of BDNF to trigger G2/M arrest in NGF-treated DCRNs. The effect of BDNF on cdk1 phosphorylation was regulated by TrkB since K252a, a protein kinase inhibitor known to prevent TrkB activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Berg1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Almeida1">[46]</xref>, was able to inhibit BDNF-dependent phosphorylation of cdk1 at Tyr15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>).</p>

         <p>Interestingly, in the presence of NGF at 1 ng/ml, BDNF was not able to induce cdk1 Tyr15 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). Although NGF can induce TrkA-dependent biological effects at 1 ng/ml <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Kaplan1">[37]</xref>, this latter concentration is below the half maximal effect of NGF to induce p75<sup>NTR</sup>-dependent cell cycle re-entry in DCRNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade2">[17]</xref>. We conclude therefore that the effect of BDNF on cdk1 phosphorylation does not require a previous activation of TrkA by NGF. In contrast, it seems that p75<sup>NTR</sup> needs to be efficiently activated by NGF to allow the effect of BDNF on cdk1 phosphorylation.</p>

         <title>BDNF cannot Prevent the Apoptotic Effect of a Constitutively Active form of cdk1 on DCRNs</title>
         <p>To test whether BDNF could use additional mechanisms to prevent cdk1 activity, E6 retinal cells were co-electroporated with two pIRES2-EGFP vectors expressing both cyclin B1 and a constitutively active form of cdk1 in which Tyr15 has been substituted by Phe (Tyr15Phe) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Fletcher1">[32]</xref>. Then, E6 retinal cells were cultured for 20 h under neurogenic conditions in the presence of different combinations of 100 ng/ml NGF and 2 ng/ml BDNF. Overexpression of the mutated form of cdk1 was able to induce ectopic mitoses followed by cell death. The percentage of detectable mitoses after 20 h of treatment was very small (&lt;1%), suggesting that the presence of an active form of cdk1 may accelerate the mitotic process. This notion was confirmed when G2/M transition was blocked with nocodazole, a known inhibitor of the microtubule polymerization. Application of 0.4 µg/ml nocodazole for 18 h resulted in the presence of phosphoHistone H3 in a significant number of DCRNs previously transfected with the mutated form of cdk1 and maintained in the presence of 100 ng/ml NGF (11 out of 110 cells analyzed), as well as low levels of apoptosis, measured as the percentage of cells showing pyknotic nuclei (2 out of 110 cells analyzed). In contrast, apoptosis was readily observed in the transfected cells cultured in the absence of nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064890-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).

      <p>We have demonstrated the presence of cdk1 in cells that undergo ectopic mitosis at the basal portion of the retina, previously identified as differentiating RGCs that have reactivated the cell cycle and are about to undergo apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref>, indicating that the common mechanism for G2/M transition can be active in these cells. This observation is consistent with a previous study in the quail showing cdk1 expression in postmitotic RGCs before they are fully differentiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Espanel1">[49]</xref>. We provide two lines of evidence demonstrating that cdk1 function can be regulated by BDNF in tetraploid neurons. Firstly, we demonstrate that BDNF reduces the levels of cdk1 protein, but not of <italic>Cdk1</italic> mRNA, in DCRNs, thus suggesting that BDNF uses a post-translational mechanism for this regulation. Although the expression of cdk1 has been shown to be downregulated as the retina differentiates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Espanel1">[49]</xref>, the effect of BDNF on cdk1 expression is likely specific since this neurotrophin cannot induce neuronal differentiation in retinal precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-DelaRosa1">[50]</xref>. Secondly, using a kinase assay we have shown that BDNF is also able to reduce cdk1 specific activity in DCRNs-derived extracts. This reduction of the specific activity of cdk1 cannot simply be explained by the known decrease of cyclin B2 expression triggered by BDNF in NGF-treated DCRNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade2">[17]</xref>, since BDNF was able to prevent cdk1 activity and apoptosis in NGF-treated DCRNs that over-express both cdk1 and cyclin B1. The regulation by BDNF of cdk1 expression and function in tetraploid neurons is reminiscent from the effect of NGF on this cdk during NGF-dependent PC12 cell differentiation, which leads to the reduction of the cdk1 protein levels and a decrease in its enzymatic activity, an effect accelerated in cells that over-express TrkA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Buchkovich1">[51]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Most of this study has been performed with embryonic retinal cells cultured under neurogenic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade6">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade7">[34]</xref>, and treated with NGF to induce cell cycle re-entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade2">[17]</xref>. In these cultures, BDNF is likely acting through the neurotrophic receptor TrkB, which is expressed by all DCRNs. Indeed, picomolar concentrations of BDNF (i.e. 2 ng/ml), known to be specific for its high-affinity receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-RodrguezTbar1">[38]</xref>, can induce G2/M arrest in NGF-treated DCRNs. Moreover, the use of K252a, a known inhibitor of protein kinases commonly used to prevent the activation by neurotrophins of Trk receptors including TrkB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Berg1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Almeida1">[46]</xref>, was able to prevent BDNF-dependent phosphorylation of cdk1 at Tyr15. As in the DCRNs, BDNF is also likely to induce TrkB-dependent G2/M arrest in tetraploid RGCs in vivo since BDNF is expressed in the pigment epithelium and retina during the period of RGC differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade1">[16]</xref>, and we have shown TrkB immunoreactivity in differentiating RGCs lacking Rb expression, known to become tetraploid in response to endogenous NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The mechanism used by BDNF to directly inhibit the activity of cdk1 relies on Tyr15 phosphorylation of this cdk. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that BDNF cannot prevent in DCRNs the apoptotic effect of a constitutively active form of cdk1 in which Tyr15 has been substituted by a Phe residue. In proliferating cells, cdk1 is phosphorylated in Tyr15 by the G2/M check point kinase Wee1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Parker1">[47]</xref>, thus preventing its biological activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Norbury1">[43]</xref>. Interestingly, Wee1 has been shown to be expressed by differentiating neurons, playing an essential role for the initial differentiation prior to axonal polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Mller1">[52]</xref>, and also by adult neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Tomashevski1">[53]</xref>. In agreement with a cell cycle-independent role of Wee1 in differentiating neurons we have shown that a selective inhibitor of this latter kinase, used at a concentration previously shown to block Wee1 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Hirai1">[48]</xref>, was unable to inhibit the effect of BDNF on cdk1 phosphorylation. Based on the above evidence, we can rule out the participation of Wee1 in the signaling pathway initiated by TrkB to arrest tetraploid neurons in G2. TrkB might regulate cdk1 activity by either direct interaction followed by Tyr15 phosphorylation, as it has been shown for cdk5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Cheung1">[44]</xref>, or by cdk1 phosphorylation by other protein kinases acting downstream of TrkB. In this latter case, it is noteworthy that cdk1 can be inactivated by Tyr15 phosphorylation in an ERK-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Ray1">[54]</xref>, the latter being a major pathway activated by Trk receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Reichardt1">[55]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Neurotrophin signaling has proven to be highly complex due to the existence of different receptors with intricate functionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Dechant1">[24]</xref>. There is published evidence that Trk receptor-dependent signaling can be modulated by p75<sup>NTR</sup> activation with heterologous ligands. For instance, BDNF binding to p75<sup>NTR</sup> has been shown to modulate both NGF/TrkA- and NT3/TrkC-dependent signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-MacPhee1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Ivanisevic1">[58]</xref>. A similar situation is observed in our study. We have demonstrated that TrkB-dependent phosphorylation, but not expression regulation, of cdk1 in DRCNs required previous activation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> by NGF. This observation suggests that the levels of cdk1 expression in DCRNs are not modulated by Tyr15 phosphorylation. BDNF-dependent phosphorylation of cdk1 at Tyr15 does not seem to require TrkA activity since a p75<sup>NTR</sup> suboptimal concentration of NGF (1 ng/ml) was unable to facilitate the effect of BDNF in Tyr15 cdk1 phosphorylation. This latter observation is consistent with the capacity of a p75<sup>NTR</sup> blocking antibody to prevent NGF-dependent cell cycle re-entry in DCRNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade2">[17]</xref>. The mechanism used by p75<sup>NTR</sup> to facilitate the phosphorylation of cdk1 at Tyr15 is currently unknown and further studies will be necessary to fully characterize it.</p>
      <p>Cdk1 expression has been shown to be downregulated at E8 in the developing quail retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Espanel1">[49]</xref>, a stage equivalent to E10–11 in the chick embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Padgett1">[59]</xref>. At this stage, chick RGCs generation has been completed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Prada1">[60]</xref>, and the number of high-affinity binding sites for BDNF is dramatically reduced by this age in the chick retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade1">[16]</xref>. Altogether, these observations indicate that the mechanism described in this study for BDNF-dependent inhibition of cdk1, required for tetraploid neuron survival during development, seems to be restricted to a specific temporal window just when RGCs differentiate.</p>
      <p>BDNF-dependent G2/M arrest in tetraploid neurons has been shown to prevent cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Morillo2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade2">[17]</xref>. Likewise, mitotic arrest with nocodazole reduced the levels of cell death in DCRNs transfected with a constitutively active form of cdk1. These observations suggest that cdk1 activity may participate in the induction of apoptosis in these neurons. In this regard, neuronal cdk1 activation can lead to nuclear accumulation of FOXO1 and the phosphorylation of Bad, thus triggering apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Konishi1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Yuan1">[61]</xref>. The hypothetical prevention of neuronal apoptosis by BDNF through inactivation of cdk1 might be a crucial mechanism for the maintenance of tetraploid neurons during both embryonic development and also in the normal and pathological adult brain. In this regard, active cdk1/cyclin B1 kinase has been found to be enriched in AD neurons with neurofibrillary tangles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Nagy1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Pei1">[65]</xref>, and BDNF is known to facilitate neuronal survival in a number of neurodegenerative disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Zuccato1">[66]</xref>. The known decrease of BDNF and TrkB in the brain at late stages of AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Ferrer1">[67]</xref> could therefore facilitate neuronal degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064890-Frade5">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In sum, in this study we have provided evidence for a novel mechanism likely based on the activity of the TrkB neurotrophic receptor, which regulates the maintenance of vertebrate tetraploid neurons in a G2-like state, thus preventing their death. This mechanism might be active in neurodegenerative states in which neuronal tetraploidization is known to occur.</p>
