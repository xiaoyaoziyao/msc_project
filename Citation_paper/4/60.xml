          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Urbanization is the most prevailing cause of habitat transformation
                        worldwide, differing from others by its intense levels of human activity.
                        Despite its obvious impact on wildlife, it is still unclear why and how some
                        species are able to adapt to urban settings. One possibility is that fear of
                        humans and vehicles could preclude most species from invading cities.
                        Species entering urban environments might be those that are more tolerant of
                        human disturbance (i.e., <italic>tame species</italic>). Alternatively or in
                        addition, urban invaders could be a fraction of <italic>variable
                            species</italic>, with “tame” individuals invading urban
                        habitats and other individuals remaining in rural areas.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology</title>
          <p>Using the contemporary urban invasion by birds in a recently established
                        South American city, we tested both hypotheses by relating interspecific
                        differences in invasiveness to their flight initiation distances (i.e., the
                        distances at which birds flee from approaching cars, FID), as well as to
                        their relative brain size (RBS), a correlate of measures of behavioral
                        flexibility.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Urban invasiveness was not significantly related to species' average
                        rural FIDs but positively related to their RBS and inter-individual
                        variability in FID. Moreover, FIDs were consistently lower in urban than in
                        rural conspecifics, and the FIDs of urban individuals were within the
                        lower-range distribution of their rural conspecifics. RBS indirectly
                        influenced urban invasion through its positive effect on inter-individual
                        variability in FID.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Urban invaders do not appear to be individuals from apparently
                            <italic>tame</italic> species, but rather <italic>tame</italic>
                        individuals from species with a variable response regarding fear of people.
                        Given the positive relationship between RBS and inter-individual variability
                        in FID, our results suggest that behavioural flexibility should be regarded
                        as a specific trait encompassing variability among individuals. Further
                        research is needed to ascertain the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying
                        the relationship between brain size and inter-individual variability in
                        behavioural traits.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Urbanization can be considered one of the most severe and lasting forms of land-use
                modification which is occurring unchecked worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-McKinney1">[1]</xref>. Approximately half of the
                human population currently lives in cities, with the proportion of those residing in
                urban environments increasing rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Ellis1">[2]</xref>; thus, an intensification of the
                current biodiversity crisis associated with this urban expansion into native
                ecosystems is expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-McKinney1">[1]</xref>. Therefore, the urbanization process is a challenge for
                biodiversity conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Dearborn1">[3]</xref> but it also presents a unique scenario for evolutionary
                biologists to study specific traits that make some species better at colonizing new
                niches than others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Diamond1">[4]</xref>. Birds offer a good study model for this purpose because
                while many species are negatively affected by the current spread of urbanization
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Beissinger1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Chace1">[6]</xref> others such as the house sparrow (<italic>Passer
                    domesticus</italic>) are almost exclusively urban dwellers.</p>
      <p>Despite its intuitive significance, fear of humans has been largely overlooked as a
                behavioural trait precluding the entrance of some species into urban environments
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Mller1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Mller2">[8]</xref>. Humans are
                potential predators of birds, to the point that their flight initiation distances
                (i.e. the distance at which birds flee from approaching humans, hereafter FID) have
                been considered as measures of antipredatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Blumstein1">[9]</xref> and of anthropogenic
                stressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Tarlow1">[10]</xref>. In
                fact, there is ample evidence that pedestrian activity causes disturbance, measured
                as FIDs, in natural habitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Ikuta1">[11]</xref>. Besides people, cars and other vehicles are omnipresent
                in urban areas, and can seriously disturb neophobic species and/or individuals. In
                this context, the notions of neophobia and neophilia (i.e., the spontaneous aversion
                or attraction of an animal to a food item, object, or place because it is novel
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Greenberg1">[12]</xref>) are
                known to be important since they may play a decisive role in the ability of an
                individual to face new situations and may greatly influence an animal's
                apparent cognitive ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Greenberg1">[12]</xref>. Car traffic is known to affect breeding densities and
                activity patterns of birds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Bautista1">[13]</xref>, also causing direct mortality through road kills. A
                recent review on the effects of road traffic on the distribution and abundance of
                animals shows that species are negatively affected due to direct disturbance or car
                casualties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Fahrig1">[14]</xref>.
                In cities, cars usually travel at low velocity and it could be expected that
                disturbance effects could be more important than direct mortalities.</p>
      <p>Here, we tested two non-alternative hypotheses to explain avian urban invasions
                related to fear of humans and their accompanying vehicles. First, birds entering
                urban environments might belong to <italic>tame species</italic>, i.e. those more
                tolerant of human disturbance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Mller1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Mller2">[8]</xref>. Individuals trade-off early flight for other activities
                such as resource acquisition, reproduction or rest, so bird species showing lower
                FIDs would be more able to cope with human disturbance and invade cities than
                species that do not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Mller1">[7]</xref>. Under this hypothesis, we predicted that if urban
                invaders belong to the group of <italic>tame species</italic> then the main factor
                explaining variability in invasiveness among species should be their mean FID
                    (M<sub>FID</sub>) measured in rural (i.e. ‘natural’) habitats. A
                within-species corollary prediction is that FIDs of urban individuals would not
                significantly differ from FIDs of conspecifics living in rural habitats. Second,
                individuals entering urban areas could belong to <italic>variable species</italic>,
                i.e. those species whose individuals respond differently to human presence. In this
                case, urban invasion would be mainly possible by tame individuals from species
                showing larger inter-individual variability in their response to human disturbance,
                measured as the coefficient of variation of FID (CV<sub>FID</sub>) in rural
                habitats. As a within-species corollary prediction, urban individuals should show
                shorter FIDs than their rural conspecifics. This idea derives from the
                disturbance-induced habitat selection hypothesis recently proposed by Carrete &amp;
                Tella <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete1">[15]</xref> and
                from a recent study testing the importance of individual variability in FID in urban
                invasiveness in the Old World <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Mller2">[8]</xref>. Carrete &amp; Tella <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete1">[15]</xref> showed a strong individual
                consistency in FIDs (repeatability: 0.84–0.92) of burrowing owls
                    (<italic>Athene cunicularia</italic>), suggesting that individuals may
                distribute themselves among breeding sites depending on their susceptibility to
                human disturbance. This has been recently supported by Evans <italic>et al.</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Evans1">[16]</xref>, who found
                differences in behavioural syndromes linked to FID between rural and urban song
                sparrows (<italic>Melospiza melodia</italic>). Moreover, Møller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Mller2">[8]</xref> showed a
                significant contribution of variability in FIDs in explaining urban invasiveness in
                the Old World. Although this result is of great importance in the understanding of
                urban invasiveness, the current set of urban species might have resulted from
                multiple processes of colonization, adaptation and extinction likely undergone by
                urban bird populations in European countries, where the thousand-year-old cities may
                have experienced changes in human attitudes towards birds as well as in habitat
                conditions. Thus, as stated long ago by Diamond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Diamond1">[4]</xref>, the study of urban invasions
                should also be carried out in areas where urbanization processes are recent and thus
                contemporary evolution is actually at work.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the colonization by bird species of these newly urbanized areas is better
                explained by some yet unexplored components of behavioural flexibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol2">[18]</xref> rather than by
                their fear of humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Mller2">[8]</xref>, so we also considered this possibility. Different
                evidence suggests that large brains, relative to body size, can confer advantages to
                individuals to modify their behaviour in potentially adaptive ways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol2">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Lefebvre1">[19]</xref>. Such
                enhanced behavioural flexibility is predicted to lend fitness benefits to
                individuals facing novel or altered environmental conditions, an idea known as the
                brain size-environmental change hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Reader1">[20]</xref>. Larger brains allow animals to
                process, integrate, and store more information about their environment, enhancing
                the capacity of individuals to modify or acquire new behaviours (innovations) in
                flexible ways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Lefebvre1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Lefebvre2">[23]</xref>. In this sense, species with relatively large brains
                would tend to be more successful in establishing themselves in new environments by
                enhancing their innovation propensity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol1">[17]</xref>. Under this behavioural flexibility hypothesis, our
                prediction is that species with relatively larger brains will be better at invading
                urban sites than species with smaller brain sizes.</p>
      <p>To properly assess the relative importance of fear of humans and relative brain size
                (RBS) in urban invasiveness, we simultaneously tested the contribution of mean FID,
                within-species FID variability and RBS through Generalized Linear Mixed Models. We
                also included potentially confounding variables previously shown to be related to
                avian invasiveness such as dietary and habitat generalism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Cassey1">[24]</xref>, environmental tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Bonier1">[25]</xref>, and abundance
                of the species in rural habitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Cassey1">[24]</xref>, as well as body size because of its positive
                relationship to FID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Blumstein1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Cooke1">[26]</xref>. To avoid biases derived from the long-term coexistence
                between people and birds in ancient cities, we focused on a recently urbanized
                system to test behavioural traits underlying urban invasion as a contemporary
                process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Diamond1">[4]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Urban invasiveness of the study species was scored into three rough categories (null
                or occasional, medium and high) based on their within-species relative abundances in
                rural and urban areas. Univariate analyses showed that urban invasiveness was
                positively related to the relative brain size (RBS, calculated as the residuals of a
                log-log linear regression of brain mass against body mass) and the inter-individual
                variability in flight initiation distance (CV<sub>FID</sub>, measured as the
                coefficient of variation in FID) of 42 species measured in rural habitats, but not
                to their average FID (M<sub>FID</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018859-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Invasiveness was also marginally related to their
                between-species relative abundance in surrounding rural areas and body size, the
                most common and smaller species being more likely to invade cities. Species invading
                urban habitats were also those showing higher habitat generalism (obtained as the
                number of the major habitat types recorded in the literature for each species), a
                relationship that was marginally significant. Dietary generalism (obtained as the
                number of the major food types recorded in the literature for each species) and
                environmental tolerance (calculated as the whole latitudinal distribution of each

      <p>Among urban invading species, an intraspecific comparison of 20 species present in
                urban and rural habitats consistently showed lower FIDs in urban than in rural
                conspecifics in all examined species (Paired t-test,
                Z = −4.02, P&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018859-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Moreover, the distributions of FIDs of
                urban individuals were all within the lower-tail range distributions of their
                conspecifics living in rural habitats (see the two species with larger sample sizes
                in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018859-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that tame
                individuals belonging to species consisting of a gradient between tame and less tame
                individuals, are those entering into urban areas. Notably, one of the species shown

                previously demonstrated high within-individual repeatability in FID (see Methods).
                All these results offer support to our predictions of higher urban invasiveness

      <p>Furthermore, we tested the relative importance of inter-individual variability in FID
                and relative brain size in urban invasiveness. Generalized Linear Mixed Models
                showed that only CV<sub>FID</sub> was significantly retained
                (F<sub>1,6</sub> = 6.05, P = 0.049), RBS
                losing all explanatory power (F<sub>1,6</sub> = 0.03,
                P = 0.86) when its role was simultaneously tested with
                    CV<sub>FID</sub>. This result comes from the strong covariation between RBS and
                    CV<sub>FID</sub> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59;
                F<sub>1,8</sub> = 17.04, P = 0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018859-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), showing a positive
                relationship between inter-individual variability in FID and relative brain size. No
                other variable was significantly retained with CV<sub>FID</sub> in these set of

      <p>Finally, we constructed Confirmatory Path Analysis to ascertain the actual links
                between inter-individual variability in FID, RBS and urban invasiveness (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018859-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). In particular, we tested
                whether large brains and large inter-individual variability in FID may enhance urban
                invasiveness in an additive way (model 1), whether large brains could promote larger
                variability in FIDs among individuals thus increasing urban invasiveness (model 2),
                or whether large brains have both direct and indirect (through increased
                    CV<sub>FID</sub>) positive effects on urban invasiveness (model 3). The model
                with lowest AIC (model 2) supports a positive effect of RBS on variability in FID
                that enhances urban invasiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018859-g005">Fig.
                    5</xref>). Although AIC differences between model 2 and 3 are &lt;2, the lack of
                significance of the path from RBS to urban invasiveness in the last model makes them
                both biologically equivalent. These results thus suggest that large brains can
                promote urban invasiveness indirectly, through an increment in variability in FIDs
                at the species level, but not directly through enhanced cognitive abilities or other
                skills. Alternative models, including the rest of explanatory variables, did not
                include any additional statistically significant variable and showed differences in

        <title>Fear of humans and urban invasiveness</title>
        <p>Literature on introduced species suggests that behavioural flexibility, in the
                    form of learning, cognition and/or rapid adjustment to new conditions, allows
                    animals to be successful when invading novel habitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol3">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol4">[28]</xref>. However, unlike typical
                    biological invasions, urban areas present birds with all of the novel conditions
                    characteristic of new environments (e.g., food resources, competitors, or
                    breeding sites) as well as an extraordinary selective factor, i.e. humans. In
                    this sense, our study indicates that species that are variable regarding their
                    fear of humans and/or vehicles, which are also those with relatively larger
                    brains, are more likely to invade urban habitats than apparently tame species.
                    Abundant, small and generalist species also tended to show higher urban
                    invasiveness. However, when simultaneously tested, only the effect of
                    variability in FID remains significant, suggesting that the ability to cope with
                    this extreme anthropogenic habitat change can be largely related to
                    inter-individual variability in a specific behavioural trait such as fearfulness
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Evans1">[16]</xref>.
                    Within-species variability in fear of people thus emerges as a proximate
                    behaviour that could explain urban invasion by a small subsample of tame
                    individuals, while RBS could be the ultimate responsible behind the variability
                    in this behaviour among individuals, as suggested by our confirmatory path
                    analysis. Our results obtained from a contemporary scenario of invasion strongly
                    support the suggestion by Møller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Mller2">[8]</xref> of a selection of individuals
                    with reduced FID in urban environments.</p>
        <p>While admitting that other unexplored behavioural traits related to brain size or
                    FID could also contribute to explaining urban invasiveness, our results suggest
                    that only tame individuals from variable species would cross the disturbance
                    frontier and thus be able to live in urban environments, hence supporting the
                    disturbance-induced habitat selection hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete1">[15]</xref>. One could ask why
                    individuals from apparently tame species do not become urban invaders. The
                    likely answer would be that individual fearfulness (as measured through FID)
                    must be interpreted regarding its within-species variability. Both risk
                    perception and the costs of fleeing from people likely vary among species, and
                    thus just the FID of an individual tells us little about its tolerance of people
                    if it is not compared with the variability shown by its conspecifics. In this
                    sense, variable species seem to include some individuals which perceive human
                    proximity as less risky than their conspecifics, being thus able to coexist with
                    people. However, in species with low variability all individuals would be
                    similarly affected by human disturbance, creating few opportunities for some
                    individuals to invade urban areas.</p>
        <p>Looking for alternative explanations to the above hypothesis, the low FIDs of
                    urban individuals compared to their rural conspecifics could partially result
                    from individuals habituating to human disturbance after they settled in cities,
                    thus increasing their tameness with time. Cooke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Cooke1">[26]</xref> found 30 years ago that
                    birds tend to be more approachable in urban than in rural habitats, suggesting
                    that birds in urban areas come into contact with people more often and with
                    greater proximity, having a greater opportunity to learn within what distance a
                    human can approach before being a danger. Since then, habituation has been often
                    argued to explain differences in FID among areas with different human
                    disturbance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-RodrguezPrieto1">[29]</xref>. Those studies, however, were based on population
                    means instead of on individual responses to an increased human presence. The
                    only study so far dealing with changes in individual responses did not find
                    evidence for a consistent short-term individual habituation to human disturbance
                    in rural birds, using the same burrowing owl population included in this study
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete1">[15]</xref>.
                    Habituation was neither supported when relating the differences in FID between
                    urban and rural conspecifics to time as species become urban in Old-World cities
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Mller1">[7]</xref>.
                    Nonetheless, further research on habituation is needed. Despite the strong
                    within-individual consistency in FID found, some burrowing owls slightly
                    habituated to human disturbance while others became more afraid of people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete1">[15]</xref>, and we
                    cannot discard the possibility that the relationship between individual
                    consistency in FID and habituation could change among species.</p>

        <title>Brain size, individual behaviour and behavioural flexibility</title>
        <p>The brain size-environmental change hypothesis predicts that behavioural
                    flexibility carries fitness benefits to individuals facing novel or altered
                    environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol1">[17]</xref>. The principle underlying this hypothesis is the idea
                    that enlarged brains afford advantages to individuals in dealing with
                    environmental change when the response demands behavioural flexibility in the
                    form of learning and innovation. Relative brain size correlates with measures of
                    behavioural flexibility, linked to, for example, innovation capacities and the
                    ability to deal with new environments, which could satisfactorily explain the
                    success of several species as alien invaders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol4">[28]</xref>. From these studies, one could
                    assume that individuals from large brain species are equally flexible. However,
                    recent research shows that species often exhibit inter-individual differences in
                    their responses to a variety of situations such as feeding, mating, or
                    avoiding/escaping predators. These behavioural tendencies, personality traits or
                    behavioural syndromes (such as activity, shyness-boldness, exploration, and
                    aggressiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Rale1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sih1">[31]</xref>) can greatly determine how these species respond to
                    changes such as those produced by human development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Evans1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sih1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Dall1">[32]</xref>.</p>
        <p>A growing number of studies show that the majority of a population's niche
                    width is determined by inter-individual variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Roughgarden1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Arajo1">[35]</xref>. Along this
                    same line of evidence, individuals within populations show different behaviours
                    that are heritable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Dingemanse1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Drent1">[37]</xref>, relatively inflexible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Rale1">[30]</xref>, and linked to fitness
                    traits, thus being favoured or disfavoured by selection depending on the
                    particular ecological conditions experienced by the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Rale1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Dingemanse2">[38]</xref>. Within
                    this context, and taking into account results presented here, behavioural
                    flexibility should be regarded as a specific trait encompassing variability
                    among individuals, but not necessarily within individuals. Recent studies on
                    individual variations in FID have shown that this behaviour has a strong
                    individual component in two bird species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Evans1">[16]</xref> and a

                    Moreover, these authors also found links between FID and other individual
                    behaviours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Evans1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carter1">[39]</xref>, suggesting that FID can be considered as a

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Rale1">[30]</xref>. Therefore,
                    although much more research is needed, we must not discard that
                    within-individual consistency in FID could be a generalised fact in animal
                    behaviour. No studies have been performed however to test whether FID changes
                    across situations or is the result of early experience that then is fixed
                    throughout life, but studies on personality envisage these possibilities for
                    individual behaviours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sih1">[31]</xref>. However, as FIDs resulted highly repeatable within
                    individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Evans1">[16]</xref>, there would be a low potential cognitive effect of
                    larger brains on the flexibility of adult individuals (i.e., those studied here)
                    regarding their fear of humans. Although the actual mechanism underlying the
                    positive relationship between RBS and variability in FID found in this study
                    remains unexplained, our results suggest an association between enlarged brains
                    and the evolution of behavioural variability among individuals, not just the
                    capacities of individuals to modify their behaviour in potentially adaptive ways
                    but through increased differences in individual traits. Thus, one prominent
                    contribution of our results is that the behaviours of individuals, but not the
                    average behaviour at the level of species, are important during the invasion
                    process. As previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Rale1">[30]</xref>, further research on biological invasion processes
                    would benefit from the perspective of variability in animal personalities.</p>

        <p>Field work conducted here was not invasive and did not require the manipulation
                    of live animals, and measuring FID from a car did not suppose an additional

                    from the literature and from birds found recently killed by cars in the roads.

        <title>Study area</title>
        <p>We selected the area of Bahía Blanca as a study site, on the Atlantic
                    coast of Argentina, a relatively young city founded by European colonists in
                    1828. It was a small village until the middle of the twentieth century, reaching
                    ca. 293,000 inhabitants in very recent years. The city is surrounded by natural
                    habitats (mostly grasslands and pasturelands, with small interspersed patches of
                    xerophytic forests and scrublands) where human presence and activities are
                    negligible. Both pedestrian records (0–0.1 pedestrians/h) and traffic
                    volume (0.34–2.4 cars/h) were extremely low in natural (hereafter rural)
                    habitats when compared to typical figures for First World countries
                    (11–325 cars/h; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-McKinney1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Bouchard1">[40]</xref>). Sampling in rural habitats was restricted to areas
                    20–150 km from the city to avoid potential confounding effects of
                    urban-rural ecotones on both behaviour and relative abundance of birds (see
                    below). Field work was conducted during wintering and summering months of

        <title>Urban invasiveness and explanatory variables</title>
        <p>We classified species within a gradient of urban invasiveness based on their
                    relative abundance (measured through censuses following road transects; see e.g.
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete2">[41]</xref>) in
                    urban and rural habitats. Road transects were shown to perform as well as other
                    measurement techniques such as foot transects or point counts in estimating
                    relative abundances of a variety of bird species in similar Argentinean open
                    habitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Travaini1">[42]</xref>. In summer 2004, transects totalling 59 and 150 km
                    were conducted in urban and rural habitats, respectively, at a constant speed
                    (ca. 20 km/h), avoiding windy and rainy days and the hottest hours of midday.
                    Near-road abundances (hereafter, abundances) were estimated as the number of
                    individuals of each species recorded per km <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete2">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Travaini1">[42]</xref>. As is
                    the case for any census methodology, differences in abundances between species
                    may be biased by their differential detectability. In our case, smaller species
                    could be more frequently missed when conducting road transects. This is not a
                    problem, however, when comparing within-species abundances in rural and urban
                    areas, since any body size bias should be common to both areas. After
                    calculating the difference in abundance in rural minus the abundance in urban
                    areas for each species (i.e., within-species relative abundance), urban
                    invasiveness was scored as null or occasional (species recorded in rural
                    habitats that were never or very rarely seen at urban sites), medium (species
                    commonly recorded at urban sites but with higher abundances in rural habitats),
                    and high (species showing higher abundances in urban compared to rural
                    habitats). We chose these rough scores because urban invasion is a contemporary
                    process in our study area: several species have become urban within the last
                    5–15 yr, while urban populations of others continue to increase (Authors
                    unpubl. observations). Therefore, relative abundances may not have been
                    established in some species and thus the use of finer scoring scales could imply
                    their incorrect categorization. Nonetheless, the use of five scores for the
                    categorization of urban invasiveness gave similar results to those presented in
                    this paper. For the same reason (contemporary, dynamic process), we did not
                    differentiate between potential urban exploiters and urban adapters (i.e.,
                    species living in the city proper and species living in the surrounding, less
                    urbanized areas, respectively) as defined by Kark <italic>et al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Kark1">[43]</xref>.
                    Nonetheless, both types of species do not seem to differ in terms of behavioural
                    flexibility as measured through relative brain size and the number of feeding
                    innovations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Kark1">[43]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We recorded FIDs of different birds to car approach as a measure of the ability
                    of individuals to cope with human disturbance. We are confident that we mostly
                    sampled different individuals since 1) we surveyed ca. 750 km of different
                    unpaved roads and streets across a large study area (ca. 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>),
                    and 2) road surveys covered a number of territories of territorial species, such
                    as the burrowing owl, that we identified in the course of other field-work tasks
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete1">[15]</xref>.
                    Therefore, the likelihood of resampling individuals for FID was negligible. To
                    measure FID, we drove a small grey car at a slow, steady speed (ca. 10 km/h).
                    Birds measured were typically perched close to (usually within 15 m) unpaved
                    roads in rural habitats or streets at urban sites. When we selected a focal bird
                    we did not stop for the identification of the species but approached it driving
                    through the route at the same speed until it flew. Therefore, the approach was
                    nearly directional (i.e., following the straight road or street in direction to
                    the bird) and was done in the same way that usual car traffic unintentionally
                    approaches birds. If the focal bird was close to others, we only measured FID
                    from the focal one. Then, one of the two authors seated in the front of the car
                    identified the species, using binoculars if needed, and measured the FID of the
                    focal bird through the closest open window. Therefore, we cannot differentiate
                    bird responses to the car from those to humans that were clearly visible to
                    birds. Nonetheless, FIDs of one of the species obtained by an approaching human
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Carrete1">[15]</xref> give
                    similar results to those when measured from a car (Authors, unpublished data).
                    FIDs were obtained only from adult birds, discarding fledglings and juveniles
                    (whose flight skills could be compromised by their young ages). Each FID was
                    measured by using a LEICA laser distancemeter (measuring range: 10–800 m;
                    accuracy: ±1 m) or through direct measurement (for distances&lt;10 m),
                    thus obtaining the actual Euclidean distance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Blumstein1">[9]</xref>. We recorded 1,393 FIDs
                    from 61 species in rural habitats and 691 FIDs from 41 species in urban habitats
                        (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018859.s001">Figure
                        S1</xref>), individual FIDs ranging from 0.5 to 122 m. However, to avoid
                    potential biased results associated with small sample sizes, statistical
                    analyses (see below) were performed following Cooke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Cooke1">[26]</xref> and Blumstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Blumstein1">[9]</xref> by using
                    information from species for which we obtained FIDs from at least 10 individuals
                    measured in rural habitats (n = 42 species, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018859.s001">Figure S1</xref>).
                    As a measure of within-species variability in FID in rural habitats, we used the
                    coefficient of variation (CV<sub>FID</sub>) instead of the variance because,
                    contrary to this measure, CV was not related to body size (Regression of
                    variance against body size: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.25,
                        <italic>n</italic> = 42,
                    P = 0.0015; Regression of CV<sub>FID</sub> against body
                    size: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.003, n = 42,
                    P = 0.93). Thus, we can test the relative importance of
                        CV<sub>FID</sub> and body mass including them simultaneously in the same
                    models.</p>
        <p>Information on overall brain masses (in grams) was available for 27 species (44,
                    D. Sol, unpubl. data, Authors unpubl. data). As is the case in most comparative
                    works on brain size, the number of individuals from which brain size and body
                    mass is available per species was generally low (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018859.s001">Figure S1</xref>).
                    However, variance in both brain size and body mass is much higher among than
                    within bird species, which is required for the feasibility of a comparative
                    analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Garamszegi1">[44]</xref>. Body masses were obtained from the same sources as
                    available brain masses, completed with information from published body mass
                    compilations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Dunning1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Salvador1">[47]</xref> and own unpublished data
                    for the rest of species. Following Sol <italic>et al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol1">[17]</xref>, we
                    calculated the residuals of a log-log linear regression of brain mass against
                    body mass. The relationship was positive and linear (linear regression,
                        R<sup>2</sup> = 0.75;
                    F<sub>1,25</sub> = 75.08, P&lt;0.0001) and the residuals
                    were uncorrelated to body mass (r = 0.003,
                    P = 0.99, n = 27), hence, we used them
                    as a measure of relative brain size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol1">[17]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The abundance of each species in rural areas was estimated as the average number
                    of birds/km (see above). As previously mentioned, larger species could be more
                    easily detected from a car than smaller ones. Contrary to when we previously
                    estimated within-species relative densities in urban and rural areas, the
                    between-species relative densities obtained in rural areas could be seriously
                    affected by such a bias. However, abundances in our study species in rural
                    habitats were uncorrelated to our measure of body size (i.e., body mass;
                        r<sub>s</sub> = 0.014, P = 0.93,
                    n = 42), despite the fact that sampled species widely
                    differed in size (body masses ranging from 13 to 890 g, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018859.s001">Figure
                    S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Dietary and habitat generalisms were obtained as the number of the major
                    food/habitat types recorded in the literature for each species (diet: grasses
                    and herbs, seeds and grains, fruits and berries, pollen and nectar, vegetative
                    material, invertebrates, vertebrates, and carrion; habitat: forest, mixed scrub,

                    Environmental tolerance was calculated as the whole latitudinal distribution of

        <p>Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs, using the cumulative logit link function
                    and the multinomial error distribution for categorical, ordered data; GLIMMIX
                    procedure in SAS 9.1) were performed to investigate the relative influence of
                    our explanatory variables on urban invasiveness (as a categorical, ordered
                    variable with three levels; see above) while controlling for potential
                    phylogenetic effects (Family and Order as nested random factors, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Sol1">[17]</xref>). The same
                    random factors were fitted when testing in a GLMM the relationship between
                        CV<sub>FID</sub> and brain size of the species, using a normal distribution
                    of errors and the identity link function. As FIDs did not differ between seasons
                    and years within species and habitats (all P&gt;0.36), data were pooled for
                    analyses. CV<sub>FID</sub> and average FID were not significantly related
                    (r = 0.13, P = 0.40,
                    n = 42), so we included both variables in the same models
                    without problems of colinearity. We compared alternative models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018859-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) to ascertain the links
                    between relative brain size, CV<sub>FID</sub> and urban invasiveness through

                    The Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used for model selection,

                    support). Models with AIC scores differing from that of the lowest score by more
                    than two were considered to be unsupported statistically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018859-Richards1">[49]</xref>. Finally, a Paired t-test
