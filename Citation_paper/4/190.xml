<abstract>
<p>The role of DNA methylation has not been enough explored in pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, according to recent reports it has been inferred that hypermethylation could be one of the principle cause associated with the enhancement of DN. An interrelationship between miR29b and DNA methylation has been studied via <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis. We have validated that miR29b prominently targets DNA methyl transferase (DNMT), specifically DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B. We have developed <italic>in vitro</italic> DN model using renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs), contributed to a significant alleviation in RNA and protein expression levels of DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT1. The developed model has also demonstrated downregulation in expression of miR29b. Our studies have also suggested that miR29b targets DNMT1 via targeting its transcription factor SP1. In addition to this, downregulation of a specific biomarker for kidney injury, tubular kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and fibrosis causing glycoprotein i.e. fibronectin, was also demonstrated. Hence, the developed model revealed that hypermethylation is a key factor incorporated in DN, and miR29b could effectively ameliorate defensive actions in DN pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diabetes mellitus is a rapidly growing concern around the globe. It is associated with several microvascular and macrovascular complications. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the major microvascular complication of diabetes which is a major cause behind development of end-stage renal disorder (ESRD). The disease ranges from microalbunumeria to progressive chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref002">2</xref>]. The pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy includes a complex interaction between metabolic and haemodynamic factors that leads to an increase in formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) as well as increase in factors promoting growth like angiotensin-II (Ang-II) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref004">4</xref>]. Collective evidences have suggested that the factors associated with DN pathogenesis are influenced by various epigenetic modifications such as methylation on the promotor region of DNA, non-coding RNAs and histone modulations. These factors have showed their pivotal role in DN pathogenesis by a second layer of gene regulation, activation of various gene signaling pathways and ultimately causing vascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref006">6</xref>]. Among various epigenetic modifications, abberant DNA methylation contributes to increased prevalance of type I and type II diabetes and is found to be a major regulator of transcriptional activity in DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref010">10</xref>]. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that hypermethylation of genes such as <italic>NPHP4</italic>, <italic>IQSEC1</italic> and <italic>TCF3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref011">11</xref>] are involved in pathways that trigger epithelial to mesenchymal transitions and kidney fibrosis while methylation of <italic>NRBF2; RUNX3; ZBTB5; ZNF639</italic> are known to regulate transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously produced small, non-coding RNAs of 21–25 nucleotide length, affecting every cellular function by modulating gene expressions. Amongst them, miR29 family is the most excessively expressed miRNA in liver, kidney and pancreas in humans and mice affecting glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin irresponsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref013">13</xref>]. In diabetic nephropathy, miR29b is remarkably downregulated in response to AGE and TGF-β1-Smad3 signalling which promotes renal fibrosis. Downregulation of miR29b was found to be associated with higher expression of collagen type1 (COL-I) and collagen type 4 A1(COL4A1) in extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref016">16</xref>]. After going through the repertoire of literature, it has been observed that miR29b regulates abnormal methylation induced in various pathogenic diseased conditions such as lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref017">17</xref>], acute myeloid leukaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref018">18</xref>] as well as hepatocellular cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Amongst DNA methyl transferases, DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT1 are the biomarkers specific to methylation, which were shown as one of the contributing factors in developing DN pathogenesis. Different miRNAs showed distinct expression patterns in DN. It has been reported that TGF-β1, a pro-fibrotic cytokine downregulates miR29b expressions in RPTECs conferring to progression in DN. However, the relationship between miR29b downregulation and hypermethylation in DN conditions is yet to be established. With this aim, we hypothesized that there is a correlation between downregulation of miR29b and hypermethylation in DN pathogenesis. Initially, we generated an <italic>in vitro</italic> DN model using RPTECs using combined treatment of DN promoting factors i.e. AGE, high glucose (HG) and Ang-II. Participation of miR29b in aberrant methylation patterns occurring in DN was also investigated in developed <italic>in vitro</italic> DN model. Collectively, our studies have suggested that miR29b might be involved in downregulation of methylation-specific genes (DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT1) as their aberrant expressions contribute to hypermethylation in <italic>in vitro</italic> DN model and thereby their downregulation via miR29b can alleviate the DN conditions.</p>

The sequences shown in red colour are the miR29b sequences complementary to the 3’UTRs of DNMTs shown in green colour. All the targets have demonstrated minimum binding energy of -20 kcal/mol, indicating a stable complex formation between miR29b and 3’UTRs of DNMTs.</p>

<title>Evaluation of miR29b role in high glucose, AGE and Ang II induce diabetic nephropathy in renal proximal tubule cells</title>
<p>Thee different concentrations (0.1, 0.5 and 1 μM.) of Ang-II and AGE (50, 100 and 150 μg/ml) were taken to check the expression of TGF-β1, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and COL4A1 for the development of <italic>in vitro</italic> DN model. Based on the mRNA expression profile using RT-PCR, we have finalized 1 μM Ang-II concentration and 150 μg/ml AGE concentration for further standardization. Later, RPTECs were divided in three different combinations to standardize the <italic>in vitro</italic> model by checking expression of TGF-β1 and COL4A1. Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), analysis of RPTECs induced by all the three components have demonstrated higher expression of TGF-β1 and COL4A1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208044.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). RPTECs were cultured in three different combinations of stress; 1) HG and Ang-II, 2) HG and AGE, 3) HG, Ang-II and AGE, and these three combinations were compared with high glucose stress model <italic>in vitro</italic>. RT-PCR studies of TGF-β1, VEGF-A and COLA1 verified their expression profiles involved in DN pathogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208044.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Hence, we found that supplementing HG (30 mM) along with Ang-II (1 μM) (Sigma) and AGE products (150 μg/ml) (Sigma) at 37°C for 48 h with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> could provide the appropriate conditions to generate a DN model.</p>

<title>Expression profiles of oxidative stress markers and miR29b and their targets in diabetic nephropathy model</title>
<p>In this study, rise in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was found in RPTECs treated with HG, AGE and Ang-II as compared to untreated RPTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208044.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). A gradual decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity also indicates an increase in ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208044.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208044.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Studies related to DNA methylation have not yet been explored much in kidneys compared with those of other organs affected in diabetes. However, it has been reported that aberrant methylation events occurring at CpG islands in kidney could be associated with progression in DN. Albuminuria is one of the major clinical manifestations of DN. In a recent study, it was found that aberrant methylation patterns could be associated with severity of albuminuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref020">20</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that aberrant DNA methylation patterns particularly occurring in proximal tubular cells also contribute to enhance DN conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref021">21</xref>]. This signifies how aberrant DNA methylation patterns promote development of DN conditions. Diabetic nephropathy also constitutes abundant deposition of ECM proteins which confers to thickening of tubular and glomerular basement membrane. Among several miRNAs, the expression levels of miR29b were found to be downregulated in DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref022">22</xref>]. In addition to this, miR29b has been also claimed to be involved in renal fibrosis and in the regulation of collagen-I, III and IV expressions. However, TGF-β1, a profibrotic cytokine causes downregulation of miR29b via TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway and elevates expression levels of collagen-I, III and IV contributing to renal fibrosis in RPTECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>The relationship between miR29b and DNA methylation were earlier reported in various pathogenic diseases such as in lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref017">17</xref>] and in acute myeloid leukaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref018">18</xref>]. However, role of miR29b in molecular events underlying DN has not yet been demonstrated. To our knowledge, it is the first evidence suggesting the role of miR29b in regulation of DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B expressions in RPTECs in DN conditions. DNA hypermethylation is one of the key mechanisms involved in enhancement of DN that is induced by DNMT3A, DNMT3B and transcription factor SP1. In our experiment, through bioinformatics analysis, it was predicted that miR29b potentially targets DNMT3A, DNMT3B and SP1. Moreover, in case of lung cancer and leukaemia this interaction of miR29b with DNMT3A, DNMT3B and SP1 has already been proved. Bioinformatic analysis was carried out using online miRNA target prediction databases including miRDB, TargetScan and FindTar3 which revealed that miR29b could bind to methylation-specific markers (DNMT3A, DNMT3B and SP1). RNA hybrid database have further showed minimum binding energy between 3’-UTR of methylation-specific markers (DNMT3A, DNMT3B and SP1) and mature miR29b, indicating a highly stable complex formation. It has been already reported that the secondary structures of miRNA and mRNA are functionally and thermodynamically essential parameters for the stability of these complexes. From the obtained results, it can be inferred that all targets have minimum free energy below -20kcal/mol and hence, the secondary structure is more stable. These bioinformatics results strongly indicate that miR29b modulates DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>However, in order to further validate these results, expression profiles of miR29b, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, DNMT1 and SP1 were analyzed in <italic>in vitro</italic> DN model using RPTECs. High glucose is a major risk factor involved in DN progression. It is linked with abnormal activation of protein kinase C (PKC), elevation in expression levels of TGF-β1 and COL4A1 that enhances ECM deposition which causes renal fibrosis in RPTECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref024">24</xref>]. Furthermore, high glucose conditions have induced downregulation of miR29b while overexpression of miR29b triggers cell viability and showed protective action in hyperglycaemic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref025">25</xref>]. Ang-II were found to be associated with the induction of proteinuria, renal injury as well as apoptosis and remarkably contributed in the development of chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref026">26</xref>]. Ang-II binds to angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) and causes subsequent activation of NF-κB which activates YY1 transcription factor which leads to downregulation of miR29b. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref027">27</xref>]. In response to AGE, reduction in miR29b expression level was observed that leads to deposition of collagen in the region of mesangial cells via TGF-β1/Smad3 dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref022">22</xref>]. Moreover, it was found that AGE have also induced elevated expressions of NF-κB which can ultimately lead to the reduction in miR29b expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref025">25</xref>]. Moreover, earlier literature suggested that high glucose, Ang-II and AGE product play a vital role in pathogenesis of DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref029">29</xref>]. Thus, in order to mimic DN conditions, we have first developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> DN model mimicing DN microenvironment in RPTECs. Our studies have showed that expression of miR29b was significantly reduced while the expression of DNMT3A, DNMT3B DNMT1 and SP1 (transcription factor allowing transcription of DNMT1) were found to be upregulated in RPTECs based DN model supplemented with HG (30 mM); Ang-II (1 μM) and AGE (150 μg). It had indicated that miR29b downregulation may raise the expression levels of methylation-specific markers (DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT1) and there exists a correlation between miR29b and DNA methylation in DN.</p>
<p>In our study, when RPTECs were treated with different stress conditions, they were characterized further for the expression of biomarkers involved in DN pathogenesis through qRT-PCR and ELISA. From these results it is also evident that, there is a remarkable rise in mRNA and protein expression levels of TGF-β1, a pro-fibrotic cytokine and VEGF-A, a potent vascular factor participating in inflammation, COL4A1 along with inflammatory markers like IL-6 and NF-κB, apoptotic markers like Caspase 3 and transcription factor Smad2 in RPTECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref030">30</xref>]. Moreover, other pathological conditions were found to be significantly high in developed DN model treated with HG, Ang-II and AGE compared to untreated RPTECs. Expression level of COL4A1 was also elevated which is also found in previously reported studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref023">23</xref>]. Inflammation and oxidative stress conditions seems to play a critical role in enhancement of DN pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref031">31</xref>]. A gradual increase in ROS was also observed which causes the release of inflammatory cytokines. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the leading protector against superoxides in renal tissue during DN conditions. Downregulation of SOD was demonstrated by developed DN model which caused an increase in the cytotoxicity levels of superoxides that contribute to diabetic-induced renal impairment. Therefore, SOD downregulation may be a key factor in development of DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref032">32</xref>]. TGF-β1 have also induced elevation of Smad2 expressions that promoted renal fibrosis via insulin like growth factor binding protein-7 (IGFBP7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref033">33</xref>]. Smad2 mRNA expression profiling was also performed to confirm tubular injury in proximal tubular cells. The study have suggested that Ang-II and AGE products under hyperglycaemic conditions are the key influencers in DN pathogenesis and could provide appropriate DN conditions to study the role of miR29b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref034">34</xref>]. These results are consistent with pathogenic conditions of DN and therefore, assessment of miR29b expression levels in this microenvironment could provide a considerable source in establishment of its mechanism in DN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208044.g011">Fig 11</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref035">35</xref>].</p>

<title>Graphical conclusion.</title>
<p>Hemodynamic factor (Ang-II) and metabolic factors (AGE and Glucose) are modulating expression of inflammatory markers like TGF-β1, NF-κB and IL-6 and oxidative stress markers like ROS. Because of increased expression of TGF-β1 there is downregulation of miR29b which leads to dysregulation of methylation and as a result causes hypermethylation of genome.</p>

<p>In this study, transfection of miR29b in developed <italic>in vitro</italic> DN model has showed its active participation in response to hyperglycaemic conditions. Every component of miR29 family possesses distinct physiological function and our hypothesis principally targeted attention towards protective action of miR29b in hyperglycaemia-induced injury of RPTECs in DN. Our experimental results have showed upregulation of miR29b upon transfection with miR29b mimics while its downregulation occurred when miR29b inhibitors were transfected. Further, to validate miR29b potential targets, mRNA expression profiles of DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT1 were analysed which have demonstrated the downregulation of DNA methylation markers upon transfection with miR29b mimics. Transfection of miR29b inhibitors in <italic>in vitro</italic> DN model had demonstrated upregulation in the expression of DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT1. Downregulation of DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT1 and upregulation of the same were also observed at protein level, upon transfection with miR29b mimics and miR29b inhibitors respectively. Besides this, expression levels of biomarkers including KIM-1 and fibronectin were also observed. Among them, KIM-1 is a transmembrane tubular protein that was already reported to be elevated in kidney disease and found to be engaged with inflammation and renal fibrosis in DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref036">36</xref>]. The overexpression of fibronectin was also reported to be the contributor of diabetes-induced renal impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208044.ref037">37</xref>]. In our studies, it was observed that upon transfection with miR29b mimics, alleviation in expression levels of KIM-1 and Fibronectin occurs. From these results, it could be inferred that miR29b could significantly suppress renal injury in proximal tubular epithelial cells in DN conditions. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to further validate whether miR29b could target 3’-UTRs of DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT1 or not. The results obtained from this assay had revealed that miR29b could specifically and successfully target DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT1. This exemplifies the multifarious actions of miR29b in renal injuries.</p>
<p>We can thus conclude that miR29b could effectually target DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT1 contributing in the progression of DN in RPTECs. Therefore, miR29b therapy could be a propitious therapeutic approach towards diabetic nephropathy. The major limitation of this study is the clinical validatation of developed <italic>in vitro</italic> DN model and clinical efficacy of miR-29b in DN. Although miR-29b has been checked for its protective role in diabetic nephropathy, research needs to explore its roles to the fullest.</p>
