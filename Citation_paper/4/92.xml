        <p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin critically involved in cell survival, synaptic plasticity, and memory. BDNF has recently garnered significant attention as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), but emerging evidence suggests that BDNF may also be mechanistically involved in the pathogenesis of AD. AD patients have substantially reduced BDNF levels, which may be a result of Aβ and tau pathology. Recent evidence, however, indicates reduced BDNF levels may also serve to drive pathology in neuronal cultures, although this has not yet been established <italic>in vivo</italic>. To further investigate the mechanistic role of BDNF in AD, we generated 3xTg-AD mice with a heterozygous BDNF knockout (BDNF<sup>+/−</sup>) and analyzed Aβ and tau pathology. Aged 3xTg-AD/BDNF<sup>+/−</sup> mice have significantly reduced levels of brain BDNF, but have comparable levels of Aβ and tau pathology to 3xTg-AD/BDNF<sup>+/+</sup> mice. These findings indicate that chronic reduction of BDNF does not exacerbate the development of Aβ and tau pathology, and instead suggests the reduced BDNF levels found in AD patients are a consequence of these pathologies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that manifests as a progressive decline of cognitive function and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Querfurth1">[1]</xref>. Pathologically, AD is primarily characterized by the accumulation of plaques containing amyloid-β (Aβ), tau-laden neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and progressive synaptic and neuronal loss. Emerging evidence suggests that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be important for the pathogenesis of AD.</p>
      <p>BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family that has been well-established as a key regulator of neuronal survival and plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-McAllister1">[2]</xref>. BDNF binding to its high-affinity receptor, TrkB, is essential for the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) and for long-term memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Bartoletti1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Monteggia1">[6]</xref>. Interestingly, AD patients have significantly reduced levels of hippocampal and cortical BDNF mRNA and protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Peng1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-TapiaArancibia1">[10]</xref>, and some evidence suggests these deficits are a consequence of Aβ accumulation. Aβ treatment of cultured cortical neurons reduces BDNF levels by decreasing activation of CREB, a transcription factor that regulates BDNF expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Aliaga1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Garzon1">[13]</xref>. Recent work suggests Aβ may also prevent proteolytic maturation of proBDNF, the precursor form of BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Zheng1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although Aβ accumulation may influence BDNF levels in AD patients, recent evidence suggests this interaction may work in the reverse direction as well, i.e. BDNF influences Aβ accumulation. Although still under debate, numerous studies have found evidence that various BDNF polymorphisms, in particular Val66Met and Cys270Thr, are associated with an increased risk of developing AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Akatsu1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Olin1">[20]</xref>. Exogenous application of BDNF in primary neurons and <italic>in vivo</italic> in the hippocampus reduces levels of murine Aβ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Arancibia1">[21]</xref>. It was recently reported that treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with anti-BDNF antibodies induces amyloidogenic processing and apoptosis, which suggests BDNF may be an important regulator of Aβ production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Matrone1">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, application of BDNF <italic>in vitro</italic> rapidly dephosphorylates tau via TrkB signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Elliott1">[23]</xref>, which indicates a potential role for BDNF in the development of tau pathology.</p>
      <p>These findings suggest a novel role for BDNF as a regulator of AD pathogenesis, however this has yet to be demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> in a mouse model of AD. To investigate the impact of reduced BDNF levels on AD pathology, we generated 3xTg-AD mice with reduced levels of BDNF by introducing a heterozygous knockout of the BDNF gene (BDNF<sup>+/−</sup>). Although homozygous knockout of BDNF (BDNF<sup>−/−</sup>) is lethal within 2 weeks of postnatal development, BDNF<sup>+/−</sup> mice do not exhibit premature mortality or any overt developmental deficits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Ernfors1">[24]</xref>. We found that aged 3xTg-AD/BDNF<sup>+/−</sup> mice had significantly reduced BDNF levels compared to 3xTg-AD/BDNF<sup>+/+</sup> mice, but Aβ and tau pathology was unchanged.</p>

        <title>Analysis of BDNF levels in 3xTg-AD mice</title>
        <p>Previous work demonstrates that AD patients have reduced levels of brain BDNF, which may be a result of Aβ pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-TapiaArancibia1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Tong1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Garzon1">[13]</xref>. To determine whether 3xTg-AD mice have similar deficits in BDNF, we conducted a western blot analysis of BDNF on whole brain homogenates from naïve 24-month-old homozygous 3xTg-AD mice. 3xTg-AD mice were found to have BDNF levels that are comparable to wildtype controls (<italic>n = </italic>3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039566-g001">Fig. 1A–B</xref>) despite the presence of significant Aβ and tau pathology at this timepoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Oddo1">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, average levels of proBDNF were 67% higher in 3xTg-AD versus controls, but this difference did not reach significance (<italic>n = </italic>3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039566-g001">Fig. 1A–B</xref>). These data suggest 3xTg-AD mice do not recapitulate the Aβ-induced BDNF deficits found in patients, and thus provide additional rationale for genetically reducing BDNF levels in these mice.</p>

        <title>Generation of 3xTg-AD mice with reduced levels of BDNF</title>
        <p>To determine whether reduced BDNF levels may influence the development of Aβ or tau pathology, we crossed homozygous 3xTg-AD mice to BDNF<sup>+/−</sup> mice. All of the resulting offspring were hemizygous for APP<sub>swe</sub>, tau<sub>P301L</sub>, and PS1<sub>M146V</sub>, and approximately half were BDNF<sup>+/−</sup> and the other half were BDNF<sup>+/+</sup>. The pathology of hemizygous 3xTg-AD mice is less aggressive than that of homozygous 3xTg-AD mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Oddo2">[26]</xref>, which is ideal for examining a potential exacerbation of pathology. To allow adequate time for the effects of BDNF knockdown to manifest, animals were aged to 15–17 months before collecting brains for biochemical analysis of BDNF signaling-related proteins and Aβ and tau pathology.</p>
        <p>To quantify the change in steady state BDNF protein expression in 3xTg-AD/BDNF<sup>+/−</sup> mice, we conducted a BDNF ELISA on cerebral cortex homogenates. Compared to 3xTg-AD/BDNF<sup>+/+</sup> controls, 3xTg-AD/BDNF<sup>+/−</sup> mice had a 43% reduction in BDNF protein levels (<italic>n = </italic>4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.015, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039566-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). This result is consistent with the original characterization of this mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Ernfors1">[24]</xref>, and roughly emulates the BDNF deficits reported in AD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Peng1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-TapiaArancibia1">[10]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Next we sought to determine if BDNF knockdown influenced the expression or activation state of other BDNF signaling-related proteins. We found no differences in levels of TrkB, the major receptor for BDNF, or phosphorylated TrkB by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039566-g001">Fig. 1D–E</xref>). We also found no differences in the expression or activation state of Akt1 or Erk1/2, two important downstream mediators of BDNF signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Reichardt1">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039566-g001">Fig. 1D–E</xref>). These findings suggest that BDNF signaling may be relatively resilient to chronic aberrations in BDNF levels.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether NGF/TrkA signaling, which may have some functional overlap with BDNF/TrkB signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Pitts1">[28]</xref>, is altered to compensate for reduced BDNF levels, we measured levels of total and phosphorylated TrkA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039566-g001">Fig. 1D–E</xref>). No group differences were detected for TrkA or pTrkA, which suggests NGF signaling is not likely compensating for reduced BDNF levels.</p>

        <title>Comparable Aβ and tau pathology between 3xTg-AD/BDNF<sup>+/−</sup> and 3xTg-AD/BDNF<sup>+/+</sup> mice</title>
        <p>To determine the impact of reduced BDNF levels on AD pathogenesis, we analyzed Aβ and tau pathology in 3xTg-AD/BDNF<sup>+/−</sup> and 3xTg-AD/BDNF<sup>+/+</sup> mice. A sensitive sandwich Aβ ELISA on cerebral cortex homogenates revealed lower Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>/Aβ<sub>1–40</sub> ratios than has previously been found for 3xTg-AD mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Green1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Green2">[30]</xref>, which was expected because the mice used in the current study are hemizygous for the APP<sub>swe</sub> and PS1<sub>M146V</sub> transgenes. Importantly, the Aβ ELISA revealed comparable levels of detergent-soluble or -insoluble Aβ<sub>1–40</sub> or Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> between groups (<italic>n = </italic>4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039566-g002">Fig. 2A–B</xref>). Consistent with the ELISA findings, fluorescent immunohistochemistry for 6E10 and hTau revealed a similar pattern of immunoreactivity between groups for CA1 and cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039566-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>To emulate the deficits in BDNF levels reported in AD patients, we generated 3xTg-AD mice with reduced BDNF expression. We report the novel finding that BDNF knockdown in 3xTg-AD mice does not significantly alter Aβ or tau pathology. As with any chronic knockdown model, it is possible that compensatory processes occurred in response to BDNF knockdown. Indeed, we found no change in the expression or activation levels of TrkB, which has been reported to occur following chronic alterations in BDNF levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Mamounas1">[32]</xref>. Thus, although we found no effect of chronic BDNF reduction on AD pathology, it remains possible that pathology is modulated by TrkB signaling. We also found no changes in the expression of various downstream signaling mediators, which may indicate compensation has occurred through changes in related signaling systems. Future studies should consider the use of an inducible knockout system that spares BDNF levels until after development. Also, since APP<sub>swe</sub> and tau<sub>P310L</sub> are driven by a Thy1.2 promoter, our experiments do not rule out the possibility that BDNF influences pathology via an interaction with the native APP or tau promoter. Previous work has shown that application of BDNF <italic>in vitro</italic> increases APP expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Ge1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-RuizLen1">[34]</xref>, and it is possible that reduced BDNF expression may actually lower APP expression.</p>
      <p>In the current study, reduced BDNF levels in 3xTg-AD mice had no detectable impact on Aβ pathology, however, this result differs from that of a previous study which found increased amyloidogenic processing after interruption of BDNF signaling in hippocampal neuronal cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Matrone1">[22]</xref>. This difference may be attributable to differences in the degree of BDNF knockdown between the antibody-mediated approach used previously, which nearly completely removed BDNF from the culture media, and our genetic knockdown approach, which reduced BDNF to approximately half of normal levels. It is possible that a more complete knockdown of BDNF in 3xTg-AD mice may have led to an increase in amyloidogenic processing, however, the degree of knockdown achieved in the current experiment more closely models the deficits reported for AD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-TapiaArancibia1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recent evidence suggests BDNF may promote non-amyloidogenic APP processing by increasing expression of SORLA. SORLA reduces amyloidogenic processing of APP by preventing the trafficking of APP to late endocytic compartments where β- and γ-secretase cleavage occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Schmidt1">[35]</xref>. BDNF<sup>−/−</sup> mice have reduced expression of SORLA, and intracranial infusion of exogenous BDNF reduces levels of murine Aβ via SORLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Rohe1">[31]</xref>. Based on this evidence, we expected BDNF knockdown in 3xTg-AD mice to reduce SORLA expression and exacerbate Aβ pathology, however, we found no changes in either of these outcomes. Although increasing BDNF levels may have some influence on Aβ production, our findings suggest that the reduced BDNF levels found in AD patients may not significantly influence APP processing.</p>
      <p>Previous work <italic>in vitro</italic> has demonstrated that tau dephosphorylation can be initiated by BDNF/TrkB signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Elliott1">[23]</xref>, which suggests BDNF knockdown may lead to an increase in the phosphorylation of tau. However, our <italic>in vivo</italic> investigation indicates no changes in total tau expression or levels of various phospho-tau epitopes in animals with BDNF knockdown. Overall, our findings suggest that knockdown of BDNF does not result in effects that are opposite to what has been reported for BDNF overexpression.</p>
      <p>Our findings are in agreement with recent studies of the therapeutic potential of BDNF in AD models, which have found the beneficial effects of BDNF on synaptic and cognitive function to occur without changes to pathology. Our lab found that NSC transplantation into the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice increases synapse density and reverses cognitive deficits, and these benefits are mediated by NSC-derived BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-BlurtonJones1">[36]</xref>. Importantly, these benefits occurred independent of any alterations in Aβ or tau pathology. Similarly, lentiviral delivery of BDNF into the entorhinal cortex of J20 AD mice reverses synapse loss and restores cognition, but Aβ load is unaltered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039566-Nagahara1">[37]</xref>. Targeting BDNF signaling has clear promise for treating synaptic and cognitive deficits in AD, but the current findings support the notion that such a treatment may not be useful for modifying AD pathology.</p>

        <p>BDNF levels were determined using the BDNF E-max Immunoassay System per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, a 96-well Immulon 2HB plate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was incubated overnight with anti-BDNF monoclonal antibody (1∶1000). The plate was loaded with a standard curve and 100 μl of undiluted soluble protein extracts (to detect free mature BDNF, samples were not acid pre-treated), and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with shaking. The plate was washed with TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) using an ELx405 automatic plate washer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The plate was then incubated with anti-human BDNF polyclonal antibody (1∶500), washed, incubated with Anti-IgY HRP conjugate (1∶200), and washed again. For color development TMB One solution was added for 10 min followed by 1 N HCl, and absorbance was read at 450 nm using a Multiskan Ascent plate reader (Thermo Labsystems). The value for each sample was normalized to the protein concentration of that sample. The r<sup>2</sup> value for the standard curve was &gt;99% and values for all samples fell within the linear range of the curve.</p>
