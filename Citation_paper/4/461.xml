        <p>Lactobacilli are Gram-positive bacteria that are a subdominant element in the human gastrointestinal microbiota, and which are commonly used in the food industry. Some lactobacilli are considered probiotic, and have been associated with health benefits. However, there is very little culture-independent information on how consumed probiotic microorganisms might affect the entire intestinal microbiota. We therefore studied the impact of the administration of <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> UCC118, a microorganism well characterized for its probiotic properties, on the composition of the intestinal microbiota in two model animals. UCC118 has anti-infective activity due to production of the bacteriocin Abp118, a broad-spectrum class IIb bacteriocin, which we hypothesized could impact the microbiota. Mice and pigs were administered wild-type (WT) <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 cells, or a mutant lacking bacteriocin production. The microbiota composition was determined by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from faeces. The data show that <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration had no significant effect on proportions of major phyla comprising the mouse microbiota, whether the strain was producing bacteriocin or not. However, <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 WT administration led to a significant decrease in <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> levels, the third major phylum in the untreated pig microbiota. In both pigs and mice, <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration had an effect on <italic>Firmicutes</italic> genus members. This effect was not observed when the mutant strain was administered, and was thus associated with bacteriocin production. Surprisingly, in both models, <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration and production of Abp118 had an effect on Gram-negative microorganisms, even though Abp118 is normally not active <italic>in vitro</italic> against this group of microorganisms. Thus <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration has a significant but subtle impact on mouse and pig microbiota, by a mechanism that seems at least partially bacteriocin-dependent.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Lactobacilli are Gram-positive bacteria, commonly associated with the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of humans and animals. They are members of the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and have a number of uses in industry especially in the manufacture of dairy products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Hammes1">[1]</xref>. Many LAB are considered to have probiotic effects. Probiotics are defined as “live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Guarner1">[2]</xref>. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how these probiotic microorganisms can be beneficial for the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-OToole1">[3]</xref>. Firstly, probiotics could enhance intestinal barrier function. Madsen and collaborators showed that the probiotic mixture VSL#3, partially comprising LAB, improved intestinal epithelial integrity and reduced its permeability, conferring protection against inflammatory luminal constituents coming from bacteria or diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Madsen1">[4]</xref>. They also showed that probiotic consumption conferred resistance to <italic>Salmonella</italic> invasion by reducing intestinal permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Madsen1">[4]</xref>. Secondly, some strains demonstrate immunomodulatory activity. Indeed, in a recent study, Sierra and collaborators showed that administration of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> CECT5713, isolated from breast milk, improved host immunity by inducing Interleukin (IL)-10 and some immunoglobulins levels as well as inducing an increase in Natural Killer cell and monocyte numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Sierra1">[5]</xref>. Furthermore, a recent study showed that <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> B1 can increase the number of immunocompetent cells and enhance IL-6 gene expression in the pig intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Zhang1">[6]</xref>. Finally, some probiotic microorganisms exert protective effects against pathogen invasion by adhesion or metabolic competition, or inhibition due to production of antimicrobial compounds. Indeed, some <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> and <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> strains used as probiotics can prevent enterohemorrhagic or enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain adhesion to epithelial cells and thus reduce infection severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Sherman1">[7]</xref>. Moreover, a five-strain probiotic mixture comprising four different species (and including <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> DPC6005) has been shown to reduce <italic>Salmonella</italic> carriage in infected pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Casey1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Whereas recent studies were aimed at elucidating mechanisms by which probiotics could exert these beneficial effects, few studies have focused on if and how probiotic administration impacts the normal microbiota – either directly or indirectly. It is important to know if these microorganisms could induce alteration of the composition or activity of the host microbiota, since some microbial population alterations are associated with intestinal disorders like obesity or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Ley1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Fiocchi1">[10]</xref>. A recent study showed that administration of <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> NCFM and <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> subsp. <italic>lactis</italic> Bi-07 does not affect major genera in the microbiota of children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Larsen1">[11]</xref>. However, the specific impact of probiotic consumption on the host microbiota may depend on the identity and phenotype-specificity of the strains used. It is thus important to carry out similar studies using different known probiotic microorganisms, to increase our knowledge on the impact of probiotics on the normal microbiota, and to exclude the possibility of undesirable microbiota changes occurring.</p>
      <p><italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 is well studied for its probiotic properties. Corr and collaborators have shown that this strain protects against <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> EGDe and LO28 and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> UK1 infections in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Corr1">[12]</xref>. More specifically, they showed that the observed anti-<italic>Listeria</italic> effect was due to production of the bacteriocin Abp118 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Corr1">[12]</xref>. Abp118 is a broad-spectrum class IIb bacteriocin encoded by an operon located on the <italic>L. salivarius</italic> megaplasmid pMP118 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Claesson1">[13]</xref>. A mutant lacking bacteriocin production still protected against S<italic>almonella</italic> infection whereas it did not protect against <italic>Listeria</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Corr1">[12]</xref>. Thus, the anti-<italic>Listeria</italic> effect of UCC118 was due to direct antagonism via Abp118, whereas its anti-<italic>Salmonella</italic> effect was more likely due to competitive exclusion or immunomodulation of host defenses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Corr1">[12]</xref>. Because of the anti-microbial activity associated with Abp118, we hypothesized that administration of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 might impact the host. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the impact of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration and more specifically bacteriocin production, on the composition of the normal microbiota of healthy mice and pigs. This was addressed by determining faecal microbiota composition before and after treatment, of duration one week and four weeks in mice and pigs respectively.</p>

        <title>Animal model selection and construction of an isogenic <italic>abpT</italic> mutant in <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> UCC118, deficient for bacteriocin production</title>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that two different strains of <italic>L. salivarius</italic>, among them UCC118, exhibited probiotic effects through anti-infective properties in mice and pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Casey1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Corr1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Walsh1">[14]</xref>. Thus, these two animal models were selected for the assessment of the effect of bacteriocin production on host microbiota in these species.</p>
        <p>In the mouse trial, animals were either sterile PBS (control group), PBS containing <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 expressing bacteriocin (Bac+ group) or PBS containing <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 deficient for bacteriocin production (Bac− group). The bacteriocin deficient mutant had been constructed in a previous study by plasmid integration into the <italic>abpT</italic> gene which encodes the bacteriocin transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Corr1">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s003">Table S1</xref>). To control for the possible (but unlikely) effects associated with the integrated plasmid in the genome of the knock-out strain, the strain producing bacteriocin and administered to mice in the Bac+ group was a derivative of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 harboring the same plasmid but integrated in the non-essential <italic>lacZ</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s003">Table S1</xref>). Faeces of each individual of the three groups were collected at the start of the trial and after 7 days of feeding, and microbiota composition determined by amplicon pyrosequencing.</p>
        <p>For the pig trial, all <italic>L. salivarius</italic> strains administered were rifampicin-resistant derivatives of the parent strains. However, the experimental facility used for the pig trial prohibited the use of antibiotic-resistant genetically-modified organisms (containing foreign DNA), and so the strains used for the mouse trial were not suitable. Thus, a new derivative of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 deficient in bacteriocin production was constructed by clean deletion of the <italic>abpT</italic> gene. This isogenic <italic>abpT</italic> mutant, named <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 Δ<italic>abpT</italic>, was constructed using the pORI<sub>19</sub>/pVE<sub>6007</sub> system previously used in our group to construct an isogenic sortase mutant in UCC118 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-vanPijkeren1">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s003">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). In this technique, 1 kb upstream and downstream flanking regions of the <italic>abpT</italic> gene were amplified using primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s004">Table S2</xref>, joined by Splicing by Overlap Extension (SOE)-PCR, and then cloned in the non-replicative pORI<sub>19</sub> vector. This construct, named pORI-Δ<italic>abpT</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s003">Table S1</xref>), was introduced by transformation of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 harboring the pVE<sub>6007</sub> helper vector to allow replication of pORI-Δ<italic>abpT</italic>.

        <p>Pigs were fed (each day and for 29 days) sterile milk (control group), milk containing <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 WT, producing bacteriocin (Bac+ group) or milk containing <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 Δ<italic>abpT</italic>, deficient in bacteriocin production (Bac− group). Pig faeces were collected at the start of the trial and after 28 days. Microbiota composition was determined by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Fecal samples as well as ileal content and tissue samples were also collected at different times of the trial and used to enumerate administered strains in the pig GIT. Finally, pig sera were collected at the start of the trial and after 14 and 29 days of treatment, to evaluate the effect of administering the respective strains on pig immune system parameters.</p>

        <p>Because of their rifampicin resistance, we were able to enumerate the administered strains in faeces throughout the pig trial and thus to determine if they were able to survive GIT transit. After 14 days treatment, all probiotic-fed pigs excreted rifampicin-resistant (Rif<sup>R</sup>) microorganisms between 2.8×10<sup>3</sup> and 6.1×10<sup>6</sup> CFU/g faeces, with a median of 5.7×10<sup>4</sup> and 1.7×10<sup>5</sup> CFU/g faeces for the Bac+ group and the Bac− group, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, a median of 8.0×10<sup>2</sup> Rif<sup>R</sup> CFU/g faeces was enumerated in control pig faeces and statistical analysis revealed that control group counts were not significantly different from counts in Bac+ or Bac− groups after multiple testing (<italic>p</italic> = 0.058 and 0.046, respectively; Bonferroni Correction&gt;0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). This was due to presence of abundant naturally Rif<sup>R</sup> microorganisms in two of the control group pigs which excreted 8×10<sup>6</sup> and 2×10<sup>5</sup> Rif<sup>R</sup> CFU/g faeces, respectively, whereas the other pigs excreted between 0 and 1×10<sup>3</sup> Rif<sup>R</sup> CFU/g faeces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

        <p>Following 28 days treatment, Bac+ and Bac− groups excreted Rif<sup>R</sup> microorganisms at median levels of 1.4×10<sup>7</sup> and 3.0×10<sup>8</sup> CFU/g faeces, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). This was significantly higher than similar counts in the control group (9.0×10<sup>2</sup> Rif<sup>R</sup> CFU/g faeces, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, Bonferroni Correction&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). This shows that <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 WT or Δ<italic>abpT</italic> were the major microorganisms responsible for these counts. The presence of both strains in pig faeces demonstrates that <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 survived transit of the pig GIT. Both strains seemed to survive similarly as there was no significant difference between <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 fecal numbers in the two probiotic-fed groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Enumeration of Rif<sup>R</sup> microorganisms was also performed with ileum tissue and its content after 29 days of treatment. Rif<sup>R</sup> microorganisms were found in the ileal contents of every pig from the probiotic-fed groups. All pigs from the Bac+ group, but only 6 of the 8 pigs from the Bac− group, harbored Rif<sup>R</sup> microorganisms on the ileal mucosa. A median of 2.7×10<sup>7</sup> and 1.3×10<sup>7</sup> Rif<sup>R</sup> CFU/g digesta were enumerated in ileal contents from pigs of the Bac+ and Bac− groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). These counts were significantly different from control group counts (2.5×10<sup>1</sup> Rif<sup>R</sup> CFU/g digesta) and thus associated to <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 WT or Δ<italic>abpT</italic> presence in ileal digesta (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005 and Bonferroni Correction&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Similarly, a median of 2.5×10<sup>1</sup> and 4.9×10<sup>3</sup> Rif<sup>R</sup> CFU/g tissue were enumerated on ileal tissues from pigs of the Bac+ and Bac− groups respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Again, these counts were significantly different from control group counts (no Rif<sup>R</sup> CFU for any of the control group pigs) and thus associated to <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 WT or Δ<italic>abpT</italic> presence (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005 and Bonferroni Correction&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). This allowed us to demonstrate that administered strains were able to survive in, and colonize upon, the ileal mucosa. We also observed that the mutant strain seemed to colonize slightly better than the wild-type strain but this difference failed to be significant after multiple testing (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and Bonferroni Correction&gt;0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

        <p>Pigs were individually housed and individual pig weights were recorded on Day 0. Pig weight and feed removal were recorded after 14 and 28 days of treatment to allow calculation of average daily gain, average daily feed intake and feed conversion efficiency. At the start of the trial, all three groups had similar pig weight (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.10) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0031113-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The lower average daily gain observed in the probiotic-fed group was associated with a numerical deterioration in feed conversion efficiency (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06) compared to the control, during this period. This difference in average daily gain was not observed between Day 0 and Day 14 (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.10) or between Day 0 and Day 28 (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.10) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0031113-t001">Table 1</xref>).

        <title>Mouse and pig microbiota evolved during the time of the trial</title>
        <p>Total DNA was extracted from murine and porcine faeces at the beginning of the trial and after 7 and 28 days of treatment respectively, and used to amplify and sequence pooled amplicons of the V4 (mouse trial) or V4–V5 (pig trial) region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Each sequence read corresponded to a specific operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and was assigned at the phylum and genus level by homology comparison. The number of reads per OTU allowed us to determine the relative abundance of each OTU.</p>
        <p>Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) was used to highlight similarities or differences between each individual animal on the basis of their microbiota composition and of the time of sampling (Day 0 and 7 for the mouse trial and Day 0 and 28 for the pig trial). This analysis revealed that mice, on Day 0, could not be discriminated on the basis of microbiota composition as they all clustered together (cluster 1 = Day 0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). It also allowed us to show that most individual pigs (19 of 24 pigs) could not be discriminated on the basis of their microbiota composition determined on the first day of the trial (cluster 1 = Day 0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). However 5 pigs (3 from the control group and 2 from the Bac− group) demonstrated a microbiota that was dramatically different from that of cluster 1 pigs because their microbiota seemed to be depleted in a number of genera (cluster 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The two pigs from the Bac− group had diarrhea on the first day of the trial. We thus conclude that their abnormal microbiota composition reflects this condition. The three other pigs from the control group also demonstrated an abnormal microbiota composition that was similar to the microbiota of the two pigs with diarrhea, although these animals did not show any physical symptoms of disease. Therefore, data from the five pigs with an abnormal microbiota composition were excluded from further Day 0 data analysis.</p>

        <p>Determination of microbiota composition at the start of the trial revealed that the mouse microbiota was composed of a majority of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, accounting for almost 95% of total microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s005">Table S3</xref>). In the pig, these two phyla were also a majority and represented around 85% of total microbiota. Comparison of OTU relative abundance between each group (control, Bac+ and Bac−) confirmed PCoA in showing that there was no significant difference between the initial microbiota composition of each group, neither at the phylum nor at the genus level (data not shown). This is significant because it would allow us to identify any probiotic-administration related effect on microbiota composition.</p>

        <p>PCoA also revealed that animal microbiota composition determined at the end of each trial (after 7 days of treatment for the mouse trial and 28 days for the pig trial) seemed to differ from the microbiota determined at Day 0 (Cluster 2 = Day 7 and Day 28, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g004">4</xref> respectively) with the exception of two mice from the Bac− group that tended to cluster with Day 0 mice, on the basis of their microbiota composition. To evaluate microbiota evolution over time, and bearing in mind that we had established that animal microbiota composition was similar at the start of the trial, we compared relative abundance of all OTUs at the start and the end of the trial in the control group only. We first observed in the murine microbiota, small and non significant variations over time of a number of genera (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s005">Table S3</xref>). In contrast, one major pig microbiota phylum significantly increased in proportion during pig growth. In fact, <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> proportion represented a median of 0.02 of the microbiota at the start of the trial whereas it represented a median of 0.15 at the end (p&lt;0.005, Bonferroni correction&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>). Probably in compensation, <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> proportions tended to decrease slightly, but not significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>). The same variation was observed at the genus level whereby the proportion of <italic>Treponema</italic>, a member of the phylum <italic>Spirochaetes</italic>, significantly increased during the time of the trial (median of 0.01 in proportion at Day 0 compared to a median of 0.15 at Day 28, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005 and <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05) while members of the phylum <italic>Firmicutes</italic> such as <italic>Blautia</italic>, <italic>Clostridium</italic>, <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, <italic>Roseburia</italic> or <italic>Parasporobacterium</italic> significantly decreased in proportion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>).

        <title><italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration induces modification of the mouse microbiota by a bacteriocin-dependent mechanism</title>
        <p>PCoA revealed a clear separation, at the end of the mouse trial, between the control and Bac− groups, and the Bac+ group (cluster 2A: control and Bac− groups, Day 7 and cluster 2B: Bac+ group, Day 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Comparisons of OTU relative abundance between each group allowed identification of specific taxa responsible for this differentiation. In fact, we observed that proportion of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> decreased whereas <italic>Firmicutes</italic> increased more in Bac+ treated mice compared to control and Bac− treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g005">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s005">Table S3</xref>). However, changes observed at the phylum level were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. Similarly, there was no significant difference at the genus level between microbiota composition of mice of the control group or of the Bac− group when compared to all the other groups. Interestingly, a number of genus proportions were significantly altered by <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration when comparing the microbiota composition of Bac+ group mice to that of control and Bac− group mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s005">Table S3</xref>). Thus, we observed a greater decrease in the proportion of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> (<italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>), one of the largest genera in the mouse microbiota, in Bac+ mice than in other mice (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s005">Table S3</xref>). Proportions of two other members of the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> phylum were affected by <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration. <italic>Tannerella</italic> decreased in Bac+ mice whereas it increased in other groups and <italic>Prevotella</italic> showed a greater increase in Bac+ mice than in other mice (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05 and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0005, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s005">Table S3</xref>). Proportions of four members of the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phylum, <italic>Parasporobacterium</italic>, <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, <italic>Papillibacter</italic> and <italic>Ethanoligenens</italic> were significantly higher in mice from the Bac+ group than in mice from other groups (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05 and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s005">Table S3</xref>). We conclude from these results that <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration affected genera in the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phyla. As these effects were only observed when the wild-type strain was administered, we can say that bacteriocin production was mainly responsible for <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration effects on mouse microbiota.</p>

        <title><italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration induced modification of the pig microbiota which was greater with a bacteriocin producing strain</title>
        <p>PCoA analysis showed that the microbiota composition of probiotic-fed pigs tended to cluster together and tended to differ from control pigs (cluster 2A: control group, Day 28 and cluster 2B: Bac+ and Bac− groups, Day 28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). One pig from the Bac− group, at Day 28, did not cluster with any of the other pigs for yet unknown reasons and was considered as an outlier; data from this pig were excluded from further analyses. Comparison of OTU relative abundance between each group allowed identification of specific taxa responsible for differentiation between groups. Thus, we observed that the proportion of <italic>Spirochaetes</italic>, one of the largest phyla in the pig microbiota, was measurably affected by <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration. Whereas, as already stated, <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> proportion significantly increased over time in control pig microbiota, its proportion remained constant in Bac+ pig microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>). Thus, the proportion of <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> was significantly lower in Bac+ pig microbiota than in control pig microbiota after 28 days treatment (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, Bonferroni correction&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>). In the Bac− group, we observed an intermediate state: the proportion of <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> tended to increase but to a lesser extent to what occurred in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>). After statistical analysis, <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> proportion in the Bac− pig microbiota was significantly lower compared to that in control pig microbiota when only considering <italic>p</italic> value, but it did not reach significance after adjustment for multiple testing (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Bonferroni correction&gt;0.5). Moreover, <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> proportion in Bac− pig microbiota was not significantly different from the proportion observed in Bac+ pig microbiota. We observed the same phenomenon at the genus level, where the trend for <italic>Treponema</italic> (<italic>Spirochaetes</italic>) evolved in the same way as the whole phylum did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>). <italic>Treponema</italic> proportion was thus significantly lower in microbiota of the Bac+ pigs than in the control pigs (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05). The <italic>Treponema</italic> proportion of the Bac− pig microbiota was lower compared to the proportion of <italic>Treponema</italic> in control pigs (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) but this difference was not significant after multiple testing (<italic>q</italic>&gt;0.1). Moreover, <italic>Treponema</italic> proportion in Bac− treated pig microbiota was not significantly different from proportion observed in the Bac+ group. A number of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> genera were also affected by <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration during the pig trial. Thus, we observed that whereas the proportion of <italic>Sudboligranulum</italic> increased in all three groups during the trial, a significantly greater increase occurred in the Bac+ group compared to the control group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>). While the proportion of <italic>Oribacterium</italic> decreased in the control group over time, it increased in both probiotic-fed pig groups, but this difference was only significant when comparing Bac+ and control groups (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>). <italic>Anaerostipes</italic> proportion tended to slightly increase over time in the control group whereas it decreased in both the Bac+ and Bac− groups. Thus, proportion of <italic>Anaerostipes</italic> was significantly lower in the Bac+ group than in the control group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05). Proportion of <italic>Anaerostipes</italic> in the Bac− group was not statistically different from levels observed in the two other groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>). <italic>Lactonifactor</italic> proportion decreased with time in the three groups but the decrease was significantly higher in Bac+ group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>). Finally, the proportion of <italic>Hallella</italic> (<italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>) decreased in the control group whereas it tended to remain constant over the time in both Bac+ and Bac− groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031113.s006">Table S4</xref>). The <italic>Hallella</italic> proportion was thus significantly higher in the Bac+ group compared to the control group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05) whereas it was not different from <italic>Hallella</italic> proportion in the Bac− group. We can conclude from these results that administration of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 WT significantly affected pig microbiota leading to significant differences between microbiota composition of control and Bac+ groups. We observed that administration of the mutant strain, <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 Δ<italic>abpT</italic>, led to an intermediate state: the porcine fecal microbiota composition in this group was not statistically different from either of the other two groups, but tended to be more similar to the microbiota recorded for the Bac+ group. This result concurs with PCoA which showed that Bac+ and Bac− pigs tend to cluster together and tend to differ from control pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031113-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). We can thus say that bacteriocin production may be only partially responsible for the <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration effects on the pig microbiota. Other mechanisms could be involved and need to be identified.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the administration of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 and more specifically the effect of bacteriocin production by this microorganism on the intestinal microbiota of mammalian models, using faeces as a surrogate. For simplicity, we determined microbiota composition pre- and post-intervention periods of one and four weeks in mice and pigs, respectively. Shorter duration microbiota perturbations may have been overlooked by this pragmatic trial design. Overall, two measures of microbiota diversity, Shannon index and Phylogenetic Diversity, did not alter significantly within or between treatment groups, but as noted above, large inter-individual variation within treatment groups may confound this measurement.</p>
      <p>Our observation that <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 survived pig gastrointestinal tract and colonized the pig ileum, is concordant with the behavior of another <italic>L. salivarius</italic> strain, DPC6005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Walsh1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Gardiner1">[16]</xref>. Moreover, Walsh and collaborators showed that among a five strain probiotic mixture, <italic>L. salivarius</italic> DPC6005 was predominantly recovered from ileal digesta and mucosa compared to the 4 other <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species used in the mixture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Walsh1">[14]</xref>. The authors hypothesized that this was due to a competitive advantage afforded by Salivaricin P produced by <italic>L. salivarius</italic> DPC6005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Walsh1">[14]</xref>. The bacteriocin Abp118 produced by <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118, is highly similar to Salivaricin P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Barrett1">[17]</xref> and we thus hypothesized that its production would also confer an advantage to <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 intestinal colonization. However, our data do not provide a straightforward confirmation of this hypothesis. Indeed, we observed no significant difference between the colonizing ability of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 WT and its non-bacteriocin-producing derivative in pigs. On the contrary, <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 Δ<italic>abpT</italic> tended to be present in higher numbers on porcine ileal mucosa than the wild-type strain. It thus seems that under the conditions employed, <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 ileal colonization was not due to bacteriocin production. It should be noted that in our study, <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 was administered alone and not as a member of a probiotic mixture. It thus did not need to compete with other members of the inoculum as in the study of Walsh and collaborators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Walsh1">[14]</xref>. So, it can be hypothesized that the apparent predominance of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> DPC6005 in the porcine ileal mucosa was not due to competition with member(s) of the host microbiota, but was due to competition with the other components of the probiotic mixture. However, as molecular methods could not be applied in this study, we assed the number of administered probiotics by bacterial cell enumeration. This technique may not be the most accurate but gives a good overview of the capacity of the probiotic strain to survive and colonize within the GIT.</p>
      <p>We also showed in this study that between Day 14 and Day 28 of the trial, pigs fed probiotics gained significantly less weight than pigs in the control group. This was associated with higher feed conversion efficiency during this period, for these groups compared to the control group. This result contradicts the finding of a previous study that found that administration of <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> BSA131 to piglets enhanced pig daily weight gain and feed conversion rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Chang1">[18]</xref>. However, our results are in accordance with a recent study showing that intake of <italic>Lactobacillus gasseri</italic> SBT2055 by adults with obese tendencies significantly reduced body weight and body fat mass among other parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Kadooka1">[19]</xref>. We can conclude that the probiotic effect on body weight is species and strain dependent. While body weight enhancement can be useful in animal production, the opposite effect would be very useful for human weight management. Further studies including measurement of probiotic effect on other host factors like adiponectin or calprotectin are needed to confirm this possibility.</p>

We attempted to measure porcine IL-10 levels but despite several attempts to improve the protocol, we were not able to detect IL-10 in pig serum. <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 consumption had no effect on IL-8 levels in pig.

These results are in accordance with a previous study carried on by Lamendella and collaborators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Lamendella1">[21]</xref> where they showed that the most abundant phyla in pigs are <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and then <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>. According to this study, two other phyla are also present in great amount in pigs: <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and <italic>Spirochaetes</italic>. Similarly, in the mouse trial, we determined that the major microbiota phyla were (in decreasing order of importance): <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Tenericute</italic>, <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and <italic>TM7</italic>. These results are in accordance with results of a previous study where the authors showed that the relative abundances of the major phyla were: <italic>Firmicutes</italic> 30–70%; <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, 10–40%; <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> 1–15%; <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, <italic>Tenericutes</italic>, <italic>TM7</italic>, and <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> 0.1–0.5% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Benson1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The design of these studies allowed us to determine what microbiota alterations were due to probiotic administration, or to bacteriocin production. Despite administration of a large inoculum of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 to animals (around 1×10<sup>10</sup> CFU/day), total proportions of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in microbiota of probiotic fed animals did not change over the time course of the trials. We can hypothesize that <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 replaced other members of the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genus. In mice and pigs, members of the phylum <italic>Firmicutes</italic> were affected either positively or negatively by <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 consumption. In both trials, this effect was observed when the wild-type cells were administered, allowing us to conclude that this effect is bacteriocin dependent. Reduction in proportion of certain <italic>Firmicutes</italic> genera was foreseen, as Abp118 is active on closely related microorganisms i.e. <italic>Firmicutes</italic> members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Flynn1">[23]</xref>. If some bacteriocin-sensitive <italic>Firmicutes</italic> members decrease in proportion, others will have the opportunity to replace them, explaining our observation that some <italic>Firmicutes</italic> members increased in proportion. Elimination-succession could be a general phenomenon related to bacteriocin action upon microbiota composition.</p>
      <p>Probiotic consumption also affected Gram negative microorganisms in both mouse and pig models. This is a surprising and interesting result because, as stated above, Abp118 has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to be active only against closely related species, and bacteriocins elaborated by LAB are normally active exclusively against Gram positive microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Flynn1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Jack1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Klaenhammer1">[25]</xref>. Moreover, Corr and collaborators showed that Abp118 is not active against <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and hypothesized that the <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 protective effect against this pathogen is more likely due to competitive exclusion or immunomodulation of host defenses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Corr1">[12]</xref>. However, LAB bacteriocin activity against Gram negative microorganisms can be detected under certain <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions e.g. when the outer membrane is permeabilized as when EDTA treated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Jack1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-MartinVisscher1">[26]</xref>. Moreover, a novel bacteriocin produced by <italic>L. salivarius</italic> 1077 was identified in a recent study and demonstrated activity against a number of Gram negative genera such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Campylobacter</italic>, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Svetoch1">[27]</xref>. The reductions we observed in proportions of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Tanerella</italic> (<italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>) in mice administered <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 WT when compared to the control, might exemplify anti-Gram negative bacterium activity of LAB bacteriocins under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. We also showed that <italic>Treponema</italic> (<italic>Spirochaetes</italic>) proportions were significantly lower in pigs fed <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 WT, when compared to the control. However, <italic>Treponema</italic> levels also tended to be lower in pigs fed bacteriocin deficient <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 cells, demonstrating that bacteriocin production may not be entirely responsible for the observed effect. In this context, it is interesting to note that a recent metagenomic study identified unusually high levels of certain <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> in the porcine gut, relative to other mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Lamendella1">[21]</xref>. Thus the ability of <italic>L. salivarius</italic> to modulate these levels could be significant. In addition to bacteriocin production, other yet-unknown bacterial properties such as competition for intestinal niches (competitive exclusion), may also be involved in <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> inhibition by <italic>L. salivarius</italic>. It should be noted that the Gram negative genera <italic>Prevotella</italic>, in mouse, and <italic>Hallella</italic>, in pig, showed greater proportions in the Bac+ treated group compared to the control group. This effect can be explained, as for <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, by the fact that if some genera tend to decrease, other can thus replace the former and expand in proportion. The biological significance of alterations caused upon levels of gram-negative bacteria is currently unclear, but could be significant. For example, <italic>Prevotella</italic> can cause opportunistic infection in humans and some <italic>Tannerella</italic> strains can act as anaerobic periodontal pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Alauzet1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Posch1">[29]</xref>. As noted above, Gram-negative bacteria are typically insensitive <italic>in vitro</italic> to bacteriocins from gram positive bacteria because of exclusion by the outer membrane; this exclusion may be less effective <italic>in vivo</italic>, for example by chelation of divalent cations that stabilize this outer membrane. Further research is required to determine precisely how <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 can induce inhibition of certain Gram negative microorganisms.</p>
      <p><italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 modulation of Gram negative bacterium proportions is interesting because it supports the concept of a counter-pathogen effect by a probiotic. <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> include natural members of the intestinal microbiota that, under certain conditions, can become opportunistic pathogens in both humans and animals. <italic>Treponema</italic> sp. has been shown to induce colitis, and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> sp. synthesizes a toxin that can lead to diarrhea in the infected host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Molbak1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Wick1">[31]</xref>. Administration of cultures like <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 could afford animals some degree of protection from these kinds of infections. It is also noteworthy that microbiota alterations linked to <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 administration were limited to a small number of genera and are clearly less dramatic than microbiota disruption caused by antibiotic treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Dethlefsen1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Rettedal1">[33]</xref>. The fact that <italic>L. salivarius</italic> UCC118 did not cause dramatic alteration in the fecal microbiota is also reassuring, as the consumption of probiotic products should not lead to potentially drastic microbiota re-modeling. Such a conclusion cannot be generalized, however, and will be qualified in future studies by reference to strain identity, by dosage, and by sampling the microbiota throughout the GIT length, rather than just in faeces.</p>

For the first 7 days post-weaning, pigs were fed an un-medicated starter diet (16.33 MJ digestible energy/kg and 15.5 g/kg lysine). This was followed by a 7-day acclimatization period, during which 100 ml of sterile reconstituted skim milk (RSM) was fed daily to each pig in addition to an un-medicated basal diet, which was formulated to contain 15.38 MJ digestible energy /kg and 14.7 g/kg total lysine.

The PCR conditions were 94°C for 50 seconds (initialization and denaturing), 42°C for 30 seconds (annealing), 72°C for 60 seconds in 35 cycles (extension), and a final elongation step at 72°C for 5 minutes. Negative control reactions containing all components, but water instead of template, were performed to confirm lack of contamination with post-PCR product. PCR products were quantified using the Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA Kit according to the manufacturer's conditions (Turner BioSystems, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Concentration of all obtained PCR products was around 50 ng/ml and they were thus considered homogeneous.

        <p>Pooled 16S rRNA gene amplicons were then sequenced using 454 GS FLX Titanium technology (Cogenics, Meylan, France for the mouse trial and Macrogen, Geumchen-gu, South Korea for the pig trial).

        <p>To assign amplicon sequences to species level, we extracted 77,294 V4 sequences from 127,977 full-length 16S rRNA genes having complete species classifications (RDP release 10.24) using the same primer pair as was used for the amplification. In brief, an association table with species-specific cut-off BLAST scores was designed from an all-against-all BLAST search of the <italic>in silico</italic> extracted V4 sequences. If the same-species score for a certain species was higher than the score of the first hit against a different species, than that species was considered assignable, and the score of the first hit against a different species was recorded as the cut-off score. Thus, 53% of 9,664 species with extracted V4 sequences were assignable through this approach. Subsequently, all 9,645 and 271,059 OTUs in the porcine and murine data sets, respectively, were BLAST searched against this species database resulting in classification efficiencies of 2.6% and 5.3% for porcine and murine data sets, respectively, into species level (best BLAST hit against that species had to greater than its cut-off score).</p>

        <p>The processed Pyrosequencing datasets, microbial count dataset and the cytokine dataset were analyzed in R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-R1">[42]</xref>. Feature selection was carried out using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test with correction for multiple testing using either Bonferroni correction or q-values where there were a large number of variables being tested. Q values were generated using the R library q value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Storey1">[43]</xref>. When applying statistics, rare taxa were removed using a filter of 20% occupancy. This means that when applying a statistical test to a dataset, a variable was removed from testing if it contained 80% or more zeros. For the mouse feeding trail the time-point 0 samples were grouped for the comparisons to the three treatment groups.</p>
        <p>Statistical analysis of the pig growth performance was carried out as follows: three treatments were tested using twenty four entire male pigs arranged in eight randomized complete blocks. Each block consisted of three individual pigs similar in initial weight and ancestry. The experiment was analyzed using the General Linear Models (GLM) procedures of SAS (Sas Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) for a randomized complete block design. The pig was the experimental unit and the model used for the statistical analysis of pig performance had the effects for treatment. The results were presented as least squares means ± SEM. The Duncan's multiple range procedure was used for means separation.</p>
        <p>Alpha diversity in murine and porcine microbiota datasets was calculated using both Shannon and Phylogenetic Diversity metrics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-Faith1">[44]</xref>. The R statistical software was used to generate the statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031113-R1">[42]</xref>. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine statistical differences between the groups in the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genus as a whole and in <italic>L. intestinalis</italic>. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine significant differences between each pair of groups.</p>
