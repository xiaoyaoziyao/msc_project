        <p>During adulthood, the neurotrophin Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) sensitizes
                    nociceptors, thereby increasing the response to noxious stimuli. The
                    relationship between NGF and pain is supported by genetic evidence: mutations in
                    the NGF TrkA receptor in patients affected by an hereditary rare disease
                    (Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type IV, HSAN IV) determine a
                    congenital form of severe pain insensitivity, with mental retardation, while a
                    mutation in <italic>NGFB</italic> gene, leading to the aminoacid substitution
                        <italic>R100W</italic> in mature NGF, determines a similar loss of pain
                    perception, without overt cognitive neurological defects (HSAN V). The R100W
                    mutation provokes a reduced processing of proNGF to mature NGF in cultured cells
                    and a higher percentage of neurotrophin secreted is in the proNGF form.
                    Moreover, using Surface Plasmon Resonance we showed that the R100W mutation does
                    not affect NGF binding to TrkA, while it abolishes NGF binding to p75NTR
                    receptors. However, it remains to be clarified whether the major impact of the
                    mutation is on the biological function of proNGF or of mature NGF and to what
                    extent the effects of the R100W mutation on the HSAN V clinical phenotype are
                    developmental, or whether they reflect an impaired effectiveness of NGF to
                    regulate and mediate nociceptive transmission in adult sensory neurons. Here we
                    show that the R100 mutation selectively alters some of the signaling pathways
                    activated downstream of TrkA NGF receptors. NGFR100 mutants maintain identical
                    neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties in a variety of cell assays, while
                    displaying a significantly reduced pain-inducing activity <italic>in
                        vivo</italic> (n = 8–10 mice/group). We also show
                    that proNGF has a significantly reduced nociceptive activity, with respect to
                    NGF. Both sets of results jointly contribute to elucidating the mechanisms
                    underlying the clinical HSAN V manifestations, and to clarifying which receptors
                    and intracellular signaling cascades participate in the pain sensitizing action
                    of NGF.</p>

      <p>The neurotrophin Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-LeviMontalcini1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-LeviMontalcini2">[2]</xref> was originally
                identified for its developmental actions, as a neurotrophic survival factor
                necessary for the development and differentiation of sympathetic and sensory neurons
                during embryogenesis. In the adult, NGF was subsequently shown to exert pleiotropic
                actions in various neural and non neural cells, including phenotypic maintenance of
                basal forebrain cholinergic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Hefti1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Mobley1">[4]</xref> and functional modulation of sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Pezet1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Snider1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Ritter1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Lewin1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The NGF/TrkA system is known to be a potent mediator of pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Pezet1">[5]</xref>. Indeed, NGF is produced in
                injured tissues and acts a mediator of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Pezet1">[5]</xref>. NGF acts directly on peptidergic
                C fiber nociceptors, which express both NGF receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkA, and the
                p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Snider1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Chao1">[9]</xref>. TrkA-mediated activation of Erks and PLC−γ1 and
                p75NTR-mediated c-jun activation have been proposed to contribute to the pronounced
                pain observed upon NGF administration, <italic>via</italic> the opening of TRPV1
                channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Pezet1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Doya1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-MalikHall1">[11]</xref>. The role of
                p75NTR in nociception is, on the contrary, more controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Obata1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Bergmann1">[13]</xref>. Also, nothing is known on
                the relative contribution of NGF versus that of proNGF in the sensitization of
                nociceptive pathways. Thus, both NGF receptors seem to contribute to peripheral
                sensitization and nociception, although the extent of their relative contribution
                remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>Besides its actions on the sensitization and hyperexcitability of sensory neurons,
                NGF exerts a TrkA-mediated chemotactic activity on mast and basophil cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Sawada1">[14]</xref>, attracting
                them towards inflammation sites, and inducing their degranulation and secretion of
                the inflammatory soup <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Horigome1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Kawamoto1">[16]</xref>. For this reason, the NGF/TrkA system can be considered a
                master switch for chronic and inflammatory pain responses.</p>
      <p>The exogenous administration of NGF induces pain in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Lewin2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Lewin3">[18]</xref> and, when delivered to humans,
                it induces allodynia, prolonged hyperalgesia, widespread deep pain and muscular
                tenderness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Dyck1">[19]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Petty1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Svensson1">[21]</xref>. The pain
                elicited by NGF infusions was severely dose-limiting, leading to clinical lack of
                efficacy, in clinical trials for diabetic polyneuropathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Apfel1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Apfel2">[23]</xref> or a cause for interruption of
                Alzheimer's disease trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-EriksdotterJonhagen1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The physiological relevance of the NGF system as a crucial regulator of pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Pezet1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Nicol1">[25]</xref> is highlighted
                by robust genetic evidence in humans. Rare forms of congenital insensitivity to pain
                [human sensory and autonomic neuropathy type and V, HSAN IV (OMIM # 256800) and
                HSAN V(OMIM # 608654)] are caused by mutations in the <italic>NTRK1</italic>
                gene, coding for the NGF receptor, TrkA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Indo1">[26]</xref>, and the NGFB gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Einarsdottir1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Carvalho1">[28]</xref> respectively.
                HSAN IV NTRK1 mutations abolish or reduce TrkA responsiveness to NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Indo1">[26]</xref>. HSAN IV patients
                show a severe pain insensitivity, anhydrosis and mental retardation, which have been
                interpreted as due to the developmental consequences of lack of trophic support by
                the NGF/TrkA system to target neurons, including sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Indo1">[26]</xref>. Importantly,
                HSAN V patients, differently from HSAN IV patients, while displaying a similar
                congenital insensitivity to pain, show no mental retardation nor other neurological
                and cognitive deficits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-deAndrade1">[29]</xref>, suggesting that neurodevelopmental effects on NGF target
                neurons, including sensory neurons, are probably minor in HSAN V patients. The
                single nucleotide missense mutation in the <italic>NGFB</italic> gene, found in a
                family of HSAN V patients, who show impaired temperature sensation and an almost
                complete loss of deep pain perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Einarsdottir1">[27]</xref>, but normal sweating

                impact of the R100W mutation on NGF functions is unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Larsson1">[31]</xref>. It has been reported that the
                R100W mutation provokes a reduced processing of proNGF to mature NGF in cultured
                cells and that the higher percentage of neurotrophin secreted is in the proNGF form
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Larsson1">[31]</xref>.
                However, it remains to be clarified whether the major impact of the mutation is on
                the biological function of proNGF or of mature NGF. Also, it is presently unclear to
                what extent the effects of the R100W mutation on the HSAN V clinical phenotype are
                developmental, or whether they reflect an impaired effectiveness of NGF to regulate
                and mediate nociceptive transmission in adult sensory neurons.</p>
      <p>For these reasons, we undertook a series of studies to assess the binding and the
                functional properties of hNGFR100 and hproNGFR100 mutants. In a previous study, we
                derived hNGF mutants from refolded hproNGF protein, by controlled proteolysis and
                subsequent chromatography. While all mutants yielded comparable amounts of protein
                in inclusion bodies, they gave distinct yields after refolding and purification,
                respectively maximum for wild type hNGF, hNGFR100K and hNGFR100Q, intermediate for
                hNGFR100A and hNGFR100E and much lower for the genetic mutant hNGFR100W (or for
                mutants with hydrophobic residues R100Y, R100I, R100L and R100V consistently) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Covaceuszach1">[32]</xref>. The
                recombinant proteins were used for <italic>in vitro</italic> receptor binding
                studies to purified TrkA and p75NTR receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Covaceuszach1">[32]</xref>, by surface plasmon
                resonance (SPR).The hNGFR100 mutants, R100W and R100E, while showing an affinity for
                TrkA identical to that of hNGF, demonstrated a significantly lower affinity for
                p75NTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Covaceuszach1">[32]</xref>.
                In the context of hproNGF, the R100W and R100E mutations did not affect at all the
                binding of hproNGF to TrkA, while the binding of unprocessed hproNGFR100W and
                hproNGFR100E mutant to p75NTR was not greatly affected, revealing only a two-fold
                decrease in affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Covaceuszach1">[32]</xref>. Thus, we concluded that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, the
                major impact of the R100 mutation (notably with the 100W and R100E substitutions) is
                on the binding of mature hNGF to the p75NTR, while, in the context of unprocessed
                hproNGF, the mutation has a much lower effect.</p>
      <p>The impact of the R100W mutation on receptor binding is consistent with structural
                predictions based on the crystallographic structures of hNGF complexes with p75NTR
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-He1">[33]</xref> and TrkA

                participates in an extensive charge complementary surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017321.s006">Fig. S1B</xref>). The

      <p>In this paper, we assessed the functional properties of hNGFR100 mutants, providing a
                functional characterization of the R100 mutation in the context of both hNGF and
                hproNGF. The data show that the R100 mutation, alters the signaling pathways
                activated downstream of both NGF receptors, abrogating pain-inducing activity, while
                maintaining identical neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties in cell models. We
                also show that proNGF has a significantly reduced nociceptive activity, with respect
                to NGF. These results offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying the clinical
                manifestations in HSAN V patients, and provide a basis for the development of
                “painless” hNGF molecules with therapeutic potential for
                neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

        <p>To characterize the effects of the R100W mutation in cell signaling <italic>in

        <p>The activation of TrkA signal transduction pathways by hNGF mutants was studied

                    The phosphorylation of this residue by hNGFR100W and by hNGFR100E mutants,
                    determined with a site-specific anti- phosphoTrkA antibody, was reduced by
                    70% with respect to that induced by hNGF, or by other hNGFR100 mutants,

                    but only slightly affected in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g001">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). TrkA-dependent signaling linked
                    to neuronal survival is channeled, via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)
                    through the downstream Akt pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Reichardt1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Kaplan1">[40]</xref>. The activation of Akt in

                    antibodies against active Akt. All hNGFR100 mutants, including R100W and R100E
                    mutants, were equally effective as wild type hNGF in activating this pathway in

                    and hNGFR100E share similar properties. A significant reduction of PLC-γ1
                    activation by hNGFR100E proteins was also found in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g001">Fig. 1E,G</xref>). TrkA activation by

        <p>In conclusion, the R100W and R100E mutants, in spite of an overall binding
                    affinity for TrkA that is identical to that of wild type hNGF, show a selective
                    inhibition of certain signaling pathways downstream to TrkA activation. The
                    selective inhibition of TrkA signaling by hNGFR100 mutants occurs both in the
                    absence or in the presence of p75NTR.</p>
        <p>Since R100W and R100E hNGF mutants share superimposable receptor binding
                    properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Covaceuszach1">[32]</xref> and TrkA signaling properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), and since the yield of R100E
                    proteins was much higher than that of the R100W mutants, subsequent cell
                    bioassays and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were performed using the R100E
                    proteins.</p>
        <p>As far as p75NTR signaling is concerned, it is expected that the lower binding
                    affinity of hNGFR100E mutants for p75NTR results in a reduction of downstream
                    signaling. The effectiveness of hNGFR100E mutants to activate p75NTR signaling,
                    was assessed by analyzing the phosphorylation of c-jun at residue Ser63, through
                    the p75NTR dependent activation of the jnk kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-CasacciaBonnefil1">[44]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017321.s007">Fig. S2</xref>).
                    In hippocampal cells, as expected, the phosphorylation of c-jun by hNGFR100E,
                    was reduced by 30% with respect to that induced by hNGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g001">Fig. 1I</xref>). It is noteworthy
                    that the level of phosphorylation of c-jun induced by hNGFR100E is even lower
                    than the basal levels in untreated hippocampal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g001">Fig. 1I</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thus, mutants hNGFR100W and hNGFR100E differ significantly from hNGF in their
                    ability to activate not only TrkA-dependent signaling pathways, despite their
                    identical binding affinity for TrkA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Covaceuszach1">[32]</xref> but also p75NTR
                    downstream pathways, with a notable reduction in the ability to activate Erks,
                    PLC−γ1 and c-jun.</p>

                            culture (priming) induces an NGF dependency (cell death after hNGF
                            removal, green arm), which is rescued by re-exposing the cells to hNGF
                            mutants (blue and red arms). The mutant hNGFR100E is equally effective
                            in inducing dependency after priming and survival of rat hippocampal

        <p>The neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties of hNGF and hNGFR100E mutants
                    were then compared in a neuronal amyloidogenic model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Matrone1">[48]</xref> for neurodegeneration,
                    based on rat hippocampal neuronal primary cultures. In this system hippocampal
                    neurons are, at first, plated for two days in presence of NGF (priming), after
                    which NGF is removed or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g003">Fig.
                        3B</xref>). Under these experimental conditions, in the presence of 100
                    ng/ml NGF, hippocampal neurons express increasing (albeit low) levels of TrkA
                    and p75NTR receptors, and constantly high levels of sortilin receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017321.s008">Fig. S3</xref>).
                    hNGF and hNGFR100E were equally effective in priming hippocampal neurons,
                    thereby inducing NGF dependency, as shown by the extent of neuronal death
                    following removal of the hNGF proteins (hNGFX) and incubation with anti-NGF
                    antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g003">Fig. 3C,E,H</xref>).
                    For comparison, naïve rat hippocampal neurons, not “primed”
                    with hNGF, do not acquire this NGF dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). In sister cultures of hNGF and
                    hNGFR100E- primed hippocampal neurons (hNGFX), hNGF and hNGFR100E were shown to
                    be equally effective in overcoming the cell death, induced by NGF deprivation
                    after priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g003">Fig. 3C, F,
                    I</xref>). This experiment demonstrates that the priming, dependency inducing
                    and survival promoting activity of hNGFR100E on hippocampal neurons is identical
                    to that of hNGF.</p>
        <p>The activity of the hNGF and hproNGF mutants (hNGFX and hproNGFX) was further
                    tested in cultures from mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and superior cervical
                    ganglia (SCG). Cell cultures were first exposed for 4 days to 100 ng/ml or 200
                    ng/ml of NGF or proNGF, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). This assay allows to measure both
                    induction of dependency and survival activity of NGF. On the fifth day, DRG and
                    SCG neurons were deprived of hNGFX or hproNGFX for 24 hours, before cell
                    counting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). In DRG
                    cultures, hNGF and hNGFR100E were similarly effective in determining mouse DRG
                    survival or dependency from NGF (compare blue versus green bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). hproNGF was as
                    effective as hNGF in determining neuronal survival (blue versus red bars in
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) and dependency

                        4B</xref>) while hproNGFR100E was less effective than hNGFR100E in inducing
                    DRG survival and dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig.
                        4B</xref>). Parallel experiments on chick embryo DRG neurons confirmed that
                    survival curves for chick DRG neurons obtained after incubation with different
                    doses of hNGF or hNGFR100E mutant are totally superimposable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g002">Fig. 2K</xref>), demonstrating that
                    the neurotrophic potency of hNGFR100E mutants is identical to that of wild type
                    hNGF. In SCG neuronal cultures, we found that, in the context of mature hNGF,
                    the R100E mutation did not affect hNGF ability to induce neuronal survival or
                    dependency (blue versus green bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). On the other hand, hproNGFR100E was less effective than

        <p>Therefore, hNGFR100 mutants display a highly effective neurotrophic (survival and
                    dependency) activity in both DRG and SCG cultures. As for hproNGF, in the
                    experimental conditions of the SCG and DG cultures, the neurotrophic effect of
                    proNGF is most likely due to mature NGF molecules cleaved during the incubation
                    with the neurons, and to a reduced cleavage of the hproNGFR100E with respect to
                    hproNGF (data not shown).</p>
        <p>The ability of hNGF and hproNGFR100E mutants to activate p75NTR signaling was
                    then evaluated in cultured rat oligodendrocyte progenitors cells (OPCs), which
                    express the p75NTR receptor, in the absence of TrkA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). hNGF inhibits OPC differentiation
                        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Lee1">[49]</xref> and
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig. 4E,F</xref>), while
                    hNGFR100E does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig.
                        4E,F</xref>), confirming that this mutant has a reduced ability to bind
                    p75NTR and activate p75NTR signaling. Conversely, in OPC cultures, hproNGF
                    induces a small but significant amount of cell death, while hNGF does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>). Unlike the case of
                    hNGFR100E, the mutation R100E, in the context of hproNGF, appears not to affect
                    proNGF activity, since hproNGFR100E mutant induces OPC cell death as effectively
                    as hproNGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>). On the
                    other hand, hNGFR100E did not affect OPC survival, similarly to hNGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thus the OPC culture experiments show that the R100 mutation does indeed impair
                    p75NTR signaling in the context of mature NGF, but does not do so when present
                    in the context of hproNGF. This is in line with the p75NTR binding affinity data
                        (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017321.s005">Table

        <p>Due to the fact that the R100 mutation could determine a decreased processing of

                    determined at first, since nothing is known on the sensitization of nociceptive
                    pathways by proNGF. A significant allodynic effect was induced by hproNGF at the
                    dose of 4 µg/injection (equimolar to 2 µg/injection of hNGF), but
                    surprisingly, when the dose was doubled (8 µg/injection, equimolar to the
                    hNGF dose that provides the maximum hyperalgesic response, i.e. 4
                    µg/injection), no nociceptive response at all was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). As for the

        <p>We conclude that both hNGFR100E and hproNGFR100E mutants display a greatly
                    reduced effectiveness in nociceptor sensitization and in eliciting nociceptive

                family, suffering from the rare HSAN V form, has led to the identification of a
                mutation in the NGFB gene (exon 3, nt C661T) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Einarsdottir1">[27]</xref>. This mutation changes a
                basic arginine (CGG) to a non-polar tryptophan (TGG) at a position corresponding to
                residue R100 in mature NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Einarsdottir1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>HSAN V patients suffer from loss of pain perception but show no mental retardation
                and have most neurological functions intact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-deAndrade1">[29]</xref>, suggesting that
                neurodevelopmental effects on NGF target neurons, including sensory neurons are
                probably minor in HSAN V patients. The mechanisms whereby the mutant NGFR100W exerts
                its effects in HSAN V remain however to be investigated.</p>
      <p>A recent work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Larsson1">[31]</xref>
                showed that, PC12 cells transfected with the cDNA, encoding hproNGFR100W, accumulate
                unprocessed proNGF and secrete, as a consequence, reduced amounts of mature
                hNGFR100W. On the basis of that transfection study in one cell line, it was
                hypothesized that the clinical manifestations of HSAN V may simply depend on a
                reduced availability of NGF. However, this would not explain the clinical
                differences between HSAN IV and HSAN V patients, and the reduced neurodevelopmental
                consequences in the latter, and, moreover, does not address the issue of what is the
                mechanism for a reduced pain sensation in adult HSAN V patients.</p>
      <p>In this work, we exploited a set of well characterized recombinant forms of hNGFR100
                mutant proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Covaceuszach1">[32]</xref> to study the functional properties of hNGFR100 mutants,
                in a variety of cellular systems and <italic>in vivo</italic> pain models, providing
                a functional characterization of the R100 mutation in the context of both hNGF and
                hproNGF.</p>
      <p>First of all, this study demonstrates that hNGFR100 fails to sensitize and activate
                nociception, while it shows a full neurotrophic pro-survival competence, providing a
                direct mechanism for pain insensitivity in HSAN V and explaining the major
                neurodevelopmental effects in HSAN V. We provide a mechanism for this differential
                neurotrophic versus nociceptive activity of hNGFR100 mutants. In particular, we show
                that the interaction between hNGFR100 mutants and TrkA receptor appears to be
                modified, with respect to that of wild type hNGF, notwithstanding an identical
                    <italic>in vitro</italic> TrkA binding affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Covaceuszach1">[32]</xref>. Indeed, hNGF-R100
                mutants differ significantly from hNGF, in their ability to activate downstream
                TrkA-dependent signaling pathways, with a notable selective reduction in the ability
                to activate PLC−γ1, while the Akt signaling stream is totally preserved.
                Understanding how the hNGFR100 proteins bind TrkA with a similar affinity, yet with
                a different transduction outcome, with respect to hNGF, is a fascinating question
                that will require detailed structural studies to be understood. Kinetic, rather than
                equilibrium parameters, might be involved in the transduction mechanism. The
                demonstrated lower affinity of hNGFR100 for the p75NTR might contribute to the
                differential outcome of the signaling mediated by TrkA, although the latter was also
                observed in cells expressing exclusively TrkA, in the absence of p75NTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017321-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). It is remarkable that one
                single residue mutation confers such a selective alteration in TrkA and p75NTR
                signaling properties, particularly if compared to previous studies in which a higher
                number of residues had to be mutated in order to achieve TrkA versus p75NTR
                selectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Ryden1">[51]</xref> or
                a TrkA signaling unbalance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Mahapatra1">[52]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In any case, the differential impact of the R100 mutation on the Akt and
                PLC−γ1, TrkA signaling streams, as well as their reduced p75NTR binding
                and signaling competence, add new insights into the more general issue of NGF and
                pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Pezet1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Wood1">[53]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The specific intracellular signaling mechanism linking TrkA activation to nociception
                and TRPV1 sensitization still remains to be fully clarified, despite being the
                subject of intense study, and initial evidence pointing to the activation of
                PLC−γ1 <italic>via</italic> TrkA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Chuang1">[54]</xref> was followed by studies
                implicating the PI3K and MAPK pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Zhu1">[55]</xref>. Our results provide a firm conclusion on the relevance
                of TrkA- PLC−γ1 signaling in nociception sensitization.</p>
      <p>The role of p75NTR in pain is still controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Obata1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Bergmann1">[13]</xref>. Although the general
                consensus is that most NGF actions on pain transmission and sensitization, are
                mediated by TrkA, growing evidences suggest that p75NTR also contributes. A number
                of p75NTR-mediated signaling pathways activated by NGF have been suggested to
                mediate peripheral sensitization, independently of TrkA activity (reviewed by Nicol
                and Vasko <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Nicol1">[25]</xref> and
                schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017321.s007">Fig. S2</xref>). However, NGF-induced pain has been
                shown to occur in p75NTR −/− knock-out mice, although these mice are
                less sensitive to heat and mechanical stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Bergmann1">[13]</xref>. On the other hand, p75NTR
                has been associated with NGF-induced excitability of nociceptors in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Zhang1">[56]</xref>, with pain
                states in which bradykinin is an important mediator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Petersen1">[57]</xref>. Moreover p75NTR functional
                block has been shown to suppresses injury-induced neuropathic pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Obata1">[12]</xref> and the
                hyperalgesia arising from complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced inflammation or
                from an intraplantar injection of NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Watanabe1">[58]</xref>. In this scenario, on one
                hand our work demonstrates a significant contribution of p75NTR signaling to the
                nociceptive actions of NGF, since the R100 mutants displays a greatly reduced
                binding to p75NTR. However, the relative contribution of the TrkA signaling
                unbalance and of the p75NTR reduced binding in determining the failure of hNGFR100
                to induce pain is likely to be complex. Indeed, we found that, unexpectedly, the
                preferred p75NTR receptor ligand proNGF has a reduced capacity to sensitize and
                activate nociception, compared to mature hNGF. Introducing the R100 mutation further
                reduced the ability of hproNGF to induce pain. This suggests that p75NTR receptor
                activation <italic>per se</italic> is not the crucial sensitizing event, and,
                conversely, that it is not abolishing p75NTR signaling per se that is responsible
                for the failure of hNGFR100 to induce pain.</p>
      <p>In a number of different survival, differentiation and proliferation cellular assays,
                NGFR100 mutants showed no difference with respect the hNGF counterparts. The
                observation that neurotrophic properties are not affected by the R100 mutation may
                explain why in HSAN V patients developmental deficits affecting CNS appear very
                limited or absent. On the other hand, the ability of NGFR100 mutants to induce pain
                sensitization in animal models was markedly reduced, correlating well with the loss
                of pain perception in HSAN V patients. On the whole, these results provide an
                explanation for the clinical impact of the NGFR100 mutation, showing that the
                survival functions of NGF in neuronal development are largely unaffected by this
                mutation. Differentiation of nociceptors by NGF R100 mutants was not determined in
                the present study, so an effect on nociceptor differentiation could contribute to
                the limited neurodevelopmental loss of sensory Aδ and C fibers observed in some
                HSAN V patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Minde2">[59]</xref>. However, the results show that the main impact of the
                R100 mutation is on a great reduction of the pain-sensitizing functions of NGF,
                after neuronal development has been completed. Thus, the molecular explanation for
                the HSAN V hNGFR100W mutation lies in an alteration of the separate signaling
                streams normally activated by NGF through its receptors. hNGFR100 proteins maintain
                the neurotrophic signaling stream unchanged, while showing an impairment of the
                p75NTR- and TrkA-mediated signaling involved in nociceptor sensitization. In light
                of the unchanged prosurvival properties of hNGFR100, the clinical phenotype in HSAN
                V patients could be therefore determined by a lower hNGFR100 versus hproNGFR100,
                resulting from impaired secretion or processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Larsson1">[31]</xref> (possibly involving an altered
                intramolecular interaction of the R100 surface patch with the pro-domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Covaceuszach1">[32]</xref>), as well
                as by a reduced pain sensitizing activity of hNGFR100 and hproNGFR100. Therefore, at
                least two concomitant mechanisms might determine the clinical phenotype of HSAN V
                patients: a reduced processing/secretion efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Larsson1">[31]</xref>, and a signaling unbalance
                selectively affecting the nociceptive regulatory actions (and possibly nociceptor
                differentiation), while preserving the pro-survival ones, by hNGF R100. Further
                experiments are required to demonstrate whether and how the R100 mutation affects
                some aspects of the differentiation of sensory nociceptive neurons.</p>
      <p>In this respect, another recently described V232fs mutation in the
                    <italic>NGFB</italic> gene, purportedly linked to HSAN V <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Carvalho1">[28]</xref>, leads to a clinical picture
                characterized by inability to perceive pain, mental retardation and anhydrosis. This
                would appear, instead, clinically more similar to a HSAN IV phenotype. Consistently,
                this V232fs frameshift mutation determines a NGF protein in which the terminal 15
                aminoacids are replaced with a novel 43 aminoacid terminal sequence, resulting in a
                functionally null protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Carvalho1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The fact that the NGF mutation R100W appears, from a clinical point of view, to
                separate the effects of NGF on CNS development from those involved in the activation
                of adult peripheral pain pathways, could provide a basis for designing
                “painless” NGF variant molecules, tailored for therapeutic applications
                in Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017321-Cattaneo1">[60]</xref>, circumventing the most serious hurdle that have limited
                such applications. More generally, these results could set the basis for a designer
                neurotrophin for those applications where targeting selectively TrkA pathways,
                without the confounding actions associated to p75NTR, would be advantageous.</p>

        <p>Statistical analyses were performed using the Sigmastat v. 3.11 program (Systat
                    Software, San Jose, CA). The alpha was set at 0.05 and a normality and equal
                    variance test were first performed.</p>
        <p>All values of behavioral tests to assess nociception are expressed as mean
                    ± s.e.m of 8–10 animals per group. Two-way ANOVAs for repeated
                    measures were used to analyse the effects of pharmacological treatments.
                    Post-hoc comparisons were carried out using Tukey-Kramer test. Differences were
                    considered significant at p&lt;0.05.</p>
