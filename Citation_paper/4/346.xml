In communities with high diversity of species, a significant proportion of the sequences do not overlap any other fragment in the sample. This problem will arise not only in situations with a relatively even distribution of many species, but also when the community in a particular environment is routinely dominated by the same few species. In the former case, no genomes may be assembled at all, while in the latter case a few dominant species in an environment will always be sequenced at high coverage to the detriment of coverage of the greater number of sparse species.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>Here we show that, with the same global sequencing effort, separating the species into two or more sub-communities prior to sequencing can yield a much higher proportion of sequences that can be assembled. We first use the Lander-Waterman model to show that, if the expected percentage of singleton sequences is higher than 25%, then, under the uniform distribution hypothesis, splitting the community is always a wise choice. We then construct simulated microbial communities to show that the results hold for highly non-uniform distributions. We also show that, for the distributions considered in the experiments, it is possible to estimate quite accurately the relative diversity of the two sub-communities.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Given the fact that several methods exist to split microbial communities based on physical properties such as size, density, surface biochemistry, or optical properties, we strongly suggest that groups involved in environmental sequencing, and expecting high diversity, consider splitting their communities in order to maximize the information content of their sequencing effort.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>AB was partly supported by NSERC.

This procedure is now also being applied to environmental sequencing projects in an approach commonly referred to as metagenomics or microbial community genomics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-DeLong1">[1]</xref>. For this application, a community shotgun library is prepared from DNA that has been extracted from a natural assemblage of microorganisms, rather than from an individual isolate. Creation of such a library is a convenient way to capture the full spectrum of microbial genetic diversity within a particular sample, but the library is a jumble of genome fragments from many different microbial species or strains, often numbering in the thousands to hundreds of thousands or more <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-DeLong1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Edwards1">[2]</xref>. As a consequence, random sequencing of clones from a metagenomic library often results in a low proportion of overlapping fragments. Much of the power of genomics derives from understanding genes in their genomic context, and the failure to assemble individual sequence reads (singletons) into longer stretches (contigs) represents a significant loss of genomic information that was originally present in the sample.</p><p>It has been proposed that physical fractionation of a microbial community prior to metagenomic analysis should improve the assembly process by reducing the complexity within each of the resulting fractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Steward1">[3]</xref>, but neither the specific conditions under which this should be true nor the magnitude of the benefit have been critically examined. The benefits of fractionation are most obvious in cases where a single population of interest is selectively enriched from a more complex community. In this case, all of the sequencing effort can be focused on a single fraction that is highly enriched in the population of interest, and genome reassembly for that population is improved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Hallam1">[4]</xref>. What is unclear is whether, and to what degree, fractionation improves assembly in a more general sense, i.e., in cases where a single population is not specifically targeted and sequencing effort is distributed evenly among fractions.</p><p>In preparation for an investigation of marine viral diversity, we wished to quantify the possible benefits of splitting a complex viral community into fractions prior to library construction. Viruses make a particularly appropriate case study for examining this question. In practice, metagenomic analyses of viral assemblages have yielded very low frequencies of contigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Breitbart1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Breitbart2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Angly1">[7]</xref>, so any steps that could be taken to improve assembly would be useful. At the same time, viruses are amenable to physical fractionation by a variety of centrifugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Anderson1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Rickwood1">[9]</xref> and chromatographic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Rice1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Ollivon1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Smith1">[12]</xref> techniques, which means that if benefits of fractionation can be established theoretically this knowledge might be readily translated into practice.</p><p>To test the theoretical benefits of fractionation, metagenomic library construction and analysis were modeled for virtual viral communities, with known structure and diversity, that were either kept intact or split into fractions having non-overlapping sets of populations. Total sequencing effort was the same in all cases, but was divided evenly between fractions in the case of split communities. The proportion of sequences contributing uniquely to a contig was used as an index of assembly success. The model provides a theoretical basis for understanding the effects of fractionation on sequence assembly and predicts the specific conditions under which fractionation should be beneficial.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>In the first section we present a simple model that assumes that species are uniformly distributed in a community.

When coverage augments, the benefits of splitting the community gradually disappear.

This phenomenon is explained by the fact that, at low coverage, the number of singletons grows with the sequencing effort, but as coverage augments, the number of singletons peaks, and eventually shrinks when substantial parts of the genome are assembled. A loss of assembled singletons is not necessarily bad, since many of the species of the small sub-community are sequenced at a high coverage (more than 6× for <italic>p</italic> = 0.1). This could produce a high number of complete genomes of sparse species, showing that merely counting the number of singletons in an assembly is a very crude way to compare assemblies.</p><p>When <italic>N</italic>(<italic>L</italic>−<italic>T</italic>)/(<italic>MG</italic>) = ln 2, then, by Claim 1,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000830.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p><p>This means that, under the uniform distribution assumption, if a sequencing project is expected to produce at least N/4 unassembled sequences, or 25% of the sequencing effort, then splitting the community is always a wise strategy.</p><p>This apparently counter-intuitive result can be explained by the following observations. For highly diverse communities, or for large genomes, the number of singletons initially grows linearly with the sequencing effort: doubling the sequencing effort doubles the number of singletons. However, this is not true for less diverse communities, or for smaller genomes. Consider, for example, a large jigsaw puzzle. If a group of pieces is picked at random, most of them will not fit together, even if the number of selected pieces is doubled. On the other hand, the reverse effect is observed as the number of pieces increases with respect to the size of the puzzle. Selected pieces that do not fit together are less frequent, and eventually vanish.</p><p>By combining these two behaviors, we explore the window in which fractionation yields both a better assembly, for the small sub-community, and a reasonable sampling of the diversity of the original community. The jigsaw puzzle analog of splitting a community would be the fairly common strategy of sorting out pieces of a given color, in the hope of assembling in parallel a smaller but significant part of the big picture. This strategy works best when the selected color does not cover half of the area (blue sky with small patches of clouds) or only a tiny rectangle (a little red house in the mountain). Physical separation of species, like sorting puzzle pieces by color, requires knowledge and yields information. It is this information that is used to get better assembly results with the same sequencing effort. Of course, the cost of getting this information must also be considered when planning a project.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Non-uniform Models</title><p>When the species of a community are not uniformly distributed, the mathematical analysis of the effects of splitting a community is much harder, and always depends on the exact distribution. Since the structure and diversity of actual microbes community is still largely unknown, we choose to attack the problem using simulations with a distribution of <italic>M</italic> = 4991 surnames found in a fixed geographical location, the Province of Quebec, that had a long tradition of giving the surname of the father to his children. Each surname is identified to a species. A more detailed presentation of this community, called Quebec-Ohana, can be found in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Material and Methods</xref> section. A second community, Quebec-Ohana-Truncated, is formed by the 1319 most abundant species of Quebec-Ohana.</p><p>Again, let <italic>N</italic> be the number of fragments sequenced. A simulated environmental sequencing project draws a sample of <italic>N</italic> individuals in the community, with a probability for an individual to be selected proportional to the abundance of its species. Then, given the number of times a species is sampled, it is possible to compute the expected number of singletons contributed by each species in the sample (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Material and Methods</xref>). Splitting a community into sub-communities was done by random choices, and all the results were averaged on 10 different splits, for each value of <italic>p</italic>.

An implied corollary of this result is that pooling of samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Angly1">[7]</xref>, is likely to lead to a loss of information compared to that which would be obtained by evenly dividing the same sequencing effort among libraries prepared from the individual samples.</p><p>Gaining some practical benefit from this theoretical insight could involve relatively minor adjustments to current protocols for viral metagenomics and relatively little extra effort. Viral assemblages are usually purified by banding in density gradients prior to metagenomic library construction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Edwards1">[2]</xref>. Since this procedure also separates populations of viruses based on differences in their buoyant density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Steward2">[17]</xref>, viruses could simply be harvested from a density gradient as two or more density fractions. Metagenomic libraries from the two fractions could then be constructed and sequenced as separate samples. Even making this simple adjustment in strategy has the potential to increase the frequency of contigs per unit sequencing effort.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>The Uniform Distribution Model</title><p>In this section, we give formal proofs of Claim 1 and Claim 2.

Starting in 1608, a few thousand French settlers occupied the territory, which then passed, in 1760, under British rule. The decision of the British administration to allow the French settlers to keep their language and religion resulted in the effective isolation of this community. The specific characteristics of the Quebec population have already been used in genetic studies (see, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Scriver1">[18]</xref>). Up to 1981, the tradition to give the surname of the father to its children resulted in a current population of surnames whose distribution pattern could be similar to bacteria and viruses populations. Currently, 4991 different surnames occur with a frequency higher than 0.001% in the estimated 7.5 million residents of the province.</p><p>The “Institut de la statistique du Québec” has published a detailed distribution of the abundance of these 4991 surnames <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000830-Institut1">[19]</xref>. We used this distribution as a basis for constructing our test community, Quebec-Ohana, identifying each different surname as a <italic>species</italic> (part of Hawaiian culture, ‘ohana’ means ‘family’ in an extended sense of the term including both blood-related or extended). The abundance of each species in this community is the relative abundance of a surname in the community of 4991 surnames.

Removing these species yielded a community of the 1319 most abundant species of Quebec-Ohana, Quebec-Ohana-Truncated. The abundance of each species in this community is the relative abundance of a surname in the community of 1319 surnames.
