        <p>Fibroblasts are important in orchestrating various functions necessary for maintaining normal tissue homeostasis as well as promoting malignant tumor growth. Significant evidence indicates that fibroblasts are functionally heterogeneous with respect to their ability to promote tumor growth, but markers that can be used to distinguish growth promoting from growth suppressing fibroblasts remain ill-defined. Here we show that human breast fibroblasts are functionally heterogeneous with respect to tumor-promoting activity regardless of whether they were isolated from normal or cancerous breast tissues. Rather than significant differences in fibroblast marker expression, we show that fibroblasts secreting abundant levels of prostaglandin (PGE2), when isolated from either reduction mammoplasty or carcinoma tissues, were both capable of enhancing tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> and could increase the number of cancer stem-like cells. PGE2 further enhanced the tumor promoting properties of fibroblasts by increasing secretion of IL-6, which was necessary, but not sufficient, for expansion of breast cancer stem-like cells. These findings identify a population of fibroblasts which both produce and respond to PGE2, and that are functionally distinct from other fibroblasts. Identifying markers of these cells could allow for the targeted ablation of tumor-promoting and inflammatory fibroblasts in human breast cancers.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Fibroblasts were first described in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century by the pathologist Rudolph Virchow based on their residence within connective tissues and their elongated, spindle-like shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Kalluri1">[1]</xref>. As the most prominent cell type within connective tissues, these mesenchymal cells function to deposit and remodel extracellular matrix (ECM), specify epithelial fate and maturation of tissues, facilitate granulation of tissues post wounding and promote re-epithelialization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Dvorak1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Bellini1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Desmouliere1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Baglole1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Silzle1">[6]</xref>. Fibroblasts are required for mammary gland development, as signals from the underlying primary mesenchyme are required to induce mammary placode elongation and invasion to form the primitive mammary ductal tree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Arendt1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to regulating and maintaining tissue homeostasis, fibroblasts are well established mediators of tissue fibrosis following injury and promoters of epithelial tumor growth. During fibrosis, the acquisition of epigenetic alterations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Bechtel1">[8]</xref> results in fibroblasts with altered gene expression, conferring an increase in growth factor production, ECM deposition, and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Krenning1">[9]</xref>. During carcinoma progression, the associated desmoplastic stroma includes an abundance of alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA+) expressing fibroblasts, collectively referred to as cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). These cells are also found in connective tissues during wound healing and are frequently termed “myofibroblasts”. These αSMA+ fibroblasts isolated from the stroma of solid tumors can significantly promote the growth of breast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Orimo1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Orimo2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Shimoda1">[12]</xref>, prostate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Olumi1">[13]</xref>, pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Hwang1">[14]</xref>, and skin cancer cells in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Erez1">[15]</xref>. Some of the tumor promoting mechanisms of these cells have been established, such as increasing tumor angiogenesis and mediating macrophage recruitment, both of which serve as a prominent sources of growth factors and cytokines for the growth of tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Liao1">[16]</xref>. Recently, αSMA+ myofibroblasts have also been shown to possess a pro-inflammatory phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Erez1">[15]</xref>, suggesting that these cells may contribute to the tumor associated inflammation that accompanies the progression of tumors.</p>
      <p>Despite the established functions of fibroblasts in tissue homeostasis and disease, the molecular mechanisms contributing to the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity among fibroblasts remains largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Fries1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Jelaska1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Ko1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Korn1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Tipton1">[21]</xref>. It has been reported that the gene expression of fibroblasts derived from disease- free breast tissue harbors a greater heterogeneity than those derived from breast carcinomas, even within the same patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Bauer1">[22]</xref>. This is surprising, given that breast tumors are heterogeneous and there exists significant heterogeneity among the expression of αSMA within the tumor associated stroma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Micke1">[23]</xref>. While αSMA is a common marker routinely used to identify CAFs, these cells may vary in the levels of αSMA expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Sugimoto1">[24]</xref>, and it remains unknown if robust expression of αSMA marks the most tumor promoting fibroblasts within a given fibroblast population. It also should be noted that several cell types in the tumor microenvironment, in addition to fibroblasts, will express αSMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Bissell1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Radisky1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Radisky2">[27]</xref>, and it is not a unique marker of CAFs or myofibroblasts. Moreover, it is well established that fibroblasts isolated from homeostatic tissues will acquire αSMA expression and stress fibers, resembling the phenotype of myofibroblasts when explanted in culture, exposed to TGFβ, or exposed to tumor cell conditioned media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-RonnovJessen1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-RonnovJessen2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Webber1">[30]</xref>. Because of this, maintaining the phenotypic and functional discrepancy of fibroblasts from homeostatic versus diseased tissues in culture has been extremely difficult.</p>
      <p>Intriguingly, αSMA+ fibroblasts isolated from tumor associated stroma are not the only source of fibroblasts that harbor the capacity to support epithelial tumor growth. Fibroblasts isolated from arthritic synovium can promote growth of co-mixed human breast cancer cells in a xenograft mouse model of breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Hu1">[31]</xref>. However, there are numerous examples to demonstrate the tumor suppressive function of fibroblasts as well. For example, ras-transformed mouse keratinocytes are unable to form tumors in syngeneic animals when they are co-mixed with dermal fibroblasts isolated from disease-free mouse skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Dotto1">[32]</xref>; initiated primary human prostate epithelial cells do not form tumors under the renal capsule when co-mixed with fibroblasts from disease free human prostate tissues, unlike their CAF counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Olumi1">[13]</xref>. These functional discrepancies among fibroblast populations remain to be reconciled.</p>
      <p>In this manuscript, we sought to understand the properties of breast fibroblasts that contribute to a tumor promoting phenotype. Using fibroblast populations isolated from both disease-free and breast tumor tissues, we demonstrate for the first time that the ability of fibroblasts to promote tumor growth is irrespective of tissue source and correlates with the ability of these cells to secrete PGE2 and respond to PGE2 signaling. These data may lend insight into the dichotomy among the tumor promoting or tumor suppressive functions of various fibroblast populations, and warrants the investigation of novel markers for these cells among heterogeneous fibroblast populations. Discovery of such markers may elucidate which patients in the clinic would largely benefit from an adjuvant therapy targeting both the eradication of tumor cells and the tumor promoting fibroblasts within the tumor stroma.</p>

        <p>Fibroblasts were grown as described above. MCF7 breast cancer cells were grown in DMEM+10% CS+1% AB/AM. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To generate conditioned media, fibroblasts were seeded at 1.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/plate in phenol red free DMEM (PRF-DMEM, Invitrogen), supplemented with either 0.5% or 2% charcoal/dextran stripped FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% AB/AM, treated with ethanol or 0.5 µM PGE2 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), or left untreated, for 72 hrs. CM was then harvested, filtered through a 0.22 µm filter (Millipore, Danvers, MA), aliquoted and stored at −80°C. For MCF7 treatments, cells were grown in PRF-DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal/dextran stripped FBS, 1% AB/AM, and treated with ethanol, 0.5 µM PGE2, or 1 nM 17-β-Estradiol (Sigma Aldrich). For MCF7 treatments involving fibroblast CM, CM was collected as previously described, supplemented with 5% charcoal/dextran stripped FBS, and administered to MCF7 cells for 6 days. α-IL6 and recombinant human IL-6 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were used at 1.5 µg/mL and 10 ng/mL, respectively.</p>

We corroborated these immunofluorescence results by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).

        <p>Recently, fibroblast surface protein (FSP) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) have been reported to distinguish different types of fibroblasts in tumor tissues. Therefore, we also examined FSP and FAP expression in breast tissue derived fibroblasts. Both CAFs and disease-free breast fibroblasts harvested from several different patient samples expressed high transcript levels of these two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Given that αSMA, FSP or FAP expression <italic>in vitro</italic> could not distinguish fibroblasts isolated from human breast tumor specimens versus fibroblasts isolated from disease-free human breast tissues, we sought to identify other proteins whose expression may be enriched in one tissue source or the other. Recently, expression of Caveolin-1 has been reported to be downregulated in CAFs compared to disease-free fibroblasts, and loss of Caveolin-1 in mammary stromal fibroblasts promotes a tumor promoting, CAF-like phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Sotgia1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Witkiewicz1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Trimmer1">[39]</xref>.

Fibroblasts derived from tissue samples C, K, and E co-mixed with MCF7 cells formed larger tumors than MCF7 cells injected alone, whereas fibroblasts derived from tissue sample I failed to support MCF7 tumor growth (p = 0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), and only supported tumor formation 50% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, tumor promoting ability of fibroblasts did not depend on their tissue source of origin (i.e. breast tumor or reduction mammoplasty, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0024605-t001">Table 1</xref>), nor did it associate with their extent of αSMA, FSP, FAP, or Caveolin-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024605.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p>

        <p>Based on these findings, we sought to identify characteristics of these tissue derived fibroblasts that could resolve the differences in their ability to support MCF7 tumor growth. Recent reports have indicated that CAFs express an NFκB mediated pro-inflammatory secretome that is required for their ability to support tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Erez1">[15]</xref>. Thus, we hypothesized that fibroblasts differ in their inherent pro-inflammatory state, which might account for their tumor promoting capabilities <italic>in vivo</italic>. In fact, all tissue-derived fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>, regardless of their tissue of origin, expressed cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), an enzyme upregulated during tissue inflammation and tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Meric1">[40]</xref>, as well as its isoform Cox-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024605.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Both Cox-2 and Cox-1 catalyze the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory hormone prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), although Cox-1 is thought to be constitutively expressed in most tissues and likely responsible for producing the levels of prostaglandins required for normal tissue function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Ricciotti1">[41]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Given that these tissue-derived fibroblasts express Cox-1 and Cox-2, we assayed for the levels of PGE2 in the conditioned media (CM) from these cells. Fibroblasts from 8 different tissue samples were serum starved for 72 hrs in phenol-red free DMEM, upon which the CM was collected, filtered, and assayed for the concentration of the pro-inflammatory hormone PGE2 by a specific immunoassay. CM from several different tissue samples exhibited significant differences in PGE2 secretion (p = 2.84×10<sup>−12</sup>): low (&lt;50 pg/ml; patient sample I), medium (50–150 pg/ml; tissue samples A, E, F, M, J) or high (&gt;200 pg/ml; tissue samples C, K) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Intriguingly, we found a correlation between the ability to secrete high levels of PGE2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and the ability to promote MCF7 tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. In fact, there was a statistically significant difference in the ability to support MCF7 tumor growth between high PGE2 secreting fibroblasts (K) compared to low PGE2 secreting fibroblasts (I) (p = 0.004). These findings suggest that unlike αSMA, FAP, FSP, or Caveolin-1 expression, the ability to secrete PGE2 may contribute to the tumor promoting phenotype of fibroblasts.</p>

        <title>Secreted factors from tumor-promoting fibroblasts expand breast cancer stem-like cells</title>
        <p>It is known that breast tumors are comprised of cells with varying tumorigenic potential. Using primary human breast cancer tissues, it has been demonstrated that the CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> population of cells can support tumor initiation with as few as 100 cells and have self-renewing, stem-like properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-AlHajj1">[42]</xref>.

Because high PGE2-secreting fibroblasts support MCF7 tumor growth, we hypothesized that these fibroblasts may secrete factors that expand the most aggressive, tumorigenic cells within the tumor bulk. To determine if fibroblasts could expand this aggressive cell population, we treated MCF7 cells for 6 days with CM isolated from serum starved tissue-derived fibroblasts exhibiting varying degrees of PGE2 secretion <italic>in vitro</italic>. We quantified the percentage of aggressive, CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> stem-like cells by FACS following this 6-day treatment.

        <p>Recently, it has been reported that PGE2 is necessary for the expansion of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-North1">[44]</xref>. Since fibroblasts exhibiting high levels of PGE2 secretion also exhibited the most robust increase in cancer stem-like cells and promoted the largest MCF7 tumor formation, we reasoned that paracrine production of PGE2 by fibroblasts might be sufficient to expand CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> MCF7 stem-like cells. Therefore, we treated MCF7 cells with 0.5 µM PGE2, 1 nM 17-β-estradiol (E2, positive control), or EtOH (vehicle) for 6 days, and quantified the percentage of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells by FACS. We found, however, that PGE2 alone was not sufficient to expand aggressive MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Given the striking association between the ability of fibroblasts to secrete PGE2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and the ability to expand CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells and support tumor growth, we speculated that perhaps PGE2 signaling enhances the tumor promoting phenotypes of fibroblasts. To test this hypothesis, we chose to examine the CM from fibroblast patient samples who did not robustly enhance the growth of MCF7 breast cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (patient samples A and I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). First, we confirmed that these tissue-derived fibroblasts express prostanoid receptors EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4, making them sensitive to PGE2 signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024605.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>). Next, we exposed these tissue-derived fibroblasts to exogenous 0.5 µM PGE2 or EtOH (vehicle) for 72 hours before harvesting CM. We then exposed MCF7 cells to this CM for 6 days before quantifying the population of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells by FACS. Interestingly, exposure to PGE2 before CM collection significantly augmented the ability of tissue sample A to increase the percentage of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024605.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), suggesting that PGE2 enhanced fibroblast tumor promoting ability. However, exposure to PGE2 did not significantly enhance the ability of tissue sample I to increase expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024605.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), despite prostanoid receptor expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024605.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also performed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> functional assays of MCF7 tumorgenicity using CM from PGE2- or vehicle (EtOH) treated fibroblasts. Specifically, MCF7 cells were grown under non-adherent culture conditions to promote tumorsphere formation in the presence of CM from PGE2- or vehicle (EtOH) treated fibroblasts of varying tumor promoting capability and endogenous PGE2 secretion status. As expected, CM from PGE2 treated tissue derived fibroblasts (tissue samples A, C and K), formed significantly more tumorspheres than those treated with CM from vehicle treated fibroblasts (A, p = 0.014; C, p = 0.001; K, p = 0.0006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, CM from fibroblasts derived from tissue sample I did not significantly enhance MCF7 tumorsphere formation when primed with exogenous PGE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), consistent with the inability to further enhance CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cell expansion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024605.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>). Importantly, 0.5 µM PGE2 was not sufficient to enhance MCF7 tumorsphere formation compared to vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also sought to demonstrate that fibroblasts primed with PGE2 promote the aggressiveness of MCF7 cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we exposed MCF7 cells first <italic>in vitro</italic> to CM from PGE2-treated tissue sample A, or CM from PGE2-treated tissue sample I, for 6 days to enrich for aggressive CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells. After 6 days, 10<sup>4</sup> cells from each cohort were inoculated into the inguinal mammary gland of NOD/SCID mice. MCF7 cells exposed <italic>in vitro</italic> to CM from PGE2-treated tissue sample A formed significantly larger tumors than those exposed <italic>in vitro</italic> to CM from PGE2-treated tissue sample I (p = 0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of these tumors revealed that the tumors were all ERα- and E-cadherin-positive with a significant degree of central necrosis, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Interestingly, tumors derived from MCF7 cells exposed <italic>in vitro</italic> to CM from PGE2-treated tissue sample A exhibited reduced p53 and CK8/18 expression compared to those tumors formed from MCF7 cells exposed to CM from PGE2-treated tissue sample I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>, p = 0.02). Together, these data suggest that PGE2 signaling in fibroblasts enhances their tumor promoting abilities, resulting in expansion of aggressive tumor cell populations and increased tumor growth.</p>

        <title>PGE2 mediated IL-6 secretion by tumor-promoting fibroblasts</title>
        <p>Since PGE2 alone was not sufficient to confer expansion of aggressive cancer stem-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), we hypothesized factors produced from PGE2-stimulated fibroblasts were essential for this expansion. To identify the secreted proteins mediating breast cancer stem-like expansion, we examined the CM from PGE2-treated or vehicle-treated tissue derived fibroblasts from patient A, and quantitatively assayed for 164 secreted growth factors and cytokines using an antibody-based protein array. We observed that the secretion of IL-6 was increased at least 5 fold upon PGE2-treatment compared to vehicle-treated control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024605.s004">Fig. S4A</xref>).</p>
        <p>To more comprehensively assess whether PGE2 treated fibroblasts secrete IL-6, we performed both qualitative and quantitative assays. We first isolated CM from PGE2 or vehicle treated fibroblasts from 3 patient derived tissue samples (C, A, and G), concentrated the CM, and immunoblotted for IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Nearly all patient samples showed an increase in IL-6 secretion upon exposure to PGE2, supporting the cytokine array results. For a more quantitative assessment of IL-6 secretion, we performed a human specific IL-6 ELISA with CM prepared from various breast tissue derived fibroblasts treated with either 0.5 µM PGE2 or EtOH (vehicle) for 3 days. Although the fold induction of IL-6 secretion in response to PGE2 was heterogeneous among tissue derived fibroblasts, nearly all patient samples showed at least a 1.5 fold increase in IL-6 secretion upon treatment with PGE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, the induced secretion of IL-6 by PGE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), as well as the basal levels of IL-6 secretion in these tissue derived fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024605.s004">Fig. S4B</xref>) both failed to associate with the tumor promoting abilities of these fibroblasts <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), or their ability to secrete PGE2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).

        <title>IL-6 is necessary but not sufficient for tumor-promoting fibroblasts to expand stem-like cells</title>
        <p>It has been reported that IL-6 enhances aggressive, stem-like features in sphere-forming populations of human mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Sansone1">[45]</xref>, and mediates a positive feedback loop that maintains oncogenic transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Iliopoulos1">[46]</xref>. Thus, we suspected it might be an essential cytokine produced by fibroblasts that is required for expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells. To test this, we exposed MCF7 cells to CM from PGE2- or vehicle (EtOH) treated fibroblasts from tissue sample A and tissue sample I for 6 days in the presence of an IL-6 neutralizing antibody (αIL-6) or goat IgG control. Quantifying the percentage of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells by FACS revealed that PGE2 significantly enhanced the ability of fibroblasts from tissue sample A to support expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells (p = 0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) in an IL-6 dependent manner, as the expansion was attenuated in the presence of an IL-6 neutralizing antibody (αIL-6, p = 0.0004). PGE2 did not enhance the ability of fibroblasts from tissue sample I to support CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cell expansion, despite some IL-6 present in the CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Given that IL-6 is necessary for fibroblast mediated expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells, we asked if IL-6 was sufficient to confer this expansion. We treated MCF7 cells with 10 ng/mL recombinant human IL-6 or 0.1% BSA (vehicle), in either the presence or absence of 0.5 µM PGE2 or EtOH (vehicle). Interestingly, IL-6 alone, or in combination with 0.5 µM PGE2, was not sufficient to expand CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> MCF7 cells, unlike 1 nM E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Also, IL-6 alone was not sufficient to confer increases in MCF7 tumorsphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). To confirm that MCF7 cells were capable of signaling through IL-6, we exposed MCF7 cells for 30 min to CM from PGE2 or EtOH treated fibroblasts of differing tumor-promoting capabilities, in the presence of an IL-6 neutralizing antibody or goat IgG control, and immunoblotted for the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 as an indicator of the IL-6 signaling pathway. pSTAT3 levels were higher in MCF7 cells exposed to CM from PGE2-treated fibroblasts from patient sample A as compared to CM from PGE2-treated fibroblasts from tissue sample I, and this was abrogated by addition of αIL-6. Moreover, 0.5 µM PGE2 was not sufficient to induce pSTAT3 expression, unlike the addition of 10 ng/mL recombinant human IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024605-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that IL-6 is enriched in CM from several patient tissue-derived fibroblasts, secreted by fibroblasts in response to PGE2, and is necessary, but not sufficient, for fibroblast-mediated expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> MCF7 cells.</p>

Moreover, we identify a novel tumor promoting mechanism of these cells that is enhanced upon exposure to PGE2: the ability to secrete factors (such as IL-6) that are essential for the expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cells.</p>
      <p>There exist a number of citations to substantiate the notion that fibroblasts harvested from resected breast tumor specimens are αSMA+ and promote tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Orimo2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Shimoda1">[12]</xref>. These cells, commonly referred to as cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), lack specific markers to discriminate them from fibroblasts isolated from disease free tissues, because these normal fibroblast counterparts acquire the expression of αSMA when grown <italic>in vitro</italic>. Despite this, αSMA has become a widely used marker to discriminate these cells. We harvested both types of fibroblasts: fibroblasts from human breast tumors (CAFs), and fibroblasts from disease free reduction mammoplasty tissues. Both sources of fibroblasts expressed the fibroblast markers vimentin, prolyl-4-hydroxylase, and αSMA to unifying degrees <italic>in vitro</italic>, and both were largely negative for breast epithelium specific cytokeratins CK18 and CK14.</p>
      <p>Despite similar fibroblast marker expression <italic>in vitro</italic>, both sources of fibroblasts had differences in their tumor promoting abilities <italic>in vivo</italic>. Because tumor-promoting ability of our fibroblast populations did not associate with any differences in marker expression examined, nor did it associate with tissue source, we sought for other characteristics of fibroblasts that may influence fibroblast tumor promoting abilities. Because fibroblasts isolated from dysplastic mouse skin support squamous cell carcinoma growth <italic>in vivo</italic> through pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Erez1">[15]</xref>, we suspected that inflammatory mediators differ among the various patient derived fibroblasts, which ultimately influence their varying degrees of tumor promotion. Indeed, we found an association between tumor promoting ability <italic>in vivo</italic> and high PGE2 secretion <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, the ability to secrete PGE2 associates with the ability to expand CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cells.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, PGE2 alone was not sufficient to confer the expansion of these cells, despite MCF7 expression of the prostanoid receptors. PGE2 enhanced the inherent tumor promoting abilities of fibroblasts as shown by <italic>in vitro</italic> tumorsphere assays, and <italic>in vivo</italic> MCF7 limiting dilution experiments. Our data suggest that this is largely due to the increased secretion of IL-6 in response to PGE2, consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Singh1">[49]</xref>. The secretion of IL-6 by fibroblasts was necessary for expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells. Because this particular cell population has been shown to contribute to tumorsphere formation and seed tumor growth at limiting dilution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Fillmore1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Fillmore2">[50]</xref>, we suspect that PGE2- mediated IL-6 secretion by fibroblasts was largely responsible for the increased MCF7 tumorsphere formation and tumor formation observed upon exposure to fibroblast CM.</p>
      <p>Despite the requirement for IL-6 in mediating the tumor promoting abilities of fibroblasts, we found that IL-6 alone was not sufficient for expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells in the MCF7 cell line. This is in contrast to previous reports using different breast cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Iliopoulos1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Iliopoulos2">[51]</xref>. IL-6 has been implicated in a positive feedback loop that perpetuates cellular transformation through NFκB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Iliopoulos1">[46]</xref>, which may drive the secretion of the other necessary cytokines (in addition to IL-6) that are required for the induction and maintenance of this aggressive cell state. We failed to see activation of NFκB in response to CM from various tissue-derived fibroblasts (data not shown), suggesting that this feedback mechanism may not be activated in these cells, or only activated in various subpopulations (i.e. CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells).</p>
      <p>The basal level of IL-6 varied widely among patient derived breast fibroblasts, and also increased with passage number, consistent with previous reports using primary fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Coppe1">[52]</xref>. However, neither the basal secretion of IL-6 nor the induced secretion of IL-6 by PGE2 in fibroblasts correlated with fibroblast tumor promoting ability <italic>in vivo</italic> or their ability to expand CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is consistent with the notion that IL-6 is required, but is not sufficient for expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells, nor is it sufficient for tumorsphere formation. In addition, although IGF-II was significantly induced by fibroblasts exposed to PGE2 more so than IL-6, we failed to observe a requirement for this cytokine in expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells (data not shown). In lieu of these data, we speculate that a certain stoichiometric balance of specific cytokines is required to promote the expansion of these cells. This stoichiometric balance may be obtained <italic>in vivo</italic> by secreted factors from tumor cells as well as inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment. It therefore follows that non-tumor promoting fibroblasts (i.e., those with very low PGE2 secretion; i.e. tissue sample I) perhaps lack the ability to activate certain pathways downstream of PGE2 that modulate the balance of cytokine secretion required for CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cell expansion and tumor promoting ability <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further studies are needed to determine what precise signaling pathways are activated in stromal fibroblasts that activate Cox-2 expression and increase PGE2 and IL-6 secretion. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that PTEN loss in stromal fibroblasts significantly enhances fibroblast tumor promoting ability through upregulation of genes associated with ECM remodeling, wound healing and inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Trimboli1">[53]</xref>. Further investigation into the activation of the PI3K/Akt, Ras, and JNK pathways in stromal fibroblasts will elucidate which, if any, of these molecular players are upstream of PGE2 and IL-6 secretion in these cells.</p>
      <p>Since PGE2 enhanced fibroblast secretion of IL-6, it is plausible that PGE2 also induces secretion of other cytokines yet to be identified that together in concert with IL-6 orchestrate the process of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cell expansion. For example, SDF1α is a growth factor secreted by myofibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Orimo1">[10]</xref> that promotes breast cancer cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Marlow1">[54]</xref> as well as expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Huang1">[55]</xref>, and may be upregulated by PGE2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-Katoh1">[56]</xref>. Also, IL-8 increases tumorsphere forming ability and the percentage of ALDEFLUOR-positive breast cancer cells, which enriches for cancer stem-like cell populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024605-CharafeJauffret1">[57]</xref>. Further studies are needed to elucidate if these cytokines contribute to IL-6 mediated expansion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results indicate that the pro-inflammatory, tumor-promoting phenotype of fibroblasts correlates with the ability to secrete PGE2 and respond to PGE2 signaling. We were unable to identify differential expression of well-established markers of CAFs and tumor-promoting fibroblasts that correlated with their observed tumor promoting phenotypes. Moreover, we failed to identify a correlation between fibroblasts isolated from invasive carcinomas (either ER+ or ER−) and a high PGE2 secreting, tumor promoting phenotype, as compared to those isolated from reduction mammoplasty tissues. Our results suggest that tumor promoting fibroblasts secrete PGE2 and mediate autocrine PGE2 signaling, thereby activating the increased secretion of IL-6, which is required for expansion of breast cancer stem-like cells. In fact, our results suggest that the tumor promoting ability of fibroblasts associates moreso with PGE2 secretion and signaling than if these fibroblasts are derived from diseased tissues. The identification of specific markers for these tumor promoting fibroblasts would likely allow for the observation of more robust phenotypic discrepancies between various fibroblast tissue sources, and would possibly discriminate among patients that would likely benefit from tumor-associated stroma drug targeting strategies for use as adjuvant therapies in the treatment of human breast cancers.</p>
