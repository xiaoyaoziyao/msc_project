        <p>Neurotrophins (NTs), which play an integral role in neuronal development and function, have been found in non-neuronal tissue (including lung), but their role is still under investigation. Recent reports show that NTs such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as well as NT receptors are expressed in human airway smooth muscle (ASM). However, their function is still under investigation. We hypothesized that NTs regulate ASM intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) by altered expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory proteins. Human ASM cells isolated from lung samples incidental to patient surgery were incubated for 24 h (overnight) in medium (control) or 1 nM BDNF in the presence vs. absence of inhibitors of signaling cascades (MAP kinases; PI3/Akt; NFÎºB). Measurement of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and histamine using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator fluo-4 showed significantly greater responses following BDNF exposure: effects that were blunted by pathway inhibitors. Western analysis of whole cell lysates showed significantly higher expression of CD38, Orai1, STIM1, IP<sub>3</sub> and RyR receptors, and SERCA following BDNF exposure, effects inhibited by inhibitors of the above cascades. The functional significance of BDNF effects were verified by siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of proteins that were altered by this NT. Overall, these data demonstrate that NTs activate signaling pathways in human ASM that lead to enhanced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses via increased regulatory protein expression, thus enhancing airway contractility.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Neurotrophins (NTs) are growth factors primarily described in the nervous system where they play an integral role in neuronal development and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Friedman1">[1]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Zweifel1">[3]</xref>. NTs such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) function via both high affinity tropomyosin related kinase (TrkB in the case of BDNF) and low-affinity pan-neurotrophin (p75NTR) receptors to activate several intracellular signaling cascades including phospholipase C (PLC), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-light chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFÎºB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Chao1">[4]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Teng1">[6]</xref>. In this regard, studies in neuronal systems have reported both acute, non-genomic effects of NTs such as enhanced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) and synaptic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Kovalchuk1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Rose1">[8]</xref>, as well as genomic effects over longer time scales involving altered expression of genes and proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Luther1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Patapoutian1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to their well-recognized role in the nervous system, there is now increasing evidence that NTs and their receptors are expressed in a range of non-neuronal tissues including the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Lommatzsch1">[11]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Ricci2">[16]</xref>. For example, we recently demonstrated that BDNF, TrkB and p75NTR are all expressed by human airway smooth muscle (ASM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash3">[14]</xref>, that acute exposure to BDNF enhances [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses to agonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash3">[14]</xref> and potentiates the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNFÎ±) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash2">[13]</xref>. While these data suggest at least a non-genomic role for BDNF in the airway, as a growth factor that is released by several airway cells including epithelium, ASM, immune cells, and nerves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Hoyle1">[17]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Scuri1">[19]</xref>, BDNF presumably has longer term, genomic effects on cells of the airway. The relevance of such effects lies in the recent recognition that the levels of circulating and local BDNF, as well as receptor expression are increased in asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Hoyle1">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, a role for BDNF in airway inflammation, remodeling and hyperreactivity has been suggested based on animal studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Braun1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Lommatzsch2">[21]</xref>. However, the underlying mechanisms are still under investigation.</p>
      <p>Diseases such as asthma are characterized by both enhanced airway contractility as well as remodeling which in turn may involve ASM cell proliferation. We recently demonstrated that in human ASM, prolonged BDNF exposure enhances cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Aravamudan1">[22]</xref>, consistent with its role as a growth factor. Enhanced contractility may result from exaggerated responses to agonist, and here BDNF may act non-genomically to potentiate such responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash2">[13]</xref>. Additionally, upregulation of mechanisms that normally regulate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and force in ASM also contribute to overall increases in contractility. We hypothesized that as a growth factor known to promote protein expression in the nervous system, prolonged BDNF exposure enhances expression and function of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and force regulatory components in ASM. We tested this hypothesis using primary human ASM cells and determined the role of signaling mechanisms most commonly associated with BDNF.</p>

        <p>The techniques for isolating human ASM cells from lung samples incidental to patient surgery have been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash3">[14]</xref>. Pathologically normal areas of 3rd to 6th generation bronchi were dissected from lung samples of patients undergoing pneumenectomies or lobectomies for focal disease (de-identified samples considered surgical waste following clinical diagnoses; approved by Mayoâs Institutional Review Board and considered not Human Subjects Research. Accordingly, patient consent was waived). The IRB-approved protocols involved initial review of patient histories, to allow exclusion of smokers, asthmatics or patients with COPD, since we did not want to confound the effect of variable chronic inflammation and/or smoke exposure on the parameters studied. Following this step, samples were completely de-identified for storage and subsequent usage. In this study, we used airways from both males (3) and females (3).</p>
        <p>Samples were placed in cold Hanksâ balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES and 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. ASM layer was removed, minced and enzymatically dissociated using papain and collagenase with ovomucoid/albumin separation (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ). Cell pellets were re-suspended and seeded into 75 cm<sup>2</sup> sterile tissue culture flasks, 100 mm Petri dishes or 96-well clear bottom plates, and maintained under usual culture conditions in phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. Prior to experimentation, cells were serum starved for 48 h. Experiments were limited to passages 1â3 of subculture in order to ensure maintenance of ASM phenotype, which was periodically assessed by Western analysis for smooth muscle actin and myosin, and agonist receptors.</p>

        <p>Human ASM cells were incubated for 24 h at 37Â°C in regular growth media (control), or 1 nM recombinant human BDNF (#248BD, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) reconstituted in growth media. The BDNF concentration was selected based on our previous data showing acute effects on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash3">[14]</xref> as well as pilot studies in which we found that 100 pM BDNF did not significantly affect [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regulation, whereas 10 nM or higher concentration resulted in significant cell death with prolonged exposure.

Inhibition of these pathways generally blunted the enhancing effects of BDNF on expression of all the proteins mentioned above (except TRPC3 obviously), but the contribution of specific pathways differed between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory proteins. There was no significant effect of the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 (10 ÂµM) on influx mechanisms: TRPC3, Orai1, or STIM1.

Based on these results, we explored the effect of inhibiting specific signaling intermediates relevant to MAP kinases.

In this regard, BDNF has acute, likely non-genomic effects of enhancing human ASM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and contractility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash3">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Damera1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Hotta1">[35]</xref>, especially in the presence of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash2">[13]</xref>. The present study now shows that with prolonged BDNF exposure would further contribute to enhanced contractility by upregulation of proteins involved in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regulation.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms by which NTs can influence airway structure or function are still under investigation. NTs can modulate neural influences, thus indirectly increasing airway contractility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Meuchel1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Undem1">[37]</xref>. However, as shown in previous studies, BDNF can also directly influence ASM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash3">[14]</xref>. Here, expression of TrkB and p75NTR allows ASM to react to NTs derived from other sources as well. In ASM, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses to bronchoconstrictor agonist involve sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via IP<sub>3</sub>R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Coburn1">[38]</xref> and RyR channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Kannan1">[39]</xref> as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via voltage-gated channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Worley1">[40]</xref>, receptor-gated channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Ito1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Murray1">[42]</xref> and SOCE in response to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Ay1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Pabelick1">[43]</xref>. In neurons, BDNF primarily increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Berninger1">[44]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Wang1">[46]</xref>, mediated via TrkB, phospholipase C, IP<sub>3</sub> production and IP<sub>3</sub>R channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Li1">[47]</xref>. We previously showed that BDNF acutely enhances [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses to agonists such as histamine that largely affect IP<sub>3</sub>R channels as well as to caffeine which opens RyR channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Prakash3">[14]</xref>. In pontine neurons of newborn rat, BDNF increases influx via TRPC3 channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Li2">[48]</xref>, which are involved in SOCE of ASM as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Ay1">[26]</xref>. Thus BDNF can enhance multiple [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regulatory mechanisms. Our data now show that with prolonged exposure, such enhancement can be sustained long-term by increased expression of many of these proteins including IP<sub>3</sub>R and RyR channels. In addition BDNF also increases expression of Orai1, which has been recently recognized to be a key mediator (if not the channel) for SOCE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Hewavitharana1">[49]</xref>. These changes are reflected by the enhanced peak and plateau [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> values with agonist stimulation as well as SOCE.</p>
      <p>In terms of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes, the data showing comparable effects of BDNF and the newly-identified TrkB-specific agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone suggest a large role for TrkB signaling in ASM, with a likely small and insignificant role for p75NTR evidenced by the lack of effect of the p75NTR inhibitor TAT-pep5. In cell types other than ASM, BDNF activates a number of pathways including PI3/Akt, ERK1/2 and NFÎºB. In a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Aravamudan1">[22]</xref>, we showed that activation of ERK1/2 was essential for BDNF-induced enhancement of ASM cell proliferation, thus suggesting involvement of CREB-mediated gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Clarke1">[50]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Lahiri1">[52]</xref>. This signaling cascade also appears to be important in BDNF-induced enhancement of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory protein expression in ASM, evidenced in this study by the effects of different pharmacological inhibitors for various signaling intermediates along this pathway. BDNF activation of ERK1/2 appears to involve TrkB as previously shown using TrkB siRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Aravamudan1">[22]</xref>. Activation of NFÎºB also appears to be important in mediating BDNF effects on cellular proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Aravamudan1">[22]</xref>, as well as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and protein expression as shown in this study using pharmacological inhibition of both IKK and NFÎºB. In this regard, the lack of effect of TAT-pep5 on BDNF enhancement of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is interesting since NFÎºB activation is typically associated with p75NTR signaling. However, the involvement of PI3/Akt in BDNF effects suggests an alternative route for NFÎºB activation which may be mediated via TrkB.</p>
      <p>While the data in this study using pharmacological inhibitors suggest a role for all of MAP kinase, PI3/Akt and NFÎºB in mediating the effect of BDNF on expression of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regulatory proteins, it is interesting that their contributions are complex and appear to be mechanism specific. For example, MAP kinases appear to consistently affecting the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory proteins such as SERCA and release channels, but not influx mechanisms in general. On the other hand, NFÎºB appears to have a broad and consistent effect on both influx and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mechanisms. The relative contribution of PI3 vs. Akt is even more complex, with both involved for some proteins but not others. These data only highlight the complexity of BDNF signaling in any cell type, and emphasize the need to examine the underlying mechanisms in every cell type of interest rather than extrapolating from the nervous system or other cell types. Indeed, we propose that the differential contribution of different signaling pathways in mediating BDNF effects allows BDNF to have pleiotropic effects on inflammation and other insults that also use these signaling cascades. Accordingly, in diseases such as asthma, BDNF has the potential to enhance one cascade vs. the other to enhance [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> or cell proliferation as we have previously shown. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Aravamudan1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The present study demonstrates a functional relevance for the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory expression observed with BDNF, as well as the role of the above signaling cascades. Given the importance of the plasma membrane vs. intracellular regulatory mechanisms for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regulation in ASM, the effects of BDNF on CD38 are particularly important. This interesting ectoenzyme is a key molecule for the cyclic ADP ribose-RyR channel second messenger-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory pathway in ASM. CD38 expression is known to be regulated by cascades such as MAP kinases and NFÎºB, and is considered a key mechanism in mediating the effects of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Jude1">[29]</xref>. Accordingly, BDNF-induced expression and function of CD38 has the potential to substantially influence airway reactivity and its dysfunction. Whether a similar relationship between BDNF and other [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regulatory mechanisms holds in terms of signaling cascades is not yet known. However, the differential effects of inhibiting MAP kinase vs. PI3/Akt vs. NFÎºB on BDNF enhancement of influx proteins (STIM1, Orai1) vs. intracellular proteins (SERCA or RyR) suggest that BDNF can modulate the relative contribution of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathways in a complex fashion. This pleiotropic effect will facilitate nuanced influences of BDNF on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regulation via influx vs. intracellular release/reuptake in the setting of inflammation where certain mechanisms may be upregulated, such as influx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-Ay1">[26]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044343-White1">[28]</xref>, while others such as SERCA may decrease.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the present study shows that BDNF upregulates a number of mechanisms important in airway contractility which, in combination with enhancement of ASM cell proliferation and cytokine effects can substantially influence airway hyperresponsiveness. Further in vivo research is required to determine whether interactions between BDNF and inflammation is enhanced in asthmatic airways, setting the stage to investigate the potential for interference with BDNF signaling as a therapeutic avenue.</p>
