<abstract>
<p>Sperm whales are present in the Canary Islands year-round, suggesting that the archipelago is an important area for this species in the North Atlantic. However, the area experiences one of the highest reported rates of sperm whale ship-strike in the world. Here we investigate if the number of sperm whales found in the archipelago can sustain the current rate of ship-strike mortality. The results of this study may also have implications for offshore areas where concentrations of sperm whales may coincide with high densities of ship traffic, but where ship-strikes may be undocumented. The absolute abundance of sperm whales in an area of 52933 km<sup>2</sup>, covering the territorial waters of the Canary Islands, was estimated from 2668 km of acoustic line-transect survey using Distance sampling analysis. Data on sperm whale diving and acoustic behaviour, obtained from bio-logging, were used to calculate g(0) = 0.92, this is less than one because of occasional extended periods when whales do not echolocate. This resulted in an absolute abundance estimate of 224 sperm whales (95% log-normal CI 120–418) within the survey area. The recruitment capability of this number of whales, some 2.5 whales per year, is likely to be exceeded by the current ship-strike mortality rate. Furthermore, we found areas of higher whale density within the archipelago, many coincident with those previously described, suggesting that these are important habitats for females and immature animals inhabiting the archipelago. Some of these areas are crossed by active shipping lanes increasing the risk of ship-strikes. Given the philopatry in female sperm whales, replacement of impacted whales might be limited. Therefore, the application of mitigation measures to reduce the ship-strike mortality rate seems essential for the conservation of sperm whales in the Canary Islands.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worldwide, the anthropogenic impact on marine life is increasing due to an intensifying utilisation of the marine environment. During the last few decades maritime traffic volume and vessel speed have grown rapidly, leading to an increase in ambient noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref001">1</xref>], as well as in the number of ship-strikes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref002">2</xref>]. The increase in the number of ship-strikes has been identified as of particular concern for species that spend long periods of time near the surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref004">4</xref>] where they are vulnerable to ship-strikes. Cetaceans must come to the surface to breathe and consequently there are numerous documented cases of both serious injuries and mortalities caused by ship-strikes in cetacean populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref005">5</xref>]. As a result, the mortality from ship-strikes has become an important conservation issue for cetaceans worldwide.</p>
<p>Although a variety of sailing and small motorised vessels have been reported as being involved in collisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref006">6</xref>], the occurrence and severity appears to increase with both the size and the speed of vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref007">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the likelihood of collision increases in areas where high volumes of maritime traffic overlap with areas frequented by cetaceans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref002">2</xref>]. Reports of ship-strikes include collisions with both small and large whales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref008">8</xref>], but whales that swim slowly and spend long periods at shallow depths seem to be particularly vulnerable. To date, ten species of shallow-diving baleen whales have been reported to be globally involved in ship-strikes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref009">9</xref>]. Ship-strikes are of particular concern for small or isolated populations in near-shore habitats with high levels of maritime traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref011">11</xref>]. This is the case with the North Atlantic right whale (<italic>Eubalaena glacialis</italic>), where collisions with vessels have been identified as the main factor underlying the risk of extinction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref012">12</xref>]. In general, the low reproduction rate of cetaceans, often compounded by complex social structures, can cause ship-strikes to have a significant impact at a population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>To date, much of what is known about ship-strikes comes from coastal shallow-diving species [e.g. 2, 11]. In order to better understand the impact of ship-strikes on deep-diving species this study examines the sperm whale (<italic>Physeter macrocephalus</italic>) within an area that allows the assessment of the study's two essential objectives: the determination of the abundance of sperm whales in the area and a measure of the minimum ship-strike mortality rate. These objectives were feasible because of the proximity of the whale's deep-water habitat to land within the Canary Islands study area. The Canary Island archipelago consists of seven main volcanic islands, located off the northwestern coast of Africa.</p>
<p>Within the archipelago high densities of whales and dolphins coincide with areas of relatively high maritime traffic levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref016">16</xref>]. From 1991 to 2007 a total of 59 strandings, some 11% of the total number of strandings, were reported as showing signs of ship-strike. Eight different cetacean species could be identified: sperm whales (n = 24, 41%), pygmy sperm whales (<italic>Kogia breviceps</italic>, n = 7, 12%), Cuvier´s beaked whales (<italic>Ziphius cavirostris</italic>, n = 7, 12%), short-finned pilot whales (<italic>Globicephala macrorhynchus</italic>, n = 6, 10%), Gervais´ beaked whales (<italic>Mesoplodon europaeus</italic>, n = 1, 2%), fin whales (<italic>Balaenoptera physalus</italic>, n = 2, 3%), Bryde´s whales (<italic>Balaenoptera brydei</italic>, n = 2, 3%), and sei whales (<italic>Balaenoptera borealis</italic>, n = 1, 2%), in the remaining 9 strandings (15%) the species was not identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref015">15</xref>]. These reports of whales with signs of ship-strike increased in 1999 and have remained consistently high since [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref015">15</xref>]. This increase corresponds with the concurrent rise in the mean speed of ferries and the number of ferry journeys in the archipelago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref017">17</xref>]. Sperm whales are found year-round in the waters off the Canary Islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref018">18</xref>] and within the islands comprise the majority of stranding records where signs of ship-strike are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref015">15</xref>]. Since 1999 an average of two sperm whales per year have stranded within the archipelago with signs of ship-strike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref015">15</xref>]. The sperm whale is listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and is included in Annex IV of the European Union Habitats Directive.</p>
<p>In the Canary Islands collisions may be caused by international shipping, most often transiting through the two International Maritime Organization (IMO) designated shipping lanes within the Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) of the Canary Islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref019">19</xref>], and by inter-island vessel traffic. Ferries operating in the Canary Islands usually travel at speeds of 23 to 40 knots (some 43 to 74 km/h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref016">16</xref>]. Laist <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref002">2</xref>] and Vanderlaan and Taggart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref005">5</xref>] correlated increasing vessel speed (above 10 knots) with a greater probability of ship-strikes and of whales sustaining a lethal injury from such strikes.</p>
<p>Here we provide an estimate of the absolute abundance and density of sperm whales within the Canary Islands and a snap-shot of their distribution. The results are used to assess the potential for ship-strikes in the archipelago to impact on the local abundance of sperm whales. This assessment shows that in the long term this deep-diving species cannot sustain the current level of ship-strikes within this local area. This has implications for other areas, particularly remote offshore areas, where high concentrations of deep-diving whales may coincide with high levels of ship traffic resulting in the impacts of ship-strikes going unnoticed.</p>

<title>Survey area and transect design</title>
<p>The survey was designed to cover an area extending from the islands' shelf-edge, across the slope and into abyssal waters; the 500 m isobath was used as the inner survey boundary while the outer boundary was 27 km offshore from this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This survey area included the territorial waters around the Canary Islands, where the Spanish Government has a mandate from national and international conservation law to manage protected species and mitigate anthropogenic impacts for conservation purposes. Furthermore, the survey area encompassed the Concepcion, Amanay and El Banquete seamounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which are proposed for inclusion in the EU Nature 2000 network of protected areas. The total area of the zone surveyed was 52933 km<sup>2</sup>. The zone was divided into 23 survey blocks to facilitate transect design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which was carried out using <italic>Distance</italic> version 6.0 release 2 (distancesampling.org, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref020">20</xref>]. An equidistant zigzag transect design was used, with a random start to the zigzags within each block, and with a similar coverage rate across all blocks; this resulted in 99 transects totalling 3030 km in length. The principal axis for the zigzag design within each block was as close to parallel to the bathymetry as possible, resulting in transects approximately perpendicular to the slope. The average survey speed was 6.4 knots (11.8 km/h), essentially fulfilling the recommendation ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref021">21</xref>] p251) that surveys should be conducted at speeds of at least 2–3 times that of the animals' speed in order to avoid an overestimation of animal density; typical speeds for sperm whales are 1.9–3.2 knots (3.5–6 km/h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref022">22</xref>].

<title>Acoustic Survey</title>
<p>Acoustic data were collected using a hydrophone array with two broadband frequency hydrophone elements (HP-03) 23.4 cm apart and a broadband preamplifier with a 2 kHz high-pass filter (Ecologic, J. Gordon) towed 200 m behind the vessel. The hydrophone was connected to an amplifier box built by Seiche Measurements Ltd. Sound was digitised with an analogue to digital converter (ADC <italic>E-MU Tracker Pre</italic>) at a sampling rate of 96 kHz and recorded continuously as WAV files using IFAW's <italic>Logger</italic> software, version 4.05.0002. An automatic click detection and classification program, <italic>Rainbow Click</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref023">23</xref>] version 4.07.0002, ran continuously throughout the survey. <italic>Rainbow Click</italic> identified candidate sperm whale clicks and calculated the bearings to these clicks in real-time by measuring the difference in time of arrival of the signal at the two elements.</p>

<title>Click Analysis</title>
<p>To obtain perpendicular distances to whales it was necessary to use the bearings to clicks produced by individual whales and to intersect these as the vessel passed the whales. Clicks were assigned to individual whales during post-processing by analysing the WAV recordings using <italic>Rainbow Click</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref024">24</xref>]. The program identified candidate sperm whale clicks and plotted these on bearing against time, amplitude against time and inter-click interval against time plots. The program also provided plots of the waveform and the power spectrum for individual clicks and allowed playback of selected clicks. An analyst used these tools to assign clicks to click trains and click trains to individual whales. Clicks of individual sperm whales appeared as sequences of regularly spaced clicks on a bearing that changed slowly with time as the vessel passed the animals.</p>

<title>Determining Perpendicular Distances</title>
<p>A routine for estimating whale positions, implemented in Matlab 6.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com" xlink:type="simple">www.mathworks.com</ext-link>), was used to estimate the position of each whale and consequently its perpendicular distance to the track-line. The routine combined data for the ship's course with data on bearings to clicks from individual whales and, by simplifying the situation and assuming whales were at the sea surface, crossed these bearings at the surface. This produced two areas of intersection, one to the left and one to the right of the track. The routine selected the side with the most coherent intersection of bearings and the distance between this point and the survey was then used in the program <italic>Distance</italic>. The simplification of assuming whales were at the surface means that for diving whales the perpendicular distance is over-estimated. The bias introduced by this simplification was investigated by Leaper <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref025">25</xref>] and found not to be significant.</p>

<title>Line-transect g(0) estimation</title>
<p>Conventional Distance sampling (CDS) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref021">21</xref>] was used to calculate the density of whales in the survey area. A detection model was used to calculate the equivalent width of the survey strip as if a strip-transect survey (i.e. of fixed width) had been used, this is termed the effective strip half-width (ESHW). This allows the density of animals within the effective strip to be estimated. Hence, density estimates rely on the knowledge of a detection function, i.e. the probability of detecting an animal as a function of its perpendicular distance from the track-line. Here, a key parameter is g(0), the probability of detecting animals at zero horizontal distance from the track-line, which is assumed to be certain. However, sperm whales occasionally spend extended periods at the surface, resting and/or socialising, when they do not echolocate, this can result in g(0) being less than one. Previous studies have used g(0) = 1 as an approximation to the actual value of g(0) as evidence suggested that extended non-echolocating periods were relatively rare (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref026">26</xref>]), and furthermore accurate data on the extent and frequency of such periods was either not available or not easily obtained.</p>
<p>The probability of acoustically detecting whales is a combination of the probability of whales vocalising and the probability of detecting these sounds. Following Barlow <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref027">27</xref>] we assumed that, within the ESHW either side of the track-line, the availability bias, resulting from animals being missed because they were not vocalising, dictates g(0). We therefore estimated the acoustic availability bias of sperm whales using a Monte Carlo simulation. The model used defines a ship travelling through a 1-D model space (the transect line) of <italic>L</italic> km length (randomly chosen between 100 and 1000 km) with a fixed speed. <italic>N</italic> (1–300) randomly distributed stationary whales were placed on the track-line changing their detectability (time echolocating/not echolocating) after a period t<sub>e</sub>/t<sub>ne</sub>. Periods t<sub>e</sub> and t<sub>ne</sub> were randomly chosen from a distribution of t<sub>e</sub> and t<sub>ne</sub> values derived from empirical data (see below). Whales vocalising within a range equal to the ESHW behind or ahead of the travelling vessel were considered as detected. We used the ESHW obtained from the perpendicular distances as a proxy for the ESHW ahead and behind the vessel, this can cause a bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref028">28</xref>], however due to the long-range detection of sperm whales' echolocation clicks and the relatively short duration of the non-echolocating periods this bias can be considered negligible.</p>
<p>For animals on the track-line the survey’s detection time-window is defined as 2 × detection range / survey speed. We estimated g(0) by dividing the number of detected whales <italic>n</italic> by the total number of whales present in the model space: <italic>g(0) = n/N</italic>. The distributions of t<sub>e</sub> and t<sub>ne</sub> values were derived from the number and duration of the periods that sperm whales spend echolocating or not, respectively. This was estimated using data from acoustic and movement tags (DTag, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref029">29</xref>]) deployed on seven sperm whales off the Azores; this provided 94 hours of combined acoustic and movement data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Three of the seven sperm whales were recognised as females, given that calves were seen suckling from them; the rest may have been adult females or immature males, both similar in appearance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150660.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The dive profiles of tagged whales were divided into dive cycles comprising a foraging dive and the following inter-dive interval (IDI). Only complete dive cycles (n = 80) were used and the first dive cycle after tagging was excluded from the analyses to reduce potential bias due to the reaction of whales to tagging. We considered that whales were available for acoustic detection only during the echolocation periods within foraging dives, because only ‘usual’ echolocation clicks, and not social sounds such as codas, were used in our survey to detect and localise whales. Hence, the vocal period over which sperm whales were acoustically detectable was defined as the interval between the beginning and the end of clicking within a dive. We pooled data from all whales to estimate the probability of a sperm whale being available for acoustic detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Sperm whales were distributed throughout the archipelago (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g005">Fig 5</xref>); there were detections around all surveyed seamounts and all major islands, except for El Hierro. Most detections were made in the following areas: the channel between Tenerife and Gran Canaria, north of La Palma, east and west of the channel between Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, and in the vicinity of the Concepcion seamount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g005">Fig 5</xref>). There was a significant concentration of whales in a relatively small area to the north of La Palma, where four groups were detected, one of which contained over 20 individuals. Following this, the area with the highest number of groups was the channel between Tenerife and Gran Canaria. In general there was an increase in the number of detections with increasing depth within the surveyed area.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Knowledge of distribution and abundance is essential for effective management towards conservation of wildlife. Here, we estimate the absolute abundance and density of sperm whales in the Canary Islands and provide a snap-shot of their distribution. The results are used to assess the sustainability of ship-strikes for sperm whales in the archipelago and suggest that the Canary Islands might be acting as an attractive sink habitat.</p>
<sec id="sec016">
<title>Detection function</title>
<p>The estimate of g(0) for our survey was 0.92. This means that sperm whale abundance would be underestimated by approximately 8% should we fail to account for animals not echolocating for periods exceeding our survey's detection time-window of 43 minutes. This time-window is given by 2 × detection range/survey speed. Here we use the ESHW of 4.2 km as an approximation to the detection range, and use the mean survey speed of 11.8 km/h. The estimate of g(0) was performed using bio-logging data from the Azores, on the basis that sperm whales will behave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g002">Fig 2</xref>) similarly in the Azores and the Canary Islands given both regions have similar habitats and lie within the Macaronesia ecoregion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref032">32</xref>]. Moreover, the diving and vocal behaviour of sperm whales across warm and temperate regions has been shown to be highly stereotyped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>The ESHW of 4.2 km for this survey was about half that of the ESHWs estimated for surveys performed in comparable latitudes, where groups comprising of females and immature animals predominate, e.g. 8–10 km [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref034">34</xref>]. This difference is probably due to masking caused by elevated levels of noise generated by our survey vessel. The histogram of perpendicular distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g004">Fig 4</xref>) shows a dip close to the track line (&lt;600 m) with a peak further out (600–1800 m). This dip and peak in the histogram is likely to have resulted from the process of rotating the distances to dived whales to the surface in order to obtain horizontal perpendicular distances for Distance analysis (as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and Methods</xref>). Leaper <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref025">25</xref>] showed that the bias introduced by this simplification was small (e.g. &lt;1% for animals diving to 1000 m), furthermore the Hazard Rate Key model, aided by a plateau in the histogram data beyond the peak, effectively smoothed out this perturbation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec017">
<title>Abundance estimation &amp; distribution</title>
<p>The density of sperm whales within the survey area was 4.24 whales/1000 km<sup>2</sup> (CI 2.27–7.89), just 18% of the density estimate obtained during the first survey of sperm whales in the Canary Islands, made in 1995, of between 19.6 and 27.7 whales/1000 km<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref018">18</xref>]. This reduction is considerable, but should be interpreted with caution, given that both studies differ in several respects: (i) our survey was performed in autumn-winter, while André surveyed in summer; (ii) André covered a smaller survey area—extending to 20 km offshore (ours extended to 27 km from the 500 m isobath); (iii) André used acoustic point sampling, whereas we used line transect sampling, and iv) André used a mean value for group size in the abundance estimation, based on observations of sperm whales off the central islands, whereas we used distances to each animal detected within a group for CDS analysis.</p>
<p>Although sperm whales exhibit a nomadic ranging behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref035">35</xref>], and consequently can be found throughout the Canary Islands, we also found that there were specific areas where sperm whales were concentrated, and that many of these areas were consistent with those reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref018">18</xref>]. These areas included: the area north of La Palma, the channel between Gran Canaria and Tenerife, the area southwest of La Gomera, the areas southeast and northwest of Fuerteventura, and the area northeast of Lanzarote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Additionally, a new area of aggregation was found around the Concepcion seamount, an area not surveyed by André. While these two surveys only constitute snapshots of the distribution of the whales, the coincidence of areas with higher whale concentrations in both surveys, which were carried out more than a decade apart, suggests that sperm whales may have preferred habitats in the archipelago.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec018">
<title>Potential ship-strike risk</title>
<p>This study suggests that sperm whales may occupy preferred areas within the archipelago, which might be quite stable across time, likely indicating important foraging habitats and some degree of site fidelity within the region. Some of these aggregation areas coincide with areas of high maritime traffic density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref036">36</xref>], creating areas with an elevated ship-strike risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g005">Fig 5</xref>). For example, the preference of sperm whales for the channel between Tenerife and Gran Canaria may explain the high number of strandings with signs of ship-strikes recorded in Tenerife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref016">16</xref>]. This channel is crossed by inter-island ferry routes which are used by fast (travelling at 23–25 knots) and high speed (travelling at 30–40 knots) ferries some 130 times per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref016">16</xref>]. A shipping lane endorsed by the IMO also passes through the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150660.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The dominant trade-wind and marine currents in the archipelago are from the northeast and therefore favour the stranding of carcasses on the island on the western side of the channel, i.e. Tenerife.</p>
<p>Carrillo and Ritter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref015">15</xref>] showed that in the Canary Islands at least two sperm whales per year died between 1999 and 2007 with signs of ship-strike. In general, caution is required when inferring ship-strike as the cause of a stranding, given that injuries may be post-mortem, potentially resulting in an overestimation of strike-related mortalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref002">2</xref>]. However, all necropsies (n = 17) performed on sperm whales that stranded with signs of collision in the Canary Islands confirmed ship-strike as the cause of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref038">38</xref>]. Necropsies were performed on animals stranded in an adequate state of conservation, independently of the cause of death. This strongly suggests that the estimate of annual ship-strike mortality rate gathered from strandings is not overestimated. In fact, the actual number of ship-strike mortalities is likely to be underestimated by stranding data, since not all carcasses strand and not all stranded animals are discovered. For example, Williams <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref039">39</xref>] suggested the rate of discovery of sperm whale carcasses in the Gulf of Mexico was only 3%. This rate may be higher in the Canary Islands due to the proximity of deep waters to the shore; however, the steepness of the coast may impede the discovery and recovery of stranded animals in many areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref040">40</xref>]. Furthermore, when carcasses of stranded whales are found, signs of collision may not be detected or conclusive.</p>
<p>The average number of strandings per year showing signs of collision represents about 1% of the 224 sperm whales estimated to be within the surveyed waters around the archipelago. Whitehead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref041">41</xref>] estimated the maximum rate of increase of a sperm whale stock (<italic>r</italic>) to be about 1.1% per year. Applying this to our abundance estimate gives a maximum rate of increase of 2.5 whales per year, a value that is very close to the 2 whales that strand per year with signs of collision. Moreover, given the likelihood that strandings are underestimating the actual ship-strike mortality rate, mortalities due to ship-strikes would likely exceed the reproduction rate of the number of sperm whales surveyed in the Canary Islands. Nevertheless, the overall effect of anthropogenic mortality on an animal population will depend on whether or not the losses can be compensated for by external recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref042">42</xref>]. The lack of data on the site fidelity and the connectivity of sperm whale groups inhabiting the Canary Islands preclude an accurate evaluation of the risk posed by ship-strikes for this pelagic deep-diving species in the archipelago. However, given female philopatry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref043">43</xref>] and the complex social structure of this cetacean species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref045">45</xref>], the fact that ship-strikes in the Canary Islands appear to preferentially affect females and young animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref015">15</xref>] may increase the risk of population level effects.</p>
<p>This study presents the first attempt to assess the potential effects of ship-strikes on sperm whales in the Canary Islands, and represents the best available information on which to base management actions until further data on population structure becomes available. The results suggest that the archipelago could be considered as an attractive sink habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref042">42</xref>]. Such a habitat is defined as a high-quality area in terms of occupancy (e.g. for food resources), but low-quality in terms of poor survival rates arising from human activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref046">46</xref>]. When such apparently attractive sink habitats are utilised in preference to other habitats, the population as a whole may decline or become locally extinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref047">47</xref>]. The implications of selecting an attractive sink habitat for a population´s long term survival will depend on the population size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref048">48</xref>], the strength and flexibility of the habitat selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref049">49</xref>]) and the amount of sink habitat in the landscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref042">42</xref>]. In the face of uncertainty, it is important to implement precautionary approaches to management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref051">51</xref>]. Applying the precautionary approach in this case would mean reducing the anthropogenic impact, i.e. that caused by ship traffic, to reduce human induced mortality in an apparently high-quality habitat for sperm whales in the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>Sperm whales in the Canary Islands are not well studied, but it is recognised that sperm whales occur mainly in groups composed primarily of females and their offspring which are present in the islands all year-round [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref018">18</xref>]. Sperm whales in the North Atlantic are considered a single stock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref052">52</xref>], and genetic studies carried out by Alexander <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref053">53</xref>] show an mtDNA differentiation between the Canary Islands and the western North Atlantic, which suggests that there is no apparent connection between females groups within the west and east North Atlantic Ocean. Given the local philopatry of females ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref053">53</xref>], previous studies have suggested that management of sperm whales should be focused on females and immature components of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref055">55</xref>]. Here, we support the idea that mitigation measures should be implemented in the archipelago in order to reduce ship-strike mortality rates. Mitigation measures, proposed by Silber <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref056">56</xref>] and Carrillo and Ritter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref015">15</xref>], should be evaluated for their effectiveness and be implemented for both the inter-insular ferries and the international shipping in collaboration with the IMO. In this study, we focused on the sperm whale, however all cetacean species involved in ship-strikes in the Canary Islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0150660.ref037">37</xref>] will potentially benefit from these mitigation measures.</p>
