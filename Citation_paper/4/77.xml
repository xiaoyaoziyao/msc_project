<abstract>
<p>Neurite outgrowth is an essential process for the establishment of the nervous system. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) binds to its receptor TrkB and regulates axonal and dendritic morphology of neurons through signal transduction and gene expression. SH2B1 is a signaling adaptor protein that regulates cellular signaling in various physiological processes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of SH2B1 in the development of the central nervous system. In this study, we show that knocking down SH2B1 reduces neurite formation of cortical neurons whereas overexpression of SH2B1β promotes the development of hippocampal neurons. We further demonstrate that SH2B1β promotes BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth and signaling using the established PC12 cells stably expressing TrkB, SH2B1β or SH2B1β mutants. Our data indicate that overexpressing SH2B1β enhances BDNF-induced MEK-ERK1/2, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. Inhibition of MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT pathways by specific inhibitors suggest that these two pathways are required for SH2B1β-promoted BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth. Moreover, SH2B1β enhances BDNF-stimulated phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 at serine 727. Finally, our data indicate that the SH2 domain and tyrosine phosphorylation of SH2B1β contribute to BDNF-induced signaling pathways and neurite outgrowth. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that SH2B1β promotes BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth through enhancing pathways involved MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Development of the nervous system depends on both extracellular cues and intrinsic factors, including neurotrophins, to promote differentiation. Neurotrophins are a family of closely related proteins that regulate many aspects of survival, development, maintenance and function of neurons in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems (PNS and CNS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Reichardt1">[1]</xref>. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophic factor that was originally shown to promote survival of a subpopulation of dorsal root ganglion neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Barde1">[2]</xref>. Its specific receptor TrkB is highly expressed in the developing CNS (brain and spinal cord) and PNS (cranial and spinal ganglia) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Klein1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Klein2">[4]</xref>. By binding to its receptor TrkB, BDNF acts in a paracrine and autocrine manner to control a variety of brain processes, including promoting neurite outgrowth of developing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Bosco1">[5]</xref>, increasing survival and axon outgrowth from pontocerebellar mossy fiber neurons in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Rabacchi1">[6]</xref>. Besides axonal development, BDNF and TrkB also play important roles in regulating the growth and branching of dendrites in cortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-McAllister1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Yacoubian1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Three major intracellular signaling pathways have been implicated by BDNF-TrkB binding. There are the pathways involving Ras/Raf/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase (MEK) activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) stimulation of AKT and PLCγ1-dependent generation of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol, leading to mobilization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and activation of DAG-regulated protein kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Reichardt1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Bibel1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Patapoutian1">[13]</xref>. ERK signaling pathway has been shown to be required for TrkB-mediated axonal outgrowth in sympathetic neurons and neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells ectopically expressing TrkB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Atwal1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Qui1">[16]</xref>. AKT has recently been implicated in several aspects of neurite outgrowth, including elongation, branching, calibre and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Markus1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Zheng1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Kumar1">[19]</xref>. These findings suggest that MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways regulate neurite elongation, branching and calibre of PC12 cells and primary neurons.</p>
<p>SH2B1β is a member of the SH2B family of adaptor proteins including SH2-B (SH2B1), APS (SH2B2) and Lnk (SH2B3). SH2B1 contains three proline-rich domains, a pleckstrin homology domain, a dimerization domain, and a carboxy (C)-terminal Src homology (SH2) domain. Four SH2B1 splice variants, α, β, γ, and δ, differ only in their C-termini starting just past the SH2 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Yousaf1">[20]</xref>. SH2B1β is known to interact with the activated forms of Janus kinase 2, nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor TrkA, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor (GDNFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) through its SH2 domain and then is tyrosyl phosphorylated by these receptors to mediate downstream signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Qian1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Rui4">[28]</xref>. Previous studies also revealed a positive role of SH2B1β in NGF-, GDNF- and FGF1-induced neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion and PC12 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Qian1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Rui3">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Zhang1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Lin1">[29]</xref>, model systems for the peripheral nervous system. The cellular role of SH2B1β, the predominant splice variant in the nervous system, in the CNS has not been investigated. In this study, we examine whether SH2B1β regulates neurite development of cortical and hippocampal neurons. As BDNF is a predominant neurotrophin in the central nervous system, we further determine whether SH2B1β is involved in BDNF signaling during neuronal differentiation.</p>

<title>Neurite outgrowth</title>
<p>For BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth, all stable cell lines were plated on 3.5-cm culture dishes coated with 0.1 mg/ml of collagen type I. For neuronal differentiation, PC12+TrkB cells were treated with 100 ng/ml BDNF in low-serum differentiation medium (DMEM containing 2% horse serum, 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic and 1% L-glutamine). Cells were pre-treated 1 h with or without 20 µM U0126 or LY294002 before the addition of 50 ng/ml BDNF. Neurite outgrowth was monitored for 1 or 3 days. Medium containing BDNF and the inhibitor was replaced every two days. Images of differentiating cells were taken using Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope using either 10X (NA/0.3), 20X (NA/0.4) or 40X (NA/0.6) objective. The definition of morphological differentiation in PC12 cells is that the length of the neurite should be at least twice of the diameter of the cell body. The percentage of differentiation was scored as the percentage of differentiated cells per counted cells.</p>

<title>Measurement of neurite length and neurite branching</title>
<p>The average length of the longest neurite (i.e. neurite extending directly from the cell body) was measured using the Simple Neurite Tracer, a plugin for ImageJ software to make semi-automatic tracing of neurons or tube-like structures (neurite or filopodia). The mean pixel value of neurite length was measured and converted pixels into micrometers (µm). The number of end-points were quantified using the built-in cell-counter in ImageJ software.

<title>SH2B1 regulates neurite outgrowth of cortical and hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>To investigate whether SH2B1β is involved in the development of CNS, we examine the role of SH2B1β in the neurite outgrowth of embryonic day 18 (E18) cortical neurons by knocking down endogenous SH2B1. Neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons transfected with short hairpin (sh) shLacZ control plasmid was compared to those transfected with shSH2B1 construct together with pEGFP plasmid on day in vitro (DIV) 4, followed by with or without BDNF stimulation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, knocking down SH2B1 significantly reduced BDNF-induced neurite length and branching of cortical neurons. The quantified results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g001">Figure 1B and C</xref>. In the absence of BDNF, the average neurite length was reduced to 45%. Similarly, knocking down SH2B1 reduced the average neurite length to around 50% in the presence of BDNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of SH2B1β enhanced neurite length and BDNF-induced branching of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These data suggest that SH2B1 regulates neurite outgrowth of E18 cortical and hippocampal neurons.</p>

<title>Knocking down SH2B1β reduced BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells</title>
<p>We thus set out to investigate the underlying mechanism by which SH2B1β enhances BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth. Because of the poor transfection efficiency of primary neurons, PC12 cell line was used as a model system to carry out the following experiments. PC12 cells do not express BDNF receptor, TrkB. We thus establish PC12 cell line that stably expresses TrkB (PC12-TrkB) to determine if we could re-capitulate the phenotype observed in cortical and hippocampal neurons. PC12-TrkB and PC12 cells were treated with 50 ng/ml BDNF in low serum medium for 0, 1 or 3 days. The parental PC12 cells were not responsive to BDNF and thus no neurite outgrowth was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We compared the neurite outgrowth of PC12-TrkB cells with or without reduced endogenous SH2B1. Knocking down SH2B1 via shSH2B1 transfection, we established two other stable cell lines, PC12-TrkB+shLacZ control cell line, and PC12-TrkB+shSH2B1 cell line that expresses 60% reduced SH2B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The definition of neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells is that the length of the neurite should be at least twice of the diameter of the cell body. Neurite outgrowth of PC12-TrkB+shSH2B1 was obviously reduced compared to control PC12-TrkB+shLacZ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). BDNF-induced neuronal differentiation was reduced by 50% when endogenous SH2B1 was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). These results recapitulate findings using primary cortical neurons and suggest that PC12 cells expressing TrkB can be used to study how SH2B1β regulates BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth.</p>

<p>To understand how SH2B1β may enhance BDNF-induced signaling, two new PC12 cells stably cell lines, PC12 cells expressing GFP and TrkB receptors (PC12-GFP+TrkB) and PC12 cells stably expressing GFP-SH2B1β and TrkB receptors (PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB), were established to study the regulation of BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth by SH2B1β. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g004">Figure 4A</xref> showed the expression of GFP-SH2B1β and TrkB in these two cell lines. To examine the effects of SH2B1β on BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth, PC12-GFP+TrkB and PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cell lines were mock-treated or treated with 100 ng/ml BDNF for 1 or 3 days.

Representative live cell images are shown. Scale bar  =  50 µm.

<p>Binding of BDNF to TrkB can activate three major intracellular signaling pathways, including MEK-ERK, PI3K-AKT, and PLCγ1 pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Blum1">[31]</xref>. To determine how SH2B1β promotes BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth, PC12-GFP+TrkB and PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cell lines were treated with 50 ng/ml BDNF for 5, 10, 30 and 60 min. In PC12-GFP+TrkB cell lines, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) was induced by BDNF within 5 min and reduced by 30 min. The level of pERK1/2 remained elevated above the basal level for up to 60 min of BDNF treatment. In contrast, in PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cell line, pERK1/2 was induced within 5 min after BDNF stimulation and the level of phosphorylation remain higher than that in PC12-GFP+TrkB cells for at least 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Total ERK1/2 levels serve as the loading control to demonstrate that the difference of pERK1/2 in the two cell lines is not due to the difference in the total amount of ERK1/2. Similarly, phosphorylation of AKT at serine 473 [pAKT(S473)] was induced within 5 min after BDNF treatment in PC12-GFP+TrkB and PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cells. The level of pAKT(S473) in PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cells was higher compared to that in PC12-GFP+TrkB cells within 60 min. It is noteworthy that the basal level of pAKT(S473) in PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cells was higher than that in PC12-GFP+TrkB cells. Moreover, application of BDNF to the two cell lines for 5 min also induced phosphorylation of PLCγ1 at tyrosine 783 [pPLCγ1(Y783)] and the level of pPLCγ1(Y783) was induced up to 60 min. The level of pPLCγ1(Y783) was higher in PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cells compared to that in PC12-GFP+TrkB cells only for the 5 min time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). The quantified results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g005">Figure 5B</xref>.

<title>Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT are required for SH2B1β-enhanced neurtie outgrowth</title>
<p>To determine whether MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways are required for BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth, specific inhibitors were used to block either one of these pathways. PC12-GFP+TrkB and PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cells were stimulated by 50 ng/ml BDNF for the indicated time in the presence or absence of selective pharmacological inhibitors of the MAPK or PI3K-AKT pathways and the neurite outgrowth was analyzed. The MEK inhibitor, U0126, inhibited BDNF-induced pERK1/2 in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12-GFP+TrkB cells was completely abolished by the U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, panel v and vii).

BDNF induced pSTAT3(S727) within 5 min and the level of phosphorylation remained elevated above the basal level for up to 60 min for both cell lines. The relative pSTAT3(S727) in PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cells was higher compared to that in PC12-GFP+TrkB cells at the indicated time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

To investigate which pathway is responsible for the induced pSTAT3(S727), specific inhibitors of MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT pathways were used to examine the contribution of these two pathways to BDNF-induced pSTAT3(S727). Inhibition of MEK-ERK1/2 pathway by U0126 reduced BDNF-induced pSTAT3(S727) in both PC12-GFP+TrkB and PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

<title>SH2B1β interacts with TrkB receptors</title>
<p>A central question to address is how SH2B1β may enhance BDNF signaling. One possibility is that SH2B1β interacts with TrkB. To this end, 293T cells were co-transfected with TrkB and myc-SH2B1β followed by BDNF treatment. SH2B1β was immunoprecipitated using anti-myc antibody. In response to BDNF for 10 or 30 min, the association between SH2B1β, TrkB and pTrkB(Y706) was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g010">Figure 10</xref>, upper panels). Phosphorylation of TrkB at tyrosine 706 was induced in response to BDNF treatment for 10 and 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079619-g010">Figure 10</xref>, lower panels). This result suggests that BDNF-induced phosphorylation and activation of TrkB facilitates its interaction with SH2B1β. This interaction may be responsible for the enhanced and prolonged BDNF signaling by overexpression of SH2B1β.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main purpose of this study is to investigate how SH2B1 regulates BDNF-induced signaling and thus morphogenesis of cortical neurons and PC12-TrkB cells. SH2B1β enhances BDNF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT and STAT3. Inhibition of MEK-ERK1/2 pathway clearly blocks BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth for both PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB and PC12-GFP+TrkB cells. Inhibiting PI3K-AKT pathway, on the other hand, blocks neurite outgrowth of PC12-GFP+TrkB cells but only reduces neurite outgrowth of PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cells. These results suggest that SH2B1β enhances BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth mainly through MEK-ERK1/2 pathway. In line with this conclusion, the basal level of pAKT(S473) in PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cells was higher than that of control cells whereas no spontaneous neurite outgrowth was found. Because pAKT was shown to be the major survival-promoting factor for neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Kaplan1">[34]</xref>, it is possible that the enhanced pAKT in PC12-SH2B1β+TrkB cells serve to promote cell survival. Our recent report showing that overexpression of SH2B1β reduces oxidative stress-induced cell death supports this possibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Lu1">[35]</xref>. Alternatively, SH2B1β may enhance pAKT to increase dendritic formation and/or branches of cortical and hippocampal neurons.</p>
<p>SH2 domain of SH2B1 is responsible for binding to a variety of its receptor tyrosine kinases, including the receptors for insulin, PDGF, NGF and GDNF. In this study, we demonstrate that the binding of SH2B1β to TrkB. The dominant negative mutant of SH2B1β that lacks functional SH2 domain cannot enhance BDNF signaling and neurite outgrowth. SH2B1 has been reported to be phosphorylated in response to activation of PDGFR, TrkA and FGFR3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Qian1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Rui1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Rui3">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Kong1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Ahmed1">[33]</xref>. SH2B1β(9YF), with all nine tyrosines mutated, is able to slightly enhance BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth and signaling. These results raise a possibility that, in addition to mechanisms regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of SH2B1, other SH2B1-regulated functions may play a role during BDNF-induced neuronal differentiation.</p>
<p>Both BDNF and SH2B1 have been implicated in metabolic diseases. SH2B1 knockout mice develop obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Duan1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Song1">[38]</xref>. Human subjects with SH2B1 mutations have also been reported to result in hyperphagia, obesity, insulin resistance, reduced height and behavioral abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Doche1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Prudente1">[42]</xref>. While peripheral insulin resistance attributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes, brain insulin resistance has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Insulin signaling and regulation are critical for neuronal survival, metabolism and energy generation necessary for memory and cognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-delaMonte1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Steen1">[44]</xref>. Previous studies from our group and others showed that SH2B1 promotes neuronal differentiation and reduces oxidative stress-induced cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Rui3">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Lin1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Lu1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Song1">[38]</xref>. SH2B1 also regulates insulin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Ahmed1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Ahmed2">[45]</xref>. Thus, it is likely that SH2B1 may have roles not only in neuronal development and survival, but also metabolism. BDNF has also been shown to correlate with metabolic syndrome as well as diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Han1">[46]</xref>. Plasma level of BDNF in diabetic patients is lower than normal individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Hristova1">[47]</xref> and administrating BDNF to transgenetic diabetic animals normalizes blood glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079619-Tonra1">[48]</xref>. Although the exact mechanisms by which SH2B1 and BDNF regulate metabolism are not clear, our study shows an association between SH2B1 and TrkB, suggesting a link of SH2B1 in regulating BDNF signaling and glucose metabolism.</p>
<p>Taken together, this study suggests that the adaptor protein SH2B1β promotes BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth in part through enhancing BDNF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT. SH2B1β does so through binding to TrkB. In response to BDNF, tyrosine phosphorylation of SH2B1β is likely to play a role in enhancing BDNF-induced signaling and neurite outgrowth.</p>
