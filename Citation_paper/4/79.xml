				<p>TrkA-mediated NGF signaling in PC12 cells has been shown to be compartimentalized in specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane, the caveolae, which are organized by scaffold proteins including the member of the caveolin family of proteins, caveolin-1. Here, we characterize the intracellular distribution as well as the biochemical and functional properties of the neuroendocrine long coiled-coil protein 2 (NECC2), a novel long coiled-coil protein selectively expressed in neuroendocrine tissues that contains a predicted caveolin-binding domain and displays structural characteristics of a scaffolding factor. NECC2 distributes in caveolae, wherein it colocalizes with the TrkA receptor, and behaves as a caveolae-associated protein in neuroendocrine PC12 cells. In addition, stimulation of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) increased the expression and regulated the distribution of NECC2. Interestingly, knockdown as well as overexpression of NECC2 resulted in a reduction of NGF-induced phosphorylation of the TrkA downstream effector extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2) but not of Akt. Altogether, our results identify NECC2 as a novel component of caveolae in PC12 cells and support the contribution of this protein in the maintenance of TrkA-mediated NGF signaling.</p>

			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>Neuroendocrine long coiled-coil protein 2, also referred to as Jakmip3, is the third and still uncharacterized member of a family of long coiled-coil, vertebrate-specific proteins composed of two additional members, Jakmip1/Marlin1 and NECC1/Jakmip2. Jakmip1/Marlin1 is predominantly expressed in neurons and lymphoid cells. In lymphocytes, Jakmip1 associates with microtubules and the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Tyk2 and Jak1 and has been proposed to participate in polarized secretion and segregation of signaling complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Jakmip1/Marlin1 associates with microtubules and the molecular motor kinesin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] in neurons, wherein it has been suggested to play a role in the maintenance of the structural organization of the Golgi apparatus and in cell morphogenesis and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Both <italic>Necc1</italic> and its ortholog, <italic>Necc2</italic>, are preferentially expressed in neuronal, neuroendocrine, and endocrine tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Specifically, NECC1 locates to the Golgi apparatus in neuroendocrine PC12 cells and controls the regulated release of secretory cargo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p>
			<p>Long coiled-coil proteins represent highly versatile molecules that exert a wide variety of essential functions in eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. They serve as tethering factors controlling the association of transport vesicles with target membranes as well as membrane pairing and fusion events. Long coiled-coil proteins have been also proposed to act as molecular scaffolds to maintain and organize intracellular compartments, including the nuclear envelope, the Golgi apparatus or the presynaptic active zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Given their ability to interact with multiple partners, these proteins have been suggested to integrate signals and transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Indeed, there is compelling evidence supporting the relevance of scaffolding factors in the organization of membrane microdomains specialized in transmembrane signalling, such as caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Caveolae are enriched in the integral membrane protein caveolin-1, and constitute localized platforms for downstream signaling of several tyrosine kinase receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Specifically, the high affinity neurotrophin receptor TrkA, as well as many of the intermediates involved in the TrkA signaling cascade, have been shown to locate to caveolae or to caveolae-like membranes in PC12 cells and in TrkA-transfected NIH-3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Remarkably, the presence of long coiled-coil proteins in caveolae has not been documented yet.</p>
			<p>Herein, we demonstrate that NECC2, whose expression and localization in PC12 cells is regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF), co-localizes with caveolin-1 and TrkA in the plasma membrane of these cells. Moreover, we show that both silencing and overexpression of <italic>Necc2</italic> impairs TrkA-dependent activation of extracellular-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2) without modifying TrkA-dependent Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, our data indicate that NECC2 is a novel component of caveolae in PC12 cells, and support a role for this protein as a molecular scaffold modulating NGF-mediated TrkA signal transduction.</p>

Alternatively spliced mRNAs would generate a short isoform of 844 amino acids containing the HR (98,7 kDa), and a 915 amino acids-isoform (106 kDa) containing an alternative C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which were indeed amplified using specific RT-PCR primers flanking the HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Specificity of the amplicons was assessed by PCR re-amplification analysis using internal RT-PCR primers for each transcript (nested PCR).</p>

				<p>Given the presence of two overlapping CBDs at the C-terminus of NECC2, we carried out double immunofluorescence in PC12 cells using antibodies against the caveolae marker, caveolin-1, and the anti-NECC2 antibody. Examination by confocal microscopy revealed a high degree of overlap between NECC2 and caveolin-1 at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Immunolabeling of NECC2 with the anti-NECC2-II antibody also showed a high degree of colocalization between NECC2 and caveolin-1 immunosignals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073668.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Moreover, NECC2 immunosignal also colocalized with cortical actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Pretreatment of PC12 cells with LatB significantly disrupted both cortical actin and caveolin-1 distribution at the plasma membrane. LatB treatment also prevented NECC2 localization to the cell periphery, leading to a loss of co-localization between NECC2 and caveolin-1 or actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
				<p>In contrast to that found for the endogenous protein, exogenous cMyc-tagged NECC2 accumulated in the perinuclear region of PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073668.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). These results are reminiscent of that previously reported for the <italic>Necc2</italic> ortholog, <italic>Necc1</italic>, which forms protein aggregates when transfected in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Likewise, we observed that caveolin-1 accumulated close to the nucleus when exogenously expressed in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073668.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), which is in accordance with previous reports in COS-7 and U2OS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

We next analyzed the distribution pattern of the deletion mutant of NECC2 lacking the HR domain (NECC2ΔHR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, NECC2ΔHR distributed at the cell surface, wherein it colocalized with caveolin-1. Intracellular accumulation of both proteins was also observed. A shorter truncated form of NECC2 (NECC2Δ372) containing the first 4 N-terminal coiled-coil regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) also partially overlapped with caveolin-1 at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the CBDs are not strictly required for localization of NECC2 to caveolae.</p>

				<p>To further characterize NECC2, we performed subcellular fractionation studies. Immunoblot analysis of cytosolic and crude membrane fractions from PC12 cells revealed that NECC2 protein is mostly distributed in the cytosol and, to a low extent, associates with membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). On the other hand, exogenous cMyc-NECC2 containing the HR domain was distributed in both fractions, with a higher content in membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We next investigated the type of association that NECC2 maintains with caveolae by using a detergent-free method to isolate caveolae membranes based in their “buoyant” properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, endogenous NECC2 or NECC2ΔHR did not co-migrate with caveolin-1 and TrkA to “buoyant” fractions.

				<p>The intracellular distribution of NECC2 during NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation was also investigated. Short-term treatment of PC12 cells with NGF (0-120 min) increased the association of NECC2 to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073668-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

			<title>Discussion</title>
			<p>Caveolae are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains, which, among other key functions, constitute specialized signaling platforms that allow physical localization and direct interaction of multiple types of receptors with their intracellular mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These specialized domains cluster a variety of specific proteins, including the structural proteins caveolins and cavins, along with several cytoskeletal proteins and scaffolding factors which are essential for caveolae formation, maintenance, and functional organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p>
			<p>Fluorescence microscopy using two different anti-NECC2 antibodies revealed that NECC2 co-localized with caveolin-1 at the cell surface of PC12 cells. NECC2 immunosignal was also closely associated with cortical actin, which has been shown to regulate the dynamics and localization of caveolin-1 in caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Accordingly, disruption of actin filaments by LatB treatment altered NECC2 distribution and decreased significantly the co-localization between NECC2 and both caveolin-1 and actin. In all, these observations indicated that NECC2 locates to caveolae in PC12 cells. These results were in line with our in silico analysis showing the presence of two CBD domains as well as four CRAC motifs in NECC2 sequence, which have been proposed to promote the incorporation of proteins into cholesterol-rich domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, recent data indicates that CBDs are not enriched among caveolin-binding proteins and, more importantly, that the interaction between CBDs and the scaffolding domain in caveolin-1 does not likely mediate caveolae-associated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In fact, our microscopy studies using truncated NECC2 variants support the notion that neither the CBDs nor the CRAC domains are required for the localization of NECC2 to caveolae. Alternatively, NECC2 targeting to caveolae might occur via the interaction of its coiled-coil domains with caveolae-resident proteins. In this regard, a role for coiled-coil domains in intracellular targeting has been reported for the long coiled-coil proteins associated to the Golgi apparatus, golgins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p>
			<p>Subcellular fractionation studies showed that endogenous NECC2 distributed mainly in the cytosol and, to a lesser extent, in membrane fractions. Detergent-free extraction of caveolae-enriched membranes and sucrose gradient fractionation analysis confirmed that both the endogenous protein and the NECC2 variant lacking the HR were located in non-buoyant fractions. However, full-length NECC2 containing the HR migrated to caveolae-enriched membrane fractions. These observations, which are consistent with the expression of several NECC2 variants in PC12 cells, suggest that NECC2 associates to caveolae membranes as an integral or a peripheral membrane protein depending on the presence or absence of the HR domain, respectively. In line with these findings, the family of long coiled-coil proteins ERC comprises two distinct members generated by alternative splicing, ERC1a and ERC1b, that differ in both their expression pattern and intracellular distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, whereas ERC1a is a cytosolic protein, ERC1b is both a cytosolic protein and an insoluble component of the active zone at the synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, golgins undergo disassociation/association cycles between the cytosol and Golgi membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Likewise, it has been shown that soluble cavin proteins peripherally attach to caveolae once they reach the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In this scenario, the NECC2 isoform lacking the HR might cycle between a soluble, cytosolic pool and the caveolae membrane, likely via its interaction with a caveolae-associated protein.</p>
			<p>Neurotrophic factor receptors have been found associated with lipid rafts in several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. It has been shown that TrkA receptor accumulation in lipid rafts facilitates receptor dimerization and transphosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Herein, we observed that NECC2 colocalized at the cell surface with the TrkA receptor, which has been located to caveolae in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (our unpublished observations). However, the extent of colocalization between NECC2 and TrkA varied in a time-dependent manner following NGF stimulation. Thus, this colocalization transiently decreased by 5 minutes of NGF stimulation, likely due to NGF-induced TrkA internalization, and increased subsequently to reach a maximum after 60 minutes of exposure to NGF. In line with this, it has been shown that, following NGF-evoked internalization, TrkA receptors are recycled back to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We observed that both the percentage of PC12 cells showing accumulated NECC2 at the plasma membrane and the amount of NECC2 immunosignal at the cell surface increased upon NGF exposure, suggesting that this factor induces the recruitment of NECC2 to cell surface microdomains. Similar results have been reported for the adaptor protein that is responsible of TrkA localization to lipid rafts, c-Cbl associated protein (CAP), which also moves to the cell surface following short-term NGF stimulation of PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p>
			<p>Our microscopic and biochemical findings suggested that NECC2 might regulate TrkA-mediated NGF signaling in caveolae. In support of this proposal are our functional studies showing that decreasing NECC2 content by shRNA-mediated (siRNA) silencing altered NGF-induced phosphorylation of the TrkA downstream effector ERK1/2. Remarkably, NECC2 silencing had no effect on NGF-induced activation of Akt, which is also mediated via NGF binding to TrkA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Overexpression of NECC2 mimicked the effects evoked by NECC2 silencing on both signaling routes. When viewed together, these data suggest that appropriate expression levels of NECC2 are required for proper TrkA activity and strongly support a role for this protein in the regulation of caveolae function. In addition, they suggest that, when overexpressed, NECC2 may display a dominant-negative effect, as it has been previously reported for other long coiled-coil proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Notably, it has been shown that overexpression of caveolin-1 functions as a dominant negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and impairs NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p>
			<p>Trafficking, sorting, and ubiquitination of ligand-activated TrkA receptors regulate the magnitude and duration of the intracellular response evoked by NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. It is well established that TrkA activation triggers a transient, short-term response (5 min) that involves the activation of both the PI3K/Akt and the ERK/MAPK pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Once in endosomes, TrkA induces the selective activation of ERKs via the small GTPase Rap1 and B-Raf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In our study, we observed that changes in NECC2 expression levels impaired sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to NGF treatment, without affecting NGF-induced Akt activation. Similar results have been depicted for several TrkA-related signaling adapter proteins located to lipid rafts, such as FRS2 and ARMS/kidins220 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In particular, both FRS2 and ARMS/kidins220 are involved in the formation of the signalling complex Crk-C3G, which is responsible of targeting NGF signaling to Rap1-ERKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Crk possesses SH3 and SH2 domains, which are essential for its interaction with ARMS/kidins220 and FRS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Interestingly, NECC2 possesses a proline-rich motif (PXXP), which is considered a target domain for proteins containing SH3-type motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Given this and the structural features conferred by the coiled-coil domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], together with our functional data, it is tempting to speculate that NECC2 might act as a scaffolding factor facilitating the interaction of the signaling molecules responsible of NGF-dependent persistent ERK activation. Alternatively, NECC2 could play a role in TrkA compartmentalization and/or trafficking towards the endosomal system by acting as a tethering factor. In line with this proposal, golgins have been shown to facilitate sorting and membrane trafficking across the Golgi apparatus by regulating membrane-membrane and membrane-cytoskeleton tethering events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Likewise, the long coiled-coil proteins liprins and ERC2/CAST, which are located to the cytomatrix at the active zone of synapses, act as regulators of membrane fusion events and stabilize these membrane microdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Interestingly, NECC2 distributed in neurites and growth cones in differentiated PC12 cells, wherein it largely colocalized with caveolin-1. It has been reported that caveolin-1 recruits synaptic components and regulates signal transduction of a variety of neurotransmitter and neurotrophic receptors in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], thus suggesting its participation in synapse maturation and/or remodelation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. In this scenario, a general role for NECC2 as organizer of membrane microdomains specialized in signal transduction seems plausible.</p>
			<p>In sum, our data are the first to demonstrate the presence of a long coiled-coil protein, NECC2, in caveolae, and to identify a potential regulatory role for this protein in the control of the NGF-TrkA system in PC12 cells.</p>
