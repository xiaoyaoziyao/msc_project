        <p>The characterization of bacterial communities using DNA sequencing has revolutionized our ability to study microbes in nature and discover the ways in which microbial communities affect ecosystem functioning and human health. Here we describe Serial Illumina Sequencing (SI-Seq): a method for deep sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using next-generation sequencing technology. SI-Seq serially sequences portions of the V5, V6 and V7 hypervariable regions from barcoded 16S rRNA amplicons using an Illumina short-read genome analyzer. SI-Seq obtains taxonomic resolution similar to 454 pyrosequencing for a fraction of the cost, and can produce hundreds of thousands of reads per sample even with very high multiplexing. We validated SI-Seq using single species and mock community controls, and via a comparison to cystic fibrosis lung microbiota sequenced using 454 FLX Titanium. Our control runs show that SI-Seq has a dynamic range of at least five orders of magnitude, can classify &gt;96% of sequences to the genus level, and performs just as well as 454 and paired-end Illumina methods in estimation of standard microbial ecology diversity measurements. We illustrate the utility of SI-Seq in a pilot sample of central airway secretion samples from cystic fibrosis patients.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Microbes inhabit all environments on earth and contribute to ecosystem function in ways that are only vaguely understood. Decades of culture-based study have provided a solid foundation for our understanding of microbial physiology, genetics, and evolution, but investigations of microbial ecology have been notoriously difficult due to the small size and vast diversity of microbes. Recent developments of culture-independent methods have illuminated the microbial ecosystems that are found in terrestrial and aquatic environments, as well as those intimately associated with organisms. Of particular interest are microbial ecosystems within the human body (the human microbiome), as they are expected to profoundly impact human health and disease. For example, bacterial communities within human intestines are being studied for their effects on atopic and bowel diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Cho1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Robinson1">[2]</xref>, and altered structure of bacterial communities in the vagina is associated with susceptibility to a plethora of diseases including bacterial vaginosis and sexually transmitted infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Wilson1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The development of next-generation sequencing technology has enabled the large-scale investigation of microbial communities and stimulated broad interest in microbiota research. Similar to earlier studies that relied on Sanger sequencing, most of the next-generation microbiota studies have focused on a portion of the taxonomically informative 16S rRNA gene. 454 pyrosequencing was the first and is still the dominant next-generation sequencing technology applied to microbiota research because it can produce reads of sufficient length for appreciable taxonomic resolution. This need for adequate read length has generally hampered the use of Illumina sequencing by synthesis technologies that produce shorter reads despite the fact that the vastly higher throughput of the Illumina systems would enable much deeper and cost-effective sampling. Several groups have circumvented this problem by overlapping Illumina reads produced by paired-end sequencing (sequencing reads produced from opposite ends of the same template) to provide longer sequence albeit at the cost of decreased taxonomic resolution due to the unavoidable sequencing of the two highly conserved primer-binding regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Bartram1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Caporaso1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Degnan1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Gloor1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Lazarevic1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Zhou1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we propose 16S rRNA gene-based community analysis by Serial Illumina Sequencing (SI-Seq), which provides a taxonomic resolution similar to 454 pyrosequencing with the throughput and cost-effectiveness of Illumina sequencing. SI-Seq is able to get the best of both technologies by adapting Illumina sequencing technology to read three hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Here we describe the development of SI-Seq, its validation using single species controls and a mock community, and its comparison to 454 FLX 16S rRNA sequencing of 56 sputum samples collected from Cystic Fibrosis patients.</p>

        <p>We sequenced the V5 through V7 region of the 16S rRNA locus to balance taxonomic resolution with fragment size restrictions imposed by Illumina sequencing technology. PCR amplicons of ∼300 bp were generated by amplification of the 16S rRNA gene using bacterial universal primers with 5′ barcodes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045791-t001">Table 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045791.s003">Table S1</xref>). These amplification products were pooled and libraries were prepared for SI-Seq Illumina sequencing as described in the Materials and Methods. The resulting SI-Seq library consisted of templates with 16S rRNA V5–V7 amplicons flanked by the barcoded universal 16S rRNA PCR primers flanked by the standard Illumina paired-end adaptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It is important to recognize that each individual SI-Seq template has the potential to bind to the flowcell in either the V5–V7 orientation or the V7–V5 orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>As discussed in the Methods section, the SI-Seq library was serially sequenced using multiple template-specific primer sets. The first sequencing step used the standard Illumina sequencing primer to sequence off the Illumina adaptors and into the barcode attached at the 5′ end of the 16S rRNA PCR primers. After eight cycles, this sequencing primer was removed by denaturation and replaced with a mix of V5 and V7 sequencing primers. These primers hybridize in conserved 16S rRNA regions just outside of the appropriate hypervariable regions and sequence into the hypervariable regions. Sequencing was performed with these primers for 36 cycles and followed by another round of denaturation and the addition of two distinct V6 sequencing primers [V6+953 (V6a) and V6-976 (V6b)]. The V6 sequencing primers hybridize to two conserved regions on opposite sides of the V6 hypervariable region and sequence into the V6 region from both orientations. After another round of sequencing, the two V6 primers were removed by denaturation and the clusters were flipped and regenerated using the Illumina pair-end sequencing protocol. After pair-end cluster generation the entire process was repeated by serially sequencing with the Illumina barcode primer, the V5 and V7 primers, and finally the two V6 primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Overall, a total of six sequencing steps were performed with 144 nucleotides read from the 16S rRNA locus (4 sequencing steps of 36 cycles each) and the eight nucleotide barcode read twice. The primers used and specific number of cycles performed can be easily altered to fit specific needs.</p>
        <p>SI-Seq data is generated in two possible orientations depending on how the template binds to the flowcell. The first orientation is barcode:V5:V6a for read one of the pair and barcode:V7:V6b for read two, while the second orientation is the reverse with barcode:V7:V6b for read one and barcode:V5:V6a for read two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These two orientations can be distinguished by a rapid UBLAST analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Edgar1">[15]</xref> as described in the Materials and Methods.</p>
        <p>To compare SI-Seq to other commonly used 16S rRNA sequencing protocols (e.g., 454 and Illumina Paired-End), we simulated reads of varying lengths using published primer sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Bartram1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Caporaso1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Dethlefsen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Sogin1">[13]</xref>. From these simulated reads we calculated the proportion of reads that could be assigned to the genus level using the RDP Classifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Wang1">[14]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g002">Figure 2</xref>, SI-Seq and 454 were similar in their ability to produce a high proportion of reads that could be assigned to the genus level. These data indicate that SI-Seq is in theory comparable to 454 in its ability to produce reads with enough sequence variation for good taxonomic assignment, yet being Illumina-based, produces over 100-fold more reads at similar cost.</p>

        <p>Filtering the sequences to obtain the optimal dataset is a balance between retaining too many sequences of poor quality that may give erroneous taxonomic classifications in order to favor dataset size (type I error) versus discarding too many moderate quality sequences in order to favor dataset quality (type II error).

        <p>We calculated the rate of taxonomic classification error by calculating the number of SI-Seq sequences whose taxonomy was inconsistent with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.

Our control community consisted of genomic DNA from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic>, and <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> that were mixed at abundances that differed from each other by an order of magnitude. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the observed taxon abundances were nearly identical to those expected. Furthermore, we were able to detect taxon abundances that ranged over five orders of magnitude. The taxon of lowest abundance, <italic>B. cepacia</italic>, had only 120 pg of total genomic DNA added to the original pool, of which less than 1,000<sup>th</sup> of which would be 16S rRNA; thus, the reliable detection of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> in all separate barcoded samples verifies the repeatability and sensitivity of SI-Seq.</p>

        <title>Comparison of SI-Seq to 454 FLX Titanium</title>
        <p>To further validate SI-Seq, we sequenced 56 sputum samples collected from CF patients using both SI-Seq and 454 FLX Titanium. Samples for both platforms were taken from the same PCR stock to ensure no PCR bias. Sequence reads from 454 and SI-Seq were filtered for quality and de-barcoded either using QIIME (454) or a pipeline developed in-house (SI-Seq) (as described in Materials and Methods). The range of sequences obtained per sample differed substantially between the two sequencing approaches: between 478 and 11,405 quality reads were obtained using 454, whereas between 38,120 and 859,764 quality reads were obtained using SI-Seq (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045791-t002">Table 2</xref>). The average length for the 454 reads was 415nt, with 33% of the reads shorter than the average. A rarefaction sampling analysis indicated that the number of reads obtained for each patient sample saturated the community diversity in all cases for the SI-Seq data and in most cases for the 454 data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Both rarefaction analyses suggest that ∼1,000 sequences would be sufficient for characterizing the majority of bacteria present in these CF lung communities. The saturation of community diversity with such low read numbers indicates that a much higher degree of multiplexing would further reduce per patient sequencing costs without reducing community information.</p>

        <p>To compare within sample diversity estimates from 454 and SI-Seq communities, we calculated alpha diversity (Phylogenetic Diversity) on rarefied OTU tables (454: 478 reads per patient; SI-Seq: 38,120 reads per patient). It is important to use rarefied data to normalize the number of sequences per sample; this is because samples with greater sequencing depth are expected to have higher diversity due to sequence coverage alone. Alpha diversity metrics from 454 and SI-Seq data were significantly correlated (Spearman's rho: 0.90; P&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

        <p>We used the RDP Classifier to determine the number of reads from each approach that could be classified down to the genus level. Quite strikingly, an average of only 56% of 454 reads were classified to the genus level, while 95% of SI-Seq reads carried this resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045791-t003">Table 3</xref>). Trimming the 454 reads to include only those regions sequenced by SI-Seq increased this percentage to 61%. Separate quality filtering and processing of raw reads using Mothur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Schloss1">[17]</xref> increased the percentage of reads assigned at the genus level to 85%. These results support previously published findings showing that the 454 platform has a substantially higher error rate than the Illumina platform, particularly when generating only very short Illumina reads as is done in the SI-Seq protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Glenn1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Luo1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Minoche1">[21]</xref>.</p>

        <p>To determine whether the high proportion of genus level assignments for the SI-Seq data were the result of incorrect high-confidence classifications due to the short SI-Seq read length, we compared the classifications of the single species control data generated by 454 and SI-Seq runs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045791-t003">Table 3</xref>). We also used multiple versions of the reference database to ensure that the database structure did not bias the results, including full length reference sequences, reference sequences trimmed to 400 bp starting at our V5 primer, and SI-Seq formatted reference sequences. When classifying each dataset with the appropriately formatted reference database, this analysis remarkably showed that 91% of reads from the single species control (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1) were correctly classified with SI-Seq data compared to only 16% of the 454 data.</p>
        <p>We compared the 454 and SI-Seq community profiles visually and statistically to verify their similarities. We first compared the per-sample distribution of bacterial orders obtained from the 454 and SI-Seq OTU tables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Despite differing sequencing methods, OTU clustering thresholds, and taxonomy classification approaches, the composition of each community for each sample was remarkably similar between the 454 and SI-Seq datasets. We next tested for statistical significance using a Procrustes analyses to determine whether the OTU dissimilarity matrices obtained from each approach were statistically indistinguishable. We applied a variety of distance metrics and found that the match between community profiles generated by 454 and SI-Seq were highly significant regardless of the dissimilarity matrix used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045791-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045791.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

            <p>Note that the relative taxonomic structure of the communities inferred for each sample are nearly identical using the two methods, although SI-Seq generates ∼100-times more data, thereby permitting a higher level of resolution and larger dynamic range. Data is based on OTUs collapsed to the order level using the MEGAN ver4 software package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Huson1">[35]</xref>. Sample IDs are presented in the center of the figure. Relative abundance of bacterial orders for each sample are presented in mirror order for SI-Seq on the left and 454 on the right. The color code for each bacterial order is presented on the bottom. The number of reads (sequences) for each sample are presented on either side.</p>

        <title>Application of SI-Seq to study the ecology of the CF lung</title>
        <p>To demonstrate the utility of SI-Seq, we performed additional analyses on the CF sputum samples to begin our investigation of CF lung ecology, although a more in depth analysis of this subject will be completed in the future with a larger patient cohort.</p>
        <p>We used a Species Accumulation curve to determine if the bacterial diversity observed in our patient cohort represented the overall bacterial diversity present in CF lungs. This approach measures how many new OTUs are identified as additional samples are cumulatively added to the analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, the number of OTUs increased quickly between 0 and 20 samples, and began to plateau by the end of our sampling; this indicated that we have largely saturated the diversity found in this environment. Many of the OTUs detected with increased sputum sampling were rare, as reduction of the dataset to include only those OTUs with a total abundance greater than 0.001 resulted in a plateau around 25 sputum samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>

        <p>We also performed SI-Seq on ten samples extracted from mucus plugs obstructing the airways of lungs surgically removed from CF lung transplant patients, and combined these results with those from the 56 sputa discussed above. Clustering of community profiles from these two sample types indicated substantial overlap in community composition of sputum and lung airway samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). The heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g009">Figure 9A</xref> shows three types of patient samples: (1) those with only <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>; (2) those with predominantly <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with additional minor constituents; and (3) those with little or no <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, but either a diversity of other bacterial species or a community dominated by <italic>Streptococcus</italic> or <italic>Burkholderia</italic>. The ten airway samples were evenly divided among these three groups. Despite this similarity, a principal components analysis using weighted UniFrac dissimilarities showed a separation of the sputum and lung airway samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). This suggests that when phylogenetic distance is taken into account (as was done with the weighted UniFrac but not the Euclidean distance based heatmap), sputum and airway samples slightly differ in their microbiota.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Targeted sequencing of taxonomically informative regions of the 16S rRNA gene has been instrumental in describing and comparing microbial communities and ecosystems. Associating changes in these microbiota with disease etiology or ecosystem function requires a method that fulfills the following criteria: good taxonomic resolution; deep enough sequencing to ensure community saturation; and a cost that permits multiple biological replicates and fine temporal or spatial sampling. Our side-by-side comparison of 454 and SI-Seq profiling of single species controls and CF sputum samples revealed the superiority of SI-Seq regarding each of these criteria; below we discuss these in turn.</p>
      <p>SI-Seq profiling permits as good or better taxonomic resolution as 454 profiling. Analysis of CF communities using the RDP Classifier found that a maximum of 85% of the 454 reads were classified to the genus level, compared to 95% of SI-Seq reads. This result seems counter-intuitive since the 454 reads are substantially longer than SI-Seq reads. However, highly conserved regions are included in the 454 reads and these regions do not segregate for sufficient or appropriate genetic variation to discriminate genera. SI-Seq passes over these highly conserved regions and reads only hypervariable regions that permit greater taxonomic resolution.</p>
      <p>An additional factor affecting taxonomic resolution is the error profiles of the two platforms. It is well established that the 454 platform has an approximately 10-fold higher error rate compared to the Illumina platform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Glenn1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Luo1">[20]</xref>, and most Illumina sequencing errors are generated in later cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Minoche1">[21]</xref>. Because SI-Seq uses only very short reads, it generates data with an extremely low error rate. This conclusion is supported by our classifications of CF microbiome reads trimmed to match the SI-Seq format, which allowed direct comparisons of 454 and SI-Seq on real samples using the same data format and the same reference database; this trimming only increased the percent of reads assigned to genus by 5% (from 56% to 61%). The substantial difference that remains between 454 and SI-Seq (61% vs. 95% of reads classified to the genus level, respectively) can only be explained by sequencing error (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045791-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our analyses of both control and real samples show that bacterial communities profiled using the two approaches were significantly correlated, even though different parameters were used for OTU clustering, different reference databases were used for taxonomic classification, and different reference trees were used for phylogeny-based diversity metrics. The convergence of these sequencing methods and analysis pipelines on a similar picture of the CF lung community speaks to SI-Seq being a robust method.</p>
      <p>In addition to superior taxonomic resolution, SI-Seq provides a major cost advantage relative to 454 by producing over 100-fold more data per dollar. Clearly though, it is a unique and more complicated protocol, which requires the careful addition of multiple sequencing primers during the sequencing run and additional data processing steps to deal with the structured reads. Nevertheless, the incredibly high throughput of the Illumina platform provides a compelling case for using SI-Seq. Assuming that the Illumina GA-IIx and MiSeq platforms can sequence 40M and 15M templates per channel per run, respectively; SI-Seq should produce over 400K or 150K reads per sample when using 96-fold multiplexing per channel. Importantly, pooling of SI-Seq samples is performed after PCR, but prior to sample preparation, cluster generation and sequencing; therefore, only one pooled-sample needs to be carried through the sample preparation protocol for all of the sequencing. The net result is that the cost of performing high-multiplex SI-Seq is in the range of tens of dollars per sample, while still obtaining as many as 400K sequences per sample. Multiplexing can be increased for simpler communities (such as the CF lung) if lower depth coverage is needed, or if amplicons are run on machines with higher throughput, such as the Illumina HiSeq.</p>
      <p>Paired-end Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene has been proposed by a number of authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Bartram1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Caporaso1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Degnan1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Gloor1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Lazarevic1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Zhou1">[9]</xref>, particularly since the Illumina MiSeq can currently produce read lengths of 150nt, and are expected to reach 250nt within the next couple of years. While these approaches have great merit, they have some of the same issues as 454, namely: they are forced to sequence through conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene; they have a higher error rate since the reads are longer and error rates increase dramatically near the end of long Illumina reads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Minoche1">[21]</xref> (with the caveat that some Illumina-based methods overlap the ends of the two paired-reads to reduce the overall error); and they cost more per reaction and take longer to run due to the fixed cost and time accrued per Illumina sequencing cycle. SI-Seq, as described here, runs in 144 total cycles, while Illumina-based microbiome approaches need at least 144nt paired-end runs (288 total cycles) to get taxonomic resolution similar to 454 and SI-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045791-g002">Figure 2</xref>). So while paired-end Illumina approaches are initially simpler to apply than SI-Seq, they cost at least twice as much per sample and take twice as long to run.</p>
      <p>While this study focuses on the interrogation of the V5, V6 and V7 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA locus, it should be clear that any region or locus can be analyzed by SI-Seq if appropriate PCR and sequencing primers can be designed. Additionally, the methods can be easily adapted to sequence even larger numbers of regions or provide longer reads for each region. In general, SI-Seq has many potential applications, including targeted re-sequencing of amplicons for SNP detection and multilocus sequence analysis.</p>
      <p>Our study of the CF lung microbiota indicated that SI-Seq produces results consistent with laboratory culture and the published literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Armougom1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Bittar1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Cox1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Guss1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Han1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Harris1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-KlepacCeraj1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Rogers1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Sibley1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Sibley2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-vanderGast1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Han2">[33]</xref>. This very preliminary analysis reveals some distinction between samples collected from the CF sputum and those collected from airway mucus plugs from explanted lungs. Sampling the microbiota present in mucus plugs is important for determining whether some taxa are truly present in the lower airways, or present in the more commonly sampled sputa because of contamination from upper airway bacteria during sputum expectoration (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045791-Lipuma1">[34]</xref>). However, our results show that anaerobes are indeed present within the lower airways, as mucus plugs from one patient's airways contained <italic>Veillonella, Parvimonas</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus anginosus</italic>, The DNA from these anaerobes was in low abundance, and likely to only be detectable using a method like SI-Seq that offers a great depth of coverage; nevertheless, its presence suggests anaerobic bacteria are within the lower airways of CF patients, and not merely oropharangeal contaminants of sputum. Further analysis will assess the role of these anaerobes in relation to other bacteria present, and the clinical status, antibiotic therapy, and genotype on a larger sample of CF patients.</p>
      <p>Although here we describe the use of SI-Seq for characterizing relatively simple CF communities, additional work shows that the approach easily generates sufficient sequence coverage to thoroughly examine more complex communities such as mouse or human feces, house dust, and saliva (unpublished). We believe SI-Seq will be generally applicable to any microbiota. It can be readily adapted by designing primers to target different regions of the 16S rRNA gene, or different loci altogether. This flexibility also opens the possibility of using SI-Seq to study eukaryotic microbes and Archaea.</p>
