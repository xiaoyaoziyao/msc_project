          <title>Background</title>
          <p>According to the endosymbiont hypothesis, the mitochondrial system for aerobic respiration was derived from an ancestral Alphaproteobacterium. Phylogenetic studies indicate that the mitochondrial ancestor is most closely related to the Rickettsiales. Recently, it was suggested that <italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter ubique, a member of the SAR11 clade that is highly abundant in the oceans, is a sister taxon to the mitochondrial-Rickettsiales clade. The availability of ocean metagenome data substantially increases the sampling of Alphaproteobacteria inhabiting the oxygen-containing waters of the oceans that likely resemble the originating environment of mitochondria.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We present a phylogenetic study of the origin of mitochondria that incorporates metagenome data from the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition. We identify mitochondrially related sequences in the GOS dataset that represent a rare group of Alphaproteobacteria, designated OMAC (Oceanic Mitochondria Affiliated Clade) as the closest free-living relatives to mitochondria in the oceans. In addition, our analyses reject the hypothesis that the mitochondrial system for aerobic respiration is affiliated with that of the SAR11 clade.</p>

          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Our results allude to the existence of an alphaproteobacterial clade in the oxygen-rich surface waters of the oceans that represents the closest free-living relative to mitochondria identified thus far. In addition, our findings underscore the importance of expanding the taxonomic diversity in phylogenetic analyses beyond that represented by cultivated bacteria to study the origin of mitochondria.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mitochondria are eukaryotic organelles for aerobic respiration, thought to have originated sometime after the rise of oceanic and atmospheric oxygen levels roughly about 2.0×10<sup>9</sup> years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Canfield1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Kump1">[2]</xref>. Early phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal RNA and of components in the respiratory chain complexes suggested that the mitochondrion was derived from an Alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Gray1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Yang1">[4]</xref>. Consistently, comparative genomics analyses have identified aerobic respiration as ancestrally present in both the Alphaproteobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Boussau1">[5]</xref> and the proto-mitochondrion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Gabaldon1">[6]</xref>. However, despite extensive debate, there is no consensus about the identities and characteristics of the partners involved in the endosymbiotic association.</p>
      <p>On the host-side, the debate has focused on the extent to which the origin of mitochondria coincides with the emergence of eukaryotes. Several mutually incompatible models have been proposed. One suggests that the host was a relatively complex eukaryote, as explicitly stated in the Archezoa hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-CavalierSmith1">[7]</xref>. A counter-argument raised against this model is that ancestrally amitochondriate eukaryotes have never been found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Embley1">[8]</xref>. Other models, such as the Hydrogen hypothesis, favour an archaeal methanogenic host that evolved into a eukaryotic cell upon the acquisition of mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Martin1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>On the endosymbiont side, discussions have centred on the metabolic capability transferred to the host and the phylogenetic placement of the lineage from which the mitochondrial endosymbiont emerged. Since subunits of key enzymes of the respiratory chain complexes are encoded by all mitochondrial genomes and homologs are present in most of the sequenced alphaproteobacterial genomes, attempts to elucidate the origin of mitochondria have mostly focused on the system for aerobic respiration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Andersson1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Kurland1">[12]</xref>. A few ribosomal proteins are encoded by some mitochondrial genomes and these have also been used to trace the mitochondrial ancestry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Esser1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Fitzpatrick1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>With the number of complete genome sequences from alphaproteobacterial species steadily growing, several recent studies have re-examined the placement of mitochondria in relation to contemporary alphaproteobacterial species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Esser1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Williams1">[15]</xref>. Phylogenetic analyses of concatenated protein alignments have suggested that mitochondria are affiliated with the Rickettsiales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Fitzpatrick1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Williams1">[15]</xref>, an obligate intracellular clade with members that are well adapted to the cytosol of both metazoa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Darby1">[16]</xref> and protozoa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Beier1">[17]</xref>. However, phylogenetic analyses of single proteins have indicated different placements of mitochondria in relation to the Rickettsiales, as seen for example in a study of the mitochondrial phylome of <italic>Reclinomonas americana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Esser1">[13]</xref>. Of the single proteins analyzed, some indicated a placement of the mitochondria outside the Alphaproteobacteria, others as a sister-group to the Rickettsiales and the remaining suggested that they diverged within or represents a sister-group to the clade consisting of Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirilalles, Caulobacterales and Sphingomonadales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Esser1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A possible underlying reason for the difficulty in determining the specific placement of mitochondria in the alphaproteobacterial tree might involve unbalanced taxon sampling, as the current collection of completely sequenced genomes, including those of Alphaproteobacteria, is heavily biased towards medically and agriculturally relevant species. As such, the current sampling does not extensively cover the taxonomic diversity of species that inhabit environments in which mitochondria might have originated, such as the oxygen-producing marine photic zone. Given that Alphaproteobacteria are extremely common in these habitats with members of the SAR11 clade representing 30–40% of total cell counts in the oceans, it is of interest to examine the relationship between mitochondria and oceanic Alphaproteobacteria.</p>
      <p>The SAR11 group of bacteria plays an important role in the oceanic carbon cycle. These bacteria have small cell volumes and grow slowly. The genome of <italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter ubique has recently been sequenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Giovannoni1">[18]</xref> and it currently is the only published genome from a species belonging to the SAR11 clade. The <italic>Ca.</italic> Pelagibacter ubique genome is 1.3 Mb in size and, with an average intergenic space of only 3 basepairs, it is one of the most compact of all bacterial genomes sequenced to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Giovannoni1">[18]</xref>. Interestingly, the first and only phylogeny inferred so far from a concatenated protein alignment that includes <italic>Ca.</italic> Pelagibacter ubique along with mitochondria and 71 other alphaproteobacterial species has identified <italic>Ca.</italic> Pelagibacter ubique as a sister-species to the clade encompassing mitochondria and the Rickettsiales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Williams1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In light of the points discussed above, a better sampling of oceanic bacteria might help to determine the nature of the mitochondrial progenitor. The largest marine metagenomic sequencing initiative performed to date, the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Rusch1">[19]</xref> uncovered more than 6 million genes from the ocean surface waters, of which at least one third, perhaps up to as much as half, can be attributed to alphaproteobacterial species. Based on analysis of ribosomal RNA abundance, SAR11 is by far the most abundant alphaproteobacterial clade in this dataset, while other alphaproteobacterial orders such as SAR116 and Rhodobacterales (which includes the Roseobacter clade) are also well represented in the oceanic surface waters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Biers1">[20]</xref>. A clustering analysis of proteorhodopsin sequences affiliated with <italic>Ca.</italic> Pelagibacter ubique indicated extensive genetic diversity within this lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Rusch1">[19]</xref>. Thus, the GOS data set provides the most comprehensive and diverse collection of SAR11 sequences to date.</p>
      <p>The aim of this study was to examine the evolutionary relationship of aerobic respiration in mitochondria in relation to the homologous systems in oceanic bacteria. We have used a phylogenomic framework to select suitable marker genes for inferring the phylogenetic relationship of Alphaproteobacteria and mitochondria, and to extract an include alphaproteobacterial orthologs from the GOS database in the analysis. This approach resulted in the identification of sequences from oceanic bacteria that seemed to be more closely related to the mitochondrial progenitor than previously recognized bacteria. In addition, we show that the SAR11 clade is not a sister-clade to the Rickettsiales-mitochondria clade, as was suggested by previous studies.</p>

        <title>Marker Gene Selection for Inferring the Phylogenetic Affiliation of Mitochondria and Alphaproteobacteria</title>
        <p>The starting point for our analysis was the mitochondrial proteome of the freshwater protist <italic>Reclinomonas americana</italic>, defined as the protein sequences that are encoded by its mitochondrial genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Lang1">[21]</xref> (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024457-g001">Figure 1</xref> for overview). First a reference dataset was composed for each protein of this proteome by extracting orthologous protein sequences from a set of 28 alphaproteobacterial genomes and up to 18 mitochondrial genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024457.s006">Table S1</xref>). To check for phylogenetic coherence in the reference data sets and to exclude protein datasets in which phylogenetic signals were potentially obscured by horizontal gene transfer events, multiple sequence alignments of the individual protein sequences in the reference datasets were generated and phylogenetic trees were inferred using PhyML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Guindon1">[22]</xref>. Only those datasets in which the mitochondrial sequences formed a monophyletic group and in which the Alphaproteobacteria formed a monophyletic group were retained.</p>

            <p>The flow scheme depicted here displays which datasets have been used and how they were analysed (for more details, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Three different datasets have been used, being the COG database (taken from STRING <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-vonMering1">[40]</xref>; “COG”, orange shading), the GOS database (“GOS”, blue shading), and a local database of proteins that are encoded by mitochondrial genomes (‘MT’, green shading). First, homologs were retrieved for each of the 67 proteins encoded by the <italic>R. americana</italic> mitochondrial genome for each of these datasets using BlastP searches. Next, paralogs and distant homologs were removed from the retrieved GOS and MT hits by performing BlastP searches against the COG database and using stringent cut-off filters. Since the amounts of retrieved GOS homologs was too high for Bayesian analyses, two strategies were used for down-sampling: One approach involved a pruning step in which the amount of GOS homologs was reduced while reducing the phylogenetic diversity, another approach involved the targeted sub-sampling of GOS sequences that were placed as a neighbour to the mitochondrial clade in a jack-knifing screen (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref> for details). Then, the MT and COG datasets were combined and subjected to phylogenetic analysis (PhyML), selecting only those proteins whose evolutionary history was evolutionary coherent (i.e. Alphaproteobacteria formed one clade, and mitochondria formed one clade). The resulting protein datasets are referred to as the ‘reference datasets’. The reference datasets were used for three independent analyses: (i) Proteins of the reference dataset were concatenated and subjected to Bayesian analysis; Proteins of the reference dataset were either combined with the pruned (ii) or sub-sampled (iii) GOS datasets, followed by Bayesian analysis.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Ten datasets that fulfilled these criteria were selected for a more detailed phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian methods. These data sets included an essential enzyme of the citric acid cycle (SDH2), subunits of the ATP synthase complex (ATP1, ATP3) and components of each of the three energy-coupling sites of the respiratory chain: (i) the NADH dehydrogenase complex (NAD7, NAD8), (ii) the cytochrome <italic>bc</italic>1 complex (COB) and (iii) the cytochrome oxidase complex (COX1, COX2, COX3). For comparisons with bacteria without systems for oxidative phosphorylation, we also included ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2). These genes are present in most alphaproteobacterial genomes, although COX1, COX2 and COX3 have been lost independently from <italic>Rhodospirillilum rubrum</italic>, <italic>Gluconobacter oxydans</italic>, <italic>Zymononas mobilis</italic> and Bartonellaceae species. However, for each of the major alphaproteobacterial orders, a homolog was available for each of the 10 selected reference datasets, making the datasets comparable.</p>
        <p>The subsequent Bayesian inference showed that of these 10 reference datasets, the COX1, COB and NAD7 proteins provided the highest support for the divergences of the deeper nodes and grouped the taxa into the six major alphaproteobacterial orders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024457.s001">Figures S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024457.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024457.s003">S3</xref>). To examine the influence of sequence heterogeneity among lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Belfiore1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Yang2">[34]</xref> on our different protein data sets, we calculated the frequencies of amino acids coded solely by AT- and GC-codons in these species. Whereas a control dataset consisting of ribosomal proteins showed large variations in amino acid composition patterns among species, suggestive of mutational biases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024457.s004">Figure S4</xref>), the COX1, COB and NAD7 proteins were robust to such biases, displaying only a few percent differences in amino acid frequencies between the most AT- and GC-rich lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024457.s007">Table S2</xref>). Hence, the latter observation suggests that phylogenies based on these sequences are likely to be less influenced by base composition biases. In conclusion, the monophyly of mitochondria, the resolution of the deeper nodes into six major alphaproteobacterial orders and the lack of base composition biases suggest that COX1, COB and NAD7 are particularly suitable for phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial origins.</p>

        <p>In order to exploit the taxonomic diversity in the GOS dataset for a study of the evolutionary relationship of mitochondria with bacteria from the ocean upper surface waters, we extracted full-length GOS sequences that produced significant best hits (BlastP, E-value&lt;1*10<sup>−10</sup> and &gt;50% HSP overlap to the query protein) to the <italic>R. americana</italic> mitochondrial protein sequences through a series of subsequent filtering steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024457-g001">Figure 1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref> for details). The number of retrieved GOS sequences per protein differed markedly, ranging from several hundred to a few thousand sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024457.s008">Table S3</xref>). The observed differences in abundance are mainly the result of differences in gene length as well as anticipated differences in phylogenetic distribution patterns among different bacterial groups. For example, the short, universal RPS2 genes are much more abundant in the GOS dataset than COX1 genes, which are much longer and have a limited phylogenetic distribution.</p>
        <p>To get a rough estimate of the diversity of the retrieved sequences in relation to previous analyses of the diversity in the GOS metagenome data set, neighbour-joining trees including all sequences extracted from the GOS database were produced. As expected, for all genes, the dominant fraction of extracted sequences was affiliated with the SAR11 clade. For example, of the alphaproteobacterial RPS2 homologs extracted in our study, the vast majority, 82.5%, were tentatively associated with this clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024457-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Other main alphaproteobacterial clades were less well represented, with Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Rhizobiales and Rickettsiales containing only 9.3%, 7.4%, 0.6% and 0.2% of the alphaproteobacterial GOS sequences, respectively. None of the extracted RPS2 homologs were affiliated with Sphingomonodales or Caulobacterales.</p>

            <p>A phylogenetic analysis of 1641 GOS RPS2 homologs reveals that the taxonomic sampling is increased for most major bacterial clades, and specifically for the Alphaproteobacteria. The vast majority (82.5%) of the extracted RPS2 homologs that are placed in the Alphaproteobacteria is associated with the SAR11 clade, which includes <italic>Ca.</italic> Pelagibacter ubique. Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Rhizobiales and Rickettsiales are associated with 9.3, 7.4, 0.6 and 0.2% of the GOS sequences, respectively. The sequence data covered by the GOS dataset greatly increases the previous sampling of the SAR11-clade, as well as of other oceanic bacteria that lack sequenced representatives, thereby representing a rich source of sequences useful for examining the placement of mitochondria in relation to bacteria adapted to the upper surface waters of the oceans. For clarity, all GOS clades have been collapsed. Annotation of collapsed GOS clades is as follows: <italic>l</italic> and <italic>n</italic> represent the total branch length and the number of GOS sequences within collapsed GOS clades, respectively, and shading is according to the total branch length of the clade as indicated.</p>

        <p>The estimated diversity of the extracted GOS sequences is in good agreement with a recent survey of GOS sequence diversity as inferred by ribotyping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Biers1">[20]</xref>, except that our estimated abundance of Rhodospirillales (7.4%) is significantly higher than reported in the previous study (1.2%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Biers1">[20]</xref>. The observed discrepancy is probably caused by the fact that no reference species with a sequenced genome were available at the time of our analysis from the relatively abundant SAR116 cluster, which is distantly related to Rhodospirillales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Stingl1">[35]</xref>. As a result, SAR116-derived RPS2 homologs present in the GOS data have most likely been accounted as Rhodospirillales sequences in our study. Consistently, the SAR116 clade represents 6.3% of the alphaproteobacterial ribotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Biers1">[20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Altogether, the sequence data covered by the GOS dataset greatly increases the previous sampling of the SAR11-clade, as well as of other oceanic bacteria that lack sequenced representatives, thereby representing a rich source of sequences for examining the placement of mitochondria in relation to bacteria found in the upper surface waters of the oceans. To do so, we set out to determine the placement of the extracted GOS sequences relative to the recognized alphaproteobacterial and mitochondrial sequences in each of the COX1, COB and NAD7 protein trees. Given that Bayesian inferences of protein phylogenies are computationally demanding, we had to down-sample the amount of GOS sequences prior to performing such analyses. To achieve this, we used two different approaches: (i) sub-sampling the data while maintaining phylogenetic diversity (pruning), and (ii) pre-filtering the data for specific GOS homologs that grouped as potential mitochondrial neighbour, as detailed below.</p>

        <title>Inclusion of a Pruned Set of Genetically Diverse GOS Sequences</title>
        <p>In order to obtain manageable amounts of COX1, COB and NAD7 homologs from the GOS database, a pruning step was incorporated such that the number of sequences decreased while the phylogenetic diversity within the dataset was maintained (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref> for details). This pruning procedure resulted in the addition of 30–50 GOS sequences per protein dataset. Despite the pruning step that eliminated much of the genetic redundancy, a large majority of the GOS sequences still clustered with <italic>Ca.</italic> Pelagibacter ubique with posterior probability values (pp) in the range of 0.90–0.97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024457-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024457-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024457-g005">5</xref>). Another set of GOS sequences clustered within the Rhodobacterales (pp = 0.99–1), which contains the oceanic bacteria <italic>Silicibacter pomeroyii</italic> and <italic>Jannaschia</italic> sp. CCS1. A third set of GOS sequences were placed within the Rhodospirilalles (pp = 0.94–0.99). Theoretically, the GOS database should not contain any sequences of eukaryotic origins since the pore size of the filters that were utilized during the sampling procedures was specifically aimed at recovering bacteria. Yet, we observed that a number of GOS sequences grouped internally with the mitochondrial lineage of the COX1 tree with high support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024457-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Most likely, these sequences are derived from photosynthetic picoeukaryotes related to green alga or to marine alveolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Not1">[36]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, some COX1 and NAD7 sequences were identified in the GOS dataset that were placed close to or at the root of the Rickettsiales and in relatively close proximity of the mitochondrial clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024457-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024457-g005">5</xref>). Encouraged by these results, we decided to use a targeted approach to identify more GOS sequences that could belong to these oceanic clades.</p>

        <title>Systematic Searches for Mitochondrial Neighbours in the GOS Data</title>
        <p>To systematically search for sequences that are more closely related to the mitochondrial clade than any of the alphaproteobacterial reference species, we designed a taxon jack-knifing procedure in which GOS sequences were extracted that clustered in the vicinity of the mitochondrial clade in phylogenetic analyses. To this end, random samples of 100 GOS sequences were extracted for each of the selected proteins and added to the sequences in the reference data set. These combined datasets were used to construct phylogenetic trees using RAxML under the CAT [WAG] model. Subsequently, sequences affiliated with the mitochondrial clade were selected for further analysis using Bayesian methods. This procedure was repeated 100 times in order to ensure that all sequences in the dataset were sampled (the estimated un-sampled fraction for the largest dataset ∼6.7*10<sup>−5</sup>). A random sampling approach was used to avoid sampling biases.</p>
        <p>Several of the resulting Bayesian single protein trees indicated the presence of deeply diverging GOS sequences, but the topology was often poorly resolved (not shown). In an attempt to improve the resolution, we selected in a second step GOS sequences situated on scaffolds (i.e. continuous stretches of sequences obtained from the assembly procedure of GOS data) with more than one gene per scaffold. A Bayesian analysis of the concatenated COX1 and COX2 proteins revealed a clade comprising GOS sequences, the Rickettsiales and mitochondria with a posterior probability of 0.99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024457-g006">Figure 6</xref>), as also shown by a network analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024457.s005">Figure S5</xref>). These findings allude to the existence of a hitherto undetected clade of Alphaproteobacteria that may represent free-living relatives of the Rickettsiales and, by inference, extant relatives of the mitochondrial progenitor.</p>

        <p>We propose to refer to this clade as OMAC, after <underline>O</underline>ceanic <underline>M</underline>itochondrial <underline>A</underline>ffiliate <underline>C</underline>lade. Based on low fraction of COX1 sequences that were retrieved in the GOS dataset that can be reliably attributed to this clade (12 out of 566; 2.1%), OMAC does not seem to be particularly abundant in the ocean. Under the assumption that Alphaproteobacteria comprise ∼32.5% of all microbial cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024457-g002">Figure 2</xref>, based on phylogenetic distribution of RPS2 sequences), the relative overall abundance of OMAC is estimated to be less than 1 percent (0.84%) of all cells. Such sequences were identified in both open ocean and coastal waters, and in both temperate and tropical waters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0024457-t001">Table 1</xref>). These bacteria seemed not to be associated with any particular habitat (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0024457-t001">Table 1</xref>) although 4 out of 12 OMAC COX1 sequences were derived from three Sargasso Sea sampling stations. However, given the low numbers of sequences that were identified, the differences in sequencing depth between the different GOS sampling sites, and the existence of temporal variation of microbial cell abundances, any inference of cell abundance should be taken with extreme caution.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The current study was motivated by a recent phylogenetic survey that identified the closest free-living sister clade of mitochondria and the Rickettsiales to be SAR11, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Williams1">[15]</xref>, a clade that dominates the ocean surface waters in terms of abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Giovannoni1">[18]</xref>. Our aim was to explore the recently published ocean surface metagenome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Rusch1">[19]</xref> to search for genes in the oceans from free-living bacteria that might be related to the mitochondrial progenitor. As such, this study describes the first systematic attempt to infer the evolutionary relationships of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation to metagenomic sequences recovered from the oceans.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we have identified a group of bacteria in the oceans that is more closely related to mitochondria than the SAR11 clade or the Rhodospirillales, the only two groups in the tree that contain cultivated species from the oceans. The new group, here referred to as the OMAC clade, is represented by GOS sequences in relatively low abundance based on the fact that we could attribute only 12 COX1 sequences in the GOS dataset to this group (less than 1% of the cell population of the ocean surface waters). Ribotyping surveys of GOS data have revealed the presence of Alphaproteobacteria that are currently unclassified or belong to uncultured clades, such as for example the SAR116 cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Biers1">[20]</xref>. Novel sequences from poorly characterized alphaproteobacterial species are therefore to be expected.</p>
      <p>Apart from identification of the OMAC clade, our study associates <italic>Ca.</italic> Pelagibacter ubique and the SAR11 clade with the group of free-living Alphaproteobacteria rather than with mitochondria and the Rickettsiales in the phylogenetic analyses of both concatenated and single protein datasets. These results corroborate the outcome of an independent study performed in our group that also supported a clustering of <italic>Ca.</italic> Pelagibacter ubique with marine and soil bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Viklund1">[38]</xref>. The genomes of <italic>Ca.</italic> Pelagibacter ubique and members of the Rickettsiales are AT-rich, whereas most other alphaproteobacterial genomes are GC-rich. Phylogenies inferred from sites in the alignment that were strongly affected by these biases supported a clustering of Ca. Pelagibacter ubique with the Rickettsiales, whereas sites less affected by such compositional heterogeneity clustered Ca. Pelagibacter ubique with free-living Alphaproteobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Viklund1">[38]</xref>. Thus, the clustering of the SAR11 clade with the Rickettsiales observed previously is likely to be an artefact of the strong AT/GC bias in the dataset. Since COX1, COB and NAD7 are three of the most highly conserved mitochondrial proteins and thereby less sensitive to these biases, we suggest that the separation of the SAR11 clade from mitochondria and the Rickettsiales observed in our phylogenies represent the underlying evolutionary divergence pattern. It is reassuring that the position of the Rickettsiales with the same low genomic G + C content as <italic>Ca.</italic> Pelagibacter ubique was stable in all our phylogenies.</p>
      <p>Given that the process of oxygenation probably started in the ocean surface waters, it seems reasonable to assume that the systems for aerobic respiration evolved in the oceanic surface waters as well. However, much of the genetic diversity present in the ancestral oceans may since have been eliminated. Hence even if mitochondria originated in the oceans, its most closely related free-living bacterial relative may not necessarily be highly abundant in the modern oceans. Furthermore, periods of rapid evolutionary change along with different selective constraints on respiratory chain proteins in the eukaryotic cells and in free-living bacterial cells in the oceans may make it very difficult to trace these relationships using the currently available methods and tools. Despite these limitations it is encouraging to see that novel mitochondrial sequence relatives can be identified in metagenomic data sets. Whole-genome sequence analyses of these and other close relatives may thus help resolve some of the many questions concerning the origin and evolution of mitochondria.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Concluding remarks</title>
        <p>The findings presented in the current study underscore that future research aiming at the identification and culturing of bacterial lineages related to the mitochondrial progenitor should regard the exploration of marine environments such as the ocean surface waters as a priority goal. Additionally, models on the origin and evolution of the eukaryotic cell and its organelles now need to be re-examined in light of the full genetic diversity of micro-organisms that is being uncovered by metagenome sequence data. Analyses combining the increasing volumes of sequence data with computationally intense evolutionary methods will require the development of new frameworks in bio-informatics. The recent development of improved analytical methods and the rapid increase of processing power give good hope that these fundamental biological questions can be further resolved.</p>

        <title>Delineation and Selection of Reference Datasets</title>
        <p>First, each of the 67 proteins encoded by the <italic>Reclinomonas americana</italic> mitochondrial genome were assigned to an orthologous group of proteins by performing BlastP searches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-Altschul1">[39]</xref> against an updated COG database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-vonMering1">[40]</xref>, comprising proteomes of a balanced selection of species, including species from all major bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic divisions. <italic>R. americana</italic> proteins were assigned to an orthologous group if a significant, best hit (E-value&lt;1*10<sup>−10</sup>, HSP (high-scoring segment pair) overlap &gt;50%) was observed against a protein of this orthologous group. To remove any redundancy, only the best hit against a <italic>R. americana</italic> protein was retained in cases where an orthologous group contained multiple proteins from the same species. Given the central position of the Alphaproteobacteria in the current analysis, we included all available alphaproteobacterial genomes represented in the STRING database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024457.s006">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to increase the phylogenetic coverage of mitochondrial proteins, and to compensate for those cases in which mitochondrially encoded proteins were omitted from the eukaryotic proteomes covered in the STRING database, we included mitochondrially encoded proteins for a selected number of species in our analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024457.s006">Table S1</xref>). The selected mitochondrial genomes were searched for potential orthologs for each of the 67 proteins encoded by the <italic>R. americana</italic> mitochondrial genome by BlastP analysis. Significant hits (E-value&lt;1*10<sup>−10</sup>, HSP-overlap&gt;50%) were added to the respective COGs. For those species where a mitochondrial protein was already represented in a given orthologous group, only one copy was retained. The respective orthologous groups, supplemented with the selected mitochondrial sequences are referred to as the ‘reference datasets’ throughout the manuscript.</p>

In order to filter out potential paralogs and distant homologs, each GOS sequence thus identified (E-value&lt;1*10<sup>−10</sup>, HSP-overlap&gt;50%) was then used as a query in a BlastP search against the updated COG database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024457-vonMering1">[40]</xref>. The GOS sequence was retained for further analysis only if the top hit (E-value&lt;1*10<sup>−10</sup>, HSP-overlap&gt;70%) was a member of the same orthologous group as the <italic>R. americana</italic> query protein.

        <title>Identification of Potential Mitochondrial Neighbour Sequences from the GOS Dataset</title>
        <p>We used a step-wise approach to search for GOS sequences forming sister-taxons to the mitochondria, or that are situated within the mitochondrial clade. First, we performed a jack-knife analysis using the full set of extracted GOS sequences together with the reference ortholog groups for each gene. Using an in-house Perl script, random samples of 100 homologous sequences were drawn with replacement from the GOS data and aligned with all the sequences in the reference data set. For each gene and sample size, 100 replicates were generated with RAxML and the CAT-model of protein substitution. GOS sequences associated with the mitochondrial clade were automatically extracted using a script developed in-house. To improve the resolution in the subsequent phylogenetic analyses, we used a second filtering step to select GOS sequences situated on a scaffold that comprises more than one gene. This step assured that the final alignment consisted of two, or in a few cases three, concatenated genes.</p>
        <p>Finally, we aligned the concatenated GOS and reference sequence datasets, and performed Bayesian phylogenetic inference using Phylobayes and the CAT-model of protein substitution.
