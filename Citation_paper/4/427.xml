<title>Background</title>
<p>Limited studies have examined the intestinal microbiota composition in relation to changes in disease course of IBD over time. We aimed to study prospectively the fecal microbiota in IBD patients developing an exacerbation during follow-up.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Design</title>
<p>Fecal samples from 10 Crohn’s disease (CD) and 9 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients during remission and subsequent exacerbation were included. Active disease was determined by colonoscopy and/or fecal calprotectine levels. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, antibiotic use, enema use and/or medication changes between consecutive samples. The microbial composition was assessed by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>After quality control, 6,194–11,030 sequences per sample were available for analysis. Patient-specific shifts in bacterial composition and diversity were observed during exacerbation compared to remission, but overarching shifts within UC or CD were not observed. Changes in the bacterial community composition between remission and exacerbation as assessed by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, were significantly larger in CD versus UC patients (0.59 vs. 0.42, respectively; p = 0.025). Thiopurine use was found to be a significant cause of clustering as shown by Principal Coordinate Analysis and was associated with decreases in bacterial richness (Choa1 501.2 vs. 847.6 in non-users; p&lt;0.001) and diversity (Shannon index: 5.13 vs. 6.78, respectively; p&lt;0.01).</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Shifts in microbial composition in IBD patients with changing disease activity over time seem to be patient-specific, and are more pronounced in CD than in UC patients. Furthermore, thiopurine use was found to be associated with the microbial composition and diversity, and should be considered when studying the intestinal microbiota in relation to disease course.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a heterogenous disease ith respect to disease location, disease course, occurrence of extra-intestinal manifestations and therapeutic response. The disease course is characterized by exacerbations and remissions. IBD is generally considered to arise from the interaction between host genetics, environmental factors, dysregulated immune responses and alterations in the intestinal microbiota composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Scharl1">[1]</xref>. IBD, especially active disease, is associated with a decreased quality of life and high health care costs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Blumenstein1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Buchanan1">[3]</xref> especially due to the use of medication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Blumenstein1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-vanderValk1">[4]</xref>. Treatment is mainly based on symptom reduction by nonspecific immune-modulating drugs and can be associated with serious side effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Talley1">[5]</xref>. Further insight in causative factors associated with the development of exacerbations (i.e. active mucosal inflammation) may contribute to new specific treatment options for IBD.</p>
<p>The intestinal microbiota is considered to play a central role in the pathogenesis of IBD and numerous studies have corroborated evidence for intestinal dysbiosis in IBD patients compared to healthy controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Frank1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Sokol1">[9]</xref>. The gut microbiota of healthy individuals is dominated by the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and to a lesser extent by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Eckburg1">[10]</xref>. In IBD patients, members of the Firmicutes phylum appear to be reduced, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Sokol1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Sokol2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Rehman1">[12]</xref> whereas members of Gammaproteobacteria seem to bloom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Seksik1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Kotlowski1">[16]</xref>. In CD patients the Clostridia cluster IV group, in particular <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,</italic> has shown to be decreased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-MartinezMedina1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Willing1">[17]</xref>. Members of Clostridia group XIVa, belonging to the <italic>Roseburia</italic> genus, also seem to be decreased in all IBD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Willing1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-RajilicStojanovic1">[19]</xref>. Data on Bacteroidetes are more ambiguous; inconsistent findings have been reported for their presence in IBD compared to controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Andoh1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Ott1">[25]</xref>. In addition to these differences in relative abundances of specific phylotypes, there appears to be a general decrease in biodiversity in IBD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Ott1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Manichanh1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Altogether, these studies provide compelling evidence for changes in the gut microbial communities in IBD patients as compared to healthy controls. Only a few studies, however, investigated the intestinal microbiota in relation to disease activity. Differences in bacterial species or groups (e.g. <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic>, Clostridia, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Fusobacterium varium</italic>) were found, when comparing active with inactive UC and CD patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Swidsinski1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Sokol1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Andoh1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Mylonaki1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Morgan1">[29]</xref> but could not always be confirmed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Willing1">[17]</xref>. These studies are prone to confounding effects due to their cross-sectional designs and differences in medication use. Studies monitoring the microbiota composition within patients with changing disease activity over time and controlling for medication use are currently lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to prospectively monitor the microbial composition in UC and CD patients during remission and subsequent exacerbation by means of 16S rDNA pyrosequencing.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Population and Design</title>
<p>The current study was conducted within the context of a prospective follow-up cohort of IBD outpatients, in which standardized demographic and clinical data, feces and blood samples were collected at study entry, at every subsequent outpatient visit and during an exacerbation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Masclee1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of IBD was based on clinical and endoscopic or radiological findings. For case definition of CD, the Lennard-Jones criteria were applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-LennardJones1">[31]</xref>. UC was defined as continuous mucosal inflammation with granulomata, affecting the rectum and/or some or all of the colon in continuity with the rectum. Data of concomitant use of medication, body mass index (BMI), disease duration since diagnosis and disease phenotype (Montreal classification) were obtained using the computer-based medical registration databases. Furthermore at each visit, the occurrence of infections was checked by medical history and culture if indicated, and questions on overall changes in dietary habits were completed.</p>
<p>Fecal samples were collected at home on the evening before or the morning of each visit and stored at 4°C. Upon arrival at the hospital, the faecal samples were split directly. Part was sent to the laboratory of Clinical Chemistry for routine analysis of fecal calprotectine and the remaining part was frozen at −80°C within 24 hours after defecation for analyses of the microbiota.</p>
<p>Within the prospective cohort, patients with faecal samples at remission as well as after subsequent development of an exacerbation during a one-year follow-up period were eligible for the present study.</p>
<p>As clinical indices do not correlate very well with endoscopic scores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-afBjorkesten1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Regueiro1">[33]</xref> and as we aimed to assess the association of the fecal microbiota with the presence of mucosal inflammation, an exacerbation was defined by colonoscopy, a calprotectin value &gt;150 µg/g feces or &gt;5-fold increase in calprotectin as compared to remission levels. For CD, only patients with colonic involvement were included as fecal samples are not likely to reflect microbial composition in the small intestine. For UC, eligible patients had pancolitis, left-sided colitis or proctosigmoiditis. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, use of rectal enemas, use of antibiotics in the 3 months prior to inclusion or during follow-up, and/or a change in immunosuppressive medication between sampling at remission and subsequent development of disease exacerbation.</p>

<title>16S rRNA V1–V3 Amplicon Library Preparation</title>
<p>Approximately 200 milligram feces was used for DNA isolation by the PSP SPIN Stool DNA plus kit (Stratec Molecular GmbH, Berlin, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in a final volume of 200 µL.</p>
<p>Amplicon libraries for pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA V1–V3 regions were generated using a barcoded forward primer consisting of the 454 Titanium platform A linker sequence (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG-3′</named-content>), a key (barcode) that was unique for each sample, and the 16S rRNA 534R primer sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG -3′</named-content>, and a reverse primer consisting of a 9∶1 mixture of two oligonucleotides, 5′-<italic>B-</italic> AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′ and 5′-<italic>B</italic>- AGGGTTCGATTCTGGCTCAG-3′, where <italic>B</italic> represents the B linker (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAG-3′</named-content>) followed by the 16S rRNA 8F and 8F-Bif primers, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090981.s006">Table S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Dethlefsen1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>PCR amplifications (in a volume of 50 µL) were performed using 1× FastStart High Fidelity Reaction Buffer, 1.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM dNTP solution, 5 U FastStart High Fidelity Blend Polymerase (from the High Fidelity PCR System (Roche, Indianapolis, USA)), 0.2 µM reverse primer, 0.2 µM of the barcoded forward primer (unique for each sample) and 1 µL of template DNA. PCR was performed using the following cycle conditions: an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 51°C for 45 s and extension at 72°C for 5 min, and a final elongation step at 72°C for 10 min. Amplicons (20 µL) were purified using AMPure XP purification (Agencourt, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 25 µl 1× low TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).</p>
<p>Amplicon concentrations were determined by Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent kit (Invitrogen, New York, USA<italic>)</italic> using a Victor3 Multilabel Counter (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, USA). Amplicons were mixed in equimolar concentrations to ensure equal representation of each sample. A one-region 454 sequencing run was performed on a GS FLX Titanium PicoTiterPlate with a GS FLX pyrosequencing system (Roche, Branford, USA).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The V1–V3 16S rDNA bacterial sequences analyzed in this paper have been deposited in the MG-RAST database (project ID: 4728).</p>
<p>Raw pyrosequencing reads were initially passed through quality filters to reduce the overall error rate using Mothur version 1.23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Schloss1">[35]</xref>. Only those sequences with perfect proximal primer fidelity and a threshold quality score of ≥20, a read length between 200 and 540 nucleotides, a maximum of one ambiguous base call and a maximum homopolymer length of 9 were retained for further analysis.</p>
<p>Subsequent data processing was conducted using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) version 1.5.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Caporaso1">[36]</xref>. Barcodes were used to identify sequences belonging to each patient sample. The UCLUST algorithm was used to cluster sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or phylotypes based on 97% similarity (species level) against the Greengenes reference set <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-McDonald1">[37]</xref>. The following nondefault search parameters for UCLUST were applied: maxrejects = 100 and stepwords = 16. Creation of new clusters for sequences that did not cluster to reference sequences within the given similarity threshold was disabled, to further reduce the influence of pyrosequencing errors.</p>
<p>Species richness and diversity within communities (alpha-diversity) was measured by means of the observed OTUs (observed richness), Chao1 index (estimated richness), and the Shannon diversity index. Beta-diversity or diversity shared across patient communities was determined by UniFrac distance and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (BC). UniFrac distances are based on the fraction of branch length shared between two communities within a phylogenetic tree constructed from the 16S rRNA gene sequences from all communities being compared. A relatively small UniFrac distance implies that two communities are compositionally similar, harboring lineages sharing a common evolutionary history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Lozupone1">[38]</xref>. Both weighted and unweighted UniFrac were used, respectively taking into account the abundance of each bacterial species for creating branch length or not.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>BC and Unweighted UniFrac distances were calculated for each patient (remission versus active sample) and distances were subsequently compared between CD and UC patients using the Mann-Whitney U test. Distances between subsequent samples from the same patient (within subjects) and distances between remission samples of different patients (between subjects) were also compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The above mentioned statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 20.</p>
<p>All subsequent statistical analyses were conducted within QIIME 1.5.1, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>Age was dichotomized in two groups with 52 years (median age) as cut-off. Differences in alpha-diversity with respect to IBD type, disease location, age, gender and medication use (thiopurines, TNF-α inhibitors, aminosalicylates, prednisone or methotrexate) were tested using a nonparametric two-sample t-tests (i.e. using Monte Carlo permutations to calculate the p-value) at a rarefaction intensity of &gt;6,190 sequences per sample. To test for differences in alpha-diversity within patients with respect to disease activity, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was applied (conducted within SPSS v. 20).</p>
<p>OTU coverage was estimated using the conditional uncovered probability method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Lladser1">[39]</xref>. Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was used to test for differences in community structure (UniFrac) among the various groups (IBD type, disease location, age, gender and medication use) in remission state. ANOSIM is a permutation-based test of the null hypothesis that within-group distances are not significantly smaller than between-group distances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Clarke1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>To test for associations between OTUs (presence) and IBD type, disease location, age, gender and medication use, the G-test statistic was used. To test for differences in the relative abundance of OTUs, the paired-sample T-test was used with respect to disease activity (within group comparisons) and ANOVA was used to test for differences with respect to IBD type, disease location, age, gender and medication use between groups. The false discovery rate (FDR) method was used to correct for multiple testing at a cutoff of 0.25. The relatively high value was used so as not to miss possible associations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study using next-generation sequencing to examine the fecal microbiota composition in UC and CD during a quiescent disease phase and a subsequent exacerbation.</p>
<p>Similar to previous studies on the human fecal microbiota, the divisions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes predominated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Nam1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-vandenBogert1">[44]</xref>. Although no overarching shifts in microbial communities could be detected in the CD and UC populations, shifts in composition and decreased diversity were observed in individual patients. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the microbiota within CD patients was less stable compared to the microbiota from UC patients. Finally, thiopurines appear to affect the gut microbial composition and diversity.</p>
<p>In the present study, we were not able to identify overall patterns in microbial changes related to the presence of an exacerbation. An exacerbation was defined by endoscopic scores and/or fecal calprotectin levels as indicators for mucosal inflammation, as clinical scores are reported not to correlate very well with endoscopy findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-afBjorkesten1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Regueiro1">[33]</xref>. Mucosal inflammation is increasingly recognized as outcome parameter for active disease and is important for optimization of therapeutic strategies and to prevent complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Vaughn1">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous studies did show microbial differences comparing active with inactive IBD patients. For example, a combination of leucocytes in the fecal-mucosal transition zone and the concentration of <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> were found to be strong predictors of active CD and UC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Swidsinski1">[7]</xref>. Diminished <italic>F. prausnitzii,</italic> as well as a lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was also associated with active disease in another study on 49 IBD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Sokol1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, a decrease in the Clostridium family was found in active UC and inactive and active CD compared to inactive UC and healthy controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Andoh1">[20]</xref>. A decrease of <italic>C. coccoides</italic>, <italic>C. leptum</italic> subgroup, Atophium cluster and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> was reported in feces of active compared to inactive UC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Takaishi1">[8]</xref> while increased counts of bifidobacteria, <italic>E. coli</italic> and Clostridia were found in tissue specimens of active compared to inactive UC by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Mylonaki1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned studies had a cross-sectional design and are therefore more vulnerable to selection bias and confounding. None of these studies did match patients with quiescent disease to patients with active disease based on characteristics such as disease location, medication, diet and other possible confounders, nor did they adjust for these factors in their statistical analyses. In contrast, two more recent studies that used pyrosequencing did not show clustering based on disease status. A study by Willing et al. used a multivariate statistical approach (partial least-squares discriminant analysis) to distinguish disease phenotypes based on microbial composition in 40 twin pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Willing1">[17]</xref>. Six patients had active disease based on clinical scores, which could not be distinguished from 34 patients with inactive disease. In the second study, analyzing 231 biopsies and stool samples of IBD patients and healthy subjects, disease activity was not associated with specific shifts in the microbiome composition even after adjusting for other factors such as sample type (i.e. stool or biopsy), IBD type, age, smoking and medication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Morgan1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>A potential explanation for the lack of overarching shifts in microbial composition at time of exacerbation in our study may be due to the relatively small study population. Although we included only CD patients with colonic disease and excluded IBD patients with changes in medication over time, some heterogeneity in the study population cannot be excluded. IBD can be considered a set of diseases with overlapping phenotypes rather than a single disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Kaser1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Young1">[47]</xref>. This may contribute to the patient-specific microbial composition shifts, and lack thereof at group level. The fact that from a large cohort of 323 subjects, only 19 fulfilled our selection criteria, illustrates that it is very difficult to include a rather large homogenous subpopulation.</p>
<p>The main strength of the present study is the prospective design comparing the microbiota in association to disease activity within the same patients followed over time, particularly considering the interindividual differences in microbiota composition. Clear subject-specific changes have been observed. As modifications of medication use over time were not allowed, these changes were most likely associated with the changing disease activity. Major increases (up to 81.9%) in specific bacterial subspecies were observed in five patients, being <italic>Lactobacillus spp</italic>. (in one UC patient), <italic>B. dorei</italic> (in one UC patient), <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> (in one CD patient), and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> (in two CD patients (#10 and #11)). These two latter patients were both non-smoking females (age 35 and 50 years respectively) using a combination of thiopurines and TNF-inhibitors continuously during the period of interest. Apart from developing an exacerbation, no major changes in clinical or environmental factors did occur during the follow-up period in any of these patients that could have contributed to the observed findings. Although larger patient numbers need to be studied before final conclusions can be drawn on the role of the individual commensal in the pathogenesis of IBD, the potential importance of <italic>B. fragilis</italic> is supported by findings from others. <italic>B. fragilis</italic> was found to be significantly more abundant in biopsies from CD patients compared to UC patients and healthy subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Gophna1">[23]</xref>. In another study, the mucosal biofilm mass in IBD patients appeared to be dominated by <italic>B. fragilis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Swidsinski2">[24]</xref>. Some strains of <italic>B. fragilis</italic> are enterotoxigenic by producing a zinc-dependent metalloprotease toxin, and appear to be more prevalent in active IBD patients as compared to inactive patients and control subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Prindiville1">[48]</xref>. Animal models have confirmed that enterotoxigenic <italic>B. fragilis</italic> alone is sufficient to induce colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Rabizadeh1">[49]</xref>. Furthermore, a potential role for the eukaryotic-like ubiquitin gene in <italic>B. fragilis</italic> in the pathophysiology of CD has recently been postulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Patrick1">[50]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we found a different level of microbial variability contributing to exacerbations in either CD or UC. This may indicate that changes in gut bacterial composition play a more important role in CD than in UC exacerbation development. These findings are in line with findings by others. Willing et al. (2010) found different microbial profiles between CD and controls but not between UC and controls based on 454 sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Willing1">[17]</xref>. In addition, Andoh et al. found inactive UC patients to cluster with healthy controls, while inactive and active CD clustered separately together with active UC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Andoh1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the numbers were small, we found that thiopurine treatment was associated with the microbial composition and the diversity. Based upon the Principal Coordinate analysis, thiopurine use was found to be the most important factor responsible for clustering and was furthermore associated with a significant decrease in alpha-diversity. It has previously been found that the thiopurines 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and azathioprine inhibit growth of <italic>M. avium</italic> subspecies <italic>paratuberculosis in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Greenstein1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090981-Shin1">[52]</xref>. We could not demonstrate an antimicrobial effect of 6-MP in vitro as tested on <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> by disc diffusion test (test range 1–64 µg, data not shown). This does however not exclude the possibility of an (indirect) effect of 6-MP or one of its metabolites on the intestinal microbiota in vivo.</p>
<p>As such, the present findings indicate that thiopurine use, especially changes in administration or dosage over time, should be considered as a potential confounding factor when studying the microbiota composition in IBD. Replication of our findings on the association between thiopurine use and shifts in microbiota composition as well as more mechanistic insight on the potential underlying mechanisms is warranted to prove a causal relationship.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although we did observe patient-specific shifts in microbial composition, we could not demonstrate general changes in microbial composition or diversity in IBD patients at time of exacerbation as compared to a quiescent disease state. Patient-specific shifts in fecal microbial composition seemed to be associated with larger Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between remission and active disease for CD as compared to UC. Furthermore, thiopurine use was found to have significant impact on the microbial composition and diversity, and should be considered when studying the intestinal microbiota in relation to disease course.</p>
<p>Larger prospective studies that enable controlling for potential confounders such as medication, disease subtype and location, are needed to unravel potential general shifts in the microbiota related to exacerbations in IBD.</p>
