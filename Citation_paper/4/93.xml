        <p>Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is being considered as a therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment but the clinical application is hindered by its potent pro-nociceptive activity. Thus, to reduce systemic exposure that would induce pain, in recent clinical studies NGF was administered through an invasive intracerebral gene-therapy approach. Our group demonstrated the feasibility of a non-invasive intranasal delivery of NGF in a mouse model of neurodegeneration. NGF therapeutic window could be further increased if its nociceptive effects could be avoided altogether. In this study we exploit forms of NGF, mutated at residue R100, inspired by the human genetic disease HSAN V (Hereditary Sensory Autonomic Neuropathy Type V), which would allow increasing the dose of NGF without triggering pain. We show that “painless” hNGF displays full neurotrophic and anti-amyloidogenic activities in neuronal cultures, and a reduced nociceptive activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. When administered intranasally to APPxPS1 mice ( n = 8), hNGFP61S/R100E prevents the progress of neurodegeneration and of behavioral deficits. These results demonstrate the <italic>in vivo</italic> neuroprotective and anti-amyloidogenic properties of hNGFR100 mutants and provide a rational basis for the development of “painless” hNGF variants as a new generation of therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-LeviMontalcini1">[1]</xref> has a considerable therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD), not merely as a long-lasting cholinergic maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Delcroix1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Tuszynski1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Mufson1">[4]</xref> and neuroprotective agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Chao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Giacobini1">[6]</xref>, but also as a direct anti-amyloidogenic factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Cattaneo1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Matrone1">[8]</xref>. However, the development of an NGF-based therapy for neurodegenerative diseases remains a considerable challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Thoenen1">[9]</xref>, due to limited access of NGF to the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Poduslo1">[10]</xref> and to its potent nociceptive actions in animals and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Petty1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Pezet1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Current strategies for NGF therapy in AD use highly invasive approaches, such as a neurosurgical intracerebroventricular injection of NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-EriksdotterJonhagen1">[13]</xref> or a parenchimal injection of cells secreting hNGF (human NGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Tuszynski2">[14]</xref> or of viruses harboring hNGF gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Mandel1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To fully exploit the therapeutic potential of NGF in a noninvasive manner, its therapeutic window must be improved, by increasing the brain distribution, while limiting NGF pain-inducing actions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Cattaneo1">[7]</xref>. The intranasal delivery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Malerba1">[16]</xref> represents a viable option to non invasively increase NGF biodistribution in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Frey1">[17]</xref>, where it exerts anti-neurodegenerative actions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-DeRosa1">[20]</xref>. NGF intranasal delivery minimizes the build-up of peripheral NGF concentration, even if residual leakage and absorption of NGF into the blood stream, from the nasal compartment, has been shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Malerba1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Frey1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>NGF therapeutic window could be further increased if its nociceptive effects could be avoided altogether. To this aim, we described a “painless” form of NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>, linked to the rare human genetic disease HSAN V (Hereditary Sensory Autonomic Neuropathy Type V) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Einarsdottir1">[22]</xref>. In HSAN V patients, a mutation in the NGFB gene ( exon 3, nt C661T ), changing arginine R100 in mature NGF to a tryptophan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Einarsdottir1">[22]</xref>, determines the complete loss of pain perception without affecting most neurological functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-deAndrade1">[23]</xref></p>
      <p>The fact that the NGF mutation R100W appears to separate the effects of NGF on CNS development from those involved in the activation of peripheral pain pathways, provides a basis for designing “painless” NGF variant molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Cattaneo1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach1">[24]</xref>. In particular, we demonstrated that the hNGFR100E mutant displays a full neurotrophic activity in cultured neurons, while showing a reduced nociceptive activity <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>, via a selective alteration of TrkA versus p75NTR binding and signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we characterize a double mutant of human NGF (hNGFP61S/R100E; Accession number: SPIN000006237) that, in addition to the pain-related R100E mutation, harbors a second “tagging” P61S mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach2">[25]</xref>. The anti-neurodegenerative properties of hNGFP61S/R100E protein were assessed in a disease-relevant primary neuron model, as well as in two animal models for AD, based on different mechanisms. In particular, this study addresses the question whether the intranasal administration of NGF-based molecules to Familial Alzheimer Disease-based mouse models might exert neuroprotection and prevent the progression of the neuropathological and behavioral deficits.</p>

        <p>The therapeutic window for NGF in AD would be improved by the availability of NGF variants that, while retaining neurotrophic activity, would display a reduced nociceptive activity in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Cattaneo1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To test whether the administration of recombinant forms of NGF to APP-based mouse models might exert a neuroprotective effect and slow the progression of neurodegeneration, we exploited the double mutant hNGFP61S/R100E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

            <p>The NGF dimer is depicted in blue. The Ser 61 residues on the two monomers are highlighted in red and the Arg 100 in green. The cartoon representation was created with Pymol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.pymol.org</ext-link>). The scaffold of mouse NGF was used for this figure for illustration purposes, because the loop containing Pro 61 in the human NGF is missing in the available PDB structures. The mutant human NGF protein used in this study (hNGFP61S/R100E) is based, instead, on human NGF, in which residue Pro61 is substituted by its mouse counterpart Ser61, and residue Arg100 is substituted by Glu100.</p>

        <p>The design of this mutant was based on the single nucleotide missense mutation in the NGFB gene, found in Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type V (HSAN V) patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Einarsdottir1">[22]</xref>, that changes residue R100, in mature hNGF, into a W residue. We recently showed that the R100 mutation does not affect hNGF binding affinity for TrkA, while it reduces binding affinity for p75NTR by two orders of magnitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach1">[24]</xref>. It was also found that R100W hNGF mutants have very similar receptor binding and signaling properties to an engineered R100E mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach1">[24]</xref>, with the latter giving much higher yields, when expressed and purified from E. coli cells. For this reason, we used the R100E hNGF mutants for in vivo studies, demonstrating that hNGFR100E has a nociceptive activity which is much weaker than that of wild type hNGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>.</p>
        <p>For the present study, the R100E mutation was inserted in the context of a recombinant form of human NGF “tagged” with a single residue epitope (hNGFP61S), which replaces the Pro residue at position 61 of hNGF with Ser residue present in mouse NGF. hNGFP61S “tagged” molecules are equally bioactive as hNGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach2">[25]</xref> and are selectively detectable against wild type hNGF, with a specific monoclonal antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach2">[25]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The resulting double mutant hNGFP61S/R100E was expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> alongside hNGFR100E and hNGFP61S. The impact of the R100E mutation on binding affinities for the TrkA and p75NTR receptors is identical whether present in the context of human NGF or of the “tagged” hNGFP61S similarly reducing the binding affinity for p75NTR, while preserving the binding affinity for TrkA identical to that of hNGF or hNGFP61S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach1">[24]</xref>.

        <p>The neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties of hNGFP61S/R100E were then assessed in a neuronal NGF-dependent amyloidogenic model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Matrone1">[8]</xref>, based on hippocampal neuronal primary cultures. In this model, hippocampal neurons are first primed with NGF. Subsequent removal of NGF causes a γ–secretase dependent production of Aβ, that causes ensuing cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Matrone1">[8]</xref>. In this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), rat hippocampal neurons not “primed” with hNGF do not acquire NGF dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). On the contrary, when primed with NGF for 2 days, hippocampal neurons become dependent on NGF and die in the absence of NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). hNGFP61S/R100E was equally effective as hNGF, hNGFP61S and hNGFR100E in inducing priming and NGF dependency, as shown by the equivalent extent of neuronal death following its removal and neutralization with anti-NGF antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g003">Figure 3E, F–K</xref>). In sister cultures of hippocampal neurons, primed with each of the hNGF-X molecules, hNGF, hNGFP61S, hNGFR100E and hNGFP61S/R100E were equally effective in overcoming the cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g003">Figure 3E, F–K</xref>). These results highlight the effectiveness of hNGFP61S/R100E in a disease-relevant neurodegeneration model linking neurotrophin deprivation to amyloidogenesis.</p>
        <p>Finally, the pro-differentiative capacity of hNGFP61S/R100E was evaluated in rat PC12 and in human SH-SY5Y cells which are known to differentiate when incubated with NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Poluha1">[31]</xref>.

Notably, in the context of hNGFP61S the mutation R100E does not even induce the slight decrease in the number of processes/cell that was observed with hNGF/R100E, with respect to hNGF or hNGFP61S (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0037555.s001">Figure S1F</xref>). In human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Sonnenfeld1">[32]</xref>, hNGFP61S/R100E was equally effective as hNGF, hNGFP61S, hNGFR100E in the neurite outgrowth induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g001">Figure 1G, H, I, J, K</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thus, we conclude that the priming, survival, pro-differentiative and neuroprotective activity of hNGFP61S/R100E in different cell lines and neuronal cultures is identical to that of hNGF, hNGFP61S and hNGFR100E.</p>

        <p>AD11 mice treated with the higher dose of hNGFP61S/R100E showed a statistically significant increase in the number of ChAT-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g005">Figure 5F,G</xref>.), and a concomitant decrease in the number of phosphotau-positive neurons and of clusters of Aβ-positive dystrophic neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g006">Figure 6F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g007">Figure 7F,G</xref>, respectively). The efficacy of hNGFP61S/R100E was statistically indistinguishable from that of a similar dose of hNGF or hNGFP61S. On the other hand, the mutant hNGFR100E was less effective than hNGFP61S/R100E, determining only a 50% increase of the number of ChAT positive neurons at the higher dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g005">Figure 5E,G</xref>), but no significant effect on the number of phosphotau-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g006">Figure 6E,G</xref>) or of Aβ-positive dystrophic neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g007">Figure 7E,G</xref>).</p>
        <p>On the basis of these results, the hNGFP61S/R100E candidate was selected for further analysis, in a neurodegeneration model not dependent on NGF neutralization, the APPxPS1 mice (B6C3-Tg(APP695)3Dbo Tg(PSEN1)5Dbo/J) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Borchelt1">[38]</xref>, based on FAD mutations in APP and PS1 genes (APP gene Swedish mutations K595N, M596Land presenilin 1 gene mutation A246E. APPxPS1 mice were treated intranasally with hNGFP61SR100E protein (540 ng/kg, 0,51 pmoles/injection), starting from 10 months of age for two months. At this age, the APPxPS1mice show no learning and memory deficits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Heikkinen1">[39]</xref> and Aβ plaque deposition has only just started <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Borchelt1">[38]</xref>. The design of the hNGFP61SR100E treatment is therefore addressing a potential preventive efficacy, in the early phases of the neurodegeneration.</p>
        <p>After a two months treatment, spatial learning and memory was tested in the Morris water maze. First of all, the swimming speed and distance travelled during the first trial did not differ among the experimental groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0037555.s002">Figure S2B</xref>,C, respectively). PBS treated APPxPS1 mice showed a clear deficit in spatial learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) and memory of the learned task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g008">Figure 8B</xref>.). Both deficits were improved, to levels identical to control littermates, in hNGFP61S/R100E-treated APPxPS1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The brains were subsequently analysed at the neuropathological level by immunohistochemistry. Aβ immunohistochemistry and Thioflavin S staining confirmed the presence of Aβ plaque deposits in the cortex and hippocampus of PBS treated APPxPS1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g009">Figure 9</xref> B,E,I,L). No Aβ plaques were observed in WT transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g009">Figure 9A,D,I,J</xref>). Strikingly, hNGFP61S/R100E substantially reduced the plaque load in the hippocampus and cortex of APPxPS1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g009">Figure 9C,F, I,J</xref>) and determined a shift from a fibrillar to a more compact morphology of the residual plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g009">Figure 9G,H</xref>). The reduction of Aβ in hNGFP61S/R100E treated APPxPS1 mice was confirmed at the biochemical level, by ELISA, showing a significant reduction of the soluble pools of both Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 with respect to the PBS-treated APPxPS1 mice (relative levels shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g009">Figure 9K,L</xref>).</p>

        <p>A growing body of evidence shows that the most synaptotoxic form of the Aβ peptide is represented by oligomeric forms of the Aβ peptide.</p>
        <p>Since the anti-Aβ antibodies used for immunohistochemistry and ELISA do not distinguish between monomeric, oligomeric or fibrillar forms of this peptide, we examined the effect of the administration of hNGFP61S/R100E on the level of Aβ-oligomer.

        <p>Similarly, we found that the scFvA13 antibody specifically labels Aβ-oligomers in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g011">Figure 11B</xref>) and cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g011">Figure 11G,I</xref>) of APPxPS1 mice, with no specific staining detected in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g011">Figure 11A,F</xref>) nor in APPxPS1 sections in which the primary antibody fragment and/or the anti-V5 antibody were omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g011">Figure 11D and E</xref>, respectively).

Moreover, labeling with an anti-synaptophysin antibody showed that in APPxPS1 mice treated with PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g013">Figure 13O</xref>) there is a decreased expression of this synaptic marker with respect to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g013">Figure 13L</xref>), which is fully reverted by the intranasal administration of hNGFP61S/R100E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037555-g013">Figure 13R</xref>).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, hNGFP61S/R100E appears to be effective in providing broad neuroprotection to APPxPS 1 double transgenic mice, thereby preventing the onset and progression of learning and memory deficits and reducing the amyloid load in this model. The neuroprotective effect by recombinant hNGF protein appears to be exerted at multiple possible levels, by slowing the generation of Aβ peptide and Aβ oligomers and by reducing the microgliosis and astrogliosis, possibly increasing the clearance of Aβ peptides, thereby leading to the observed reduced plaque load.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The well documented nociceptive actions of NGF represent a major drawback for the development of an NGF-based prospective therapy for human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-EriksdotterJonhagen1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Apfel1">[46]</xref>. Thus, to develop NGF for AD therapy, invasive local delivery approaches are being currently adopted, involving the neurosurgical injection into the brain parenchyma of cells secreting NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Tuszynski2">[14]</xref> or of viral particles harboring hNGF gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Mandel1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To fully exploit the therapeutic potential of NGF it is necessary to improve its therapeutic window, by increasing the access of NGF to CNS target regions, while limiting its off target, pain-inducing actions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Cattaneo1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The intranasal delivery option provides a promising solution towards the former objective. Indeed, efficacy of intranasal NGF delivery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Frey1">[17]</xref> to rescue neurodegeneration in animal models has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-DeRosa1">[20]</xref>. As to whether and how the pain inducing activities of NGF can be reduced or eliminated by this delivery route remained an open problem, since passage of NGF into the blood stream, from the nasal compartments, has been shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Malerba1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Frey1">[17]</xref>. NGF therapeutic window could be further increased if its nociceptive effects could be avoided altogether.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we characterize a recombinant NGF variant that, while displaying a full neurotrophic and anti-amyloidogenic activity, also shows a reduced nociceptive activity. The hNGFP61S/R100E molecule combines a P61S tagging mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach2">[25]</xref>, with the R100E mutation, designed to selectively reduce the pain sensitizing activity of NGF, while retaining its neurotrophic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach1">[24]</xref>. On the hNGFP61S backbone, a second mutation was inserted at position R100, inspired by the genetic mutation found in NGFB gene in HSAN V patients, which changes the basic R100 in mature NGF to a non-polar tryptophan, and is responsible for the decreased perception of pain in these patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Einarsdottir1">[22]</xref>. In recent studies we showed that the clinical phenotype of HSANV can be, at least in part explained by a selective inability of hNGF R100 protein to activate nociception, while retaining the neurotrophic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>. Indeed, the binding affinity of hNGFR100 mutants to p75NTR is strongly reduced, while that for TrkA remains unchanged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach1">[24]</xref>. Despite the identical TrkA binding affinity, hNGFR100 mutants differ from hNGF in their ability to activate downstream TrkA-dependent signalling pathways, with a notable selective reduction in the ability to activate PLC–1γ and Erks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>. Notably, hNGFR100 mutants do not sensitize nociceptors and fail to induce pain <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni3">[21]</xref>. Thus, hNGFR100 mutants may share some properties of other NGF mutants described to be selective TrkA agonists with respect to p75NTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Mahapatra1">[47]</xref>, but have the additional property of selectively modulating a subset of the signaling pathways downstream of TrkA, and to be proven as less potent nociception activators.</p>
      <p>On the basis of these properties, the hNGFP61S/R100E therapeutic candidate was designed, aimed at optimizing the therapeutic window for NGF. The characterization of the hNGFP61S/R100E double mutant is provided in this paper. Moreover, until recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Aboulkassim1">[48]</xref> no study addressed the issue whether administration of NGF, or of NGF-related molecules, might affect the neurodegeneration in FAD related APP mouse models.</p>
      <p>We show that hNGFP61S/R100E is characterized by a reduced ability to activate PLC–1γ, Erks and c-jun, providing a molecular explanation for the reduced pro-nociceptive activity, observed in a mechanical allodynia pain model. hNGFP61S/R100E showed no difference with respect the hNGF counterparts in a number of different survival, differentiation and proliferation cellular assays. Thus, hNGFR100P61S/R100E maintains the neurotrophic signaling stream unchanged, while showing a reduced signaling involved in nociceptor sensitization and pain perception. Notably, hNGFP61S/R100E is very effective to rescue or prevent neurodegeneration and learning and memory deficits in mouse models, including an APP-based model, in which the neurodegeneration is not directly caused by NGF inhibition.</p>
      <p>We observed a higher effectiveness of hNGFP61S/R100E, with respect to hNGFR100E, in rescuing the neurodegeneration in the AD11 model, as well as a slight difference between the R100E and the P61S/R100E NGF proteins in nociceptive sensitization assays, most likely involving a structural cross-talk between S61 and R100 residues. Thus, the P61S substitution, which per se does not determine any measurable influence, compared to wild type NGF (Covaceuszach et al 2009), , could exert a long distance influence on the residue at position 100. In all the available 3D structures of hNGF complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-He1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Wiesmann1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Wehrman1">[51]</xref> loop 58–68 (CRDPNPVDSGC) is only partially resolved. Indeed the region 61–66 (PNPVDS), including the residue P61, is structurally not defined. On the contrary, in the crystal structures of mouse NGF (mNGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Holland1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-McDonald1">[53]</xref> the homologous loop (CRASNPVESGC), including S61, is structurally well defined. Thus, the 58–68 loop in hNGF has likely a higher intrinsic conformational flexibility compared to mNGF. This loop is structurally positioned over the C58–C108 and C68–C110 cysteine knot, and it may pose structural constraints on the possible conformations taken by the disulphide bridges of the cysteine knot. The C58–C108 and C68–C110 disulphide bridges pair β-strand-2 to β-strand-4. Residue R100 is located at the N-term of β-strand-4 (carrying C108 and C110). The P61S substitution in hNGF, by rendering the 58–68 loop structurally similar to that observed in mNGF, might cause a local conformational change in the proximity of the interacting cysteine knot, thereby exerting a long-distance effect on R100, which could explain the observed subtle modifications in the functional effects of this mutation in the context of hNGF or of hNGFP61S.</p>
      <p>The neuroprotective and anti-amyloidogenic properties of hNGFP61S/R100E mutant demonstrated in APPxPS1 transgenic mice are noteworthy. In this mouse model, the expression of mutated human APP and PS1 is the first cause of neurodegeneration. The administration of hNGFP61S/R100E was performed at an age when memory deficits have not yet started <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Heikkinen1">[39]</xref> and amyloid plaque deposition is in the initial phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Borchelt1">[38]</xref>. This allowed to study the effects of hNGFP61S/R100E at very early stages of the progressive neurodegeneration, showing that in APPxPS1 the hNGFP61S/R100E mutant was able to prevent learning and memory defects and to greatly reduce Aβ deposition. In addition, by using a conformation specific antibody anti-Aβ oligomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Meli1">[41]</xref>, we demonstrated that hNGFP61S/R100E prevents or reduces the accumulation of Aβ oligomers, considered the earliest and most synaptotoxic forms of Aβ. Thus, hNGFP61S/R100E exerts an anti-amyloidogenic effect <italic>in vivo</italic>, in a disease-relevant FAD-based model. From a mechanistic point of view, this might involve a generalized neuroprotective activity by the neurotrophin, at multiple levels, by slowing the generation of Aβ peptide and Aβ oligomers, by reducing the microgliosis and astrogliosis and/or, possibly, by increasing the clearance of Aβ peptides, thereby leading to the observed reduced plaque load and Aβ oligomer levels. The observed effects on astrocytes and microglia are consistent with both these cell types expressing TrkA and p75NTR NGF receptors, in normal and pathological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Heese1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Junier1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Wang1">[56]</xref>. Reactive astrocytes, present in APP xPS1 brain due to amyloid pathology, also express higher levels of TrkA in human AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Aguado1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Connor1">[58]</xref>. We found a reduction of both microgliosis and astrocytosis in hNGFP61S/R100E treated APPxPS1 brains, suggesting that the ensuing reduced neuroinflammation might contribute to remove an environment permissive for the buildup of amyloid pathology and neurodegeneration. Further studies are required to verify whether the activation of TrkA signaling by hNGFP61S/R100E might regulate the known mechanisms of internalization and Aβ degradation by astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-WyssCoray1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Wegiel1">[60]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The selective modulation of TrkA and p75NTR downstream signaling pathways might also contribute to the neuroprotective action of hNGFP61S/R100E. Indeed, while the activation of the Akt signaling pathway, which is preserved by hNGFR100 mutants, is required for a neuroprotective action and is downregulated by soluble Aβ oligomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Jimenez1">[61]</xref>, Erks and c-jun activation have been linked to neurodegeneration and cell death. Oligomeric assemblies of Aβ have been found to up-regulate phospho-Erks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Li1">[62]</xref>, which, in turn, can lead to abnormal phosphorylation of tau, generation of dystrophic neurites and progressive neuronal degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Chong1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Young1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Nizzari1">[64]</xref>. Similarly, up-regulation of c-jun has been linked to cell death and tau phosphorylation in AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Mehan1">[65]</xref>, and its down-regulation prevents the amyloidogenic cleavage of APP and the formation of amyloid plaques in AD mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Mazzitelli1">[44]</xref>. Thus, the decreased activation of Erks and c-jun by hNGFP61S/R100E would uncouple their involvement in a positive feedback neurodegenerative loop and facilitate the down-regulation of the effects by the aberrant APP processing. Further studies are required at more later stages of neurodegeneration, when conflicting results about the “benefits” of Erks activation have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Ma1">[66]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The possibility of hNGFP61S/R100E acting directly on APP processing and its direct consequences, such as the vicious cycle linking Aβ to the proNGF/NGF balance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Bruno1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Capsoni5">[68]</xref> should also be considered for future investigation. In this respect, it should be noted that APPxPS1 mice show a defect in NGF retrograde axonal transport by cholinergic neurons, as a consequence of APP over-expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Salehi1">[69]</xref>. Even if this defect does not lead to overt cholinergic deficit, administration of NGF might provide a boost to cholinergic function which may contribute to limiting the negative consequences of the abnormal APP processing. In any event, our results unequivocally show that this hNGF variant can exert broad neuroprotection and prevent neurodegeneration originated by FAD linked mechanisms. Moreover, the results provide additional evidence for the tight links between the pathological processes observed in FAD-based mouse models and in anti-NGF mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Houeland1">[70]</xref>, and add the evidence that TrkA agonists can improve learning and memory deficits in APP mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Aboulkassim1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our results provide a strong rational basis for the development of “painless” NGF variant for therapeutic applications. The hNGFP61S/R100E property has the dual property of being traceable with respect to human NGF, <italic>via</italic> the substitution P61S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037555-Covaceuszach2">[25]</xref>, and of having a greatly reduced pain sensitization activity on sensory fibers, while displaying an identical neurotrophic activity as hNGF. These properties make hNGFP61S/R100E an ideal candidate for the development of a noninvasive therapy for AD, avoiding the need for localized delivery by direct injection of engineered cells or of viruses into the brain parenchyma. The reduced pain sensitizing actions will allow higher doses to be delivered through intranasal delivery, and reach the target areas in the CNS while keeping the peripheral concentrations of NGF below the threshold for nociception.</p>

          <p>The mutants were diluted in 1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) at a quantity of 0.45 and 0.51 pmoles respectively for the doses of 480 ng/kg and 540 ng/kg, and were administered intranasally to mice, 3 µl at a time, alternating the nostrils, with a lapse of 2 min between each administration, for a total of 14 times. During these procedures, the nostrils were always kept open. As control treatments, AD11 and APPxPS1 mice were treated with PBS. The frequency of administration for intranasal delivery was three times per week (every 2 days). WT mice treated with PBS were used as a control group. Administrations were repeated for 7 times, over a 15 days period.</p>

        <title>Morris water maze</title>
        <p>Morris water maze was used to establish whether aged APPxPS1 mice treated with the hNGFP61S/R100E showed an amelioration in spatial memory deficits. A circular water tank, made of aluminum (diameter, 120 cm; height, 40 cm) was filled to a depth of 25 cm with water (23°C ±), rendered opaque by the addition of a small amount of milk powder. Four positions around the edge of the tank were arbitrarily designated north (N), south (S), east (E), and west (W), which provided four alternative start positions and also defined the division of the tank into four quadrants: NE, SE, SW, and NW. A circular clear Perspex escape platform (diameter, 10 cm; height, 2 cm) was submerged 0.5 cm below the water surface and placed at the midpoint of one of the NE quadrant. Mice were trained with four trials per day for 4 days (with an inter trial interval of 30 min). The start position (N, S, E, or W) was pseudo-randomized across trials. Mice were allowed up to 60 sec to locate the escape platform, and their escape latency was recorded. On the fifth day, the fourth trial was substituted by a probe trial, during which the escape platform was removed from the tank, and the swimming path of each mouse was video-recorded over 60 sec, while it searched for the missing platform.</p>
