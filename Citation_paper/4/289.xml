      <abstract>
        <p>Human-health relevant impacts on marine ecosystems are increasing on both spatial and temporal scales. Traditional indicators for environmental health monitoring and microbial risk assessment have relied primarily on single species analyses and have provided only limited spatial and temporal information. More high-throughput, broad-scale approaches to evaluate these impacts are therefore needed to provide a platform for informing public health. This study uses shotgun metagenomics to survey the taxonomic composition and antibiotic resistance determinant content of surface water bacterial communities in the Puget Sound estuary. Metagenomic DNA was collected at six sites in Puget Sound in addition to one wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that discharges into the Sound and pyrosequenced. A total of ∼550 Mbp (1.4 million reads) were obtained, 22 Mbp of which could be assembled into contigs. While the taxonomic and resistance determinant profiles across the open Sound samples were similar, unique signatures were identified when comparing these profiles across the open Sound, a nearshore marina and WWTP effluent. The open Sound was dominated by α-Proteobacteria (in particular <italic>Rhodobacterales sp.</italic>), γ-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes while the marina and effluent had increased abundances of Actinobacteria, β-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. There was a significant increase in the antibiotic resistance gene signal from the open Sound to marina to WWTP effluent, suggestive of a potential link to human impacts. Mobile genetic elements associated with environmental and pathogenic bacteria were also differentially abundant across the samples. This study is the first comparative metagenomic survey of Puget Sound and provides baseline data for further assessments of community composition and antibiotic resistance determinants in the environment using next generation sequencing technologies. In addition, these genomic signals of potential human impact can be used to guide initial public health monitoring as well as more targeted and functionally-based investigations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Coastal ecosystems continue to be subjected to increasing human pressures. Over 40% of the global population currently lives within 100 km of coastlines, and this percentage continues to increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-United1">[1]</xref>. Human impacts have led to significant degradation in marine environments in the form of habitat loss, eutrophication, hypoxia, organic and inorganic pollution, invasive species, pathogen spread and ocean acidification, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Crain1">[2]</xref>. Based on a spatial analysis of 17 anthropogenic drivers, it has been estimated that over 40% of the world’s oceans have medium to high impacts associated with human activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Halpern1">[3]</xref>. These impacts subsequently now pose risks to human health in the form of bacterial and viral pathogens, harmful algal blooms, contaminated seafood and decreased well-being <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-KitePowell1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Laws1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-NationalResearch1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Fleming1">[7]</xref>. There is thus considerable interest in investigating the distribution and magnitude of these impacts in marine environments, including nearshore, coastal and open ocean locations.</p>
      <p>Assessing human impacts on such a global scale is a challenge, and current approaches to environmental monitoring are not well suited for large-scale spatial and temporal analyses. This is changing with advancements in the field of environmental genomics. Metagenomics, in tandem with next generation sequencing, now provides a technical means by which to monitor environmental microbial communities in a high-throughput manner. Metagenomics refers to the sequencing of DNA directly from environmental samples (i.e. metagenomes), and as such simultaneously provides access to the genetic information from mixed environmental microbial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Dinsdale1">[8]</xref>. With this approach, taxonomic and functional microbial diversity can be profiled and community change subsequently monitored over space and time in response to environmental or anthropogenic impacts relevant to human health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Nogales1">[9]</xref>. Microbial community composition has been shown to change in differentially impacted coastal environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Nogales2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-AguiloFerretjans1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Wu1">[12]</xref> and other anthropogenically impacted environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Dinsdale1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Tringe1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Hemme1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Sanapareddy1">[15]</xref> and thus provides a potential indicator of community stressors and stress response.</p>
      <p>Despite the potential role aquatic ecosystems may play in harboring and disseminating antibiotic resistance, little is known regarding the distribution of antibiotic resistance determinants within marine microbial communities. Antibiotic resistance continues to be a serious public health concern, as the overuse and misuse of antibiotics has led to the selection of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial populations and has thus compromised our ability to treat bacterial infections. Coastal environments are subject to a multitude of anthropogenic impacts such as sewage, hospital waste, agricultural runoff and aquaculture that increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistance determinants in microbial communities, and thus these ecosystems have the potential to be important sources and sinks for antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes and may contribute to the dissemination of resistance determinants across organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Baquero1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Taylor1">[17]</xref>. In fact, many resistance genes found in pathogenic bacteria have evolved or are sourced from resistance genes found in environmental microbial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Martinez1">[18]</xref>. Clinical resistance in many cases is therefore the result of horizontal transfer of resistance genes via mobile genetic elements from ecologically and taxonomically distant bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Aminov1">[19]</xref>, and this gene transfer has been shown to occur across a wide range of bacterial species, including pathogens to non-pathogens and vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Salyers1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Salyers2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Allen1">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, the marine environment in particular has been shown to have a high rate of horizontal gene transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-McDaniel1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The majority of studies assessing the prevalence and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in natural environments to this point have focused on specific known resistance genes using PCR-based techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Soge1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-DCosta1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Storteboom1">[26]</xref>. While these techniques provide resistance profiles for specific organisms or targeted genes, they are limited for ecosystem level applications because of these gene-by-gene and single species approaches. Thus there is limited knowledge regarding the global prevalence and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes and other resistance determinants including mobile genetic elements in natural microbial communities, and this data gap has been exacerbated by our inability to access the genomic information for unculturable bacteria, which represent &gt;99% of bacteria in the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Amann1">[27]</xref>. Metagenomics now offers a culture-independent and high-throughput approach to investigate antibiotic resistance determinants in the environment at the microbial community-level, and a number of studies have already successfully employed this approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Allen2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Donato1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-TorresCortes1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Szczepanowski1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Kristiansson1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Sommer1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Riesenfeld1">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This study uses a metagenomic approach in combination with next generation sequencing to evaluate potential differences in community composition and antibiotic resistance gene signals across a natural ecosystem using the case study of Puget Sound, Washington. Puget Sound is a partially mixed fjord-like estuary that is connected to the Pacific Ocean via the Strait of Juan de Fuca and that receives the majority of its freshwater input from rivers emptying into the Whidbey Basin region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Babson1">[35]</xref>. There are 96 publicly owned wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the Puget Sound Basin that serve over 3.5 million people from urban population centers such as Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia and Everett and process over 124 million gallons of sewage per day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Washington1">[36]</xref>. Antibiotics, heavy metals and other pollutants also enter the Sound through agricultural and urban runoff. At the same time, Puget Sound supports one of the largest shellfish industries in the country, with over 100 commercial growing areas covering 900 miles of shoreline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Washington2">[37]</xref>. The potential for these anthropogenic impacts to alter microbial community and resistance determinant composition in Puget Sound is uncertain, and baseline data is needed in order to spatially and temporally monitor these potentially health relevant human impacts.</p>

      <p>This is the first baseline survey of the taxonomic and resistance potential of microbial communities in Puget Sound. Using high-throughput and sequence-based comparative metagenomics, we identified common taxonomic and antibiotic resistance determinant signatures for the open Puget Sound locations. Comparison of these metagenomic profiles between the open Sound, a nearshore marina and effluent from a proximal WWTP revealed unique profiles across the different environments that follow a gradient of human impact. This investigation provides an initial framework by which to monitor the marine environment for genomic determinants relevant to public health.</p>

        <title>Ethics Statement</title>
        <p>All necessary permits were obtained for the described field studies. This statement applies to the collection of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent sample. Permission for the WWTP sample was granted by the West Point Treatment Plant (King County, WA), specifically Betsy Cooper (NPDES Administrator, Wastewater Treatment Division, King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks) and Rick Hammond (Chief Process Analyst, West Point Treatment Plant). No specific permits or permissions were required for the water samples collected in Puget Sound. These cruise sample locations are routinely monitored by the University of Washington Puget Sound Regional Synthesis Model (PRISM) program, and are not privately owned or protected in any way. The marina sample was taken from a public boat ramp run by the City of Seattle. These field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.</p>

        <title>Sample Collection</title>
        <p>Surface water samples (∼5 m depth) were collected aboard the R/V Thomas Thompson from October 29–30, 2010 at five stations in Puget Sound, WA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These stations have been monitored since 1998 by the University of Washington Puget Sound Regional Synthesis Synthesis Model (PRISM) program. A nearshore surface water sample was also collected at Shilshole Bay Marina in Seattle, WA on December 20, 2010 and an effluent sample from the King County West Point Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Seattle, WA was collected on January 31, 2011. The Marina is located approximately 8 miles north of central Seattle and 2 miles north of the WWTP, and includes 1,400 moorage slips (300 slips for liveaboards), public water access and a public promenade. The West Point Treatment Plant has an average daily inflow of 133 million gallons, and the wastewater is sourced from stormwater/groundwater (53%), residential (29%), commercial (17%) and industrial (1%) processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-King1">[38]</xref>. At each station and sampling location, 80 liters of water were pumped through a peristaltic pump system (Cole-Palmer, U.S.A.) and filtered sequentially (i.e. size fractionated) through 3-µm (147 mm) polycarbonate membranes (Sterlitech, WA) and 0.2-µm (147 mm) Supor membranes (Pall Corporation, U.S.A). Filters were covered with sucrose lysis buffer (50 mMTris•HCl, 40 mM EDTA, and 0.75 M sucrose) and stored at −80°C on board and then transferred to −80°C in the laboratory. For the cruise samples, physicochemical conditions (e.g. temperature, salinity, oxygen, fluorescence) were measured using a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensor array mounted on a Niskin bottle rosette (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048000-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>DNA Extraction and Sequencing</title>
        <p>DNA was extracted from the 0.2-µm filters as these filters contain the bacterial fraction of the marine community. The filters were thawed and cut into eighths. Total metagenomic DNA was extracted using the Powerwater DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocol with modifications. This kit is specifically designed for isolating DNA from filtered environmental water samples and includes inhibitor removal technology aimed at removing humic acid and other organic matter commonly found in environmental samples that can interfere with downstream analyses. The protocol modifications included an incubation at 65°C for 10 minutes following addition of Solution P1 and a lysozyme digestion (final concentration = 10 mg/ml) at 37°C for 1 hour and an RNase digestion at 37°C for 20 minutes immediately following the bead-beating step. DNA quantity and quality were estimated using the Quant-iTPicogreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, U.S.A.) and the Nanodrop-1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, DE). DNA concentrations ranged from 75 to 130 ng/µl per sample. Gel electrophoresis showed high molecular weight DNA fragments 3–12 kb in size. Approximately 3 µg of total DNA for each sample was used for a multiplexed pyrosequencing run on the Roche/454 GS FLX Titanium platform in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Washington.</p>

The ‘other’ category includes bacteria taxa present in &lt;1% of sequences in all samples, eukaryotes and viruses. Shading is proportional to the relative abundance of each taxon within a metagenome. The cladogram was displayed using hierarchical clustering and the Euclidian distance metric. See Materials and Methods for references describing the additional metagenomes used for comparison. The open Sound locations cluster with other more saline environments including open and coastal ocean samples while the Marina and WWTP effluent samples cluster within a larger clade containing other freshwater and freshwater-impacted metagenomes.</p>

        <title>Bioinformatic Analyses</title>
        <p>The 454 sequence reads were initially trimmed to remove barcoded sequences and any secondary adapter sequences. Reads containing &lt;5% of any one nucleotide were also removed. For each sample, raw reads were assembled into contigs using Newbler v. 2.5.3 (Roche Diagnostics-454 Life Sciences) with default settings except for a more stringent 95% minimum overlap identity. For taxonomic annotation, the unassembled reads were run through the Meta Genome Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology (MG-RAST) pipeline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Meyer1">[39]</xref>. This pipeline includes QC steps to eliminate low quality sequences. Reads meeting any of the following three criteria were omitted: read length &gt;2 standard deviations from the mean sample read length, read containing &gt;5 ambiguous bases or reads identical to another sequence over the first 50 bp. Unassembled reads were taxonomically annotated using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm and only sequence matches with ≥50% identity over ≥50 amino acids were retained. This algorithm assigns each read to the LCA within the set of matching taxa from the BLASTX search <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Huson1">[40]</xref>. For example, if a given read had sequence similarity to 3 different families within the same order, the read is assigned at the order level. The LCA algorithm is thus predicted to have a lower rate of false positive assignments than the best hit BLAST approach but with a higher number of unspecific assignments or no hits. Genus level annotation was performed using 16S rRNA analysis. An <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 16S rRNA reference sequence was searched against the 454 reads using BLASTN (default settings) and matching 454 reads were run through the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Wang1">[41]</xref> to classify the 16S rRNA sequences. Only those classifications with at least a 50% confidence estimate were included in the analysis. Additional environmental metagenomes used for taxonomic comparison to the Puget Sound dataset included: Sargasso Sea (GS001a, GS001b and GS001c), Chesapeake Bay (GS012) and the Gulf of Mexico (GS016) from the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Rusch1">[42]</xref>, Lake Lanier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Oh1">[43]</xref> and farm soil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Tringe2">[44]</xref>.

        <p>To identify putative antibiotic resistance genes, an expanded version of the Antibiotic Resistance Gene Database (ARDB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Liu1">[45]</xref> was generated that incorporates all sequences deposited in GenBank to date that are ≥80% identical to sequences already in the ARDB. The ARDB is a commonly used database consisting of over 23,000 resistance genes from nearly 1,700 species. A nonredundant version of the ARDB was first compiled and consisted of 3,185 sequences. An expanded dataset, termed the ARDB+, was generated by searching the sequences from this nonredundant list against GenBank using the 80% identity cutoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Liu1">[45]</xref>. The ARDB+ increases the number of nonredundant ARDB sequences to a total of 11,500 sequences. A list of 103 antibiotic resistance gene sequences from metagenomic samples that were functionally verified to confer resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Allen2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Donato1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-TorresCortes1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Sommer1">[33]</xref> was also compiled and included in the ARDB+. MetaGeneMark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Zhu1">[46]</xref> (default settings) was used to predict potential protein coding sequences for the unassembled Puget Sound and WWTP reads, and these predicted peptides were then BLASTP searched <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Camacho1">[47]</xref> against the ARDB+ (E-value &lt;10<sup>−5</sup>). Reads with ≥80% identity over an alignment length ≥50 amino acids to a resistance gene within the ARDB+ were annotated according to the best hit.</p>
        <p>Plasmid sequences were annotated by aligning the unassembled reads and contigs against the plasmid sequences available in the NCBI RefSeq database (1843 sequences) using BLASTN (E-value &lt;10<sup>−5</sup>). Only those sequences with a nucleotide sequence identity ≥95% over an alignment length of at least 100 bp were retained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Kristiansson1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Zhang1">[48]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Two approaches were used to identify transposable elements in the dataset. First, 167 unique genes annotated as transposable elements were downloaded from GenBank. Unassembled reads were then compared against these sequences using BLAST, and reads with a sequence identity ≥80% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Kristiansson1">[32]</xref> over an alignment length of at least 150 bp were annotated as transposable elements. Second, unassembled reads were compared to 41 protein motifs annotated as transposable elements within the Pfam 26.0 database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Punta1">[49]</xref> using an E-value cutoff of 10<sup>−10</sup>. Pfam is a database of conserved protein families and domains across species, where the domains represent structural and functional motifs of the protein. A significance threshold of E&lt;10<sup>−10</sup> represents a more stringent cutoff than the manually curated Pfam gathering threshold or trusted cutoff, and thus minimizes the number of false positive assignments. The abundance of transposable elements was normalized to total sequence reads per sample for the BLAST approach and to total motif counts per sample for the Pfam approach.</p>

        <p>Overrepresentation or underrepresentation of taxonomic units (domain, phylum or class) was determined using the Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles (STAMP) software package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Parks1">[50]</xref>.

Counts were normalized to total taxonomic counts to give a measure of relative abundance within a metagenome. Significance tests were run to determine whether there were statistical differences in the abundance counts across samples. Data was analyzed using a generalized linear model for binomially distributed data. Differences among open Sound samples were treated as a source of extra-binomial variability in the statistical model to provide estimates of variability for the open Sound, Marina and WWTP samples in addition to the simple binomial variability based on the counts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-McCullagh1">[52]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Shotgun metagenomics in combination with pyrosequencing were used to explore the taxonomic and antibiotic resistance determinant composition at six locations from north to south Puget Sound in addition to an effluent sample from a WWTP that deposits into the main basin of Puget Sound. The environmental data and summary statistics for the pyrosequencing run are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048000-t001">Table 1</xref>. Approximately 1.4 million reads were generated that passed the QC filter, comprising nearly 530 million base pairs of sequence data.

        <title>A Taxonomic Signature of Puget Sound</title>
        <p>Approximately 42% of the unassembled sequence reads were assigned by phylum to protein sequences within GenBank using our sequence similarity criteria of ≥50% identity and an alignment length ≥50 aa. Bacteria accounted for 93% of all annotated sequence reads, with Archaea (4%), Eukaryota (2%) and viruses (1%) comprising the remaining proportion. All communities were dominated by the phylum Proteobacteria, which accounted for 49–67% of all sequence reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As shown by the positive and negative bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g003">Figure 3</xref>, the open Sound had an overrepresentation of α- and γ-Proteobacteria and Bacteriodetes and a decreased proportion of β-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes when compared to the Marina, WWTP and other metagenomes (p-value &lt;10<sup>−15</sup> for all comparisons). The Marina exhibited a similar pattern of taxon overrepresentation when compared to the WWTP except on a smaller magnitude. The dominance of α-Proteobacteria and γ-Proteobacteria and low abundance of β-Proteobacteria in the open Sound samples has also been characterized in other open and coastal ocean locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Zinger1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-VonMering1">[54]</xref>, but α- and γ-Proteobacteria appear to represent an even larger proportion of total taxa in the open Sound samples than the other marine metagenomes included in this study except for α-Proteobacteria in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
        <p>The overrepresentation of α-Proteobacteria in the open Sound was due to a high abundance of <italic>Rhodobacterales sp.</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048000.s001">Figure S1</xref>). A total of 47,425 sequence reads from the open Sound and Marina were recruited to 92% (7x coverage) of the <italic>Rhodobacterales bacterium</italic> HTCC2255 reference genome assembly with a minimum 95% identity per read (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This genome was also previously assembled from a metagenomic sample taken from Puget Sound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Iverson1">[55]</xref>. The high abundance of <italic>Rhodobacterales</italic> is in contrast to the other marine metagenomes where <italic>Rickettsiales sp.</italic>, another group of α-Proteobacteria that includes the ubiquitous SAR11 clade, was the dominant organism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048000.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Recent metatranscriptomic samples collected from Monterey Bay, CA also contained a high abundance of <italic>Rhodobacterales sp.</italic> HTCC2255 and a large <italic>Rhodobacterales</italic>: <italic>Rickettsiales</italic> ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Ottesen1">[56]</xref>, suggesting <italic>Rhodobacterales</italic> may be a dominant organism in surface waters on the U.S. West coast. Members of the phylum Bacteroidetes have also been shown to be widespread in marine environments, and the increased proportion of this taxon in the open Sound relative to the other metagenomes is attributable to an overrepresentation of <italic>Flavobacteriales sp.</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The proportion of Actinobacteria significantly increased from ∼2% of reads in the open Sound to 13% in the Marina and 25% in the WWTP sample (p-value &lt;10<sup>−15</sup> for all comparisons). Actinobacteria was also overrepresented in the other freshwater and freshwater-impacted environments, and further analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between Actinobacteria abundance and salinity (r = <bold>−</bold>0.952; p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048000.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Actinobacteria in coastal areas has previously been suggested to be a potential signal of terrestrial or freshwater runoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-AguiloFerretjans1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Kelly1">[57]</xref>, and our results support this notion. α-Proteobacteria (r = 0.904; p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>), β-Proteobacteria (r = −0.913; p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>), γ-Proteobacteria (r = 0.860; p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>), Bacteroidetes (r = 0.612; p&lt;0.05) and Firmicutes (r = −0.644; p&lt;0.05) were also correlated with salinity, while cyanobacteria abundance was correlated with temperature (r = 0.804; p&lt;0.005). The GC-content distribution also reveals the taxonomic similarity between the open Sound samples and the differences in community composition between the open Sound, Marina and WWTP effluent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048000-t001">Table 1</xref>). The open Sound had a mean %GC of 43.62%±0.40, with a slight increase for the Marina sample (46.8%). The GC-content of the WWTP sample was significantly higher than for all other samples (56.4%).</p>
        <p>Approximately 3.3% of sequence reads were classified at the genus level by the RDP. Open Sound samples were characterized by a high abundance of <italic>Candidatus Pelagibacter</italic> (SAR11 clade) and <italic>Thalassobacter</italic> (family Rhodobacteraceae) from the phylum α-Proteobacteria and <italic>Polaribacter</italic> from Bacteroidetes. The Marina was dominated by the γ-proteobacterium <italic>Glaciecola</italic>, accounting for 28.3% of genera diversity. <italic>Glaciecola</italic> was absent in all other samples except P5 where it comprised 0.7% of genera diversity. The abundance of bacteria from the genus Acinetobacter, which has been linked to hydrocarbon degradation in marine environments and has been shown to be seasonally prevalent in a coastal marina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-AguiloFerretjans1">[11]</xref>, was not significantly different between the Marina (0.1%) and open Sound (∼0.03–0.07%) but was considerably elevated in the WWTP (1.07%). The WWTP effluent also contained more specific taxonomic markers of potential human impact. Firmicutes, which is one of the dominant phyla of the human gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Turnbaugh1">[58]</xref>, accounted for a significantly greater proportion (8.4%) of all WWTP phyla than in the other samples except farm soil, and was also associated with a number of the WWTP putative antibiotic resistance gene sequences. <italic>Clostridiales sp.</italic> was the most abundant group within Firmicutes, members of which are commonly found in human or animal feces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Cook1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Liu2">[60]</xref>. <italic>Blautia</italic> is a core human gut microbe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Claesson1">[61]</xref>, and <italic>Hespellia</italic> is a member of the family <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> within which phylotypes have been identified as genetic markers of human fecal contamination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Newton1">[62]</xref>. Other taxonomic surveys of WWTP environments have also found an increased abundance of Firmicutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-McLellan1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Albertsen1">[64]</xref>, and one recent study used the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes to α-Proteobacteria abundance as an indicator of fecal pollution in watersheds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Wu1">[12]</xref>. Thus the overabundance of Firmicutes within the WWTP distinguishes this environment from the other marine and freshwater metagenomes, and may suggest the use of this phylum as a potential indicator of human impact.</p>
        <p>Despite the spatial variation between the open Sound samples, the taxonomic composition across these surface water samples was strikingly similar and can likely be attributed to similar salinity and temperature gradients. Salinity has been shown to be one of, if not the most, important environmental parameters determining the level of similarity between isolated microbial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Lozupone1">[65]</xref>. This is evidenced by the fact that the samples cluster by salinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The open Sound samples cluster with other more saline environments including the Sargasso Sea (open ocean) and the Gulf of Mexico (coastal ocean), while the Marina and WWTP effluent cluster within a larger clade that contains other freshwater and freshwater-impacted metagenomes (Lake Lanier, Chesapeake Bay and farm soil). The freshwater clade can be described by a high proportion of Actinobacteria, an increased abundance of β-Proteobacteria and an overall increased level of diversity. The metagenomes composing this freshwater clade can also be defined as being human impacted environments, and while it is not possible to further tease apart the potential influence freshwater input versus human impact has on the taxonomic profiles, it is important to note that the two are related in that environmental pollutants can enter marine ecosystems via freshwater runoff and thus a freshwater signal may in some cases be a potential indicator of human impact.</p>
        <p>It is also important to note the potential impact temporal differences may have had on community composition. Seasonality has been shown to be a strong driver of marine microbial composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Gilbert1">[66]</xref>. While the open Sound samples were collected within a span of two days at the end of October, the Marina and effluent samples were collected approximately 7 and 12 weeks later respectively. By nature of the fact that the freshwater effluent sample is already taxonomically distinct from the marine samples due to salinity and source, temporal variability is not likely a primary explanatory variable for describing the differences in community composition. Seasonal influences are more relevant when comparing the open Sound to the Marina. Freshwater discharges from rivers into Puget Sound are at a maximum in late autumn due to rainfall runoff and this flow continues at elevated levels through the winter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Babson1">[35]</xref>. The lower salinity of the December Marina sample (∼24 ppt) may therefore correspond to increased freshwater inputs. Subsequently the community composition of the Marina sample, which includes a higher proportion of the potentially freshwater or terrestrial-sourced Actinobacteria, may reflect these seasonal differences. The temperatures of the Marina and open Sound samples were similar despite the two month lag (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048000-t001">Table 1</xref>). More temporal monitoring data is needed to better explain the role seasonality has on bacterial composition at these locations.</p>

        <title>Proportion of Putative Antibiotic Resistance Gene Sequences Differs Across Metagenomes</title>
        <p>In order to determine the abundance of putative antibiotic resistance genes in the Puget Sound and WWTP datasets, the sequence data was searched against an expanded and nonredundant ARDB (termed ARDB+) which also included 103 functional antibiotic resistance genes sequences isolated from metagenomic projects. Approximately 0.0013% (n = 18) of all sequence reads had ≥80% identity and an alignment length ≥50 aa to a sequence within the ARDB+. To validate this annotation, the 18 sequences were also searched against GenBank, and results indicated that the best protein hits within GenBank were also to antibiotic resistance genes. Of these 18 sequences, the WWTP effluent had the highest representation (n = 14), followed by the Marina (n = 4) and the open Sound (n = 0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048000.s004">Table S1</xref>). For comparison, the proportion of putative resistance gene sequences in the WWTP effluent (0.012%) was lower than that for other pyrosequenced metagenomes from different environmental matrices including a river sediment sample taken downstream from an Indian WWTP that processes large quantities of drugs (1.4%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Kristiansson1">[32]</xref> and the plasmid fraction of a WWTP activated sludge sample (1.1%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Szczepanowski1">[31]</xref>, but slightly greater than that of an activated sludge metagenome from another municipal WWTP (0.008%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Sanapareddy1">[15]</xref>. Tetracycline resistance genes had the highest representation (33%) within the 18 putative antibiotic resistance gene sequences found in our samples. The WWTP putative antibiotic resistance gene sequences had similarity to those from clinically relevant bacteria species including <italic>Clostridium</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, while resistance gene sequences from the Marina were similar to those from environmental bacteria including <italic>Desulfococcus</italic>, <italic>Polaromonas</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. The average percent protein coverage based on the sequence alignment of the 454 reads to ARDB+ sequences was 33.8%±18.9 (mean±SD).</p>
        <p>There was a significant increase in the proportion of putative resistance gene sequences from the open Sound to Marina to WWTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g005">Figure 5</xref>), suggestive of a relationship between resistance gene abundance and human impact across these environments. The fact that a differential resistance gene signal could be detected across the different environments supports using a pyrosequencing approach to identify trends in resistance gene abundance across diverse environments. Challenges still remain though in using this approach for quantification of resistance genes in metagenomes. First, the low sequencing depth per sample likely limits our ability to detect the full resistance gene repertoire of complex microbial community samples. Depth of sequencing is a significant limitation in metagenomic investigations and thus targeting specific genomic elements in whole-genome sequence data has been a considerable challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Gilbert2">[67]</xref>. This is especially relevant for aquatic samples where dilution reduces the likelihood of identifying specific genes. That only 18 sequences in the Puget Sound dataset matched to known resistance genes potentially suggests a considerable under-sampling of the resistome when using pyrosequencing. Other marine and freshwater pyrosequenced metagenomes also have a relatively rare representation of resistance genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048000.s003">Figure S3</xref>), suggesting the need for higher sequencing depths than achievable by 454 technology to fully characterize the resistomes of surface water microbial communities. For example, Illumina sequencing technology allows for greater sequencing depth than does pyrosequencing, but with shorter read lengths and therefore a greater reliance on sequence assembly, which still remains a challenge for mixed microbial communities. Secondly, the lack of sequence data for the unculturable prokaryotic majority in combination with evidence from functional metagenomic studies indicating that many environmental resistance genes appear to be distantly related and share low sequence similarity to cultured resistance genes may result in an underestimation of the actual number of resistance genes. This challenge is being addressed through further sequencing of bacterial reference genomes and functional metagenomic projects, however more research is needed. Lastly, sequence-based identification of resistance genes does not necessarily imply these genes are functionally expressed. The resistance potential can be estimated using sequence-based metagenomics, but functional metagenomics or transcriptional analysis is needed to detect functional resistance genes and more clearly define public health risks.</p>
        <p>The fate of antibiotic resistance determinants during the wastewater treatment process is relatively unknown at this time. As no influent from the WWTP was collected in this study, it is unclear what impact the wastewater treatment process had on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in the effluent. Previous studies have shown mixed results regarding resistance gene levels in pre- versus post-treated sewage. While concentrations of resistance genes in wastewater may significantly decrease through the wastewater treatment process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Munir1">[68]</xref>, other studies have found that resistance gene levels are higher in the effluent and that therefore the treatment process may be selecting for resistant bacteria, genes or mobile genetic elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Zhang2">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-FerreiradaSilva1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-Uyaguari1">[71]</xref>. Either way, the effluent had a significantly higher abundance of antibiotic resistance genes than Puget Sound, although further effluent sampling is needed to support this individual finding.</p>

A total of 124 sequence reads (0.01%) and 3 contigs from the open Sound and Marina metagenomes and 265 reads (0.22%) and 4 contigs from the WWTP matched plasmids within the NCBI RefSeq database using a similarity criteria of ≥95% sequence identity over 100 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g006">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048000.s005">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048000.s006">Table S3</xref>). There were 13 plasmids in common between the open Sound, Marina and WWTP metagenomes. The open Sound and Marina plasmid sequences were dominated by α- and γ-Proteobacteria, while the WWTP plasmids were associated with α-, β- and γ-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. At the species level, nearly half of the plasmid matches to the open Sound and Marina reads were sourced from <italic>Silicibacter sp.

        <p>Both approaches to identify transposable elements resulted in an increasing abundance of transposable elements from open Sound to Marina to WWTP, with a highly elevated proportion in the WWTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g006">Figure 6B and 6C</xref>). The Pfam approach did detect a higher proportion of transposable elements in the Marina and WWTP than the BLAST approach, as well as a significant difference in transposable element abundance between the Marina and open Sound. No significant differences in the abundance of transposable elements were seen within the open Sound samples using either approach. The most abundant transposases in the effluent included Tn3, IS4, TnpA (gene product of IS608), the mutator transposases and IS3 (specifically IS911), in addition to a large percentage of unclassified transposases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048000-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). While the most abundant transposable elements in the Puget Sound samples were the same as that for the effluent, they were for the most part present in much lower numbers. Transposable elements from the effluent were more likely to be found on plasmids than the Puget Sound samples. Approximately 20.7% of transposable elements from the effluent were annotated as being sourced from plasmids, compared to 0.039%±0.008 for the open Sound and 13.56% for the Marina.

        <p>This comparative metagenomic survey of Puget Sound has provided baseline data describing the community composition and antibiotic resistance determinant abundance across this marine environment in addition to an effluent sample from a proximal WWTP. Our results support the use of whole-genome pyrosequencing for comparing community composition across differentially impacted environments and for profiling antibiotic resistance determinants in highly impacted environments. To more completely capture the resistomes of natural environments with low human impact, sequencing technologies allowing for greater depth of sequencing may be needed. This study has highlighted the similarity of these metagenomic components in the open estuarine environment and the differences that emerge when analyzing more nearshore and human impacted ecosystems. Taken together, these results warrant further investigation into the potential for WWTP effluent to disseminate resistance determinants into the marine environment. As only one Marina and one WWTP sample were included in this study, further sampling of these environments is needed in order to support the observed trends. Furthermore, this study only analyzed surface water communities, and community composition has been show to change significantly with depth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048000-DeLong1">[81]</xref>. Increasing the spatial and temporal extents of metagenomic sampling and analysis will thus be important for longitudinal monitoring and further assessment of human impacts in marine environments.</p>
