<p>Cellular senescence irreversibly arrests cell proliferation in response to oncogenic stimuli. Human cells develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which increases the secretion of cytokines and other factors that alter the behavior of neighboring cells. We show here that “senescent” mouse fibroblasts, which arrested growth after repeated passage under standard culture conditions (20% oxygen), do not express a human-like SASP, and differ from similarly cultured human cells in other respects. However, when cultured in physiological (3%) oxygen and induced to senesce by radiation, mouse cells more closely resemble human cells, including expression of a robust SASP. We describe two new aspects of the human and mouse SASPs. First, cells from both species upregulated the expression and secretion of several matrix metalloproteinases, which comprise a conserved genomic cluster. Second, for both species, the ability to promote the growth of premalignant epithelial cells was due primarily to the conserved SASP factor CXCL-1/KC/GRO-α. Further, mouse fibroblasts made senescent in 3%, but not 20%, oxygen promoted epithelial tumorigenesis in mouse xenographs. Our findings underscore critical mouse-human differences in oxygen sensitivity, identify conditions to use mouse cells to model human cellular senescence, and reveal novel conserved features of the SASP.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular senescence was first identified as a process that limits the proliferation (growth) of human cells in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Hayflick1">[1]</xref>. These early experiments showed that cultured human fibroblasts gradually lose proliferative capacity (arrest growth) until all cells in the culture cease division. Much of this growth arrest is now known to occur because most human cells do not express telomerase. Consequently, with each cell cycle, telomeres shorten and eventually fail, generating a persistent DNA damage signal that permanently arrests growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-dAddadiFagagna1">[2]</xref>. Subsequent studies showed that non-telomeric DNA damage, and many other stressors, can also induce senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Campisi1">[3]</xref>. Indeed, cells from laboratory mice, which have long telomeres and often express telomerase, also show only limited growth in culture, but arrest because they accumulate oxidative DNA damage under standard culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Parrinello1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Cellular senescence is now recognized as a crucial tumor suppressor mechanism and formidable barrier to malignant progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Campisi1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Prieur1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Dimri1">[6]</xref>. The hallmark of senescent cells is an essentially irreversible p53- and p16<sup>INK4A</sup>/pRb-dependent cell cycle arrest. Senescent cells differ from reversibly arrested quiescent cells in several ways. For example, senescent, but not quiescent, human fibroblasts fail to induce c-Fos in response to mitogen stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Seshadri1">[7]</xref>, and express a senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-βGal) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Dimri2">[8]</xref>. Some senescent cells form distinctive heterochromatic foci (SAHFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Narita1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Zhang1">[10]</xref>, and many harbor markers of persistent DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-dAddadiFagagna1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Beliveau1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Herbig1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Rodier1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Sedelnikova1">[14]</xref>. Senescent human cells also secrete many biologically active proteins, a phenotype we term the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Coppe1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Coppe2">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The senescence response might be beneficial or deleterious, depending on the age of the organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Campisi2">[17]</xref>. To understand this apparent paradox, the SASP may be particularly important. Senescent cells increase with age in many mammalian tissues and are found at sites of age-related pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Dimri2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Jeyapalan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Paradis1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Erusalimsky1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Martin1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Roberts1">[22]</xref>. The SASP includes inflammatory cytokines that are thought to drive aging and age-related disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Finch1">[23]</xref>. Indeed, some SASP factors, when chronically present, can disrupt tissue structure and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Parrinello2">[24]</xref>, and others can promote malignant phenotypes in nearby premalignant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Coppe1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Krtolica1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Liu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Bavik1">[27]</xref>. On the other hand, some SASP factors may be beneficial. For example, some reinforce the senescence growth arrest in an autocrine manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Acosta1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Kortlever1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Kuilman1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Wajapeyee1">[31]</xref>. Others may allow damaged cells to communicate their compromised state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Rodier1">[13]</xref> in order to stimulate tissue repair or limit pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Krizhanovsky1">[32]</xref>. To date, only the SASPs of human cells have been well characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Coppe1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Bavik1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Acosta1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Kuilman1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Chang1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Hampel1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Mason1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Zhang2">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mice are important models for understanding normal and pathological processes in humans, and mouse cells are widely used to study cellular senescence – in culture and <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, there are differences between human and mouse cellular responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Parrinello1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Hasty1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Wright1">[38]</xref>. In addition to different causes for limited growth in culture, mouse, but not human, cells readily acquire an unlimited division potential (immortalization) when certain genes are mutated. Moreover, mouse, but not human, cells often spontaneously immortalize in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Yaswen1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Itahana1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Shay1">[41]</xref>. It is not known whether mouse and human cells differ in their SASPs, although senescent mouse cells were shown to secrete specific factors that can have systemic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Kortlever1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Jiang1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>The use of mice to model human disease requires understanding critical mouse-human differences, and defining conditions under which mouse cells accurately mimic human cells. We show here that the SASP is largely conserved between mouse and human fibroblasts, providing mouse cells are cultured in physiological oxygen; standard culture conditions of supraphysiological oxygen suppress the SASP. We further show that segments of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene cluster are SASP components in both species, and that CXCL-1 (KC/GRO-α) is a conserved SASP factor that promotes premalignant epithelial cell growth. Finally, we show that only mouse cells that develop a human-like SASP stimulate epithelial tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our studies identify fundamental similarities and differences in senescent phenotypes between mouse and human cells, and describe new features of the SASP that contribute to its biological activities.</p>

<title>Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotypes (SASPs) of Mouse Fibroblasts</title>
<p>To identify proteins secreted by senescent mouse cells, we used primary fibroblasts from adult mammary glands (mBFs) or embryos (MEFs). We cultured mouse cells in either atmospheric (∼20%; standard culture condition) or physiological (3%) oxygen. In 20% oxygen, presenescent (PRE) cells underwent senescence (SEN) after 8–10 population doublings (PDs), as expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Parrinello1">[4]</xref>. However, although ∼65% of these SEN cells expressed SA-βGal, ∼40% synthesized DNA, despite little or no increase in cell number (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009188-t001">Table 1</xref>). Because this SEN arrest is driven by oxidative DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Parrinello1">[4]</xref>, we term it SEN(OXI). Mouse cells proliferate for many more PDs in 3% oxygen, as expected of cells with telomerase and long telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Parrinello1">[4]</xref>. Nonetheless, they undergo an efficient senescence arrest in response to high dose (10 Gy) ionizing (X-ray) radiation (XRA). SEN(XRA) mouse cells also expressed SA-βGal (∼75%), but very few (&lt;5%) synthesized DNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009188-t001">Table 1</xref>). In this regard, SEN(XRA) mouse cells resembled SEN human cells, whether made senescent by replication in culture (REP) or XRA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Coppe1">[15]</xref>. To compare PRE and SEN cells, we made PRE cells quiescent by culturing to confluence, thereby controlling for effects of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009188-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine the SASPs of murine cells, we collected serum-free conditioned media (CM) from PRE, SEN(OXI) and SEN(XRA) cells, normalized for cell number, and analyzed the CM using antibody arrays designed to detect 62 proteins selected for roles in intercellular signaling. We used a modified radioactivity-based detection protocol that greatly improved the assay's reliability and sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Coppe1">[15]</xref>.

<p>MEFs and mBFs cultured in 3% O<sub>2</sub> and induced to senesce by XRA secreted numerous proteins at significantly higher levels than similarly cultured PRE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). In this regard, SEN(XRA) mouse cells resembled human cells made senescent by XRA and other means <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Coppe1">[15]</xref>. (Unless noted otherwise, we pooled data from four human fibroblast strains, two embryonic lung (HEF) and two neonatal foreskin (HSF) strains). Because the factors secreted by SEN(XRA) mouse cells overlapped substantially with the human SASP, we conclude that mouse cells express a human-like SASP, at least when induced to senesce at a physiological O<sub>2</sub> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>–C for arrays, significance and comparisons).</p>
<p>In striking contrast, SEN(OXI) mouse cells secreted no factor at substantially higher levels than PRE cells, whether PRE cells were cultured in 20% or 3% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>,B). Thus, SEN(OXI) cells, unlike SEN(XRA) cells in 3% O<sub>2</sub>, do not develop a SASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In this regard, mouse cells differed markedly from human cells. That is, ambient O<sub>2</sub> strongly influenced the secretory profile of SEN mouse cells, but had only minor effects on that of SEN human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Coppe1">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1C–E</xref>). Further, the secretory profile of PRE mouse cells proliferating in 20% O<sub>2</sub> bore little resemblance to that of PRE mouse cells proliferating in 3% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1D</xref>), whereas PRE human cells had similar profiles whether cultured in 3% or 20% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1D</xref>). In addition, PRE mouse cells proliferating in 20% O<sub>2</sub> and then irradiated developed a weak SASP, compared to the robust SASP that developed in 3% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>,B,E). SEN human cells, in contrast, developed robust SASPs, whether irradiated in 20% or 3% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1F</xref>).</p>
<p>Further analyses emphasized the strikingly different effects of O<sub>2</sub> on proteins secreted by SEN mouse and human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). For mouse cells, SEN in 3% O<sub>2</sub> [SEN(XRA)] resulted in significantly elevated secretion of 31 proteins (of 62 on the array). None of these 31 proteins (0 overlap) showed elevated secretion upon SEN in 20% O<sub>2</sub> [SEN(OXI)], and 4 showed decreased secretion. For human cells, SEN in 3% O<sub>2</sub> [SEN(REP or XRA)] resulted in significantly elevated secretion of 58 proteins (of 120 on the array). SEN in 20% O<sub>2</sub> elevated 31 proteins, 18 of which overlapped with those that increased in 3% O<sub>2</sub>. Hierarchical clustering, which groups profiles on the basis of overall correlation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Eisen1">[43]</xref>, showed that, for mouse cells, the SEN(OXI) secretory profiles clustered with the PRE profiles, whereas the SEN(XRA) profiles formed an outlier cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). By contrast, the profiles of human (HSF and HEF) fibroblasts clustered on the basis of their senescence status, rather than origin or the O<sub>2</sub> concentration in which they were cultured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). Thus, mouse cells that arrest growth in 20% O<sub>2</sub> [SEN(OXI)] do not share secretory characteristics with SEN human cells, or mouse cells that senesce in physiological O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

To better understand O<sub>2</sub>-dependent differences between mouse and human cells, we assessed PRE and SEN cells for one or more (1+) 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g003">Fig. 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>).

No PRE culture had &gt;25% 53BP1-positive cells. When mouse cultures were induced to senesce in 3% O<sub>2</sub> by XRA [SEN(XRA)], the fraction of cells with 1+ 53BP1 foci rose, similar to human cells induced to senesce by XRA or REP regardless of O<sub>2</sub> concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Rodier1">[13]</xref>.

Although neither the IL-6 nor IL-8 in SEN CM stimulated malignant epithelial cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>), CXCL-1, a known epithelial cell growth factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Wang1">[44]</xref>, was potent in this regard. PRE CM, whether human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>) or mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), supported basal epithelial cell growth; for mouse cells, neither O<sub>2</sub> nor spontaneous immortalization affected secreted CXCL-1 (KC) levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s005">Fig. S5B</xref>) or growth stimulatory activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s005">Fig. S5C</xref>). However, recombinant GROα or KC, added to PRE CM at concentrations comparable to those in SASPs (determined by ELISA), stimulated epithelial cell growth by 175–300% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g006">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). Conversely, addition of GROα or KC blocking antibodies to SEN CM significantly reduced growth stimulatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g006">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). These findings identify CXCL-1 as a key conserved SASP factor responsible for stimulating the growth of premalignant and malignant epithelial cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mice are used extensively to model many human diseases, including cancer, despite mouse-human differences in fundamental processes such as telomere biology and cellular senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Hasty1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Wright2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Hornsby1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Shay2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Garinis1">[49]</xref>. Notably, oxygen sensitivity severely limits the growth of mouse, but not human, cells under standard (hyperphysiological O<sub>2</sub>) culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Parrinello1">[4]</xref>. We show here that this O<sub>2</sub> hypersensitivity severely affects the secretory profile of mouse cells. Hyperphysiological O<sub>2</sub> causes murine cells to arrest in a state termed senescence, but the phenotype of such cells differs from that of senescent human cells – and mouse cells that senesce under lower O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Although mouse cells failed to develop a human-like SASP when cultured in 20% O<sub>2</sub>, the SASPs overlapped substantially when mouse cells were cultured and induced to senesce in physiological O<sub>2</sub>. Under these conditions, the mouse and human SASPs showed substantial qualitative and quantitative conservation. In both cases, prominent secreted factors included inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukins) and growth factors and regulators (e.g., IGFBPs, GROα/KC), and shed or soluble forms of adhesion molecules and cell surface receptors (e.g., TNFRs, CAMs). We show further that the human and mouse SASPs include several MMPs. The genes encoding these MMPs form a contiguous gene cluster in both the mouse and human genomes. Of interest, MMPs encoded near the center of these clusters were most highly secreted, whereas those at the 3′ and 5′ ends were expressed at lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Two other families of conserved SASP factors (the CXCL and CCL families) are also organized as contiguous gene clusters. These findings suggest that activation of the SASP may entail remodeling of large chromosomal segments, a possibility we are currently exploring.</p>
<p>In addition to conservation at the level of individual factors, biological activities of the SASP were also conserved between mice and humans. Both SASPs stimulated the growth of premalignant and malignant epithelial cells in co-culture models. Moreover, mouse fibroblasts that expressed a SASP stimulated tumor growth in mice, similar to senescent human fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Krtolica1">[25]</xref>. We found that much of the SASP growth stimulatory activity was due to secreted CXCL-1 (human GROα, mouse KC). This potent epithelial growth factor has also been shown to induce or reinforce the senescence growth arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Yang1">[50]</xref>, similar to recently reported activities of the SASP factors IL-6 and IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Acosta1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Kuilman1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>The fact that some SASP factors help maintain the senescence growth arrest reinforces the apparently paradoxical effects of the senescence response. The senescence growth arrest is an important mechanism for preventing the growth of damaged cells, which are at risk for malignant transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Campisi1">[3]</xref>. In this regard, activity of SASP factors to reinforce the growth arrest is likely beneficial. Further, the SASP may allow damaged cells to communicate their compromised state to surrounding cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Rodier1">[13]</xref> in order to stimulate tissue repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Krizhanovsky1">[32]</xref>. However, when senescent cells are chronically present, which appears to be the case as mammalian organisms age and in several chronic degenerative diseases of aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Campisi2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Jeyapalan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Paradis1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Erusalimsky1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Martin1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Roberts1">[22]</xref>, they may disrupt normal tissue function and drive aging phenotypes and age-related disease, including cancer. This possibility is strengthened by the fact that SASP includes factors that can stimulate inflammation, which underlies many age-related pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Finch1">[23]</xref>. Our finding that the mouse and human SASPs share many features, and the identification of culture conditions under which the mouse SASP can be studied, suggests that mice can be used to understand how the beneficial and deleterious effects of the senescence response are balanced.</p>
<p>Our finding that mouse cells that senesce in 20% O<sub>2</sub> do not develop a SASP adds to the anomalies shown by mouse cells when cultured under hyperoxia. Although under these conditions mouse cells arrest growth and express SA-βGal activity, many of these ‘senescent’ cells continue to synthesize DNA and they retain serum-inducible c-Fos expression. Senescent human cells, and mouse cells made senescent in physiological O<sub>2</sub>, do not share these characteristics. Further, mouse cells that arrest growth in 20% O<sub>2</sub> do not accumulate persistent DNA damage (53BP1) foci, which mark DNA double strand breaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Ward1">[51]</xref> and correlate with inflammatory cytokine secretion by senescent human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Rodier1">[13]</xref>. Nonetheless, mouse cells that ‘senesce’ in 20% O<sub>2</sub> accumulate oxidative DNA lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Parrinello1">[4]</xref>, and such cells are capable of expressing a SASP, albeit weakly, when irradiated (which causes double strand breaks). Others have found that MEFs from 129Sv mice arrest growth in 20% O<sub>2</sub> and do not spontaneously immortalize but do harbor DNA damage foci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-DiMicco1">[52]</xref>. We predict that these cells might also display a SASP, although this was not tested. The mouse SEN(OXI) state displayed by other mouse strains may be a unique senescence growth arrest, dissociated from the senescence secretory program, although it is not clear whether or how this state relates to organismal physiology or pathology.</p>

In graphical representation, error bars correspond to standard deviation around the mean. For determination of the significance of overlap, we used the hypergeometric distribution with the following parameters: population size  = 46 (total orthologs proteins on human and mouse array), sample size  = 22 (mouse SASP), successes in population  = 20 (human SASP; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1C</xref> and our previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009188-Coppe1">[15]</xref>), successes in sample  = 14 (qualitative overlap between the mouse and human SASPs).

<p>Mouse Secretome: Computational analysis of antibody array data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1</xref> (PRE, SEN(XRA), SEN(OXI), and IM mouse fibroblasts cultured in 3% and 20% oxygen condition) The first spreadsheet (“mouse data_raw_ave_fold”) is composed of six main blocks: column A-AT lists the raw antibody array read outs of all 45 mouse cell samples (62 factors); column AW-BK lists the average values for each different group of samples; column BN-CE lists fold average values against the mean within each cell strain; column CH-CY is the log2 of column BN-CE; column DB-EU lists fold of all raw values against the mean of each cell strain; column EX-GQ is the log2 fold of column DB-EU. The second spreadsheet (“mouse data_ttest_log2fold”) lists in column A-AT the data log2 fold of all raw values against the mean of each cell strain (that is column EX-GQ from the first spreadsheet), and calculates in column AV-AY the significance (Student t-test) of variation between subpopulations of interest; finally, the log2 fold average values against the mean of each cell strain (extracted from the column CH-CY in the first spreadsheet) are reorganized as represented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1</xref>. The third spreadsheet (“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>”) extracts only the significant variations from the second spreadsheet (as listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The fourth spreadsheet (“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009188-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>”) extracts data from the two first spreadsheets and compare directly the SEN(XRA) and SEN(OXI) secretomes. The fifth spreadsheet (“<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1</xref>”) rearranges the data as presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009188.s001">Fig. S1</xref>. These data can be used for clustering and correlative analysis.</p>

<p>Gene Orthology: List of human and mouse genes corresponding to the specific proteins detected by antibody array The first spreadsheet (“human gene IDs + mouse orthologs”) lists all human genes found on the human antibody arrays and their corresponding mouse orthologs.

Conversely, the second spreadsheet (“mouse vs human SASPs”) lists all mouse secreted factors and their related t-test values, and lists in parallel all corresponding human orthologs and secretory profiles and t-test values. Only SEN(XRA) at 3% is considered here. In the third spreadsheet (“h&amp;m SASPs ranking (1)”), spreadsheets 1 and 2 are merged to obtain the ranking order of all significantly altered mouse or human SASP factors. The non-SASP factors were given a value of 0; SASP factors were assigned the value of their rank within their population (either human or mouse). The fourth spreadsheet (“h&amp;m SASPs ranking (2)”) shows the direct calculation for Spearman ranking correlation, using the square value of the difference of ranking between human and mouse orthologous secretory profiles.</p>
