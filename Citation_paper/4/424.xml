<abstract>
<p>Our previous work demonstrated that application of a bio-organic fertilizer (BIO) to a banana mono-culture orchard with serious <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease effectively decreased the number of soil <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. and controlled the soil-borne disease. Because bacteria are an abundant and diverse group of soil organisms that responds to soil health, deep 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing was employed to characterize the composition of the bacterial community to investigate how it responded to BIO or the application of other common composts and to explore the potential correlation between bacterial community, BIO application and <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease suppression. After basal quality control, 137,646 sequences and 9,388 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from the 15 soil samples. <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> were the most frequent phyla and comprised up to 75.3% of the total sequences. Compared to the other soil samples, BIO-treated soil revealed higher abundances of <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> and <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>, while <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> were found in lower abundance. Meanwhile, on genus level, higher abundances compared to other treatments were observed for <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> and <italic>Gp4</italic>. Correlation and redundancy analysis showed that the abundance of <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> and the soil total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen content were higher after BIO application, and they were all positively correlated with disease suppression. Cumulatively, the reduced <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease incidence that was seen after BIO was applied for 1-year might be attributed to the general suppression based on a shift within the bacteria soil community, including specific enrichment of <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Banana <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease, which is caused by <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>cubense</italic> race 4 (FOC) and reported to be the most limiting factor in banana production worldwide, has spread quickly in <italic>Cavendish</italic>-production areas since 1996, and it affects approximately 90% of the banana industry in China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-ODonnell1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Chen1">[3]</xref>. Among the managements for controlling the disease, such as crop rotation, biocontrol, application of chemical fungicides and cropping of resistant banana cultivars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Getha1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Sivamani1">[8]</xref>, biocontrol is the most promising technique for disease prevention because of owning the advantages of environmental protection, safety, high economic benefits and longevity at the same time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Wang1">[9]</xref>. However, direct inoculation of functional microorganisms into the soil without a suitable organic substrate cannot be expected to be successful due to the absence of nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-ElHassan1">[10]</xref>. Many reports have demonstrated that biocontrol agents combined with organic materials to create novel bio-organic fertilizers (BIOs) can enhance the suppression of <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease in the soil by ameliorating the structure of the microbial community <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Kavino1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Zhao1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>The composition of the soil microbial community and induced changes caused by its amendment, provide useful information on soil health and quality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Poulsen1">[15]</xref>. Maintaining biodiversity of soil microbes is crucial to soil health because a decrease in soil microbial diversity is responsible for the development of soil-borne diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Mazzola1">[16]</xref>. Determining the responses of soil bacterial communities to different organic amendments is particularly important because the bacterial community is one of the main components that determine soil health and is believed to be one of the main drivers in disease suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Garbeva1">[17]</xref>. Despite the known key roles of bacteria in soil health and the significant change in soil bacterial composition and activity after BIO application, information regarding the variation of soil bacterial communities that are affected by different organic amendments is still lacking. More importantly, understanding soil microbial community structure shifts following implementation of various organic amendments is an important component when selecting fertilizer types to improve soil function and health.</p>
<p>As described in our previous work, <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease was more effectively controlled by a 1-year application of BIO than by the other composts in a field experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Shen1">[12]</xref>. In that study, the effects of different types of composts on soil bacterial communities were mainly assessed using traditional PCR-DGGE fingerprinting and culture-dependent methods. Taking into account the large size of the bacterial community and the heterogeneity of the soils, only a tiny fraction of the bacterial diversity was unraveled by that study. Recently, pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA gene fragments has been applied for in-depth analysis of soil bacterial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-AcostaMartinez1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Roesch1">[19]</xref>. This method could provide a large number of parallel reads to characterize the unseen majority of the soil microbial community and offer an opportunity to achieve a high throughput and deeper insight into the effects of different types of composts on soil bacterial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Binladen1">[20]</xref>, thus it is an improvement over previous fingerprinting techniques, such as PCR-DGGE or T-RFLP, which are not entirely specific and do not result in many sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Poulsen1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>We used a deep 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing approach to further investigate how the soil bacteria community responded to the application of BIO or other common composts and to explore the potential correlation between bacterial community, BIO application and <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease suppression. This study was the first to provide information on the banana soil bacterial community in a single soil type that was exposed to different organic amendments using deep 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing. Therefore, the aims of this study were to answer the following questions: (1) Does the soil bacteria community that is amended with BIO differ from that exposed to other common composts? (2) Does the <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease incidence correlate with the bacterial community? (3) Does the disease suppression after BIO application correlate with the physicochemical properties of the soil?</p>

<title>Field experiment</title>
<p>Five treatments were established as randomized, complete block designs with three replicates at the “Wan Zhong” banana orchard in Hainan, China and included a general operation control (GCK) and soil that was amended with four different types of organic amendments: bio-organic fertilizer (BIO), cattle manure compost (CM), Chinese medicine residue compost (CMR) and pig manure compost (PM). And each replicate was planted with 170 banana tissue culture plantlets (<italic>Musa acuminate</italic> AAA <italic>Cavendish</italic> cv. Brazil) with an area of 667 m<sup>2</sup>. Worthy to notify, the bio-organic fertilizer (BIO) contained a biocontrol agent <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. and was prepared by a solid fermentation method according to Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Chen2">[21]</xref>. The orchard has been continuously cropped banana for more than 10 years and was abandoned by farmers to growing banana for high <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease incidence (50%).

<title>Soil sample collection and DNA extraction</title>
<p>The soil sample collection and DNA extraction methods were described in detail as supplementary information to our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Shen1">[12]</xref>. Five individual, healthy banana trees that were at least 5 m apart in each treatment plot were randomly selected for sample collection, and the collected soil samples from each tree were mixed as a composite soil sample for each replicate plot. For each tree, composite soil from 4 random sites of the trunk base was collected using a 25-mm soil auger at a depth of 20 cm. All soil samples were transported to the laboratory and stored at −70°C for subsequent DNA extraction after sifting through a 2-mm sieve. Total soil DNA was extracted using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kits (MoBio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration and quality (ratio of A260/A280) of the DNA were determined using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000, ThermoScientific, USA).</p>

<p>PCR reactions for each sample were performed in triplicate (including two negative control reactions) with 2 µM of each primer, 0.25 µM of dNTPs, 4 µL of 5 × FastPfu Buffer, 1 U of FastPfu DNA polymerase (2.5 U/µL, TransGen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) and approximately 20 ng of soil DNA template at a final volume of 20 µL. The forward primer consisted of the 25-bp 454 adapter A, 2-bp linker A and 15-bp universal bacterial primer 27F <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Dethlefsen1">[22]</xref>, and the reverse primer consisted of the 25-bp 454 adapter B, 2-bp linker B, a 10-bp barcode and the 19-bp universal bacterial primer 533R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Huse1">[23]</xref>. Detailed information regarding the primer sequence is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098420.s001">Table S1</xref>. These primers target an approximately 500-bp region of the 16 S rRNA gene that contains variable regions 1 to 3 (V1–V3), which is well-suited for accurate phylogenetic placement of bacterial sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Liu1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Amplifications were performed using an Eppendorf Mastercycler thermocycler (Eppendorf North America, Hauppauge, NY) with the following temperature program: an initial denaturation step of 95°C for 4 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 30 s and a final elongation at 72°C for 5 min. PCR amplicon libraries were purified from a 1.2% agarose gel and quantified using the PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Promega, USA). Equal amplicons from each sample were then pooled in equimolar concentrations into a single aliquot. After cleaning, precipitating, and re-suspending the amplicons in nuclease-free water, an emPCR was carried out to attach the single strands onto beads for further 454 pyrosequenicng. Pyrosequencing was performed on a Roche 454 GS-FLX Titanium System at Majorbio Bio-pharm Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China).</p>

<title>Bioinformatic analysis</title>
<p>After pyrosequencing, raw sequences were analyzed using the Mothur software following the Schloss standard operating procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Schloss1">[25]</xref>. Briefly, sequences with a minimum flow length of 450 flows were denoised using the Mothur-based reimplementation of the PyroNoise algorithm with the default parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Quince1">[26]</xref>. Sequences with more than 1 mismatch to the barcode, 2 mismatches to the primer, any ambiguous base call, homopolymers longer than 8 bases and reads shorter than 250 bp were eliminated, and the filtered sequences were then trimmed and assigned to soil samples based on unique 10-base barcodes. After removing the barcode and primer sequences, the unique sequences were aligned against the Silva bacteria database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Pruesse1">[27]</xref>. After screening, filtering, preclustering, and chimera removal, the retained sequences were used to build a distance matrix with a distance threshold of 0.2. Using the average neighbor algorithm with a cut-off of 97% similarity, bacterial sequences were clustered to operational taxonomic units (OTU), and the representative sequence for each OTU was picked and classified using a Ribosomal Database Project naive Bayesian rRNA classifier with a confidence threshold of 80% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Wang2">[28]</xref>. Lastly, the resulting matches for each set of sequence data were summarized at various levels of taxonomic hierarchal structure (e.g., phylum and genera). All raw sequences have been deposited in DDBJ SRA under the accession number DRA001282.</p>
<p>To correct for sampling effects, we used a randomly selected subset of 7,817 sequences per sample to further analyze the richness and diversity of the bacterial community. All analyses were based on the OTU clusters with a cut-off of 3% dissimilarity. The richness index of the Chao1 estimator (Chao1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Chao1">[29]</xref> and the abundance-based Coverage estimator (ACE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Eckburg1">[30]</xref> was calculated to estimate the number of observed OTUs that were present in the sampling assemblage. The diversity within each individual sample was estimated using the nonparametric Shannon diversity index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Washington1">[31]</xref>. Good's nonparametric Coverage estimator was used to estimate the percentage of the total species that were sequenced in each sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Bunge1">[32]</xref>, and a rarefaction curve generated using the Mothur software was used to compare the relative levels of bacterial OTU diversity across all soil samples.</p>
<p>To compare bacterial community structures across all samples, a heat map based on the abundant phyla were performed in R (Version 3.0.2) with the gplots package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Warnes1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-R1">[34]</xref>, and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on the OTU composition was performed using the Mothur software. To examine the relationship between the frequencies of abundant phyla, samples and environmental variables, redundancy analysis (RDA) was carried out using CANOCO for Windows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Etten1">[35]</xref>.</p>

<p>The relationships between the selected taxonomy group (abundant phyla or genera) or bacterial community indices (Chao1, ACE and Shannon) and <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease incidence (DI) were calculated using the SPSS 13.0 software program. For all parameters, data were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at the end of each bioassay.

Unfortunately, some classified genera that were generally considered to contain plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains, which can suppress soil-borne fungi or promote plant growth, were only present in limited amounts, and their presence was not correlated with disease incidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098420.s004">Table S4</xref>). Furthermore, in our research, no significant correlation was found between the whole bacteria community indices (richness and diversity) and disease incidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098420.s005">Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>The RDA that was performed on the phyla data and soil chemical properties showed that the first two RDA components could explain 88.6% of the total variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098420-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The first component (RDA1) separated the BIO and CMR treatments from the other fertilizer treatments and explained 61.1% of the variation, and the second component (RDA2), which separated the BIO from the CMR treatment, explained 27.5% of the variation. All soil chemical properties sufficiently explained the variation in phyla data (p = 0.002, Monte Carlo test). Ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and electricity conductivity (EC) accounted for a large amount of the variation in the distribution of the BIO treatment from other treatments along the RDA1 and RDA2 axes. As shown by their close grouping and by the vectors, BIO-treated soil with the lowest disease incidence was positively related to the higher relative abundant phyla of <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> and <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic>, the higher content of NH4-N and the EC, and it was negatively related to <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, a higher content of soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and higher total carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N). Furthermore, the relative abundance of <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> was positively correlated with soil pH, EC and NH4-N contents and negatively correlated with the soil total carbon (TOC) and C/N ratio. Moreover, the relative abundance of <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> was positively correlated with the total nitrogen (TON) and NH4-N contents of the soil and negatively correlated with the soil C/N ratio. In contrast, the relative abundance of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> was positively correlated with the soil C/N ratio and negatively correlated with the soil TON and NH4-N contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098420-g006">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098420.s006">Table S6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our previous study, the main potential mechanism by which the BIO application reduced the <italic>Fusarium</italic> population has been revealed by culture-depended and PCR-DGGE methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Shen1">[12]</xref>. However, deeper research should be done to further explore the potential mechanism. To our knowledge, this detailed comparison of the soil bacteria community after the application of BIO or other common composts in a banana orchard with serious <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease was the first to be assessed using deep 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing, although this method has been used to study the long-term effects of selected, common composts on the soil bacteria community composition or structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Poulsen1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Chaudhry1">[36]</xref>. The obtained results supported the hypothesis that soil amended with different organic materials showed different responses by the bacterial community or suppression of <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Poulsen1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Bonanomi1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Sun1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>Phyla analysis revealed that <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic>, <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Firmicutes</italic> were the most common phyla, but with some variety in relative abundance. This finding roughly corresponded with those of previous articles that investigated agricultural or other type soils in which these phyla accounted for more than 74.0% of the sequences that were examined using deep 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-AcostaMartinez1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Roesch1">[19]</xref>. The relative abundance of <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> was relatively high in our study due to the experiment being conducted in acidic soil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Lauber1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Rousk1">[41]</xref>. However, in our study, BIO and PM treatments with the higher pH showed the higher relative abundance of <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>. This finding was contrary to a previous study that showed that pH had a negative relation to <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Lauber1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Shen2">[42]</xref>. The reason for this phenomenon is still unclear and may be due to the narrow pH value range of the treated soil; however, a few articles have shown no obvious correlation between pH and abundance of <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Poulsen1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Chaudhry1">[36]</xref>. Analysis of the most abundant genera (&gt;1%) also revealed significant differences between the bacterial communities of different treatments, a higher abundance of <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> and <italic>Gp4</italic> in BIO-treated soil compared to other soil samples.</p>
<p>These changes could correspond to the decline of <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease incidence. Thus, further correlation analysis was performed. Interestingly, the results showed that <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease incidence might be related to the <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> phyla and/or <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> genus, which belongs to <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic>, <italic>Ohtaekwangia</italic>, which belongs to <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, which belongs to <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>. The high abundance of the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> phylum and the <italic>Ohtaekwangia</italic> genus that was observed in this study might positively correspond to <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease incidence because this finding is in accordance with the report that the relative abundance of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> was similar between the initial and disease stages and followed by a significant decrease when suppressiveness was reached, as investigated using a 16 S rRNA-based microarray method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Sanguin1">[43]</xref>, although, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> was also reported to possess the potential ability for biocontrol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Kyselkov1">[44]</xref>. Moreover, we found the <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> phylum and <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> genera might respond to the suppression of <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease via BIO application. <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> and <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> are a recently proposed genus and phylum, respectively, and they widely exist in multiple terrestrial and aquatic habitats. However, little is known about the ecological functions of this genus/phylum, except that Yin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Yin1">[45]</xref> reported that the <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> genus was found at a higher frequency in the rhizosphere of healthy plants using 454 pyrosequencing. <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, which belongs to the <italic>Sphingomonadaceae</italic> order and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> phylum, is widely distributed in natural habitats and is utilized for a wide range of biotechnological applications due to its remarkable biodegradative and biosynthetic capabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Balkwill1">[46]</xref>. Kyselková et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Kyselkov1">[44]</xref> reported that bacteria affiliated with <italic>Sphingomonadaceae</italic> were more prevalent in tobacco-suppressive rhizosphere soil. Wachowska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Wachowska1">[47]</xref> also reported that <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> could be used as biological agents to control winter wheat pathogens, such as <italic>Fusarium</italic>, under greenhouse conditions.</p>
<p>Analysis using rarefaction, Chao1 and ACE showed that the OTU numbers for BIO treatment were not significantly higher than for the other treatments. Furthermore, the diversity for BIO treatment that was estimated by the Shannon index and Coverage was also not the highest. All of the results indicated that a 1-year application of BIO could not significantly increase the bacteria community richness and diversity at the whole-community-structure level, which was in accordance with results of a previous study that used pyrosequencing to show that soil bacterial community richness and diversity were similar after a 5-year application of different organic amendments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Poulsen1">[15]</xref>. Although many previous articles indicated that the richness and/or diversity of the soil microbial community may respond to disease incidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Shen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Qiu1">[38]</xref>, this phenomenon was not observed in this study because no obvious correlation between the indices and <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098420.s005">Table S5</xref>). This may be due to all 1-year treatments being performed on the same soil, which possessed similar bacteria community indices at the beginning.</p>
<p>In our study, the results of phylogenetic structure analyzed using the hierarchical cluster tree, heat map analysis based on the phyla frequency and PCoA analysis based on the OTU composition all showed that the bacterial community of BIO-treated soil differed from the common compost treatments (CM, CMR, and PM) and the control (GCK). All of the results confirmed that BIO application altered the bacterial community, which was roughly similar to the results of our previous investigation using PCR-DGGE that showed that BIO-treated soil grouped away from other soil samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Shen1">[12]</xref>. Poulsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Poulsen1">[15]</xref> also reported similar results suggesting that soil amended with MSW-compost was separate from other amendments or the control, which indicated that the soil bacterial community responds differently to different compost amendments.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the chemical properties of soil can influence the suppressiveness of soil towards diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Hper1">[48]</xref>. In our RDA analysis, the BIO treatment with lowest <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease incidence was highly correlated with the highest proportion of <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> and lowest proportion of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>. Furthermore, the proportion of <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> was positively correlated with soil pH, EC and NH4-N and negatively correlated with TOC and the C/N ratio. However, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> was positively correlated with the soil C/N ratio and negatively correlated with TON and NH4-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098420-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098420.s006">Table S6</xref>). Therefore, suppression of <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease might be highly correlated with soil properties because <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease incidence was positively correlated with the C/N ratio and negatively correlated to NH4-N and TON (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098420.s007">Table S7</xref>), which was in agreement with reports from several previous studies. For example, Hamel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Hamel1">[49]</xref> reported a positive association between the TON content of the soil and the suppressiveness towards <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. on asparagus. However, the form of N, either as NO3-N or NH4-N, is also important for disease suppression. Pérez-Piqueres et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-PrezPiqueres1">[50]</xref> reported that suppressive soil contained higher rates of NH4–N than conductive soil when studying the effect of compost amendment on soil suppressiveness toward <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> disease, and Mallett and Maynard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Mallett1">[51]</xref> reported that the incidence of <italic>Armillaria</italic> root disease significantly increased with decreasing NH4-N concentration on the organic surface horizon. In contrast, Oyarzun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Oyarzun1">[52]</xref> reported that the disease suppression ability of <italic>Thielaviopsis basicola</italic> was positively associated with a decreased C/N ratio.</p>
<p>In this study, after analyzing all of the data, the abundance of <italic>Bacillus</italic> was not enriched after BIO application. This finding combined with our previous results, the main mechanism reduced the <italic>Fusarium</italic> population for BIO application might be attributed to a general suppression that the BIO application altered the soil microbial composition and stimulated the population of soil bacteria, actinomycetes and some beneficial microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098420-Shen1">[12]</xref>, indicated that the genus might not necessarily reflect the individual species that has functional importance in suppressing endemic soil disease and all the results revealed by further deep 16S rRNA pyrosequencing confirmed that the main potential mechanism by which the BIO application reduced the <italic>Fusarium</italic> population was deduced to the fact that the specific bio-organic fertilizer containing functional microbes altered the soil microbial composition and stimulated the population of some beneficial microorganisms, thus resulting in a general suppression.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Deep 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing assessment of soil bacterial communities from different compost-treated soil in a monoculture banana orchard revealed significant differences among all treatments, including differences in community structure, composition, richness, diversity and bacterial phylogeny. Phyla of <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> and <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> were significantly elevated in BIO treatment in comparison to other treatments. A decrease was also found for <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> in BIO treatment. Moreover, genera of <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> and <italic>Gp4</italic> were significantly elevated in BIO treatment in comparison to other treatments. Additionally, the enrichment of <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> and the TON and NH4-N soil content was positively correlated with disease suppression. Cumulatively, the reduction of the <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease incidence after a 1-year application of BIO might be attributed to the fact that application of a BIO fertilizer containing <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. induced general suppression in the soil by modulating the bacterial community and specific suppression by enriching <italic>Gemmatimonas</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>.</p>
