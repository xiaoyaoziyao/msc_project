<abstract>
<p>Marine microbes degrade dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which is produced in large quantities by marine algae and plants, with DMSP lyases into acrylate and the gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Approximately 10% of the DMS vents from the sea into the atmosphere and this emission returns sulfur, which arrives in the sea through rivers and runoff, back to terrestrial systems via clouds and rain. Despite their key role in this sulfur cycle DMSP lyases are poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we report the first X-ray crystal structure of the putative DMSP lyase <italic>Rd</italic>DddP from <italic>Roseobacter denitrificans</italic>, which belongs to the abundant DddP family. This structure, determined to 2.15 Å resolution, shows that <italic>Rd</italic>DddP is a homodimeric metalloprotein with a binuclear center of two metal ions located 2.7 Å apart in the active site of the enzyme. Consistent with the crystallographic data, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TRXF) revealed the bound metal species to be primarily iron. A 3D structure guided analysis of environmental DddP lyase sequences elucidated the critical residues for metal binding are invariant, suggesting all proteins in the DddP family are metalloenzymes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is a metabolite synthesized by marine algae and plants, (∼10<sup>9</sup> tonnes per year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Curson1">[1]</xref>) where it functions as an osmolyte, chemical attractant-deterrent and possibly as an antioxidant precursor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Dickson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Sunda1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Kiene1">[4]</xref>. Blooms of single celled phytoplankton produce the bulk of DMSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g001">Figure 1</xref>), reaching concentrations of several µM in the surrounding seawater and intracellular concentrations of up to 1 M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Gibson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Kiene1">[4]</xref>.</p>

<p>Marine microbes are key in DMSP cycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Reisch1">[6]</xref> by catalyzing its cleavage into acrylate and dimethyl sulfide (DMS), thereby releasing ∼300 million tonnes of DMS per year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Curson1">[1]</xref>. Approximately 10% of the DMS vents from ocean waters and constitutes the major natural emission of sulphur to the atmosphere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Kiene1">[4]</xref>, returning the element in the form of oxidised DMS compounds within clouds and rain back to terrestrial systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g001">Figure 1</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Andreae1">[7]</xref>. These sulfur compounds act as condensation nuclei, trigger cloud formation, increase the reflection of solar radiation and regulate climate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Charlson1">[8]</xref><sub>,</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Carslaw1">[9]</xref>. Therefore, microbial production of DMS is of broad significance for the sulfur cycle and climate. However, DMSP lyases are poorly understood at the molecular level.</p>
<p>Proteins in the DddP family are abundant and widely distributed in marine systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Rusch1">[10]</xref>. The first biochemically characterized DddP protein, which was cloned from <italic>Roseovarius nubinhibens</italic> ISM, displayed activity on DMSP to produce DMS and acrylate, albeit with relatively low activity under the assay conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Kirkwood1">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, a mutant of <italic>R. nubinhibens</italic> lacking the gene encoding <italic>Rn</italic>DddP reduced the rate of DMS production by this marine bacterium by a factor of ∼8 and a transfer of this gene into <italic>E. coli</italic> conferred the ability to make DMS from DMSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Todd1">[12]</xref>. Solidifying the identity of DddP proteins as DMSP lyases was the additional observation that the transfer of two fungal DddP enzymes, one from <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> cc19 and the other from <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> RIB40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Todd1">[12]</xref>, into <italic>E. coli</italic> also conferred the ability to produce DMS from DMSP.</p>
<p>The DddP family of DMSP lyases is distantly related to the M24 family of metalloproteinases. These enzymes contain an active site with a binuclear metal center, which is crucial for their activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Bazan1">[13]</xref>. The residues that coordinate the metal cofactors in M24 metalloproteinases are also conserved in DddP lyases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Todd1">[12]</xref>. Initial reports characterizing the recombinant <italic>Rn</italic>DddP suggested the lack of metal cofactors; however, this was contradicted by the observation that when the residues conserved with M24 metalloproteinases were mutated to alanine in <italic>Rn</italic>DddP its DMSP lyase activity was abolished, suggesting these residues have an important biological function i.e. for metal binding and catalysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Kirkwood1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Curson1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>To provide new insight into the molecular basis of DMSP cleavage by DddP enzymes we aimed to analyze a member of the DddP family using X-ray crystallography. We were able to crystallize and solve the structure of a putative DMSP lyase from the DddP family, <italic>Rd</italic>DddP from the marine bacterium <italic>R. denitrificans</italic> Och 114. This putative DMSP lyase shares 77% identity with <italic>Rn</italic>DddP, 50% identity with <italic>Ao</italic>DddP (<italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> RIB40) and 32% identity with <italic>Fg</italic>DddP (<italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> cc19); these enzymes, including <italic>Rd</italic>DddP, are all part of the monophyletic clade that contains all three of the enzymes with confirmed functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Todd1">[12]</xref>. Total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TRXF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) both revealed iron ions in <italic>Rd</italic>DddP. X-ray crystallography of <italic>Rd</italic>DddP revealed a binuclear metal center bound by the residues that are conserved with the metal binding residues in M24 metalloproteinases. Comparison with the amino acid sequences of the putative and the characterized DddP lyases showed these metal binding residues are invariant throughout the DddP family, and therefore likely critical for the biological function of these enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Kirkwood1">[11]</xref>. Together, these results provide strong evidence that DddP lyases are metalloenzymes and that iron may be of relevance to the cycling of DMSP by marine microbes.</p>

<title>Presence of metal ions in <italic>Rd</italic>DddP</title>
<p>We cloned, expressed and purified the recombinant putative DddP DMSP lyase (YP_682809) from <italic>R. denitrificans</italic> Och 114 (<italic>Rd</italic>DddP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Todd1">[12]</xref><sub>,</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Kirkwood1">[11]</xref>. The protein could be prepared to high purity and the concentrated protein solution displayed an amber colour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). When metal chelating chelex resin was added directly to the protein solution the amber coloration disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). This initial result suggested a protein metal complex. To test the hypothesis that <italic>Rd</italic>DddP is a metalloprotein the presence of metal ions in this protein was investigated using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TRXF). ICP-MS identified Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn with occupancies of 1.3, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1, respectively, per monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). TRXF detected the same metals in ratios of 1:0.22:0.14:0.06, for Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn, respectively (Figure S1 and Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103128.s001">File S1</xref>), which is similar to the results obtained by ICP-MS. These metal ions were measured after extensive dialysis against a buffer from which metals were removed with metal chelating resin. The metal concentrations in this buffer, which served as background control, were below the detection limits of both methods. Combined, these results suggested that the measured metal ions were tightly bound to the protein and that iron constituted the most abundant metal ion in <italic>Rd</italic>DddP.</p>

<title>Crystal structure of <italic>Rd</italic>DddP revealed a metalloproteinase like fold</title>
<p>To further analyze the putative metalloprotein character of <italic>Rd</italic>DddP we used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of this enzyme. The X-ray crystal structure of <italic>Rd</italic>DddP was solved using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method with a wavelength optimized for crystals of selenomethionine derivatized <italic>Rd</italic>DddP.

The crystal structure revealed a two-domain architecture for the 453 residues of <italic>Rd</italic>DddP (molecular weight of 51 kDa) comprising an N-terminal domain of mixed α/β secondary structure and a C-terminal β-barrel domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g003">Figure 3a, b</xref>). Together, the two domains, which are positioned at an angle of about 90° relative to each other, create an elongated shape.</p>

<p>The smaller N-terminal domain (residues 51–206) consists of six β-strands numbered from the N- to the C-terminus (β1, β2, β3, β4, β5 and β6) forming a central β-sheet. In this β-sheet only one β-strand (β3) is anti-parallel. The central β-sheet within the fold is surrounded on both sides by two α-helix bundles consisting of two (α2 and α3) and five α-helices (α4, α5, α6, α7 and α8). Appended to this N-terminal domain is a small N-terminal loop-helix extension (residues 10–50).</p>
<p>At the C-terminus of the protein, the larger β-barrel domain (residues 209–444) is connected through a short hinge region (residues 207–208) to the N-terminal domain. This β-barrel is divided along its longitudinal axis resulting in an open half-β-barrel. The half-β-barrel consists of six anti-parallel β-strands (β7, β8, β9, β10, β11, and β12) of which the first two, β7 and β8, are discontinuous due to a central β-bulge. Aligned to the β-strands, at the exterior wall of the half- β-barrel, are four α-helices (α9, α10, α11, and α12). This C-terminal β-barrel domain, which has been named the “pita bread” domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Coll1">[14]</xref>, represents the catalytic domain of the M24B-metallopeptidase family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Roderick1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Bazan1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>To identify closely related structural homologs of <italic>Rd</italic>DddP we queried the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the Dali server <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Krissinel1">[16]</xref>. We identified the proline dipeptidase (AAPPs) from <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> as closest structural relative (z-score: 32.8, root-mean square deviation of 2.9 Å, and 21% amino acid sequence identity over 343 matched residues; PDB-id: 3Q6D). The structural homolog with the highest pairwise sequence identity was the X-pro aminopeptidase (prolidase) from <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> (z-score of 32.26, root-mean square deviation of 2.9 Å, and 23% amino acid sequence identity over 341 matched residues; PDB-id: 2ZSG). These structural homologs, albeit lacking the N-terminal appendix, share the same global organization as <italic>Rd</italic>DddP consisting of two domains. In contrast, the related methionine-aminopeptidases MMAPs (PDB id: 1MAT) contain only the pita bread domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). Structurally, therefore, the DddP enzymes belong to the metallopeptidase family harbouring the signature pita bread domain.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title><italic>Rd</italic>DddP is a homodimeric enzyme</title>
<p>The crystal structure of <italic>Rd</italic>DddP contained only one molecule per asymmetric unit; however, a tight interaction with a second peptide chain that was related by crystallographic symmetry in the P6<sub>3</sub>22 space group was present, revealing the homodimeric organization of the enzyme. The interaction between the two peptide chains, which is reminiscent of embracing hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g003">Figure 3d</xref>), has been previously described for the creatinase of <italic>P. putida</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Coll1">[14]</xref> and prolidases. In <italic>Rd</italic>DddP, this mode of interaction results in a large buried interface area of 3741 Å<sup>2</sup> and creates a globular tertiary structure with a total surface area of 17701 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g003">Figure 3d</xref>). The interaction is mediated by a large array of ionic and hydrogen bond interactions (Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103128.s001">File S1</xref>), calculated with the PDBePISA program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Krissinel2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Krissinel3">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Residues under high positive selection are usually found in the core (folding determinants) or in areas that are important for protein function such as active sites and molecular interfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Glaser1">[19]</xref>. For example, solvent exposed residues located on the surface of proteins are usually less conserved, except if they interact with binding partners. Thus, patches of residues under strong positive selection, i.e. on the surface of a protein, can reveal important biological functions. To calculate the conservation of protein residues we used the Consurf server and mapped the conservation scores obtained from multiple DddP amino acid sequences onto the 3D structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Ashkenazy1">[20]</xref>. At the interface of the <italic>Rd</italic>DddP dimer structure we observed a large number of conserved residues almost covering the entire area that is buried in the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g003">Figure 3e, f</xref>). This level of conservation at the dimer interface suggested that dimerization is generally present in homologs of <italic>Rd</italic>DddP. Moreover, the homologue <italic>Rn</italic>DddP has been shown to behave as a homodimer with a measured molecular weight of 95.3 in solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Kirkwood1">[11]</xref> comparable to the value of 102 kDa for the crystallographic dimer of <italic>Rd</italic>DddP. Together these results suggested that dimerization is a conserved feature throughout DddP lyases.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>The substrate binding site of <italic>Rd</italic>DddP is shaped by dimerization and hosts a binuclear metal center</title>
<p>We observed two substrate binding sites per homodimer, which were characterized as pronounced tunnels in the surface of the homodimer structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g004">Figure 4a, b</xref>). Narrow openings of ∼9–11 Å width are located at the dimer interface and form entrances to the active sites. These tunnels are formed by interaction of the N-terminal domains with the pita bread domain of the other peptide chain in the dimer. The N-terminal domain of one chain snugs into the open pita bread fold of the other chain and thereby forms the walls of the tunnels, which end at the active sites located in the center of the pita bread domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Roderick1">[15]</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). Hydrophobic residues predominantly line the tunnels and at the base of the tunnel, nested in the center of the pita bread fold, was electron density consistent with a pair of metal atoms (Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103128.s001">File S1</xref>), which presumably mark the active site of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g004">Figure 4c</xref>). Due to the absence of strong anomalous signals other than the binuclear metal center in the difference maps of the crystal structure, we can attribute the ions identified by ICP-MS and TRXF as the metals in the active site. Based on the sum of the ion occupancies of 1.9 determined by TXRF, we derived a stoichiometry of about two ions per monomer chain, which supports the binuclear character of the metal center present in the crystal structure. As iron was the most abundant ion that was identified in <italic>Rd</italic>DddP by ICP-MS and TRXF these atoms were modelled as iron in the crystal structure.</p>

<p>Six residues bind these two metal ions: the monodentate Asp297, Glu406, His371, Asp307 and the bidentate Asp295, Glu421 ligands. The distances between these residues and the ions are between 2.1–2.7 Å for metal I, 2.0–2.4 for metal II, and 2.7 Å between the two ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Additionally, the B-factor values did not significantly differ between the ions and the ligating atoms. Thus, the properties of these metal-binding sites, when refined as occupied by iron, are consistent with this atom identity. Further supporting this, the interactions between the two ions and protein residues are structurally conserved with the metal binding site of MMAPs (PDB-id: 1MAT), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Roderick1">[15]</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g004">Figure 4d</xref>) where iron ions have been recently identified as cofactor <italic>in vivo</italic>. A residue that is not conserved with MMAPs is Asp297, which may modulate the redox state of the bound metal ion. In conclusion, one monomer provides all the residues that coordinate the metal ions, and while the second dimer approaches the site it does not directly interact with the metal ions, which leaves an open space above them for substrate or water to bind and complete the coordination sphere. Due to the absence of a bound water molecule, product or substrate ligand, the exact geometry of the metal binding site and its complete coordination sphere remains to be established.</p>
<p>Because iron was the most abundant ion present in <italic>Rd</italic>Dddp, as measured by ICP-MS and TXRF, and was identified as the physiological cofactor in the related MMAPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Chai1">[21]</xref> we modeled both metal sites as being occupied by this atom; however, Ni, Zn, and Cu were also identified as cofactors for <italic>Rd</italic>DddP albeit at lower levels. Thus, it is possible that while one metal site is fully occupied by iron, the second site is occupied by a mixture of metal atoms. Indeed, the presence of a stronger and a weaker metal binding site is common in structurally related metallopeptidases and seems to modulate their catalytic activity by alternating metals in the low affinity site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Wilcox1">[22]</xref>. This mixed occupation could also explain the relatively short distance of 2.7 Å between the two modelled ions, which is usually longer (3–3.2 Å) in binuclear iron centers of enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Vincent1">[23]</xref>. However, such a short distance has been previously reported. For example, the two iron ions in the iron hydrogenase of <italic>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans</italic> are only 2.6 Å apart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Nicolet1">[24]</xref>. It should also be noted that in <italic>Rd</italic>DddP the metal ligands appear to be tightly constrained by the first and second order enzyme residues, leaving not much space between them. Finally, the metal binding residues are invariant in DddP lyases, most likely due to their anticipated function during catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g004">Figure 4e</xref>; Alignment S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103128.s001">File S1</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Todd1">[12]</xref>. Support for this argument is provided by the observation that alanine mutagenesis of any of the metal binding residues in <italic>Rn</italic>DddP, which over all has 77% amino acid identity to <italic>Rd</italic>DddP, led to an inactive enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Kirkwood1">[11]</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on the structure of the cupin-like DddQ DMSP lyase from <italic>Ruegeria lacuscaelulensis,</italic> the cleavage of DMSP by the DddQ enzymes is proposed to proceed through a β-elimination reaction whereby a bound Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion coordinates the carboxylate group of DMSP and a tyrosine residue acts as a base to abstract the Cα-H proton and initiate the reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Li1">[25]</xref>. The structure of <italic>Rd</italic>DddP suggests a similar reaction mechanism is possible in the DddP family. The strong electropositive charge of the binuclear metal center may attract the negatively charged carboxyl group of the DMSP molecules to bind. This interaction would expose the carbon backbone of DMSP to the two residues, Tyr366 and Asp377, which protrude into the substrate-binding tunnel 4.6–5.5 Å above the metal ions, and both of which are invariant throughout DddP lyases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Todd1">[12]</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103128-g004">Figure 4e</xref>). Given the common propensity for amino acid side chain carboxylate groups to act as general bases it is likely that Asp337 acts as a base to abstract the Cα-H proton. Given the proposed role of a tyrosine side chain in its phenolate form as a base in the DddQ enzymes, Tyr366 is an alternate candidate for a base in <italic>Rd</italic>DddP. However, unlike in DddQ where the tyrosine ηO atom is involved in coordinating the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion and thus maintained in its deprotonated state, such an interaction is not observed for Tyr366 in <italic>Rd</italic>DddP. In this case, it is possible that a proton shuttle involving an adjacent water molecule (HOH 2151) and Asp295, which coordinates one of the iron atoms, enhances the ability of Tyr366 to act as a base. Though, in the absence of additional evidence, we presently favour Asp377 as the most likely candidate to act as the catalytic base. The suggested relevance of metal cofactors for catalysis may also explain the low apparent activity that has been previously measured for <italic>Rn</italic>DddP (Km = 13.8 mM, and Vmax = 0. 31 nmol product/min/µg DMSP), where the low activity may have been a result of measurements made with apo-enzyme or with incorrect metal ions in the active site. While the results presented here suggest metal ions are important for DddP mediated DMSP lysis additional biochemical and kinetic experiments are clearly needed to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The presence of iron ions in <italic>Rd</italic>DddP, and the invariance of the metal binding residues in orthologous DddP lyases suggests they are metalloenzymes. Microbial uptake and transport of trace metals to the deep sea, in form of sinking particulates, depletes trace metals in ocean surface waters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Alldredge1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Morel1">[29]</xref>. Thus, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn and especially Fe can become limiting factors for diverse biological processes. For example low levels of iron limit nitrogen fixation as iron is the cofactor of nitrogenase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Zheng1">[30]</xref><sub>,</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Rubio1">[31]</xref>. Moreover, iron is a cofactor for photosynthesis and growth of phytoplankton is closely tied to iron concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Martin1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Geider1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Mills1">[34]</xref>. Thus, the presence of iron in <italic>Rd</italic>DddP raises the question if DddP lyases and DMSP cycling are iron dependent.</p>
<p>Cofactor competition may explain the functional redundancy of different <italic>ddd</italic> genes present in microbial genomes and metagenome datasets. Aside from the DddPs the most abundant DMSP lyases are cupins belonging to the DddQ family. Cupins are small proteins (∼15–30 kDa) with a beta barrel fold, which, similar to the pita bread of M24 metallopeptidases, has emerged as a highly successful scaffold for many enzymatic activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Dunwell1">[26]</xref>. Most cupins are metalloproteins with a catalytic metal in the center of the β-barrel and these metal binding sites are present in DddQ enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Dunwell1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Todd2">[27]</xref>. Indeed a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion has been recently identified in the active site of the DddQ enzyme from <italic>Ruegeria lacuscaelulensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103128-Li1">[25]</xref>, a result that is in line with the hypothesis that families of DMSP lyases use different metal cofactors. This diverse scope for metals in DddQ and DddP families may retain enzymatic activity even when one or the other metal species is scarce in the sea.</p>

Trace element analysis was performed on a Thermo X-Series II quadrupole ICP-MS run in standard mode with glass concentric nebulizer, Peltier cooled glass impact bead spray chamber, and on-line internal standard addition. A mixture of Rh, In, and Re was used as the internal standard. Calibration standards were prepared from NIST traceable mixed element stock solutions.
