        <p><italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> strain 2.4.1 is a widely studied bacterium that has recently been shown to cleave the abundant marine anti-stress molecule dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) into acrylate plus gaseous dimethyl sulfide. It does so by using a lyase encoded by <italic>dddL,</italic> the promoter-distal gene of a three-gene operon, <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic>. Transcription of the operon was enhanced when cells were pre-grown with the substrate DMSP, but this induction is indirect, and requires the conversion of DMSP to the product acrylate, the <italic>bona fide</italic> co-inducer. This regulation is mediated by the product of the promoter-proximal gene <italic>acuR,</italic> a transcriptional regulator in the TetR family. AcuR represses the operon in the absence of acrylate, but this is relieved by the presence of the co-inducer. Another unusual regulatory feature is that the <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> mRNA transcript is leaderless, such that <italic>acuR</italic> lacks a Shine-Dalgarno ribosomal binding site and 5′-UTR, and is translated at a lower level compared to the downstream genes. This regulatory unit may be quite widespread in bacteria, since several other taxonomically diverse lineages have adjacent <italic>acuR-</italic>like and <italic>acuI-</italic>like genes; these operons also have no 5′ leader sequences or ribosomal binding sites and their predicted <italic>cis-</italic>acting regulatory sequences resemble those of <italic>R. sphaeroides acuR-acuI-dddL.</italic></p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is an abundant (∼10<sup>9</sup> tons produced worldwide, each year) compatible solute that is made by many diverse marine phytoplankton, some macroalgal seaweeds and a few angiosperms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Stefels1">[1]</xref>. Its exact function is still not clear; it may act as an osmoprotectant and/or anti-stress molecule in response to oxidative damage or UV radiation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Otte1">[2]</xref>). Some DMSP-producing algae themselves can catabolise DMSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Steinke1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Anderson1">[4]</xref> and on senescence or viral lysis, the DMSP that is released from these algae can be catabolised by various marine bacteria and by some fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Yoch1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Malmstrom1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Some of these catabolic pathways generate dimethyl sulfide (DMS), an important volatile in its own right. Approximately 30 million tons (∼10% of the total) of this DMS escapes each year from the surface layers of the sea, representing the principal form by which biogenic sulfur is transferred to the atmosphere from the oceans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Lovelock1">[7]</xref>. Importantly, DMS oxidation products (e.g. sulfate) act as cloud condensation nuclei, with effects on albedo, reflecting radiation back to space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Vallina1">[8]</xref>. DMS is also a potent chemo-attractant for potential food supplies of marine animals, such as crustaceans (Copepods), seabirds (penguins, shearwaters, petrels) and mammals (harbour seals) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Nevitt1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Steinke2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Cunningham1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Kowalewsky1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Bacteria can catabolise DMSP in several different ways. Globally, the most important pathway involves demethylation of DMSP to 3-<italic>S</italic>-methylmercaptopropionate (MMPA) and thence to methanethiol and into general metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Kiene1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Kiene2">[14]</xref>. The <italic>dmdA</italic> gene, which encodes a DMSP demethylase, occurs in several marine α-Proteobacteria and is widespread in the metagenomes of marine bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Howard1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Howard2">[16]</xref>. However, this demethylation pathway does not liberate DMS.</p>
      <p>Recent genetic studies have revealed several very different ways in which different lineages of bacteria (and some fungi) release DMS during DMSP catabolism, a phenotype termed Ddd<sup>+</sup> (<underline>D</underline>MSP-<underline>d</underline>ependent <underline>D</underline>MS). This may explain the biochemical and physiological heterogeneity seen in earlier studies on this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Yoch1">[5]</xref>. Four different gene products, termed DddD, DddL, DddP and DddQ, were found in various marine bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Todd1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Todd2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Todd3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Kirkwood1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Curson1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Todd4">[22]</xref>. In all four cases, the corresponding cloned genes, <italic>dddD, dddL</italic>, <italic>dddP</italic> and <italic>dddQ</italic>, could each confer a Ddd<sup>+</sup> phenotype to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.</p>
      <p>The subject of this study, DddL, is a “DMSP lyase” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Curson1">[21]</xref>, the generic term used to describe enzymes that cleave DMSP at its γ-carbon atom to release DMS plus acrylate and a proton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Yoch1">[5]</xref>. Initially identified in <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> sp. EE-36, there are close homologues of DddL (∼65% identical at the amino acid level) in related α-Proteobacteria in the <italic>Rhodobacteraceae</italic> (<italic>Loktanella</italic>, <italic>Oceanicola</italic>, <italic>Stappia</italic> and <italic>Rhodobacter</italic>), and in <italic>Fulvimarina,</italic> in the closely related <italic>Aurantimonadaceae</italic> family. To date, all the strains tested that had <italic>dddL</italic> in their genomes had a Ddd<sup>+</sup> phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Curson1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>DddL was previously annotated as a Domain of Unknown Function, and has no sequence similarity to DddD or DddP, which are respectively in the families of Class III CoA-transferases and M24 peptidases, being found in other bacteria and, in the case of <italic>dddP,</italic> in some Ascomycete fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Todd1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Todd2">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The finding of a DddL DMSP lyase in some strains of <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> was initially surprising, because this species has a long genetic and biochemical history, but had not previously been suspected of making DMS. Of the three <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> strains whose genomes were sequenced, two (strains 2.4.1 and ATCC17029) had a Ddd<sup>+</sup> phenotype, but the third, strain ATCC17025, did not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Curson1">[21]</xref>. Consistent with this, strains 2.4.1 and ATCC17029 have a 60 kb genomic region that includes <italic>dddL,</italic> but this is missing from strain ATCC17025 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Choudhary1">[23]</xref>. All three strains were isolated around 1935 by van Niel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-vanNiel1">[24]</xref> at the Hopkins Laboratory, Monterrey, but their environmental origin(s), whether marine or freshwater, are unknown (Howard Nash, personal communication).</p>
      <p>Here, we examined the expression of the operon containing <italic>R. sphaeroides dddL</italic>, revealing unusual features about its regulation.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>In nearly all bacteria that contain <italic>dddL,</italic> this gene is in a one-gene transcriptional unit, as judged by the positions and orientations of the flanking genes. However, in <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> strain 2.4.1, <italic>dddL</italic> (locus tag RSP_1433) is the promoter-distal gene of a three-gene operon, as shown below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g001"><bold>Figures 1</bold></xref> <bold>and</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g002"><bold>2</bold></xref>). The promoter-proximal gene (RSP_1435), termed <italic>acuR</italic>, is situated 15 bp upstream of the start of RSP_1434, which we term <italic>acuI</italic> (the “<italic>acu</italic>” nomenclature refers to <bold><underline>ac</underline></bold>rylate <bold><underline>u</underline></bold>tilization – see below). All three genes also occur in the same relative location in the genome of the Ddd<sup>+</sup> <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> strain ATCC17029, but are absent from that of <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> ATCC17025, which does not catabolise DMSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Curson1">[21]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Induction of DMS production in <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> 2.4.1</title>
        <p>DMSP-dependent DMS production had been shown to be weakly increased (∼1.4-fold) when the <italic>dddL-</italic>containing strain <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> sp. EE36 was pre-grown with 5 mM DMSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Curson1">[21]</xref>. We assayed DMS production in <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> 2.4.1 and found that this activity was also modestly enhanced (∼3-fold) by DMSP, compared to cells grown in the absence of any inducer (data not shown).</p>
        <p>In other Ddd<sup>+</sup> bacteria, DMS production can be induced not only by the DMSP substrate, but, more unusually, by some products of DMSP catabolism. For example, the Ddd<sup>+</sup> phenotype of <italic>Halomonas</italic> HTNK1 was enhanced when cells were grown in the presence of 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP), which is a DMSP catabolite in <italic>Halomonas</italic>. This induction was due to enhanced transcription of the <italic>ddd</italic> genes when <italic>Halomonas</italic> was grown with 3HP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Todd3">[19]</xref>. To see if a DMSP catabolite was an effective inducer in <italic>R. sphaeroides,</italic> cells of strain 2.4.1 were grown in M9 minimal medium with succinate as C source in the presence of the catabolite acrylate (1 mM) prior to assaying DMSP-dependent DMS production.

        <title>Induction of <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> transcription by acrylate and evidence for <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulation</title>
        <p>To test if induction of DMSP-dependent DMS production in <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> 2.4.1 was due to enhanced expression of the <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> genes, three <italic>lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusion plasmids were made. In these, fragments that included the predicted (and then confirmed – see below) promoter and operator of the <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> operon were cloned into the low copy-number wide host-range <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter plasmid pMP220 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Spaink1">[26]</xref>.

        <p>Each fusion plasmid was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> and then conjugated into strain J446, a streptomycin-resistant derivative of <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> 2.4.1. The transconjugants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity after growth in M9 media, supplemented with succinate as C source, and in the presence or absence of 1 mM DMSP or 1 mM acrylate. All three fusions behaved in a similar way. Compared to the no-inducer control, they all had higher levels (5–19 fold increase) with acrylate, and modest induction (2–10 fold increase) with DMSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>).

        <p>The expression of the three genes was also determined by qRT-PCR, as follows. RNA that was harvested from cells pre-grown in M9 minimal medium with or without added acrylate was reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR, using various primer pairs internal to <italic>acuR, acuI</italic> and <italic>dddL</italic>. For all three genes, mRNA levels were greater (∼5–8 fold higher) in cells grown in the presence than in the absence of acrylate (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To identify the regulatory gene(s) involved in DMSP- and/or acrylate-dependent expression of the <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> operon, we first examined the expression of the three fusion plasmids (pBIO1780, pBIO1915 and pBIO1917) in strain J447, a streptomycin-resistant derivative of wild type <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> ATCC17025, which lacks the <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> genes and therefore serves as a naturally occurring null mutant for this locus. All three fusions behaved differently compared to when they were in strain J446, which contains these three genes in its genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). Firstly, in strain J447, none of the fusions displayed even the modest induction in response to DMSP. Secondly, although the <italic>dddL-lacZ</italic> fusion (pBIO1917) showed a similar response to acrylate-dependent induction in strain J447 as in strain J446, the <italic>acuI-lacZ</italic> fusion (pBIO1915) was induced more markedly by acrylate when it was in strain J447 (∼60-fold), compared to strain J446 (∼20-fold). With the <italic>acuR-lacZ</italic> fusion, the difference in the expression patterns in the two background strains was even more marked, since in strain J447, <italic>acuR-lacZ</italic> (pBIO1780) was deregulated, with constitutive, high levels of β-galactosidase even in the absence of acrylate.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these observations suggest that <italic>acuR, acuI</italic> and <italic>dddL</italic> are co-transcribed in a single operon that can be repressed by AcuR. This would account for the high level constitutive expression in strain J447 harboring the <italic>acuR-lacZ</italic> fusion plasmid pBIO1780, since this strain, unlike any of the others tested, lacks an intact <italic>acuR</italic> gene in the background genome, or the fusion plasmid, or both. The data also indicate that although DMSP appears to relieve the repressive effects of AcuR, it must first be converted to acrylate, the likely <italic>bona fide</italic> co-inducer molecule. This would explain why none of the fusions in the null mutant strain J447 background was inducible by pre-growth in DMSP since these strains lack a functional <italic>dddL</italic> gene that would convert the DMSP to acrylate. The enhanced induction of expression by acrylate of the <italic>acuI-lacZ</italic> fusion in strain J447 compared to the wild type strain J446 background might be because AcuI is involved in acrylate catabolism; if so, the intracellular concentrations of this co-inducer would rise, because strain J447 containing the <italic>acuI-lacZ</italic> fusion plasmid lacks a functional <italic>acuI</italic> gene. These postulates were confirmed directly below.</p>

        <p>Centred 10 and 35 bp upstream of this +1 transcriptional start were TATTAT and TTGATT motifs, potential RNA polymerase recognition sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>). To confirm that these formed the <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> promoter, they were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) as follows. The fragments that were used to make the <italic>acuR-lacZ</italic> fusion pBIO1780, and the <italic>dddL-lacZ</italic> fusion pBIO1917, were each cloned into pBluescript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Short1">[27]</xref>. Conserved nucleotides (labelled “1” and “4” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>) in these −10 and −35 motifs were then mutated and the mutated fragments were individually re-cloned into pMP220. The resulting plasmids (pBIO1827, pBIO1829, pBIO1922 and pBIO1923) were each mobilised into the <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> strains J446 and J447. None of these mutated fusions expressed β-galactosidase above background in either host strain, confirming the importance of these −10 and −35 motifs for promoter activity (data not shown). Furthermore, the fact that mutations in the promoter upstream of <italic>acuR</italic> abolished expression of the downstream <italic>dddL</italic> gene confirms that <italic>acuR, acuI</italic> and <italic>dddL</italic> are co-transcribed. Further evidence for the lack of any internal promoters came from the finding that two transcriptional fusion plasmids, containing the intergenic spaces between <italic>acuR</italic> and <italic>acuI</italic> (pBIO1784) or between <italic>acuI</italic> and <italic>dddL</italic> (pBIO1785) cloned into pMP220 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), had no detectable β-galactosidase activity in <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> strains J446 or J447 that had been grown in the presence or absence of DMSP or of acrylate (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Overlapping the <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> promoter is an inverted repeat, TAATAGAC/n6/GTCTATTA, which is a potential <italic>cis-</italic>acting regulatory operator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>). To confirm this, we mutated these motifs (marked “2” and “3” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>) by site-directed mutagenesis of the <italic>acuR-lacZ</italic> fusion plasmid (pBIO1780), altering the most highly conserved bases, but avoiding those that coincided with the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). The resultant mutant plasmids (pBIO1797, pBIO1798) were conjugated into <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> before assaying β-galactosidase after growth in DMSP or acrylate or with no inducer. Both sets of mutations caused high-level, constitutive expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>) when compared to the un-mutated <italic>acuR-lacZ</italic> fusion, consistent with these being in the <italic>cis</italic>-acting operator site to which the AcuR repressor binds.</p>

        <p>The mRNA of the <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> operon lacked a 5′ leader and so <italic>acuR</italic> lacks a SD site, whereas both <italic>acuI</italic> and <italic>dddL</italic> have such motifs (AGGAGA and AGAGAG, respectively) upstream of their AUG start codons. Thus, there might be differences in the translational efficiencies of the genes in the operon.

These two plasmids were conjugated into wild type <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> strain J446.

All but one of the mutated plasmids expressed no detectable β-galactosidase activity; the exception was where the ATG was converted to the usually less efficient start codon GTG (pBIO1928), in which the expression of the translational fusion was much-reduced, but not abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>).</p>

        <p>Acrylate is produced by DddL-mediated catabolism of DMSP and it is also a co-inducer of <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic>, so we examined the possible role of this operon in acrylate catabolism.

The AcuI<sup>−</sup> mutant was significantly more sensitive to acrylate than the wild type parent and we showed that this hypersensitivity was overcome by reintroducing pBIO1918, a plasmid that expresses functional <italic>acuI</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). Thus, AcuI is involved, directly or indirectly, in a process that counteracts the toxic effects of acrylate.

In all but one of these cases, the particular substrate of the AcuI-like enzyme and the co-inducer for the AcuR-like regulators are unknown and/or have no known link to DMSP catabolism. The exception is the gene pair in <italic>Halomonas</italic> HTNK1, which are closely linked to the previously described <italic>ddd</italic> and <italic>acu</italic> genes involved in the catabolism of DMSP and acrylate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Todd3">[19]</xref>. We also noted that the Global Ocean Sampling data set <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Rusch1">[32]</xref> of marine bacterial metagenomes has six close matches (&lt;e<sup>−40</sup>) to AcuR, four of which were encoded by genes that were next to <italic>acuI-</italic>like genes. Thus, this pair-wise arrangement of adjacent genes related to <italic>acuI</italic> and <italic>acuR</italic> is widespread in the genomes of different bacteria.</p>
        <p>We noted that the DNA immediately 5′ of several of the <italic>acuR-</italic>like genes in other bacteria that had adjacent <italic>acuR-</italic>like/<italic>acuI-</italic>like genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>), also contained motifs that resemble those in the operator/promoter of the <italic>R. sphaeroides acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> operon. Furthermore, their mRNAs are predicted to lack 5′ leader sequences or SD sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015972-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>).</p>
        <p>We directly examined the expression of one such gene pair, in the β-Proteobacterium, <italic>Burkholderia ambifaria</italic> AMMD, which contains the <italic>acuR-</italic>like gene Bamb_4743 (58% identical to AcuR at the gene product level) and Bamb_4744 (61% identical to AcuI and separated from Bamb_4743 by 46 bp). We made two transcriptional fusion plasmids in pMP220, both of which contained the predicted promoter and operator of this <italic>B. ambifaria</italic> operon. The 3′ end of one of these (pBIO1807) was in Bamb_4743 and, in the other (pBIO1808), the 3′ terminus was in Bamb_4744. These two fusion plasmids were mobilised into <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> strain J446. The Bamb_4743<italic>-lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusion was expressed at high levels (∼300 Miller units of β-galactosidase), both in the presence or absence of DMSP or acrylate; thus, its promoter was not repressed by AcuR in strain 2.4.1. However, the <italic>acuI</italic>-like Bamb_4744<italic>-lacZ</italic> fusion was expressed at lower (∼4 Units) levels in both conditions, suggesting that the product of Bamb_4743 (which is intact in the pBIO1808 fusion plasmid, but not in pBIO1807) represses its own transcription, but that it does not respond to acrylate or to DMSP.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This work reveals two novel features of the organisation and regulation of the <italic>dddL-</italic>containing operon of <italic>R. sphaeroides -</italic> (i) unusually for Proteobacteria, its mRNA product lacks an untranslated leader, with no SD sequence and (ii) it is induced primarily in response to the catabolite acrylate and only indirectly by the substrate DMSP.</p>
      <p><underline>The mRNA of the <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> operon lacks an untranslated 5′ leader. </underline>Conventionally, bacterial mRNAs contain a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence immediately 5′ of the translational start codon, which is involved in recruiting ribosomes to initiate translation. However, a few bacterial genes lack such upstream untranslated leaders, as first shown for the <italic>cI</italic> repressor of bacteriophage λ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Walz1">[33]</xref>, then the <italic>tetR</italic> gene of transposon Tn<italic>1721</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Klock1">[34]</xref>. Other cases have since been described or inferred by bioinformatic analyses and some understanding on how such leaderless messages are translated has emerged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Moll1">[35]</xref>. Leaderless mRNA templates are recognised by ribosomes, using fMet-tRNA<sub>f</sub><sup>Met</sup> initiator tRNA plus initiation factor IF2, in a mechanism that resembles that in eukaryotes, which also have no specialised ribosomal binding sites upstream of the initiation codon. This may reflect the ancestral form of translational initiation of such leaderless transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Kaberdina1">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In Proteobacteria, several genes with ratified leaderless transcripts encode regulatory proteins (e.g. λ CI and <italic>E. coli</italic> TetR), which are not required in large amounts, consistent with the reduced levels of translation of genes that lack ribosomal binding sites, compared to those that do <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-ODonnell1">[37]</xref>. Leaderless transcripts are more frequent in some Gram positive bacteria and in Archaea, in which a wider range of functions are encoded by the corresponding genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Moll1">[35]</xref>. And more recently, genome-wide surveys have shown that leaderless transcripts may be more widespread than previously thought; in <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, for example, ∼2% of the transcripts that were identified had very short (&lt;10 bp) 5′ extensions and in 26 cases, the 5′ end of the mRNA was located exactly at the AUG translational start <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Sharma1">[38]</xref>, as found here with <italic>acuR</italic>.</p>
      <p>By comparing the responses of transcriptional and translational fusions, the work on <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> is one of the few direct demonstrations that an upstream regulatory gene (<italic>acuR</italic>) in a leaderless mRNA transcript is transcribed at least as efficiently as the downstream genes, but is translated at far lower levels. This type of gene control may also apply to the other cases where an <italic>acuR</italic>-like gene lies upstream of an <italic>acuI-</italic>like gene, an arrangement that we found in a taxonomically wide range of known bacteria as well as in sub-genomic fragments of the metagenomes of marine bacteria. In all such cases, the region immediately 5′ of the <italic>acuR</italic> homologue lacked a SD site, and had convincing -10 and -35 promoter motifs located such that the transcript would start at the AUG of the promoter-proximal mRNA. Further, many of these <italic>acuR-acuI</italic>-like gene pairs had regulatory sequences similar to those in the <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> operator of <italic>R. sphaeroides.</italic></p>
      <p><underline>Acrylate, the product of DMSP catabolism is the co-inducer for <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic> expression.</underline> The finding that a <italic>product</italic> (acrylate) of a catabolic reaction appears to be the primary co-inducer of the corresponding gene (<italic>dddL</italic>) is unusual, but not unprecedented in bacteria. This is not the only case in which DMSP catabolism is induced by a catabolite, Yoch's laboratory having described several instances in which pre-growth of different bacteria in the presence of acrylate or of 3HP enhances their rates of DMSP-dependent DMS production (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Yoch1">[5]</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the case of <italic>acuR-acuI-dddL</italic>, a possible reason for this mode of regulation stems from the way in which this operon may have evolved, as follows. So far, the <italic>dddL</italic> gene is confined to a relatively small number of bacterial species, nearly all in the Rhodobacteraceae family of α-Proteobacteria. In all but one of these species, <italic>dddL</italic> is in a one-gene transcriptional unit, the exception being <italic>R. sphaeroides.</italic> Perhaps by HGT, a <italic>dddL</italic> gene “latched onto” a pre-existing <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> operon that comprised adjacent <italic>acuR</italic>-<italic>acuI-</italic>like genes, whose role may have been involved in catabolising acrylate (or a similar molecule) and whose expression therefore, responded to acrylate. Little is known of the distribution of acrylate in natural environments, but it does occur in regions of high DMSP production, such as coral reefs where it is made by cleavage of DMSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Raina1">[39]</xref>. Therefore, acrylate could act as a surrogate to activate genes involved in DMSP catabolism, since, where acrylate occurs, DMSP may also be found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Tapiolas1">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although genetic analyses of DMSP catabolism have only been ongoing for a few years, these studies have already uncovered a remarkable diversity in different aspects of this process, from the types of enzymes involved in the initial biotransformation, to the range of microbial lineages that can accomplish it. The work presented here now reveals novelty and diversity in the regulation of this process, since the acrylate-dependent expression via a TetR-type regulator in <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> contrasts markedly with that in the γ-Proteobacterium <italic>Marinomonas,</italic> where a LysR-type regulator responds to DMSP itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015972-Todd1">[17]</xref>. It will be of interest to see if yet other mechanisms regulate the catabolism of this abundant and important molecule in other microbes.</p>
