        <p>The accepted androgen receptor (AR) role is to promote proliferation and survival of prostate epithelium and thus prostate cancer progression. While growth-inhibitory, tumor-suppressive AR effects have also been documented, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we for the first time link AR anti-cancer action with cell senescence <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. First, AR-driven senescence was p53-independent. Instead, AR induced p21, which subsequently reduced ΔN isoform of p63. Second, AR activation increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby suppressed Rb phosphorylation. Both pathways were critical for senescence as was proven by p21 and Rb knock-down and by quenching ROS with N-Acetyl cysteine and p63 silencing also mimicked AR-induced senescence. The two pathways engaged in a cross-talk, likely via PML tumor suppressor, whose localization to senescence-associated chromatin foci was increased by AR activation. All these pathways contributed to growth arrest, which resolved in senescence due to concomitant lack of p53 and high mTOR activity. This is the first demonstration of senescence response caused by a nuclear hormone receptor.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Favorable response to androgen ablation, the mainstay prostate cancer (PCa) treatment, is typically followed by a relapse to the ablation-resistant disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Culig1">[1]</xref>. Advanced PCa, while unresponsive to anti-androgens often express functional androgen receptor (AR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-vanBokhoven1">[2]</xref>. In prostate stroma, low AR levels maintain the production of andromedins, which initiate proliferation and differentiation of the AR-negative basal epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Cunha1">[3]</xref>. AR expression increases as prostate epithelium differentiates: it is absent in the stem and transient amplifying basal cells and high in secretory luminal epithelium where it functions to suppress proliferation and maintain terminal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Litvinov1">[4]</xref>. AR oncogenic action has been extensively studied: in tumor cells AR activation can cause proliferation and block apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Eder1">[5]</xref>, suggesting that altered context enables AR to support cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-VanderGriend1">[6]</xref>. AR proliferative effects rely on Cyclin D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Xu1">[7]</xref>; its survival effects involve Akt and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Cinar1">[8]</xref>. AR also stimulates the expression of autocrine growth factors via O<sub>2</sub>-independent stabilization of HIF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Mabjeesh1">[9]</xref>; other evidence underscores AR non-genomic oncogenic action via cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Cinar1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Haag1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>There are several significant observations that are inconsistent with AR oncogenic function in the prostate epithelium. Transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type AR in the prostate epithelium fail to develop PCa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Kasper1">[11]</xref>, whereas mutations in the N-terminal motif ARNSM alter AR interaction with co-factors and enable oncogenic functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Han1">[12]</xref>. Moreover, the evidence of AR anti-proliferative and anti-tumor effects in the prostate emerges continuously. AR sensitizes PCa cells to apoptosis by cytotoxic drugs, induces apoptosis in cooperation with Rb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-HessWilson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Wang1">[14]</xref> and suppresses metastasis-promoting factors c-Met and VEGF-C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Verras1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Li1">[16]</xref>. Recently, AR has been identified as a replication licensing factor, which has to be degraded for continuous cell cycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-VanderGriend1">[6]</xref>. Re-introduction and/or activation of AR halt PCa growth <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Nelius1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Litvinov2">[18]</xref>. Moreover, clinical observations indicate that prostate tumors progress slower in patients treated with an intermittent androgen blockade alternated with testosterone replacement, than in patients on continuous androgen ablation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Rambeaud1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Gleave1">[20]</xref>. Thus androgen axis may be beneficial in averting PCa. Our group showed that in AR-null PC-3 cells inducible AR expression causes androgen-dependent tumor suppression, accompanied by decreased angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Nelius1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we demonstrate that continuous AR activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> cause cellular senescence, which can be attenuated by AR antagonist, anti-androgen flutamide. Cellular senescence is one of the events underlying tumor suppression. Senescence can be triggered by telomere shortening or stress, including inappropriate expression of growth-promoting genes, GTPases or reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Takahashi1">[21]</xref>. Senescence can be driven by Rb or p53 pathways, which are closely intertwined: Rb can block p53-destabilizing protein MDM2, thus increase p53 levels, promoting the expression of p53 targets, p21, Bax and PIG3 and cause senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Campisi1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Vicencio1">[23]</xref>. On the other hand, p21 inhibits cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks) and therefore dephosphorylates and activates Rb, which then binds E2F allowing the expression of growth arrest genes and senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Campisi1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Prieur1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In contrast with p53, a p53-related protein p63 opposes cellular senescence. Transcriptionally active p63 isoform, TAp63, can induce apoptosis by activating p53 targets genes; however its inactive, short isoform ΔNp63 can block p53 and TAp63 function in a dominant-negative fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Guo1">[25]</xref>. Despite well documented pro-apoptotic activity of TAp63, p63-null animals showed impaired tumorigenesis compared to the wild-type littermates. Importantly, p63 inactivation targeted to the prostate epithelium causes premature senescence and lowers tumor incidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Keyes1">[26]</xref>. Importantly, the patterns of AR and p63 expression in differentiating prostate epithelium are reciprocal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Litvinov3">[27]</xref>. While basal epithelial cells express no AR and high levels of ΔNp63, differentiated luminal secretory epithelium expresses highest AR levels and no p63 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Litvinov3">[27]</xref>. P63 deficiency can release the expression of known senescence-associated proteins p21, p53, Rb, and PML (<underline>p</underline>ro<underline>m</underline>yelocytic <underline>l</underline>eukemia) tumor suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Keyes1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our model, AR-induced senescence occurred independently of DNA damage and p53. Instead, it involved increased p21 levels, decreased phospho-Rb and p63. Additionally, we observed increased numbers of PML nuclear bodies due to AR-dependent p63 depletion. P21 expression was directly regulated by AR, as was shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Paradoxically, p21 had no effect on Rb phosphorylation: the decrease of the phospho-Rb was due to AR-dependent ROS increase. Elevated P21, on the other hand, caused depletion of the ΔNp63. AR-dependent senescence was blocked by p21 or Rb silencing, as well as by ROS quenching and vice versa, mimicked by p63 knockdown. Thus we identified a novel AR function, the induction of senescence, previously not ascribed to any of the nuclear hormone receptors, and delineated underlying signaling pathways.</p>

        <title>Persistent AR activity causes senescence</title>
        <p>To avoid the loss of androgen sensitivity due to persistent AR expression/activity we generated PC-3 PCa cells expressing tetracycline-inducible wild-type AR (PC3-AR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Nelius1">[17]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). We showed that persistent (up to 6 days) AR activation did not increase cell numbers, judging by WST-1 viability assay or direct cell counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> and data not shown). On the contrary, long-term AR activation resulted in G1 growth arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), which was not accompanied by cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031052.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>); however, the cells assumed flattened vacuolized morphology, suggestive of either autophagy or senescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031052.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). The levels of the principal autophagy mediator Beclin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Vicencio1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Maiuri1">[28]</xref> remained stable in the presence of DHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) pointing to senescence. Moreover, SA-βGal positivity increased from the background 4% to nearly 40% in the presence of DHT (P&lt;0.0002), suggesting senescence. This increase was abolished by anti-androgen flutamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g001">Fig. 1D–E, P</xref>&lt;0.005).</p>

Prolonged (3–5 days) DHT exposure significantly increased senescence albeit it remained considerably lower than in PCa cells (7–12%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g001">Fig. 1G–I</xref>). After 3–6 days of DHT exposure, senescent PC3-AR cells failed to resume growth when transferred in DHT-free medium as was evidenced by persistence of βGAL-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031052.s001">Fig. S1F</xref>), suggesting that growth arrest was permanent. Together, our findings indicate that ligand-dependent AR activity induced senescence in PCa and normal basal prostate epithelial cells.</p>
        <p>We then proceeded to verify the possibility of AR-induced senescence in vivo. One possible in vivo experiment, the treatment of male animals with ectopic testosterone, involves testosterone concentrations exceeding physiological levels. The detection of senescence in normal prostate on ambient testosterone background would not unequivocally link senescence to AR and testosterone, since in the only possible control (castration or testosterone depletion) causes apoptosis and rapid involution of the gland, which preclude the detection of senescence. As was reported previously, inducible (tet-on) AR expression inhibits the growth of PC3-AR tumors on ambient testosterone background in male mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Nelius1">[17]</xref> and this inhibition is reversed by flutamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g002">Fig. 2A–B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g002">Fig. 2A–B</xref>). SA-βGal assay revealed increased senescence in PC3-AR tumors treated with Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Similarly, ectopic DHT impaired the progression of AR-positive LNCaP tumors on testosterone-free background, with concomitant increase in SA-βGal positivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031052.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>–E).</p>

Since p63 is not detected in AR-positive luminal prostate epithelium, we hypothesized that AR may block p63 expression.

The regulation also occurred at mRNA level: in PC3-AR cells after 48–72 hours with DHT p63 mRNA declined by 85% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Interestingly, p21 knock-down increased p63 protein and mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g005">Fig. 5A, C</xref>). Although the repression by DHT was partially retained in p21 knock-down cells, p63 message remained at least 5-fold higher in DHT-treated p21-null cells, similar to untreated control PC3-AR.

(<bold>B</bold>) Schematic representation of pathways leading to AR-indiced senescence: AR triggers two parallel pathways, necessary to ensure senescence and possibly engaged in a cross-talk: (1) Activated AR directly binds p21 promoter and thus causes protein expression and accumulation. P21 attenuates the levels of TAp63-α, increasing the number of PML nuclear bodies and causing senescence (2) AR enhances ROS production thus reducing phospho-Rb levels, while active Rb binds and sequesters E2F, causing senescence. Elevated p21 levels may additionally decrease phospho-Rb by blocking Cdks. Conversely, transcriptionally inactive Rb/E2F/HDAC complexes may be sequestered in PML bodies to maintain irreversible growth arrest/senescence. These pathways cumulatively contribute to quiescence, which progresses to senescence due to constitutive high mTOR activity.</p>

Surprisingly, with the exception of eotaxin most other factors were decreased after 3 and 5 days of DHT exposure and this decrease was reversed by flutamide. This data suggests a decreased inflammatory potential of the AR-positive tumors.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have shown that persistent AR activity promotes cellular senescence in prostate cancer and in normal prostate epithelial cells. Senescence is recognized as a tumor-suppressive event whereas the proportion of senescent cells is high in pre-cancerous lesions and falls in the course of malignant progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Dankort1">[46]</xref> and the failure to undergo senescence is one of the properties which makes cancer stem cells therapy-resistant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Rossi1">[47]</xref>. In agreement, our study indicates that AR-driven senescence is associated with reduced tumorigenesis.</p>
      <p>Unaltered telomerase activity suggested that AR activation caused either DNA damage- (DDR) or stress-induced (SIS), rather than replicative senescence. The involvement of Ras in AR-dependent cellular senescence was unlikely, since Ras expression and activity are constitutively high in PaCa cells regardless of AR status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Stewart1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Chopra1">[49]</xref>. Both DDR and SIS can be caused via p14/Arf - p53, or p16/INK - Rb pathways. However, the numbers of γH2-AX positive foci indicative of DNA damage remained similar in DHT-treated and control cells ruling DDR out.</p>
      <p>DDR and SIS can cross-communicate via p53 downstream target, p21, an inhibitor of Cdks, or via MDM2 downregulation downstream of Rb, which increases p53 stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Vicencio1">[23]</xref>. However, AR-positive derivatives of PC-3 and RWPE-1 cells are p53 null. Interestingly, p53 levels remained unaltered after AR activation in LNCaP cells in the presence of DHT suggesting that p53 is non-essential for AR-driven senescence.</p>
      <p>G1 arrest after 3-day DHT exposure was followed by a significant increase in senescence at day 5 and thereafter and senescence increased after the passage of the surviving cell population or the transfer to androgen-free environment, further supporting senescence and not temporary growth arrest (quiescence). At the same time, PC3-AR cells remained resistant to stress-induced apoptosis, despite the decrease in pro-survival Bcl-2, likely due to lacking p53. Seeking molecular mechanisms of AR-dependent growth arrest, we identified p21 as direct AR transcriptional target. On the other hand, we detected striking reduction of phospho-Rb downstream of AR, which, to our surprise, was not obliterated by p21 knock-down. Moreover, the pattern of Cyclin D1 decrease over time bore no direct correlation with p21 or Rb. On the other hand, AR activation enhanced ROS accumulation, which appeared critical for Rb dephosphorylation as was shown by ROS quenching. Increased ROS levels may be caused by the elevated PKCδ expression downstream of AR, which was documented previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Takahashi1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Gavrielides1">[50]</xref> or by AR-dependent Bcl2 decrease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Lee1">[51]</xref>. Oncogene activation and subsequent ROS increase have been linked to the p16/INK, Rb and senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Takahashi1">[21]</xref>. However, PC-3 and RWPE-1 cells express no detectable p16. In some systems p21 also causes increased ROS and senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Macip1">[52]</xref>. However, obvious lack of causal link between p21 and AR-dependent Rb phosphorylation suggests that AR-induced ROS triggers Rb activation independent of p53, p21, and p16/INK. Other possibilities include ROS-dependent activation of the p27 Cdk inhibitor or PP2A, which can directly dephosphorylate Rb downstream of ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Burhans1">[53]</xref>.</p>
      <p>TA-p63 and ΔNp63 were expressed in PC3-AR and RWPE-1 cells and ΔNp63 significantly downregulated upon AR activation. A member of p53 family p63 has been linked to senescence, although its mechanisms are not completely understood. The role of p63 PCa is complex; while in most cases PCa tissues stain negative for p63 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Grisanzio1">[54]</xref>, the more aggressive tumors are thought to originate from p63-positive basal epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Hayward1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Reiner1">[56]</xref>. In prostate, stem cells and basal epithelium express ΔNp63 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Signoretti1">[57]</xref>, and decrease of the ΔN isoform allows differentiation and possibly senescence. In agreement, study of mice, with isoform-specific p63 knock-down shows that ΔNp63 plays a key role in maintaining stem cell renewal and longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Beaudry1">[58]</xref>. P63 deficit can cause premature senescence by permitting release of the p19<sup>Arf</sup> (p14<sup>Arf</sup> in humans) to the nucleoplasm and subsequent p53 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Calabro1">[59]</xref>, by releasing p16/INK expression followed by Rb activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Keyes1">[26]</xref> and finally, via promyelocytic leukemia (PML) tumor suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Keyes1">[26]</xref>. Concomitant with marked decrease in p63 due to persistent AR activity, we found more PML bodies in the nuclei of PC3-AR cells in the presence of DHT and in parental PC-3 cells after p63 knock-down. In contrast, p21 knock-down in PC3-AR elevated ΔNp63 and abolished the increase of PML body numbers. Interestingly, in prostate epithelium p63 is the marker of stem and transient amplifying basal cells such as RWPE-1. P63 expression decreases along with capacity for self-renewal and completely ceases in terminally differentiated secretory luminal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Litvinov3">[27]</xref>. Thus AR induction in PCa cells likely re-activates differentiation program, which may ultimately augments stress-induced senescence; this conclusion is corroborated by our previous finding, whereas cytokeratin 8 levels increased upon AR activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Nelius1">[17]</xref>. In agreement with our data, targeted AR inactivation in the prostate epithelium causes increased proliferation and blocks differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Wu1">[60]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The fact that AR induces senescence at a much lower rate in RWPE-1 cells lacking both p53 and Rb, compared to Rb-positive PC-3 cells suggest that AR activation triggers parallel pathways, which both contribute to senescence and may be engaged in a cross-talk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>). In one pathway, AR enhances ROS production by PCa cells thus reducing Rb phosphorylation, so that active Rb binds and sequesters E2F, thus causing cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>, left). On the other hand, AR directly binds p21 promoter and thus causes accumulation of p21, which attenuates, via unknown mechanism, the expression of p63 and therefore increases the number of the PML nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031052-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>, right). Elevated p21 levels may additionally decrease in phospho-Rb by blocking Cdks. Furthermore, transcriptionally inactive Rb/E2F/HDAC complexes could be docked to PML bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Khan1">[61]</xref> and thereby maintain quiescence. The lower levels of AR-induced senescence in RWPE-1 cells suggest the predominant role of Rb over p63 depletion.</p>
      <p>In cells that like PC-3 are p53-deficient, senescence mTOR promotes senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Demidenko3">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Leontieva1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Korotchkina1">[63]</xref>. We found mTOR constitutively active in PC-3 cells regardless of AR induction. Apparently, increased Rb and p21 signaling along with ΔNp63 depletion by AR cause the state of quiescence PCa cells. Lack of p53 allows mTOR -driven senescence, which, in turn, opposes tumor progression.</p>
      <p>AR induction of cellular senescence may be interpreted as a tumor suppressive action, or as inappropriate oncogene activation, similar to Ras and Myc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Prieur1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Halazonetis1">[31]</xref>. Direct up-regulation of p21 and repression of the ΔNp63 associated with stemness imply tumor suppressive activity. Recent study shows that approximately 50% of AR mutations induced by androgen ablation reduce or abolish its transactivation activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-OMahony1">[64]</xref>, also suggesting tumor suppressive function. In addition to its direct tumor suppressive effect, senescence may increase the production of inflammatory cytokines and thus promote the growth and proliferation of a non-senescent cell population in a tumor, a phenomenon termed senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031052-Coppe2">[65]</xref>. However, multiplex analysis of the cytokine production by the PCa cells after 3 and 5 day of AR activation revealed significant decrease in at least seven major growth and inflammatory factors, suggesting that AR-dependent senescence does not incur SASP and associated tumor-promoting effects.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study clearly demonstrates that there is more than one side to AR activation: the canonical pro-proliferative, oncogenic AR activity is counterbalanced by its less studied activity where it promotes terminal differentiation and senescence. Our observations may explain why initial robust clinical response to androgen ablation is frequently followed by emergence of a more aggressive hormone-independent PCa.</p>

While PC3-AR tumor cells predictably showed higher extent of DNA damage compared to the normal RWPE-1 cells, the moderate differences between DHT-treated and control cells were not statistically significant (P value 0.3 and 0.4 for RWPE and PC3 cells, respectively).</p>
