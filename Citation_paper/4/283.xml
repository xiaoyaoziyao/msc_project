      <abstract>
        <p>Proteorhodopsin (PR) photoheterotrophy in the marine flavobacterium <italic>Dokdonia</italic> sp. PRO95 has previously been investigated, showing no growth stimulation in the light at intermediate carbon concentrations. Here we report the genome sequence of strain PRO95 and compare it to two other PR encoding <italic>Dokdonia</italic> genomes: that of strain 4H-3-7-5 which shows the most similar genome, and that of strain MED134 which grows better in the light under oligotrophic conditions. Our genome analysis revealed that the PRO95 genome as well as the 4H-3-7-5 genome encode a protein related to xanthorhodopsins. The genomic environment and phylogenetic distribution of this gene suggest that it may have frequently been recruited by lateral gene transfer. Expression analyses by RT-PCR and direct mRNA-sequencing showed that both rhodopsins and the complete β-carotene pathway necessary for retinal production are transcribed in PRO95. Proton translocation measurements showed enhanced proton pump activity in response to light, supporting that one or both rhodopsins are functional. Genomic information and carbon source respiration data were used to develop a defined cultivation medium for PRO95, but reproducible growth always required small amounts of yeast extract. Although PRO95 contains and expresses two rhodopsin genes, light did not stimulate its growth as determined by cell numbers in a nutrient poor seawater medium that mimics its natural environment, confirming previous experiments at intermediate carbon concentrations. Starvation or stress conditions might be needed to observe the physiological effect of light induced energy acquisition.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Rhodopsins are photoactive membrane-embedded opsins found in all three domains of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Spudich1">[1]</xref>. These energy transduction proteins contain seven-transmembrane α-helices and use retinal as a cofactor, located in the retinal-binding pocket, for their light-driven function. Microbial rhodopsins, classified as type I rhodopsins, are widespread amongst prokaryotes and can function as proton pumps [bacteriorhodopsins (BR) and proteorhodopsins (PR)], ion pumps [(halorhodopsins (HR)] and photosensors [sensory rhodopsins (SRI and SRII)]. BR was discovered in <italic>Halobacterium salinarium</italic>, an extremely halophilic archaeon, found in hypersaline lakes and salterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Oesterhelt1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Oesterhelt2">[3]</xref>. Bacterial rhodopsin (proteorhodopsin, PR) was discovered much later in a metagenome fragment of a marine gammaproteobacterium from the SAR86 clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Beja1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Beja2">[5]</xref>. More than a decade after their discovery, research on PRs has shown their extensive abundance and diversity in aquatic ecosystems suggesting a key role in the biochemical cycles of the oceans.</p>
      <p>Xanthorhodopsins (XRs) are light-harvesting proton pumps with a dual chromophore, one retinal molecule and one carotenoid antenna, that were first discovered in <italic>Salinibacter ruber</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Balashov1">[6]</xref>. Its carotenoid antenna salinixanthin transfers as much as 40–45% of the absorbed photons to retinal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Balashov2">[7]</xref>, resulting in a potentially much more efficient light-capturing system compared to PRs from Bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Beja1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Beja2">[5]</xref> or BRs from Archaea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Oesterhelt1">[2]</xref>. XRs have a binding pocket into which both retinal and a second chromophore, e.g. salinixanthin (<italic>S. ruber</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Balashov1">[6]</xref> or echinenone (<italic>Gloeobacter violaceus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Balashov3">[8]</xref>) are positioned.</p>
      <p>Environmental metagenomics and single cell genomics have shown PRs to be abundant not only in the ocean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Cottrell1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-dela1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Koh1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Venter1">[18]</xref>, but also in freshwater bacterioplankton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-AtamnaIsmaeel1">[19]</xref>, where they were found for the first time in <italic>Deltaproteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> and <italic>Sphingobacteria</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-MartinezGarcia1">[20]</xref>. In their study, the authors also obtained evidence for lateral gene transfer: Actinobacterial PRs were found in several gammaproteobacterial genomes; moreover, in one actinobacterial genome, two PR genes were present, one related to <italic>Actinobacteria,</italic> the other one typical for <italic>Betaproteobacteria</italic>. Sequencing the genomes of single PR-carrying bacteria recovered by cell sorting from the ocean showed that their genomes were more representative of the natural microbial bacterioplankton community than those of cultivated PR-containing bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Woyke1">[21]</xref>. However, although this new approach has a great potential to reveal the presence of certain genes in single representative genomes, it does not show if the gene is expressed and what is its physiological role for the organism that is carrying it. Experiments using heterologous systems, on the other hand, can show the function of the encoded protein. They demonstrated the proton pump activity of PRs found in the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Beja1">[4]</xref> and showed that the proton gradient might be used to power flagella movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Walter1">[22]</xref>. The question puzzling marine microbiologists, however, remains unanswered by those approaches, namely, what is powered in marine microbes by the rhodopsins that many of them are carrying? Only culturing of a strain that naturally contains the gene has the potential to explain how this organism uses the rhodopsin to survive in its particular habitat.</p>
      <p>A large percentage of whole genome sequenced PR-containing bacteria belong to the family <italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic>. However, and despite the genomic similarities, the consequences of light exposure on the different flavobacterial species appear to vary.

However, light exposure seems to activate other metabolic processes. In <italic>Polaribacter</italic> sp.

For <italic>Vibrio</italic> sp. AND4 light was shown to increase long-term survival during starvation in seawater <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-GomezConsarnau2">[28]</xref>. Similarly, in <italic>Vibrio campellii</italic> BAA-1116 the presence of light resulted in increased survival during stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Wang1">[29]</xref>. Taken together, those studies suggest that the genomic context of the different bacteria might play an important role for defining the physiological consequences of PR-phototrophy. However, why strains of the same species present different physiological responses remains unresolved. Thus, the reason for the distinct light responses in <italic>Dokdonia</italic> sp. MED134 and <italic>Dokdonia</italic> sp. PRO95 which are 99.8% similar on the level of the 16S rRNA gene could rely on genome variations apparently unrelated to the PR gene itself.</p>
      <p>Here we report the genome sequence of strain <italic>Dokdonia</italic> sp. PRO95 and compare it to that of <italic>Dokdonia</italic> sp. MED134 and <italic>Dokdonia</italic> sp.

We analyzed the presence of genomic islands, differences in gene content, and sigma factor-dependent regulation. The discovery of a second rhodopsin in PRO95 prompted us to investigate its genomic context, phylogenetic affiliation, and transcription in more depth. Guided by genome information, we conducted cultivation experiments and attempted to find a defined medium for PRO95. We performed physiological experiments to determine light-induced proton pumping activity. The effect of light on growth of PRO95 was studied in seawater culture, i.e. at extremely low nutrient concentrations similar to those found in the natural environment.</p>

          <p>With respect to functional classes of proteins, all three strains are very similar. Amongst the most abundant classes of predicted peptides, PRO95 has 100 peptidases, MED134 has 106 and 4H-3-7-5 has 104. This is a high number compared with most bacteria. <italic>Dokdonia</italic> strains probably degrade proteins, e.g. gelatin as suggested for MED134 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Gonzalez2">[48]</xref>. PRO95 has 13 glycosyl hydrolases, MED134 has 17 and 4H-3-7-5 has 15. Although these numbers are also relatively high, the three strains seem to have a strong preference for peptides over polysaccharides. Peptides with adhesion domains are involved in the degradation of high molecular weight compounds. PRO95 has 30, MED134 has 39 and 4H-3-7-5 has 33, indicating that all three strains are likely to carry out a lifestyle attached to particles and are adapted to growth on high molecular weight compounds, e.g. proteins. Additionally environmental sequences closely related to the genus <italic>Dokdonia</italic> also suggest that this trait is common in <italic>Dokdonia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-GomezPereira1">[49]</xref>.</p>

The XR-like gene sequence of PRO95 (see below) was located in close proximity to, but not inside of an identified genomic island. The correlation in this region (0.59) was, however, lower than the first quartile of correlations (0.64). LGT of single genes is very hard to detect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Becq1">[36]</xref>, therefore the strong phylogenetic signal might be supportive enough although alterations in the oligonucleotide frequency do not clearly indicate LGT. Other than that, gene transfer in PRO95 seems to be limited, since the genomic islands were few and rather small. The acquired foreign DNA was in most cases derived from the phylum <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, with a frequency distribution that resembles the phylogenetic distance. 85 genes had their closest relatives in genera of the <italic>Flavobacteriales</italic> other than <italic>Dokdonia.</italic> Most of these genes might also have been lost in the other <italic>Dokdonia</italic> species, as there is no clear genomic signature indicating LGT. In addition, 38 genes showed similarity to other members of the <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic>. Only 22 genes were found to have been recruited from other bacterial phyla, i.e. <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (7) and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (15). For single genes acquired from these phylogenetic groups an oligonucleotide frequency signal was missing, too. Among the LGT genes are those for thiamine biosynthesis, heavy metal transporters and a sodium/hydrogen exchanger. Interestingly, PRO95 recruited a ribonuclease and DNA methylation genes from <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057487.s005">Table S4</xref>).</p>

          <title>A xanthorhodopsin-like protein is encoded in the genome of PRO95</title>
          <p>A second predicted rhodopsin gene was found in the genome of <italic>Dokdonia</italic> sp. PRO95, encoding a protein of 280 amino acid residues (843 bp) which shows typical rhodopsin features. The amino acid residue Lys231 (EBAC31A08-numbering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Man1">[50]</xref>) in helix G binds the cofactor retinal and is completely conserved in all PRs and XRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Beja1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Balashov1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-GomezConsarnau1">[23]</xref>. The amino acid residues functioning as proton acceptor and proton donor differ from those described previously. Instead of Asp97 (D) and Glu108 (E), the related amino acids Asn97 (N) and Gln108 (Q) are found. In comparison to Asp and Glu, these amino acids contain an amid side chain instead of a caboxyl group, indicating also a possibly new group of rhodopsins. The same amino acids at these positions were also found in rhodopsins of the strains 4H-3-7-5, <italic>Gillisia limnaea</italic> R-8282<sup>T</sup> ( = DSM 15749) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-VanTrappen1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Riedel2">[52]</xref>, <italic>Truepera radiovictrix</italic> RQ-24<sup>T</sup> ( = DSM 17093) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Albuquerque1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Ivanova1">[54]</xref>, <italic>Citromicrobium bathyomarinum</italic> JL354 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Jiao1">[55]</xref>, <italic>Citromicrobium</italic> sp.

At position 105, which is mainly responsible for rhodopsin spectral tuning, the amino acid residue Leu (L) was detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Man1">[50]</xref>. Without considering the possible influence of further amino acid residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Yoshitsugu1">[58]</xref> or the influence of the putative carotenoid antenna, which might shift the absorbance maximum, the second rhodopsin of PRO95 seems to be a green-light absorbing rhodopsin.</p>
          <p>The retinal binding pocket shows similarities to that of described XRs. Four of twelve amino acid residues involved in chromophore binding are identical to those in XR of <italic>Salinibacter ruber</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Luecke1">[59]</xref>. Interestingly, the XR of <italic>Gloeobacter violaceus</italic> PCC 7421 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Nakamura1">[60]</xref> similarly shares only seven of the twelve amino acids involved in chromophore binding with <italic>S. ruber</italic> (Gly156, Thr160, Asn191, Leu197, Ile205, Tyr207, and Met211, amino acid residue numbering according to the XR sequence of <italic>S. ruber</italic>). When its XR gene is expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and reconstituted with both salinixanthin and retinal it behaves like the XR of <italic>S. ruber</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Imasheva1">[61]</xref>. Moreover, the pigment of <italic>G. violaceus</italic>, echinenone, reconstitutes a functional XR molecule <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Balashov3">[8]</xref>, indicating that different XRs may use different types of carotenoids as antenna molecules. Carotenoids belong to the most structurally diverse and widely distributed pigments in nature. In both chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll based photrophy, carotenoids serve as accessory pigments in light-harvesting complexes as well as photo-oxidative protectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Frank1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Wilson1">[64]</xref>.

PRO95 and <italic>Dokdonia</italic> sp. 4H-3-7-5 which both encode for PR and a XR-like protein, lack the <italic>crtO</italic> gene, suggesting that their XR might be associated to an antenna carotenoid different from salinixanthin.</p>

          <p>The strains <italic>Dokdonia</italic> sp.

It is therefore unlikely that this rhodopsin, which shows homologies to known XR proteins, has been transferred to them in an extreme habitat. Organisms carrying XR-like homologues seem to be widespread and were found in diverse marine habitats, only some of which were extreme, e.g. sea-ice brine, crystallizer ponds of salterns, or hot springs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057487.s003">Table S2</xref>).</p>

The genomic region around the XR-like rhodopsin gene of PRO95 is also highly syntenic to that of strain 4H-3-7-5, although these genes are not known to be related to the rhodopsin function itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057487-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Interestingly, while R-8282<sup>T</sup> and RQ-24<sup>T</sup> contain the XR-like-encoding sequence but none of the surrounding genes, MED134 has nearly all the adjacent genes, but lacks the XR-like encoding sequence. Instead, it carries a hypothetical protein at this position. The data suggest that most likely only the XR-related gene has been taken up or lost by LGT, an event that seems to have occurred frequently in the marine habitat.</p>

          <title>Genes for carotenoid and retinal biosynthesis</title>
          <p>For the biosynthesis of β-carotene from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) six enzymes are required <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-GomezConsarnau1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Kimura1">[24]</xref>. β-carotene is a precursor for the biosynthesis of carotenoids and can be directly transformed into two molecules of retinal by the β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase encoded by the <italic>blh</italic>-gene. All these genes are present in the genomes of strain PRO95, MED134, 4H-3-7-5 as well as in strain R-8282<sup>T</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057487-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). A rather complex situation can be observed in strain RQ-24<sup>T</sup>. Its genome encodes two <italic>crt</italic>I genes as well as a <italic>crtO</italic> gene, which is required for the formation of the carotenoid antenna of the XR. Genome analysis of PRO95, 4H-3-7-5 and R-8282<sup>T</sup> revealed the lack of this <italic>crtO</italic> gene, indicating that those rhodopsins use another antenna protein or they function without an additional antenna, suggesting a new group of rhodopsins. Surprisingly in strain R-8282<sup>T</sup> as well as RQ-24<sup>T</sup> more than two rhodopsin genes were found: strain R-8282<sup>T</sup> encodes 3 rhodopsin genes – one PR, one unclassified rhodopsin related to XR sequences and one truncated rhodopsin sequence. Strain RQ-24<sup>T</sup> encodes even 4 rhodopsin genes. Two of them (<italic>rds2</italic> and <italic>rds4</italic>) are similar to the second rhodopsin of strain PRO95. The third one (<italic>rds1</italic>) appears to be truncated, and <italic>rds3</italic> seems to be a sensory rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057487-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

          <title>Sigma factors</title>
          <p>The primary sigma factor in bacteria is RpoD (σ70), which binds to conserved sequences of strong promoters and plays a critical role in regulating the expression of housekeeping genes. As reported earlier, MED134 encodes two RpoD homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Gonzalez2">[48]</xref>, and the same is true for PRO95 and 4H-3-7-5. One of the MED134 RpoD homologs (MED134_12871) is 93% identical to the RpoD of <italic>Flavobacterium johnsoniae</italic> UW101 for which the consensus promoter sequence is known and common in flavobacteria: TTGNTANNTTTG. In MED134, the consensus promoter sequence of RpoD is found upstream of 70 genes, including the PR gene. In PRO95 it is found upstream of 66 genes, but not upstream of genes related to light and energy conservation, i. e. the PR or XR-like genes. The second MED134 RpoD is 100% identical to the second RpoD in PRO95. But for this one the consensus promoter sequence is not known in flavobacteria. 4H-3-7-5 also has an RpoD that is 97% identical to the first MED134 RpoD and the second RpoD (MED134_05474) is also 100% identical to Krodi_2724. Like in PRO95 the consensus sequence of RpoD is not upstream of any of the opsin genes.</p>
          <p>One might conclude that the opsins of PRO95 or 4H-3-7-5 may not function as housekeeping genes because the main sigma factor does not bind to them. This is however in contrast to the constitutive expression of PR in PRO95. Moreover, the second homologue of the main sigma factor, which is present in all three strains, and whose promotor sequence is not known, could also play a crucial role for the control of the rhodopsin genes. Thus further work is needed to elucidate the regulation of PR expression in these flavobacteria.</p>

          <title>Phenotype microarrays</title>
          <p>For characterization of carbon source metabolism in strain PRO95 we used the Omnilog system (Biolog platform). Phenotype microarray plates PM1 and PM2 were used. They contain 190 different carbon sources together with a mix of IF-0, artificial seawater medium, vitamins, trace elements, sodium bicarbonate buffer and DyeD. DyeD is a tretazolium redox dye which enables the detection of respiration by NADH-dependent reduction, which results in purple color. The formation of the purple color thus reflects the import as well as the metabolic conversion of a specific substrate, but not necessarily growth. Experiments with both PM plates were performed in two independent replicates which showed identical results. To allow quantitative comparison of results, the area under curve (AUC) was determined as a measure of respiratory activity for each tested carbon source using Simpson’s rule. Respiratory activity was assumed to be positive for an AUC that was 50% higher than that of the negative control. The data indicate that PRO95 can import and metabolize 53 different carbon sources. We identified 23 different carbohydrates, including glucose. In addition PRO95 metabolized 15 different amino acids (including L-glutamic acid) and amino acid derivatives (e.g. glycyl-L-glutamic acid), 7 different organic acids (e.g. propionic acid) and 8 compounds that were related to other carbon sources (e.g. gelatin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057487-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

          <title>Development of a defined cultivation medium</title>
          <p>A defined cultivation medium is not known for any of the flavobacteria and would be a large step forward in understanding their physiology. It was not possible to develop a minimal medium for strain PRO95 containing only one carbon source together with a universal mix of vitamins (DSMZ medium 141) and trace elements (DSMZ medium 792).</p>
          <p>As a further step, the genome was investigated for cultivation related information. Biosynthesis pathways for all 20 proteinogenic amino acids were found in the genome of PRO95 by inspection of the KEGG pathway maps. Thus PRO95 should not be auxotrophic for any of them. Inspection of the KEGG pathway maps revealed also the possible biosynthesis of non-proteinogenic amino acids like L-citrulline, L-ornithine and argininosuccinate, which play a major role within the urea cycle. PRO95 should also have the ability to synthesize D-alanine, D-glutamine, D-glutamate, D-phenylalanine and D-proline as well as β-alanine which is required for coenzyme A biosynthesis. Given the preference of PRO95 (and flavobacteria in general) for degradation of high molecular weight compounds, especially proteins, this is an unexpected finding. The cultivation approach was based on artificial seawater which was amended with Wolfés Mineral Elixier (DSMZ medium 792), NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and Wolin-Vitamins (DSMZ medium 141). The pH of the medium was adjusted to pH 7.3–7.5, cultures were incubated at 28°C in weak light (40 Watt light bulb). The preculture was grown in marine broth 2216 medium filled into serum bottles under air atmosphere, and the main cultures were inoculated with 1% (v/v) of the preculture. The medium contained all minerals required by bacteria, N and P in large quantities, and the vitamins known to be required by enzymes, including thiamine and cobalamin. Therefore, theoretically supplementation of this medium with a carbon source should have been sufficient for growth of PRO95. Based on the carbon respiration data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057487-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) the carbon sources D-glucose and L-glutamate were chosen as substrates. However, no growth was obtained with glutamate (10 mM) or glucose (2 mM). When L-histidine or malate were supplied in small amounts to glutamate, weak growth was obtained after 3 days, whereas L-tryptophan, L-isoleucine, L-proline, benzoate or capronate had no stimulatory effect. Cultures grown in defined medium with glutamate did, however, not continue to grow when transferred to fresh medium. Using glucose as a carbon source and a mixture of amino acids as supplement, growth was much slower, reaching stationary phase in about three months, but this culture could be transferred to a similar medium and showed at least some weak growth after three months again. By contrast, growth and repeated subcultivation was possible in artificial seawater media with at least a supplement of 0.01% yeast extract.</p>
          <p>The data suggest that an unknown component has been lacking in the defined media, which is normally present in yeast extract, and which might have a regulatory role, rather than act as a growth substrate. Yeast extract contains not only single amino acids, but also dipeptides, oligopeptides, and diketopiperazines, which can form during autoclaving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Shanker1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Borthwick1">[68]</xref>.

          <p>The RNA was amplified using the MessageAmpII-Bacteria Kit and then rRNA was partly removed using the Terminator 5′ Phosphate-dependent Exonuclease. 155 and 56 out of 3372 firstly annotated ORFs could not be detected in the transcriptome from the low and high carbon cultivation sample, respectively. 40 ORFs could not be found in both datasets. In many cases those genes were located in close proximity on the genome, indicating that the lack of transcripts was likely due to inactivity of these genes and not due to a technical artifact. Both the scatter plot and the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.924 point to a linear relationship between both datasets suggesting that amplification of mRNA was linear and did not introduce a systematic bias when the obtained data are compared to non-amplified samples. Using a linear model approach, a slope of 0.8235 (standard error 0.0179, p-value = 0.0) was calculated, further supporting a linear relationship between both samples.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Genome sequencing and analysis revealed the presence of a second bacterial rhodopsin gene in PRO95. It might represent a new type of rhodopsin and is similar to XR. This newly discovered rhodopsin gene is also present in related flavobacteria, e.g. <italic>Dokdonia</italic> sp. 4H-3-7-5 and <italic>G. limnaea</italic> R-8282<sup>T</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Riedel2">[52]</xref> as well as in taxonomically diverse other bacterial groups suggesting that it has frequently been recruited through LGT. Its presence in phylogenetically distantly related groups indicates a “promiscuity” that may be connected to the extreme environments in which most of those rhodopsin-carrying organisms thrive. We show by RT-PCR and direct sequencing of mRNA that both rhodopsin genes as well as the complete pathway for the synthesis of the cofactor retinal are expressed by strain PRO95, suggesting an important role of rhodopsin-mediated phototrophy for this organism. A light-induced proton translocation activity was demonstrated, thus one or both rhodopsin proteins are functional. However, we detected no growth advantage of PRO95 when cultivated in seawater in the light compared to incubation in the dark. The flavobacterial PR has been expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and shown to be a proton pump. The new XR like protein found in PRO95 should definitely be investigated in an <italic>E. coli</italic> overexpression system to measure its response to light and its interaction with carotenoids.</p>
      <p>Among <italic>Haloarchaea</italic>, multiple rhodopsins with different functions can exist in one single cell. For example, <italic>Haloarcula marismortui</italic>, a halophilic red pigmented haloarchaeon, encodes genes for six rhodopsins: two for BR, one for HR and three SRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Fu1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Baliga1">[74]</xref>. Additionally, in <italic>Haloquadratum walsbyi</italic>, a square shaped halophilic archaeon discovered first in a salt pool near the Red Sea, it could be shown that one rhodopsin shows both SRII and BR function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Sudo1">[75]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the domain <italic>Bacteria</italic> only a few cultivated strains are known encoding several genes for rhodopsins in one genome. An example is the extreme halophile <italic>Salinibacter ruber</italic> strain M31<sup>T</sup> that belongs to the family <italic>Rhodothermaceae</italic> within the phylum <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>. It was isolated from climax saltern chrystallyzers and its genome encodes for four different rhodopsin sequences (one bacterial XR, one archaeal HR and two archaeal SRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Mongodin1">[65]</xref>. The genus <italic>Salinibacter</italic> shares its extreme habitat with <italic>Haloarchaea</italic> thus it is thought that the archaeal rhodopsins were transferred into this halophilic bacterium by LGT due to the close association of these two organisms in hypersaline aquatic environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Mongodin1">[65]</xref>. The scattered distribution of prokaryotic rhodopsin genes within <italic>Bacteria</italic> and <italic>Archaea</italic> has also been interpreted by other groups as a result of lateral gene transfer which switches between domains of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Mongodin1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Frigaard1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Sharma1">[77]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The amount of energy provided to strain PRO95 by PR (and possibly the XR like protein) apparently is too small to be detectable by cell counts or it is not converted into biomass in this organism Thus, much more sensitive parameters than cell number are required to unravel the function of rhodopsins in flavobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Steindler1">[30]</xref>. Experiments under starvation conditions are time consuming and contamination of the culture is a constant threat. Moreover, genetic systems for flavobacteria are very limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Gomez1">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Su1">[79]</xref>. Thus, the most precise experiment for an analysis of the global physiological role of PR, i.e. comparison of the wild-type with a gene deletion mutant, is not feasible. Comparing light and dark incubation is presently the only means to study the physiological role of PR.</p>
      <p>However, although we are able to cultivate <italic>Dokdonia</italic> species in the laboratory, we are far from understanding their real metabolic requirements. This was demonstrated by our unsuccessful attempts to develop a defined cultivation medium for PRO95. In spite of the ability of PRO95 to metabolize a wide spectrum of carbon sources and to synthesize all proteinogenic amino acids, it failed to grow on cultivation media that provided a selection of compounds based on the current microbiological expertise, genome information, and carbon source respiration data. The striking differences observed when cultivating <italic>Dokdonia</italic> strains in artificial versus natural seawater (Gómez-Consarnau, unpublished results) also suggest that natural seawater may contain additional molecules which are required by the bacteria. Rather than being sources of carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur, the necessary cues might represent cell-cell communication signals or metabolic intermediates which must be provided by neighbouring cells in the natural habitat of <italic>Dokdonia</italic>. For example, <italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062 is auxotrophic for certain vitamins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Carini1">[80]</xref> and thus critically dependent on the presence of bacteria that are able to excrete these vitamins. Although only tiny amounts are needed by the cells, concentrations in the ocean are far below these amounts in huge regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-Giovannoni2">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057487-SanudoWilhelmy1">[82]</xref>.</p>
