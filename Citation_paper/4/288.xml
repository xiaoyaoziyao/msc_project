      <abstract>
        <p>There is concern that antibiotic resistance can potentially be transferred from animals to humans through the food chain. The relationship between specific antibiotic resistant bacteria and the genes they carry remains to be described. Few details are known about the ecology of antibiotic resistant genes and bacteria in food production systems, or how antibiotic resistance genes in food animals compare to antibiotic resistance genes in other ecosystems. Here we report the distribution of antibiotic resistant genes in publicly available agricultural and non-agricultural metagenomic samples and identify which bacteria are likely to be carrying those genes. Antibiotic resistance, as coded for in the genes used in this study, is a process that was associated with all natural, agricultural, and human-impacted ecosystems examined, with between 0.7 to 4.4% of all classified genes in each habitat coding for resistance to antibiotic and toxic compounds (RATC). Agricultural, human, and coastal-marine metagenomes have characteristic distributions of antibiotic resistance genes, and different bacteria that carry the genes. There is a larger percentage of the total genome associated with antibiotic resistance in gastrointestinal-associated and agricultural metagenomes compared to marine and Antarctic samples. Since antibiotic resistance genes are a natural part of both human-impacted and pristine habitats, presence of these resistance genes in any specific habitat is therefore not sufficient to indicate or determine impact of anthropogenic antibiotic use. We recommend that baseline studies and control samples be taken in order to determine natural background levels of antibiotic resistant bacteria and/or antibiotic resistance genes when investigating the impacts of veterinary use of antibiotics on human health. We raise questions regarding whether the underlying biology of each type of bacteria contributes to the likelihood of transfer via the food chain.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>American consumers and producers are increasingly aware of concerns over antibiotic resistance in food. In animal agriculture, the specific concern is that the use of antibiotics in food animals promotes the growth of antibiotic resistant bacteria that can then be transferred to humans via food processing and distribution systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Collignon1">[1]</xref>. If these antibiotic resistant bacteria survive the acid pH of the stomach, they can potentially infect humans and cause disease. Additionally, even if the bacteria themselves do not survive outside of the live animal, their antibiotic resistance genes may be available for uptake by other bacteria via a process called horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT can occur in bacteria that become associated with a food product that is then ingested by a human, or it can occur directly within the human gastrointestinal tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Crippen1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Schjrring1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Stecher1">[4]</xref>, although the actual rates and frequency of HGT in specific environmental, food associated, and intestinal habitats is not known.</p>
      <p>While a broad conceptual framework has been worked out describing how use of antibiotics in food animals has the potential to adversely impact human health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Teuber1">[5]</xref>, many details regarding the epidemiology and ecology of antibiotic resistance in animal agriculture and food processing systems remain to be described. A number of studies have measured antibiotic resistance in animal production environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-BrichtaHarhay1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Haley1">[7]</xref>, and the general public perception is that agricultural environments have more antibiotic resistance than natural and non-agricultural environments. However little empirical data exists to quantify how the levels and types of antibiotic resistance in agricultural settings compare to those in non-agricultural settings. The first step in this comparison is to determine if differences in antibiotic resistance gene distribution can be observed between agricultural and non-agricultural samples, and describe them if present. Here we test the hypothesis that agricultural environments have different antibiotic resistance profiles than non-agricultural environments by quantifying the numbers and kinds of antibiotic resistance genes in publicly available metagenomic samples from 26 environments, including natural and agricultural samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Tringe1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Kurokawa1">[20]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048325-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). In addition, we identified bacteria that are likely carrying the antibiotic resistance genes, and determined if there are differences in the diversity or taxonomic distribution of antibiotic resistant bacteria in agricultural and natural settings.</p>

        <title>Community Metagenomics</title>
        <p>In microbial community metagenomic studies, total DNA is isolated from a complex sample, and then subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Unlike 16S rRNA sequencing which relies on a PCR step to target the 16S rRNA gene specifically, in metagenomic studies there is no PCR step, and the entire genomic DNA of a sample is sheared and sequenced directly. This direct sequencing allows for the collection of quantitative data that is not possible with 16S rRNA-based studies. Metagenomic sequencing theoretically provides information on all of the genes present in a sample, and data analysis tools such as MG-RAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Meyer1">[21]</xref> allow for the binning of community genes by function.</p>

        <title>Measuring Antibiotic Resistance</title>
        <p>Antibiotic resistance is a broad term, and is commonly used to denote the presence and/or expression of at least one antibiotic resistance element. There are multiple classes of antibiotics, multiple mechanisms of resistance within classes, and multiple genes within each functional group.

        <title>Determining Distribution of Functional Genes</title>
        <p>In order to determine the distribution of genes associated with resistance to antibiotic and toxic compounds (RATC) from agricultural, environmental, and human-associated samples, we analyzed publicly available metagenomic datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048325-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048325.s002">Table S1</xref></bold>). Previous work evaluating the distribution of functional genes in metagenomes from nine biomes reported the mean percentage of genes assigned virulence functions was 9.79% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Dinsdale1">[9]</xref>. The group of genes we analyzed is the subset of virulence genes that are associated with RATC. The sequences were available through MG-RAST, which was used to annotate the DNA fragments and provide functional assignments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Meyer1">[21]</xref>. The SEED database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Overbeek1">[22]</xref> was used to link gene function with microbial taxonomy, allowing us to determine which bacteria were likely carrying the antibiotic resistance genes.</p>

The alphaproteobacteria carry a larger proportion of the betalactamase genes in marine metagenomes (between 20–36%), compared to metagenomes from food producing animals (1–15%). In contrast, the Clostrida from food producing animals appear to carry proportionally more betalactamse genes than the Clostridia from marine metagenomes.

        <p>Metagenomes were chosen from those that were publicly available on January 2010. All analyses are based on information provided using MGRAST V2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Meyer1">[21]</xref>. The SEED database was used to assign functional classes and taxonomies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Overbeek1">[22]</xref>. In the complete set of MGRAST V2 functional assignments, RATC genes were classified as a subset of virulence genes. MGRAST V2 provided a tabular view of functional assignments where each functional assignment contained a link to the SEED taxonomic assignment. For each metagenome and each RATC category, the tabular view was used to copy the functional assignment and taxonomic link into Excel files. A macro was written to copy the taxonomy line from each SEED taxonomic assignment into the Excel file next to the corresponding functional assignment. The Excel function “Data &gt; text to columns” was used to parse the taxonomic information into individual Excel columns, and the taxonomic data was cleaned and curated by hand. Individual Excel files for each RATC category were combined to generate a single file of linked functional and taxonomic assignments for each metagenome. Principal components analysis of RATC patterns were conducted using the SAS statistical software package version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>

        <title>Total Number and Percent of RATC</title>
        <p>The RATC group of genes represents a subset of virulence genes that ranged from 0.70% to 4.04% of classified metagenome gene sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048325-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). In general, samples from aquatic metagenomes, such as the Gulf of Maine, Chesapeake Bay, Key West, Galapagos and Sargasso Sea, had a lower total number and percentage of assigned fragments associated with RATC, compared with terrestrial metagenomes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048325.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). In other words, microbial communities from marine environments have a smaller percentage of their total genetic resources allocated to RATC genes, suggesting that the bacteria in these habitats encounter fewer antibiotic and toxic compounds, compared to bacteria from the terrestrial and gastrointestinal samples. Based upon prevalence, 22 of the 26 metagenomes could be grouped into one of four classes–fecal (4.04 to 3.75% RATC), gastrointestinal tract (3.03 to 2.66% RATC), aquatic terrestrial ecosystems (2.24 to 2.15% RATC), and aquatic marine ecosystems (2.00 to 0.70%RATC). The percentage RATC in ungrouped metagenomes including kimchi, whale fall, soy phyllosphere, and farm soil ranged from 3.09 to 3.62%. An obvious relationship between increased incidence of RATC and cell density is evident from these samples. Survival in microbially-dense, very active environments (feces, soils, and gastrointestinal tracts) compared to lower density environments (aquatic ecosystems) may involve coping with toxic metabolites and antibiotics. What is the role for anthropogenic antibiotic use and prevalence of RATC? Certainly samples within fecal and gastrointestinal tract groups were likely exposed to anthropogenic antibiotics at some point in time, but the high rate of RATC in kimchi, whale fall, and termite gut, which probably were never treated with antibiotics, indicate that the effect of antibiotic exposure on percent RATC is more complicated.</p>

        <p>The current metagenomic analysis affords a first glimpse of antibiotic gene distribution across metagenomes. For example, although the four North American costal samples display the same general distribution of RATC genes, slight differences can be observed for specific RATC classes and locations. The Chesapeake Bay metagenome has a higher proportion of assignments in the tripartite Gram negative multi-drug resistance (MDR) (2.6%) and tetracycline resistance (2.6%) categories compared to the Gulf of Main, Key West, and the Gulf of Mexico (range 0.8–1.9% for Gram negative MDR, 0–0.24% for tetracycline), and a lower proportion of the acriflavin resistance cluster and beta-lactamase resistance (13.9% for acriflavin resistance genes in Chesapeake compared to 16.6–21.0% for the others; 9.9% for tetracycline resistance in Chesapeake compared to 15.6–17.5% for the others). Difference in RATC distribution can also be observed in the cattle rumen and fecal samples, with both fluoroquinolone resistance and tetracycline resistance genes being lower in feces (20% for fluoroquinolone, 5% for tetracycline) than in rumen samples (average of 30% for fluoroquinolone, 19% for tetracycline). The differences between the fecal and rumen samples likely reflect the underlying biological functions of the two gastrointestinal locations, and serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the ecology of antibiotic resistance genes in food production settings. Two other metagenomes of interest are the fish gut and the fermented kimchi. The fish gut contains a much higher proportion of mercury resistance, mercuric reductase, and cobalt/zinc/cadmium genes than any other metagenome in the analysis (1.65%, 2.26% and 53% respectively for each category in fish, compared to an average of 0.03%, 0.3%, and 16%, respectively, for the other metagenomes studied). The day 29 kimchi fermentation contains proportionately more of the two-protein Gram positive MDR genes (12.3%) compared to any other metagenome in the analysis (next highest value is a human stool at 0.93%). Both the fish and the kimchi results make sense in light of what we already know about the biology of the two systems: fish are known to concentrate mercury, and vegetable fermentations specifically select for Gram-positive organisms. The data set assembled for the current analysis contains three human fecal and three cattle rumen metagenomes. Within each “replicated” metagenome type, the RATC values are fairly similar. While all of the metagenome results await confirmation via replication over multiple samples and over time, the limited data available at this point suggests that there are characteristic RATC profiles for specific metagenomes. Previous work examining metagenomic profiles revealed biome-associated metabolic profiles, including gene assignments to the functional category of “virulence”. The current study extends the conclusions of Disndale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Dinsdale1">[9]</xref> to include RATC, one of many subsets in the virulence category.</p>

        <p>The canine and soy metagenomes were the most diverse in regards to the 33 total RATC categories represented, with 31 and 30 observed RATC categories, respectively, followed by farm soil, human stool and cattle feces with 27 RATC categories observed, and Chesapeake Bay with 25 RATC categories observed. The least diverse metagenome was the Sargasso Sea, with only 7 RATC categories represented.</p>
        <p>Principal component analysis based on the number of genes in each of the RATC classes reveals that agricultural, human-associated, and costal marine samples each form distinct groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048325-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>, suggesting that there are differences in the numbers and kinds of antibiotic resistance in these general categories of metagenomes<bold>.</bold> Specifically, agricultural and human-associated samples each form distinct clusters within quadrant III, and aquatic samples, including a coastal marine cluster, were distributed within quadrant IV and nearby in quadrant I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048325-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). Comparing the general distribution of various RATC metagenomes within the plot indicates that the variation between human-and animal agriculture is not disproportionate compared to other systems. For instance the separation of two Antarctic Lakes is roughly the same magnitude separating coastal marine metagenomes from the animal agriculture group. Examination of the Eigen vectors associated with RATC classes indicates that tetracycline, aminoglycoside adenyltransferase, and MDR efflux pump genes were strong determining factors for quadrant III groups. Whether or not these particular RATC classes can serve to distinguish larger numbers of human and agricultural from aquatic marine samples remains to be determined.</p>

        <title>Antibiotic Resistance in Specific Habitats</title>
        <p>A subset of 16 metagenomes were examined to determine which bacteria were likely hosts within each metagenome for RATC genes, with a focus on genes associated with common antibiotic resistance classes, and classes that are important in human and veterinary health settings. The five classes chosen were: beta-lactamase resistance, MDR efflux pumps, fluoroquinolone resistance, tetracycline resistance, and vancomycin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048325-g004"><bold>Figures 4</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048325-g005"><bold>5</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048325-g006"><bold>6</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048325-g007"><bold>7</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048325-g008"><bold>8</bold></xref>; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048325.s003">Table S2</xref>)</bold>: Results indicate that specific RATC gene categories are non-randomly distributed among bacterial taxa. The beta-lactamase resistance, MDR efflux pumps, and fluoroquinolone resistance genes were broadly distributed across 15, 12, and 13 bacterial phyla, respectively, compared to four for tetracycline and five for vancomycin resistance. The broader taxonomic distribution of beta-lactamase, MDR efflux and fluoroquinolone resistance genes suggests that there is a greater diversity of bacteria that are capable of taking up these genes via HGT in natural settings, compared to tetracycline and vancomycin resistance genes. Since little is known about the commensal flora ingested with food, it is unknown whether or not the taxonomic range of the bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes may impact human health. Also, HGT rates between various groups of bacteria are not well characterized. When looking at the impact of veterinary antibiotic use on human health, are some kinds of resistance more likely to be transferred between commensal bacteria of different phyla via HGT than others? Are some bacteria phyla more likely than others to horizontally transfer antibiotic resistance genes to particular foodborne pathogens?</p>

The majority of beta-lactamase resistance genes in this particular set were associated with the soy phyllosphere (23%), followed by Galapagos (19%), canine (17%), cattle fecal (10%), and Key West (9%). Across the 16 metagenomes, Beta-lactamase genes were most frequently associated with Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, which together account for 36% of all Beta-lactamase genes in the 16 metagenomes studied. It is not clear why the leaf of a soybean plant contained the largest proportion of beta-lactamase genes from the 16 metagenomes examined; however extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene sequences have been identified on both conventional and organic retail spinach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Raphael1">[23]</xref>.

        <title>Application of Antibiotic Resistance Information to Food Safety</title>
        <p>As with all gene-based surveys, the data indicate only the presence or absence of the target gene, but provide no information on whether the gene came from a living or dead bacterium, or if the gene is expressed in any particular habitat. The concept of HGT, where living bacteria can pick up genes released by dead bacteria, is a key element in the model describing how antibiotic resistance genes from animals can cause clinical health problems for humans. Knowing which bacteria are likely carrying specific antibiotic resistance genes raises the question of whether some bacteria are more relevant than others in the discussion of antibiotic resistance in food animals. For example, it has long been known that the major source of bacterial contamination on beef during processing comes from the animal hide, not the feces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Empey1">[26]</xref>, and more recently this trend has been confirmed for pathogens such as Shiga-toxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Arthur1">[27]</xref>. Results from the current study show that fluoroquinolone resistance in cattle feces is carried by both Bacteroidetes and Clostridia. Since Bacteroidetes are Gram-negative obligate anaerobes that don’t survive well outside of the animal gut and Clostridia are spore formers that can survive harsh environmental conditions found in the feedlot and on the hide, do the fluoroquinolone resistance genes in Clostridia have greater potential for transmission of antibiotic resistance to microorganisms important to humans? Across the 16 metagenomes for which taxonomic information was analyzed, the Bacteroidetes are associated with 24% of all fluoroquinolone resistance genes, compared to 15% associated with Clostridia. Another example, looking at beta-lactamase genes, is that while the Alpha- and Gamma-proteobacteria are most frequently associated with beta-lactamase resistance genes across metagenomes, in cattle feces, it is the Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes bacteria that are most commonly linked with these genes – again raising the question of whether some bacteria are more relevant than others when considering the impacts of veterinary antibiotic use on human health. An additional factor which must be considered is the rate at which specific antibiotic resistance genes are transferred in feces and the environment, and the rate at which the modifications needed for expression of the transferred genes occurs. In order for the new host bacteria to become resistant the new host must have or acquire the genetic machinery needed to express the gene. Are some groups of bacteria more likely to acquire or contribute antibiotic resistance genes via HGT, and is the rate of HGT influenced by bacterial taxonomy and specific habitats? How do HGT rates as measured in the laboratory compare to actual rates in pre-harvest feedlot, food processing and storage, and environmental conditions? Since the taxonomic distribution of bacteria is different in each step of the farm-to-fork continuum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Durso2">[28]</xref> the dynamics of HGT may vary in each of these habitats. Knowing which bacteria are likely carrying specific antibiotic resistance genes affords a starting point for laboratory and field based experiments exploring HGT in food production settings.</p>
        <p>Our results support those of Wright et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Wright1">[29]</xref> describing a global pool of antibiotic resistance genes. Studies showing that antibiotic resistance is ancient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-DCosta1">[30]</xref>, when combined with work showing that antibiotic resistance genes can be found in a variety of human-impacted and pristine habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Wright1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048325-Dantas1">[31]</xref>, this study) reveal that the presence of antibiotic resistant genes is a normal and natural phenomenon. This means that, when looking at the impacts of veterinary use of antibiotics on human health, baseline studies and control samples are needed to determine natural background levels of antibiotic resistant bacteria and/or antibiotic resistance genes for comparison. By figuring out how antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in agriculturally-impacted and non-agriculturally impacted environments compare, we can target control measures where they make the most sense.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Antibiotic resistance genes are common in both agricultural and non-agricultural habitats, although differences exist in the diversity and taxonomic distribution of the bacteria associated with these genes in agricultural and non-agricultural metagenomes. Since antibiotic resistance genes are a natural part of both human-impacted and pristine habitats, presence of these resistance genes in any specific habitat therefore is not sufficient to indicate or determine impact of anthropogenic antibiotic use.</p>
