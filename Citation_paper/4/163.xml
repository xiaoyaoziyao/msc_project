<abstract>
<p>The CARICOMP monitoring network gathered standardized data from 52 seagrass sampling stations at 22 sites (mostly <italic>Thalassia testudinum</italic>-dominated beds in reef systems) across the Wider Caribbean twice a year over the period 1993 to 2007 (and in some cases up to 2012). Wide variations in community total biomass (285 to &gt;2000 g dry m<sup>−2</sup>) and annual foliar productivity of the dominant seagrass <italic>T. testudinum</italic> (&lt;200 and &gt;2000 g dry m<sup>−2</sup>) were found among sites. Solar-cycle related intra-annual variations in <italic>T. testudinum</italic> leaf productivity were detected at latitudes &gt; 16°N. Hurricanes had little to no long-term effects on these well-developed seagrass communities, except for 1 station, where the vegetation was lost by burial below ∼1 m sand. At two sites (5 stations), the seagrass beds collapsed due to excessive grazing by turtles or sea-urchins (the latter in combination with human impact and storms). The low-cost methods of this regional-scale monitoring program were sufficient to detect long-term shifts in the communities, and fifteen (43%) out of 35 long-term monitoring stations (at 17 sites) showed trends in seagrass communities consistent with expected changes under environmental deterioration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Seagrass beds are among the most extensive shallow marine coastal habitats worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Green1">[1]</xref>. Their ecosystem services include sustaining diverse faunal communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Green1">[1]</xref>, supporting fisheries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Gillanders1">[2]</xref>, providing coastal protection through stabilization of sediments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Madsen1">[3]</xref>, cycling of nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Romero1">[4]</xref> and carbon sequestration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Duarte1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Fourqurean1">[6]</xref>. In the Caribbean, seagrasses are associated with marine/brackish protected bays and estuaries or reef systems (reef lagoons between the coastlines and the coral reefs). In reef systems, seagrass communities fulfil the above-mentioned services, and additionally provide important ecological linkages with the adjacent coral reefs and/or mangroves. Seagrass communities support the existence of coral reefs through the export of organic materials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Heck1">[7]</xref> and provide grazing grounds and/or nurseries for coral reef fishes and other reef fauna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Nagelkerken1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Verweij1">[10]</xref>. In addition, associated calcareous macro-algae and epiphytes (algae and invertebrates) on seagrass leaves are major providers of calcium carbonate sediments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Wefer1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-VanTussenbroekB1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>In places where funding resources are particularly limited such as developing countries in the Caribbean, bio-indicators can provide warning of changes in the biological condition of a coastal system and are thereby valuable to natural resource managers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Linton1">[14]</xref>. Despite such relevance, comprehensive spatio-temporal analyses of bio-indicators in tropical countries are scarce because of the lack of long-term monitoring data. Seagrasses are widely distributed, rooted in the substrate and respond to changes in the environment in terms of morphology and population characteristics; thus they can serve as biological indicators (or bio-indicators) for assessing changes in the status of coastal systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Orth1">[15]</xref>. Retreat of seagrass beds to shallower areas, with a consequent reduction in coverage or biomass has been used as an indicator of decreasing water clarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Dennison1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Livingston1">[17]</xref>. Seagrasses respond to nutrient enrichment physiologically by increasing N or P content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Duarte2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Fourqurean2">[19]</xref>, changing morphology such as leaf width <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Short1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Udy1">[21]</xref> and changing biomass distribution between above- and below-ground plant parts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Armitage1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Duarte3">[23]</xref>. Changes in water quality (clarity, salinity or nutrients) result in changes in species composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Armitage1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Fourqurean3">[24]</xref> and density of the foliar shoots of the seagrasses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Short2">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>This study presents the results of a long-term (1993–2007, with some continuing to the present) Caribbean-wide seagrass monitoring initiative: the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity (CARICOMP) program. The program was established in 1992 to study land-sea interaction processes and to monitor changes through time in the productivity and structure of the three principal tropical coastal ecosystems: mangroves, seagrasses and coral reefs, with the ultimate goal of providing scientific information for management of coastal resources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-CARICOMP1">[26]</xref>. The CARICOMP program has generated a Caribbean-wide dataset using a simple, low-cost but standardized sampling protocol, consistent among sites over time. While the Caribbean region corresponds to the “Tropical Atlantic” seagrass bioregion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Short3">[27]</xref> which has relatively high species diversity (10 species, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Short4">[28]</xref>), most CARICOMP seagrass study areas were shallow reef lagoons dominated by two species (<italic>Thalassia testudinum</italic> and <italic>Syringodium filiforme,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-CARICOMP2">[29]</xref>). The present work aims to document changes within seagrass communities at unprecedented spatial and temporal (more than a decade) scales. We demonstrate that the low-cost standardized CARICOMP sampling protocol (consistent among sites and over time) can provide, in addition to the responses of seagrass communities to season and climate, evidence of deterioration of the environment along Caribbean coastlines.</p>

<p>The sampling protocols and organization of the monitoring network are described in CARICOMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-CARICOMP1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-CARICOMP2">[29]</xref>. Seagrass monitoring was conducted at 22 sites with 52 sampling stations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090600-g001">Fig 1</xref>) from 1993 until 2012, although many concluded the monitoring program before 2007 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s003">Table S1</xref>). At each site, generally two <italic>Thalassia testudinum-</italic>dominated stations were selected by the participants; one station representing the most developed <italic>T. testudinum</italic> bed (“high productivity”) and the second an average or typical bed. However, some sites had only one station, whereas others had up to six stations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s003">Table S1</xref>). Bi-annual sampling intervals were specified in the protocol, but participation in the program was voluntary, and sampling frequencies and periods varied among sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s003">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<p>Growth and productivity of the seagrass <italic>T. testudinum</italic> were determined in 4–6 haphazardly placed quadrats (10×20 cm) per station. The leaves were marked just above the colorless basal sheath (or at the level of the quadrats) by punching one or two holes with a syringe needle and left to grow for 7–14 days. After this time, the foliar shoots were counted and the leaves were cut at the levels of the previous basal marks. Alternatively, the leaves were marked again at the base, and the entire foliar shoots (including sheaths) were retrieved from the sediments, and the foliar shoots were counted in the laboratory. In the laboratory, leaf tissues were separated into new growth (newly emerged leaves and leaf sections below the mark of old leaves) and old fractions. The epiphytes were removed by rinsing the blades in a 10% acid solution and/or scraping with a razorblade. The leaf fractions were dried and dry weight was determined. The dry weights of new growth fractions represented the production (g m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>) and the combined weight of both fractions corresponded with leaf biomass (g m<sup>−2</sup>). Based on expected changes in growth due to the solar cycle, sampling was planned twice a year: once in the high-growth season (March through August) and once during the low-growth season (September through February). Annual productivity rates were determined by averaging the daily productivity rates (per m<sup>−2</sup>) of all samples collected during the low- and high growth seasons for each year and multiplying by 365.</p>
<p>Biomass of the seagrass community was determined by taking two to four core samples at each station with a PVC or steel corer 15–20 cm in diameter (depending on site). The seagrasses (<italic>T. testudinum</italic> and “other grasses”, mostly <italic>Syringodium filiforme</italic>) were separated into above- and below-ground fractions. Above-ground fractions were also separated and analyzed for the rooted calcareous and fleshy algae (below-ground parts were excluded from the analysis). The fractions were cleaned and dried before the weight was determined. The calcareous algae were decalcified in a 10% acid solution before being dried and weighed to determine their somatic weight. Annual biomass (per m<sup>−2</sup>) was determined as the means of all samples collected during a year.</p>
<p>Possible spatial patterns for mean daily productivity rates of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> related to latitude or Physical Environments of the Caribbean Sea (PECS) defined by Chollet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Chollett1">[30]</xref> were explored using a Random Forest analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Liaw1">[31]</xref>. The standard setting for the analysis defined by R v. 2.15.3 (creation of 500 randomly selected decision trees) and overall mean values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s004">Table S2</xref>) for the stations were used for this analysis. The same analyses were applied to total (above-and below-ground) biomass of the seagrass community (data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s005">table S3</xref>). Posteriorly, the terms latitude, depth and Secchi reading (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s004">table S2</xref>) were combined (latitude*depth*Secchi reading) to discern whether a combination of these terms could explain <italic>T. testudinum</italic> productivity or total community biomass.</p>
<p>Intra-annual variation in productivity of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> was determined for twenty-four stations at eleven sites that had ten or more sampling events. General mean productivity was computed for each of the twenty-four stations as the average of all measurements of productivity at that station. Intra-annual variation (ΔP) was determined by calculating the deviation from the general mean productivity for each sampling event (per station), expressed as the percentage of the general mean productivity. ΔP was plotted separately for high- and low- growth season at each station. For each degree of latitude, a One-sample t-test was applied to test whether ΔP differed from zero. At Long Key, Florida (Site 2), and Bon Accord Lagoon, Tobago (Site 18), sampling was conducted more than twice a year. Correlations between mean monthly Sea Surface Temperatures, (SST), hours of daylight and growth rates per shoot (g dry shoot<sup>−1</sup>d<sup>−1</sup>) were determined for each station at these two sites.</p>
<p>An interim report of the CARICOMP program identified increased terrestrial run-off (sewage, fertilizers and/or sediments) as the major and most prevalent anthropogenic influence in the monitoring region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-CARICOMP2">[29]</xref>. Consequences of increased terrestrial run-off into coastal waters are mainly increasing nutrients loads and/or decreasing water clarity. The following indicators of long-term changes in community and seagrass parameters were used as indicators of potential changes in coastal conditions: 1) Total (above-, and below ground) community biomass (seagrasses and algae), 2) Relative dominance (above-ground biomass seagrass/above-ground community biomass) of faster-growing seagrasses (classified as “other seagrasses” in the CARICOMP protocol, but mainly consisting of <italic>S. filiforme</italic>), 3) Relative dominance of faster growing fleshy algae, 4) Above-ground biomass relative to total biomass of the seagrasses (the most abundant seagrass <italic>T. testudinum</italic> was used for this assessment), 5) Productivity of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> and 6) Foliar shoot density of <italic>T. testudinum</italic>. Responses to changes in the environment depend on local settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Linton1">[14]</xref>, but combinations of consistent trends in two or more of the above-mentioned parameters may indicate environmental degradation. Both decrease in water clarity and increase in nutrients were expected to increase the dominance of faster growing seagrasses (parameter 2) or algae (parameter 3), and/or increase the relative investment in above-ground biomass (parameter 4). Total community biomass (parameter 1) and productivity of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> (parameter 5) are expected to decrease at increasing turbidity and to increase at increasing nutrient input into oligotrophic or mesotrophic systems. Foliar shoot density of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> (parameter 6) is expected to decrease with increasing turbidity. Significant slopes of linear regressions for each of these parameters versus year were considered to indicate a consistent pattern of change over the sampling period. These long-term trends were determined only when sampling covered at least five years (although intermittent at some stations) sampling effort with at least six sampling events, and included 35 stations at 17 sites.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Annual productivity of leaves of <italic>Thalassia testudinum</italic> varied by an order of magnitude among the stations: lowest productivity was registered at Long Key, Florida Keys, USA (site 2-station 4, &lt; 200 g dry m<sup>−2</sup> y<sup>−1</sup>) whereas highest leaf productivity (&gt; 2000 g dry m<sup>−2</sup> y<sup>−1</sup>) was attained at Puerto Rico (site 10-stations 21 and 22) and Tobago (site 18-station 45, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090600-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s004">Table S2</xref>).

<p>No clear classification trees could be constructed relative to latitude for <italic>T. testudinum</italic> leaf productivity and total (above-and below-ground) community (seagrass and macro-algae) biomass. The Random Forests only explained 32.5% (productivity) or 57.9% (biomass) of the variance in the data. When depth and Secchi readings were added as terms, the fits of the models increased for productivity (52.8% of variance explained) and for biomass (59.8% of variance explained). The CARICOMP seagrass sites were in 10 of the 16 physicochemical provinces in the Caribbean defined by Chollett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Chollett1">[30]</xref>, and the models constructed for productivity and PECS did not result in a precise fit either for productivity (34.8% of the variance was explained) or total community biomass (35.1% of the variance).</p>

<p>The seagrass communities at the majority (25) of the 35 stations included in the analysis for longer-term trends in the community showed changes in at least one of the six selected parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090600-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s008">Table S6</xref>). At six stations the seagrass beds collapsed: in Bermuda (3 stations) the decline was due to excessive grazing by sea turtles; in Barbados (2 stations) poor water quality followed by a population explosion of sea urchins and subsequent storms were responsible; and in Mexico, a coastal bed (1 station) was buried by sediments during a hurricane. Most monitoring stations (46 out of 52) were exposed at least once to a major meteorological event (hurricane or tropical storm, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s003">Table S1</xref>) during the study period, but apart from the above-mentioned collapse of communities in Mexico and Barbados (where the storms were not the main cause of collapse), minor impacts of storms were registered only at Belize-station 26 and Venezuela-stations 47 and 48 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090600-t001">Table 1</xref>). At 15 (43%) out of 35 studied stations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090600-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090600-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), changes in the seagrass beds were consistent with hypothesized change scenarios of increased turbidity (Site 4-Stations 8 &amp; 9 and Site 21-Station 49) or increased nutrient input (Site 2-Station 5; Site 5-Stations 10 thru13; Site 8-Station17; Site 10-Station 21; Site 12-Station 25; Site 14-Stations 33 &amp; 34 Site 20-Stations 47 &amp; 48).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The CARICOMP monitoring program shows wide variation in seagrass productivity and biomass across the Caribbean, reflecting the different environmental settings among the sampling sites, although most were associated with coral reef systems. This study included a broad spectrum of seagrass community types dominated by <italic>Thalassia testudinum</italic>, from highly productive almost mono-specific beds to multi-species communities with several seagrass species and benthic macro-algae. The physicochemical provinces (PECS) defined by Chollett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Chollett1">[30]</xref> could not reliably predict the mean leaf productivity of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> or total biomass of the community. The 16 PECS were defined based on sea surface temperature, water clarity (from satellite images), salinity, wind-driven exposure and exposure to hurricanes. The criteria for the classification into these 16 provinces (PECS) likely did not include all relevant parameters that determine seagrass development. For example, Zieman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Zieman1">[32]</xref> suggested that in the Caribbean higher standing crops may be expected at sites with relief and considerable rainfall that supply nutrients for the development of larger plants, such as Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Belize, Venezuela (Morrocoy) and Panama. Latitude determines water temperatures and light regimes, and it was a better predictor for community biomass (but not productivity of <italic>T. testudinum</italic>) than the PECS. Combining latitude with local depth and mean Secchi reading (indicator for water transparency) resulted in more precise predictions; but less than 60% of the variances in mean leaf productivity of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> or total community biomass were explained by these combined predictors, suggesting that other factors also influence the leaf dynamics of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> and status of the seagrass communities.</p>
<p>Intra-annual changes in the growth of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> were registered at latitude 16°48′N (Site 12-Belize) and higher, and they appeared to be mainly driven by the seasonal solar-cycle. Also, at the northerly Florida Keys site, the initiation of the ‘high-growth season’ shows a lag of 1–2 months in comparison with more southerly sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s001">Figure S1</xref>), most likely in response to relatively low temperatures with corresponding reduced growth rates of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> until May (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s007">Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>Most seagrass beds in this study have been exposed to hurricanes or major storms during the monitoring period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s003">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s002">Figure S2</xref>), but they were strikingly resilient. The seagrasses at a few stations were negatively affected (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090600-t001">Table 1</xref>), but recovery was rapid (within 1 to several years). Eradication only occurred at one station in a narrow (20–50 m wide) coastal fringe in Puerto Morelos, Mexico, during Hurricane Wilma (2005) by burial below ∼1 m of sand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-RodrguezMartnez1">[33]</xref>. However, recovery of this seagrass bed is now in progress (Van Tussenbroek, unpublished data). The vegetation at most stations consisted of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> dominated beds in sub-tidal reef-systems, where <italic>T. testudinum</italic> is a large and persistent seagrass that invests much of its biomass in below-ground tissue, which aids in firm anchorage of the plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-CruzPalacios1">[34]</xref> and stabilization of the sediments. Seagrass beds in the tropical or sub-tropical Atlantic that are not associated with reefs are often dominated by less robust seagrass species, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico, may be much more susceptible to damage or destruction by hurricanes or storms [Heck et al., 1996 (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Byron1">[35]</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Montcreiff1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Davis1">[38]</xref>, although there are exceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Byron1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Forty-three percent of the seagrass communities at the 35 long-term study stations at nine sites show changes that potentially indicate degradation of the environment between 1993 and 2007 (2012 for some stations, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090600-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090600-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). These changes over a relatively short time-span (6–18 years) across many sites is a worrying trend, particularly because most of these sites were only moderately disturbed by humans at the outset of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090600-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Only two originally undisturbed sites, Colombia-Isla Providencia (site 13, Stations 29–31), and Colombia-Chengue Bay (site 17, stations 41 and 42) remained in ‘pristine’ condition up to the end of the monitoring period (2007 and 2005 respectively, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090600-t001">Table 1</xref>). Several sites, such as Bahamas-San Salvador (site 3), Colombia-Isla San Andres (site 15), Tobago-Bon Accord lagoon (site 18), Panama-Isla de Colon (site 22), have been impacted by human development for decades or more than a century <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-CARICOMP3">[39]</xref>, but we did not detect indications of further degradation during the study period.</p>
<p>The consequences of these changes in seagrass communities across the Caribbean are difficult to assess at this point because baseline information concerning the structure, processes and drivers of Caribbean seagrass beds is deficient. However, it is likely that the ecosystem services offered by the seagrass communities will be compromised by changes in their productivity and composition of the seagrass community. For example, a community shift from <italic>T. testudinum</italic> to faster-growing seagrass and/or algal species (observed at 7 stations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090600-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) will result in a change in the overall structure of the seagrass canopy, and possibly a change in associated fauna. Sediment retention is likely to be compromised as seagrass communities shift away from broad-bladed and deeply-rooted <italic>T. testudinum</italic>. Faster-growing seagrass species have a less developed below-ground rhizome-root system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Marb1">[40]</xref> which could also have negative consequences for below-ground carbon sequestration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-McLeod1">[41]</xref>, or resistance of seagrass beds to hurricanes. Impacts of hurricanes are most deleterious in already disturbed beds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Whitfield1">[42]</xref>, and the faster growing <italic>S. filiforme</italic> is much more susceptible to dislodgement than <italic>T. testudinum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-CruzPalacios1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-VanTussenbroek1">[43]</xref>. The fate of the seagrass beds at Barbados-St. Lawrence lagoon (site 14) is a good example of how long-term (chronic) anthropogenic stress can act synergistically with acute extreme disturbance events [over-grazing by an exceptionally strong recruitment of sea urchins, Hurricane Ivan (2004) and Tropical Storm Emily (2005)] to cause collapse of an ecosystem. Even after 7 years, this lagoon has shown only minimal recovery, with just a few impoverished <italic>T. testudinum</italic> plants in areas of coral rubble and a very sparse vegetation of <italic>Halodule wrightii</italic> appearing in the sand areas (H. Oxenford, unpublished data).</p>
<p>Interpretation of the long-term shifts in the seagrass communities is not unequivocal, because responses of individual communities depend on local conditions and the state of the community when monitoring began. For example, productivity and biomass were expected to decrease with decreasing water clarity, a relationship reported for Cuba (site 4) and Costa Rica (site 20-station 49). At Belize (site 12), conflicting trends at the two stations (25 and 26) resulted from differing environmental contexts and initial states of the two seagrass meadows. At station 25, a relatively low energy site inside the lagoon, increased productivity is more likely a response to nutrient enrichment associated with the well-documented increases in turbidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Koltes1">[44]</xref> than to the declining light levels at this shallow (1 m) depth. Further evidence for this is that shoot density of <italic>T. testudinum</italic> declined by 50% from 1993 to 2012 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090600-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>) while the relative abundance of <italic>S. filiforme</italic> increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090600-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>), both typical responses to declining light levels and/or nutrient enrichment. By contrast, station 26, established in 1997 in a higher-energy zone adjacent to a cut in the barrier reef-line, was scoured by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Trends at this station largely reflect recovery of the seagrass meadow over the first 8-10 years of monitoring (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090600-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The area of seagrass sampled by the CARICOMP protocol (0.08–0.12 m<sup>2</sup> for foliar productivity and 0.04–0.09 m<sup>2</sup> for biomass) is smaller than that of more recently established monitoring programs such as Seagrass Watch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-McKenzie1">[45]</xref>, Seagrass Monitoring in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Fourqurean4">[46]</xref>, or Seagrass Net <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Short2">[25]</xref>, that employ cover estimates of the vegetation in 5–11 quadrats (0.25–1.0 m<sup>2</sup>) along one to three 50m-long transects (supplemented with small samples of leaves, complete plants, sediments or seeds). Small sample size assumes a relatively homogeneous distribution of the species (or species groups). Long-living seagrasses (such as <italic>T. testudinum</italic>) in continuous beds, without obvious environmental gradients, may fulfil this assumption; however, a larger scale-sampling scheme (such as that of Seagrass Watch or Seagrass Net) may be necessary for less-abundant and more irregular distributed species such as the more ephemeral seagrasses (e.g <italic>Halodule</italic> spp. or <italic>Halophila</italic> spp.) or rooted macro-algae. The CARICOMP measures of foliar productivity and total plant biomass are destructive and therefore cannot be employed on a large scale (and also because sample processing is labor-intensive), but these measures are less subjective than cover estimates. In addition, they may be more sensitive to small shifts in plant abundance or biomass distribution and detect responses to environmental change sooner than monitoring programs based on less precise estimates of abundance such as vegetation cover. However, cover estimates are useful to assess loss of seagrasses over large areas under regimes of relatively severe (human-induced) stress (e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090600-Short2">[25]</xref>). Thus, optimal design of a monitoring protocol depends on its goals, site- and plant characteristics and logistics. Regardless of the protocol, it is paramount for determining trends in seagrass communities that consistent observations be made over long periods (5-10 y at least). The CARICOMP program depended on voluntary participation and local resources, which resulted in large differences in sampling frequency and periods among sites. Only 17 of the 22 sites obtained sufficient data for analysis of long term trends in the seagrass communities; and even among these sites the sampling period (5–15 y, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090600-t001">Table 1</xref>) and frequency (24–124 biomass samples, 30–202 productivity samples, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090600.s008">Table S6</xref>) varied considerably. We may therefore, have missed possible changes at stations which were sampled infrequently or for shorter periods (5 or 6 y).</p>
<p>CARICOMP was a pioneering monitoring program, and this study has shown that the simple and low-cost methods used were sufficient to discern long-term trends in the seagrass communities. We suggest that changes across various parameters are consistent with deterioration of the coastal environment, thereby indicating sites that would benefit from further studies and management efforts. We recognize that drivers of change were poorly covered in this program, and suggest that future monitoring of the long-term trends should include relevant environmental measures, such as nutrient availability (C, N, P contents in plant tissues) and sediment (anoxia, organic matter) conditions, in addition to (pulse fluctuations in) water transparency, temperature and salinity. Environmental degradation often involves multiple interacting stressors, and long-term monitoring programs such as CARICOMP can only determine causal factors of change when ecological data are viewed together with supplemental data on environmental conditions.</p>
