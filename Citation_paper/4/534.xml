<abstract>
<p>Giant clams (genus <italic>Tridacna</italic>) are iconic coral reef animals of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, easily recognizable by their massive shells and vibrantly colored mantle tissue. Most <italic>Tridacna</italic> species are listed by CITES and the IUCN Redlist, as their populations have been extensively harvested and depleted in many regions. Here, we survey <italic>Tridacna crocea</italic> and <italic>Tridacna maxima</italic> from the eastern Indian and western Pacific Oceans for mitochondrial (<italic>COI</italic> and <italic>16S</italic>) and nuclear (<italic>ITS</italic>) sequence variation and consolidate these data with previous published results using phylogenetic analyses. We find deep intraspecific differentiation within both <italic>T. crocea</italic> and <italic>T. maxima</italic>. In <italic>T. crocea</italic> we describe a previously undocumented phylogeographic division to the east of Cenderawasih Bay (northwest New Guinea), whereas for <italic>T. maxima</italic> the previously described, distinctive lineage of Cenderawasih Bay can be seen to also typify western Pacific populations. Furthermore, we find an undescribed, monophyletic group that is evolutionarily distinct from named <italic>Tridacna</italic> species at both mitochondrial and nuclear loci. This cryptic taxon is geographically widespread with a range extent that minimally includes much of the central Indo-Pacific region. Our results reinforce the emerging paradigm that cryptic species are common among marine invertebrates, even for conspicuous and culturally significant taxa. Additionally, our results add to identified locations of genetic differentiation across the central Indo-Pacific and highlight how phylogeographic patterns may differ even between closely related and co-distributed species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Giant clams of the genus <italic>Tridacna</italic> are among the most conspicuous marine invertebrates on coral reefs due to their large size and brilliantly colored mantle that contains photosynthesizing symbionts. Giant clams have traditionally provided raw material for tools, containers, and ornaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Heslinga1">[1]</xref>, and many populations are harvested for meat, shells, and the ornamental aquarium trade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Wabnitz1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Tisdell1">[3]</xref>. Despite local management efforts, including mariculture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Tisdell1">[3]</xref>, wild stocks of giant clams are depleted and some species are locally extinct in many areas of Southeast Asia and the South Pacific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Tisdell1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Wells1">[5]</xref>. Consequently, most <italic>Tridacna</italic> species are listed by CITES (Appendix II)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-UNEPWCMC1">[6]</xref> and the IUCN Redlist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-IUCN1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>There are currently eight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-binOthman1">[8]</xref> described species within the genus <italic>Tridacna</italic> (<italic>T. crocea</italic> Lamarck, 1819, <italic>T. derasa</italic> (Röding 1798), <italic>T. gigas</italic> (Linnaeus 1758), <italic>T. maxima</italic> (Röding 1798), <italic>T. mbalavuana</italic> Ladd, 1934, <italic>T. rosewateri</italic> Sirenko and Scarlato 1991, <italic>T. squamosa</italic> Lamarck 1819, and <italic>T. squamosina</italic> Sturany 1899), differentiated by morphology and habitat preference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Richter1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Lucas2">[12]</xref>. <italic>Tridacna squamosina</italic>, <italic>T. rosewateri</italic>, and <italic>T. mbalavuana</italic> have restricted distributions (Red Sea, Mauritius, and Fiji to Tonga, respectively), whereas <italic>T. derasa, T. gigas, T. crocea, T. squamosa</italic> and <italic>T. maxima</italic> are widely distributed in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with the latter two extending their distribution into the Red Sea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-binOthman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Richter1">[9]</xref>. Molecular phylogenetic investigations support monophyly of the described species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Maruyama1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Schneider1">[15]</xref>, albeit with some disagreement among species relationships. An unpublished Master's thesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Tang1">[16]</xref> also reports a morphologically distinct clam from Taiwan and uses mtDNA loci to show that this clam is highly divergent from sympatric <italic>T. maxima</italic>, potentially indicative of an additional unnamed species.</p>
<p>The juncture between the Indian and Pacific Oceans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), where several species of <italic>Tridacna</italic> are sympatric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-binOthman1">[8]</xref>, is a well-known epicenter of tropical marine biodiversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Hoeksema1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Ekman1">[18]</xref>. Genetic surveys in this region have revealed cryptic species, even among conspicuous and well-studied marine invertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Vogler1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Duda1">[20]</xref>. Many species show substantial intraspecific genetic division between the ocean basins (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Carpenter1">[21]</xref>), with the Sunda Shelf, Molucca and Flores Seas, Makassar Strait, and Bird's Head region of northwest New Guinea emerging as locations of genetic discontinuities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Carpenter1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Barber1">[22]</xref>. These locations span the archipelago commonly referred to as Wallacea, which falls between the Sunda (southeast Asia) and Sahul (Australia and New Guinea) continental shelves and was the only point of permanent oceanic connection between the Indian and Pacific Oceans throughout the Pleistocene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Voris1">[23]</xref>.</p>

<p>Phylogeographic and population genetic surveys have intensely sampled <italic>T. maxima</italic> and <italic>T. crocea</italic> throughout Wallacea using mitochondrial (mtDNA) markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Kochzius1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref>, allozymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-RavagoGotanco1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-JuinioMeez1">[28]</xref>, and microsatellites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer2">[29]</xref>. Both <italic>T. crocea</italic> and <italic>T. maxima</italic> have been shown to contain distinct mtDNA clades associated with Sumatra (Sunda), Wallacea, and northwest New Guinea (Sahul, particularly in Cenderawasih Bay) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Kochzius1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref>. These lineages are sympatric in some populations, for instance <italic>T. maxima</italic> from northern Java has both Sumatran and Wallacean mitotypes, and similarly <italic>T. crocea</italic> populations from Halmahera eastward through Cenderawasih Bay contain both Wallacean and northwest New Guinean lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer2">[29]</xref>. Microsatellite genotyping of <italic>T. crocea</italic> corroborates the distinctiveness of Sumatran and Cenderawasih populations, with evidence for mixing in Wallacea of local genotypes with Cenderawasih-like genotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer2">[29]</xref>. Thus, substantial genetic differentiation typifies at least two <italic>Tridacna</italic> species in this region.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Ocean, <italic>T. derasa, T. gigas, T. maxima</italic> and <italic>T. crocea</italic> have been genetically surveyed, primarily with allozyme markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-RavagoGotanco1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-JuinioMeez1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Macaranas1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Benzie5">[35]</xref>, but also with mtDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Gardner1">[36]</xref>. These studies show genetic divisions between western and central Pacific populations but with some indication that eastern Australian populations show greater affinities with Philippine populations than they do with other western Pacific populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Macaranas1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Benzie3">[33]</xref>. Great Barrier Reef populations (eastern Sahul) form a cluster distinct from, but closely related to, Philippine populations for <italic>T. maxima</italic> and <italic>T. derasa</italic> but with low sampling in the Philippines (two and one populations, respectively) and no sampling in Wallacea or Sunda regions. Thus, it is unknown whether substantial genetic divergence reflects the geographic distance separating the Philippines and eastern Sahul or is indicative of distinct regional groupings.</p>
<p>Here, we examine DNA sequence diversity of <italic>T. crocea</italic> and <italic>T. maxima</italic> whose sampled distributions include the eastern Indian Ocean, Wallacea, and western Pacific Oceans. Data from new samples, predominantly from the western Pacific, are merged with data from previous studies, especially from Wallacea (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Kochzius1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Nuryanto1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref>), to present a unified summary of phylogeographic patterns and a point of contrast to earlier broadscale studies based on allozymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Macaranas1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Benzie2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Benzie3">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Benzie5">[35]</xref>. We use phylogenetic analyses to assess evolutionary relationships among species and also gauge regional geographical divisions within species.</p>

<p>Previous mtDNA surveys have used either <italic>16S</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Richter1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Schneider1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref> or <italic>COI</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Kochzius1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Neo1">[41]</xref> gene regions. To unify these sources of data and address interspecific relationships, we initially took representative sequences across studies and linked them by our samples for which both gene regions had been sequenced in a concatenated search. For samples with only a single gene region (that is, sequences acquired from NCBI), information from the missing gene region was treated as missing data. Up to four individuals per species were retained representing the diversity of their species clade and prioritizing individuals with both <italic>16S</italic> and <italic>COI</italic> sequenced. Using StarBEAST v. 1.6.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Heled1">[43]</xref> each mtDNA gene region was treated as a separate partition. A general time reversible model with gamma distributed and invariant sites (GTR+G+I) was applied to each gene, with additional partitioning by codon position (1+2, 3) for <italic>COI</italic>. A relaxed molecular clock with an uncorrelated lognormal mutation rate was used for each gene. The <italic>COI</italic> and <italic>16S</italic> gene trees were linked, as mtDNA is a single linked locus (i.e. concatenated gene regions). Priors were set for nodes defining species as a log normal date (mean  = 0, SD = 1) with an offset representing the most recent estimate of the earliest fossil (<italic>T. crocea</italic>: 1.8, <italic>T. maxima</italic>: 5.3, and <italic>T. squamosa</italic>: 1.8 million years). The root of the Tridacninae was set as normal with mean date of 14 and SD of 2.5 million years. All fossil dates were based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Schneider1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Harzhauser1">[44]</xref>. Speciation was modeled both as birth-death and Yule processes in independent runs of 250 million steps, with a burn-in of 25%, and yielded similar results.</p>
<p>Additional genealogical searches were performed using MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Ronquist1">[45]</xref> and RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood, Blackbox interface) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Stamatakis1">[46]</xref>. Using the concatenated file of the same mtDNA sequences as above, searches were partitioned such that <italic>16S</italic> formed one partition, and <italic>COI</italic> formed a second partition with third codon positions partitioned separately from first and second (1+2, 3) for <italic>COI</italic>. In MrBayes, a GTR+G+I (nst  = 6, invgamma) model for all three partitions was used, with a search length of 10 million steps, sampling every 10,000 steps, and a burn-in of 25% (2.5 mill steps). Similarly, the GTR+G+I models were applied to these partitions in RAxML in a maximum likelihood search with 100 bootstrap replicates.</p>
<p>Locus-specific genealogies were also inferred for <italic>COI</italic>, <italic>16S</italic>, and <italic>ITS</italic> using both MrBayes and RAxML. Total data sets for each locus were assembled from all available sequences and then simplified by removing any identical haplotypes. Searches were performed under the same conditions previously described for <italic>16S</italic> (no partitions) and for <italic>COI</italic> (1+2, 3) with four separate searches of 10 million steps and the final 25% percent of trees retained (effectively a burn-in of 7.5 million steps). Search conditions for the partial nuclear <italic>ITS</italic> sequences were as above with indels treated as missing data and no partitioning.</p>

<p>New DNA sequence data was generated for individuals from five locations (including 55 <italic>COI</italic>, 65 <italic>16S</italic>, and 50 <italic>ITS</italic> sequences: Genbank Acc. Nos. JX974838-JX975007). Combining these new sequence data with previously published data yielded aggregations of 405 <italic>COI</italic>, 132 <italic>16S</italic>, and 50 <italic>ITS</italic> sequences for <italic>Tridacna</italic> species, with 335 unique haplotypes for <italic>COI</italic> and 54 unique haplotypes for <italic>16S</italic>.

<title>Phylogenetic analyses</title>
<p>Phylogenetic analyses resulted in well-resolved topologies defining several clades within <italic>Tridacna</italic>. Tree topologies for the concatenated and single gene datasets were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g002">Figs. 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g004">4</xref>), providing evidence for a robust and consistent phylogenetic signal. The concatenated analyses of mitochondrial <italic>COI</italic> and <italic>16S</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) strongly support monophyly of <italic>T. squamosa, T. crocea</italic>, and a previously undescribed clade (but reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Tang1">[16]</xref>) formed well-supported terminal taxa, with more modest support for the monophyly of <italic>T. maxima</italic>. This undescribed clade (which we refer to as <italic>Tridacna sp</italic>.) was also well supported in single gene analyses of <italic>COI</italic> and <italic>16S</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) and <italic>ITS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). <italic>T. sp.</italic> sequences were evolutionarily distinct from other species; the average pairwise <italic>COI</italic> sequence divergence between <italic>T. sp</italic> and <italic>T. crocea</italic> was 14.4% and was 12.6% between <italic>T. sp</italic>. and <italic>T. squamosa</italic>, as compared to 9.5% between <italic>T. crocea</italic> and <italic>T. squamosa</italic> (uncorrected pairwise distances).</p>

<title>Phylogeographic patterns</title>
<p>Within <italic>T. crocea</italic> and <italic>T. maxima</italic>, there was broadscale phylogeographic concordance of mtDNA gene trees (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). <italic>T. crocea</italic> and <italic>T. maxima</italic> haplotypes from the Solomon Islands, the Torres Strait and Lizard Island (and additionally western New Guinea/Cenderwasih Bay, Lihou Reef and Heron Island for <italic>T. maxima</italic>) formed a distinct monophyletic ‘Pacific’ group (colored blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Sequences from the Sunda Shelf formed a second monophyletic group (colored orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) as described in the original publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Kochzius1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref>, although the location or the genetic break differed slightly for each species.

<p>For <italic>T. maxima</italic>, the northwest New Guinea clade formed a cluster with the Pacific clade, although no haplotypes were shared between the two locations. For <italic>T. crocea</italic>, however, haplotypes from northwest New Guinea and the western Pacific were members of two distinct monophyletic groups: the Pacific (blue) and the Wallacea (black) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).

<p>Despite the reduced sampling for <italic>T. sp</italic>., a ‘Pacific’ lineage was similarly positioned in the Solomon Islands, and a distinct lineage, comprising samples from western Australia and Taiwan, geographically overlapped with the Wallacea (black) lineage portrayed in <italic>T. crocea</italic> and <italic>T. maxima</italic>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite their distinct shell morphology and longstanding cultural and commercial significance, our data reveal cryptic diversity within giant clams. Here, we find a previously undescribed clade of <italic>Tridacna</italic> (<italic>Tridacna sp</italic>.). This clade is supported by both mtDNA and nuclear gene regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g002">Figs. 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g004">4</xref>), which identify it as a unique, evolutionarily significant unit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Moritz1">[49]</xref> with reference to previously described species. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses place <italic>T. sp</italic>. as a sister clade to <italic>T. squamosa</italic> and/or <italic>T. crocea</italic>, but in no instance was a close relationship between <italic>T. sp</italic>. and <italic>T. maxima</italic> suggested in our gene trees. Thus, molecular data do not support <italic>T. sp.</italic> being a variety of <italic>T. maxima</italic> as was suggested by Tang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Tang1">[16]</xref>. Clams with <italic>T. sp</italic>. mitotypes were found both at Ningaloo Reef in western Australia and in the Solomon Islands. Although only <italic>T. sp.</italic> and <italic>T. squamosa</italic> were identified among our clam samples from Ningaloo, it is likely that <italic>T. maxima</italic> also occur at Ningaloo (Penny unpub., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Black1">[50]</xref>), and we found <italic>T. sp.</italic> sympatric with <italic>T. maxima</italic> and <italic>T. crocea</italic> in the Solomons.</p>
<p>The <italic>T. sp.</italic> clade includes the single haplotype (<italic>COI</italic> and a <italic>16S</italic>) described from Taiwan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Tang1">[16]</xref>. Tang <italic>et al.</italic> (2005) suggested that there are morphological differences between <italic>T. sp.</italic> and <italic>T. maxima</italic>, including mantle pattern, shell lip shape, posterior adductor weight and the position of the incurrent aperture. Qualitative examination of an individual from Ningaloo Reef with <italic>T. sp</italic>. mtDNA shows shell characters typical of <italic>T. maxima</italic>: asymmetry of the valve with posterior elongation and dense rows of scales on folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). <italic>T. maxima</italic> is well known for its morphological variability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Rosewater1">[51]</xref> and thus it is possible that previous morphological examinations of <italic>T. sp</italic> may have been identified it as <italic>T. maxima</italic>. (Additional morphological samples are not presently available as most collecting permits only allow non-lethal sampling of giant clams.) Our findings, therefore, lend support to Tang's conclusion that <italic>T. sp.</italic> is an undescribed species but we show that, rather than being a narrow-range endemic (such as <italic>Tridacna rosewateri</italic> from Mauritius <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Sirenko1">[10]</xref>), <italic>T. sp.</italic> is widely distributed. Although it is not possible at present to delineate the distribution of <italic>T. sp.</italic>, it seems probable that <italic>T. sp</italic>. occurs at locations in between Australia, Taiwan and the Solomon Islands. <italic>T. sp</italic>. individuals from the western Pacific were reciprocally monophyletic from the individuals from Ningaloo (Indian Ocean) and the single sequence from Taiwan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<p>MtDNA genealogies place <italic>T. sp</italic> as sister species to <italic>T. crocea</italic> and <italic>T. squamosa</italic>, with strong support for monophyly of this group of three species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g002">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g003">3</xref>). <italic>Tridacna maxima</italic> and <italic>T. squamosina</italic> formed a second clade, but with less support across phylogenetic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) probably because only <italic>16S</italic> sequences were available for <italic>T. squamosina</italic>. Monophyly of <italic>T. crocea</italic> and <italic>T. squamosa</italic> was reported in previous mtDNA based phylogenetic analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Richter1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Schneider1">[15]</xref>, but not in allozyme analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Benzie1">[14]</xref> where <italic>T. squamosa</italic> was sister to <italic>T. crocea</italic> and <italic>T. maxima</italic>. Monophyly of the <italic>Chametrachea</italic> subgenus (including <italic>T. squamosina, T. crocea, T. maxima, T. sp.</italic> and <italic>T. squamosa</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Schneider1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Harzhauser1">[44]</xref> was supported in individual gene analyses and the concatenated StarBEAST searches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Monophyly of the <italic>Tridacna</italic> subgenus (including <italic>T. derasa</italic>, <italic>T. mbalavuana</italic>, and <italic>T. gigas</italic>) was not well supported in any of our mtDNA analyses, with these taxa appearing basal to the <italic>Chametrachea</italic>, but missing and non-overlapping data may have contributed to the low resolution.</p>
<p>Previous phylogeographic studies of <italic>T. crocea</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Kochzius1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer2">[29]</xref> and <italic>T. maxima</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Nuryanto1">[25]</xref> from Indonesia show geographic restriction of several clades. The mtDNA gene trees within these papers delineate clusters comprising haplotypes from western Sumatra (Sunda), Wallacea, and northwest New Guinea (Sahul) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Kochzius1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer2">[29]</xref> with some mixing between clades particularly in the Bird's Head Peninsula of northwest New Guinea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref>. Our samples showed an additional and deeper evolutionary break for <italic>T. crocea</italic> to the east of Cenderawasih Bay, whereby individuals from the Solomon Islands, Torres Strait, and Great Barrier Reef form a monophyletic group and do not share any mtDNA haplotypes with northwest New Guinea or locations in Wallacea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080858-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Therefore, it appears that the distinct clade of <italic>T. crocea</italic> haplotypes from northwest New Guinea (with some spillover westward into Wallacea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref>) is regionally endemic and does not extend into the west Pacific. These patterns are not due to differences in DNA sequencing interpretation between research groups, as samples (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Kochzius1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-DeBoer1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Neo1">[41]</xref>) are mutually consistent and a single <italic>T. crocea</italic> (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Schneider1">[15]</xref>) falls within the larger Pacific <italic>T. crocea</italic> clade. Based on present sampling, we can place this newly discovered genetic discontinuity between Cenderawasih Bay and the Solomon Islands in the north and between the Aru Basin and Torres Strait in the south. For <italic>T. maxima</italic>, in contrast, the distinct haplotypes from northwest New Guinea fall in the same clade as west Pacific haplotypes. Thus the northwest New Guinea clade of <italic>T. maxima</italic> can now be viewed as a westward extension of Pacific variants, albeit with no shared haplotypes between locations.</p>
<p>With only two species to compare, we can only speculate as to why the mtDNA patterns differ between species, although greater overall population genetic structure in <italic>T. crocea</italic> compared to <italic>T. maxima</italic> is consistent with previously co-sampled regions (for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Kochzius1">[24]</xref> in comparison to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Nuryanto1">[25]</xref>). Because of the diffuse sampling for <italic>T. crocea</italic>, we cannot pinpoint a specific location of geographic differentiation east of Cenderawasih Bay, yet at a macroscale this observation is consistent with mtDNA patterns in a butterflyfish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-McMillan1">[52]</xref>, a reef fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Sims1">[53]</xref>, and a sea star (Crandall pers. comm.) and may be associated with a long stretch (&gt;700 km) of coastline east of Cenderawasih Bay with sparse reef habitat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Spalding1">[54]</xref>.</p>
<p>In <italic>T. maxima</italic>, we found that Solomon Islands haplotypes cluster with haplotypes from the Great Barrier Reef; this affinity contrasts with allozyme results that show substantial divergence between Solomon Islands and Great Barrier Reef populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Benzie3">[33]</xref>. The nature of these differing patterns cannot be explored further as allozyme results are not directly comparable across research groups.</p>
<p>The broadscale geographic and multispecies phylogenetic results of this study, consolidated with those of previous investigations, reveal new aspects of regional patterns and highlight key uncertainties in the current knowledge of <italic>Tridacna</italic>. A common result among population genetic studies of <italic>Tridacna</italic> species to date is that there is substantial population structure. Such genetic differentiation may be due in part to the relatively short planktonic larval duration of approximately 9 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Lucas2">[12]</xref> that is likely to restrict dispersal distances. The discovery of an undescribed species adds to other recent species discoveries in <italic>Tridacna</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Richter1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Lucas1">[11]</xref>, but the broad distribution of <italic>T. sp.</italic> illustrates that cryptic species can remain undetected even in such conspicuous groups as giant clams.</p>
<p>Both the discovery of a new species and the observation of substantial geographic differentiation are relevant to monitoring of local stocks and human transport of clams. First, the presence of a cryptic sympatric species would result in overestimates of species abundance where clam populations are censused. Second, human-aided movements could cause species to be introduced to regions outside their natural range and, similarly, are likely to introduce foreign genetic material into local populations. <italic>Tridacna maxima</italic>, <italic>T. squamosa</italic>, <italic>T. derasa, T. mbalavuana</italic> and <italic>T. gigas</italic> were frequently translocated during the 1980's and 1990's (some human assisted movements continuing into this century) by governmental, commercial and conservation organizations to combat local depletion and facilitate the live culture trade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Kinch1">[55]</xref>. Third, depleted populations are unlikely to receive immigrants from geographically distant locations via planktonic dispersal and, therefore, recovery may be slow or negligible even when local harvesting has ceased. Results from giant clams underscore two important themes emerging from genetic investigations of marine organisms: cryptic species are common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Vogler1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Duda1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Bickford1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Knowlton1">[57]</xref>, and many species are genetically heterogeneous across their geographic range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080858-Hellberg1">[58]</xref>.</p>

Sampling in the Torres Strait Islands was assisted by the staff and students of Tagai State College, Thursday Island Primary and the Torres Strait Regional Authority. Sampling in the Solomon Islands was made possible via the Pacific Strategy Assistance Program within the Australian Government Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and with the assistance of the Roviana Conservation Foundation. We especially thank JD Aguirre, S Albert, A Denzin, N Gemmell, M Jimuru, F MacGregor, V McGrath (Senior Community Liaison Officer, Land and Sea Management Unit, Torres Strait Regional Authority), A Mirams, R Pearce, Stephen, Lavud and Takenda for their logistical support and field assistance. JS Lucas, LG Cook, A Toon, L Pope and JM Pandolfi provided helpful comments and suggestions, as did several anonymous reviewers.</p>
