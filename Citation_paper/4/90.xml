      <abstract>
        <p>BDNF is a pro-survival protein involved in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. BDNF strengthens excitatory synapses and contributes to LTP, presynaptically, through enhancement of glutamate release, and postsynaptically, via phosphorylation of neurotransmitter receptors, modulation of receptor traffic and activation of the translation machinery. We examined whether BDNF upregulated vesicular glutamate receptor (VGLUT) 1 and 2 expression, which would partly account for the increased glutamate release in LTP. Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were incubated with 100 ng/ml BDNF, for different periods of time, and VGLUT gene and protein expression were assessed by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. At DIV7, exogenous application of BDNF rapidly increased VGLUT2 mRNA and protein levels, in a dose-dependent manner. VGLUT1 expression also increased but only transiently. However, at DIV14, BDNF stably increased VGLUT1 expression, whilst VGLUT2 levels remained low. Transcription inhibition with actinomycin-D or Î±-amanitine, and translation inhibition with emetine or anisomycin, fully blocked BDNF-induced VGLUT upregulation. Fluorescence microscopy imaging showed that BDNF stimulation upregulates the number, integrated density and intensity of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 puncta in neurites of cultured hippocampal neurons (DIV7), indicating that the neurotrophin also affects the subcellular distribution of the transporter in developing neurons. Increased VGLUT1 somatic signals were also found 3 h after stimulation with BDNF, further suggesting an increased de novo transcription and translation. BDNF regulation of VGLUT expression was specifically mediated by BDNF, as no effect was found upon application of IGF-1 or bFGF, which activate other receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, inhibition of TrkB receptors with K252a and PLCÎ³ signaling with U-73122 precluded BDNF-induced VGLUT upregulation. Hippocampal neurons express both isoforms during embryonic and neonatal development in contrast to adult tissue expressing only VGLUT1. These results suggest that BDNF regulates VGLUT expression during development and its effect on VGLUT1 may contribute to enhance glutamate release in LTP.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) is a pro-survival protein that promotes neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Poo1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-CohenCory1">[2]</xref>, in addition to neuroprotection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Almeida1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Murray1">[4]</xref>. During development, BDNF stimulates the formation of appropriate synaptic connections, controlling the direction and rate of axon growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Wang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Li1">[6]</xref>, as well as the shape of dendritic arbors and spines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Ji1">[7]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Kwon1">[9]</xref>. In the adult hippocampus, BDNF is also involved in learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Linnarsson1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Minichiello1">[11]</xref> and memory formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Liu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Bekinschtein1">[13]</xref>, and is essential for long-term potentiation (LTP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Korte1">[14]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Minichiello2">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The effects of BDNF are mainly mediated through activation of the TrkB (tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor) receptor tyrosine kinase as well as the p75 neutrotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-RodriguezTebar1">[19]</xref>. Activation of TrkB receptors by BDNF leads to receptor dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain, including Y490 and Y816, which allow recruiting proteins containing PTB and SH2 (Src homology-type 2) domains, activating in parallel the Ras-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), PI3-K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/Akt and phospholipase C-Î³ (PLCÎ³) signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Huang1">[20]</xref>. Trans-autophosphorylation of Y816 recruits and activates cytoplasmic PLCÎ³, which hydrolyzes PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) into IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol). IP3 promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores, activating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-regulated enzymes, including Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKs), and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Ouyang1">[21]</xref>. Concomitantly, DAG stimulates DAG-regulated PKC isoforms, such as PKCÎ´ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Huang1">[20]</xref>. The PLCÎ³ pathway is central in LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Minichiello2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Gartner1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Gruart1">[23]</xref> and growth cone guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Li1">[6]</xref>, retrograde synaptic modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Du1">[24]</xref> and dendritic spine morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Amaral1">[25]</xref> regulated by activation of TRPC (transient receptor potential canonical) channels. Trans-autophosphorylation of Y490 enables recruitment of Shc (Src homology 2-containing protein), IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) and IRS2 linker proteins, thereby activating the Ras-ERK and PI3K/Akt cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Reichardt1">[26]</xref>. ERK translocates to the nucleus upon phosphorylation, regulating gene expression through isoform-specific activation of transcription factors, including cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) (through ERK1/2/5), MEF2 (downstream of ERK5) or Elk1 (following activation of ERK1/2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Grewal1">[27]</xref>. The Ras-ERK signaling pathway is crucial for neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-BarnabeHeider1">[28]</xref>, inhibition of proapoptotic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Datta1">[29]</xref>, stimulation of pro-survival gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Bonni1">[30]</xref> and protein synthesis-dependent plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Kelleher1">[31]</xref>. The PI3K/Akt pathway has a pivotal role in cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Brunet1">[32]</xref>, neuroprotection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Almeida1">[3]</xref>, trafficking of synaptic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Yoshii1">[33]</xref> and can also directly control protein synthesis through mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activation and 4EBP phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Takei1">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The TrkB-activated signaling pathways account for nearly all BDNF synaptic effects but their biological responses likely reflect BDNF or TrkB receptor levels and the spatiotemporal pattern of BDNF stimulation, especially when activated pre- and/or postsynaptically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Cunha1">[35]</xref>. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying BDNF signaling in short-term plasticity and long-term potentiation are not fully understood. We have previously reported that BDNF induces significant proteome changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Manadas1">[36]</xref>, including the regulation of AMPA and NMDA receptors involved in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Caldeira1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Caldeira2">[38]</xref>. BDNF promotes phosphorylation of synapsin I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Jovanovic1">[39]</xref> and beta-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Bamji1">[40]</xref> increasing synaptic vesicle docking at the active zone and quantal glutamate release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Jovanovic1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Tyler1">[41]</xref>. However, direct presynaptic effectors of protein synthesis-dependent BDNF signaling on glutamatergic function, which also contributes to LTP and memory formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Gartner1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Gruart1">[23]</xref>, have not been identified thus far. The vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT) are such target candidates because they mediate L-glutamate uptake into synaptic vesicles and are required for exocytic glutamate release at presynaptic terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Fremeau1">[42]</xref>. Moreover, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 expression is developmentally regulated in order to match vesicle cycling and quantal amplitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Wojcik1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Wilson1">[44]</xref>. In addition, VGLUT isoforms have similar substrate specificity, transport activity and kinetics but complementary expression, which correlates with release probability and potential for plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Santos1">[45]</xref>. Therefore, the current study aimed at examining the effect of BDNF on the expression of VGLUT, given their relevance in LTP, learning and memory function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Balschun1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Tordera1">[47]</xref>. We report that BDNF regulates VGLUT gene and protein expression during development of cultured hippocampal neurons, through activation of the PLCÎ³ signaling pathway, and also affects VGLUT subcellular distribution, further suggesting a role in BDNF-induced LTP.</p>

        <title>Hippocampal Cultures</title>
        <p>Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were prepared from the hippocampi of E18âE19 Wistar rat embryos, after treatment with trypsin (0.06%, for 15 min at 37Â°C; GIBCO-Invitrogen) and deoxyribonuclease I (5.36 mg/ml), in Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free Hankâs balanced salt solution (HBSS; 5.36 mM KCl, 0.44 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 137 mM NaCl, 4.16 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.34 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, 5 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES and 0.001% phenol red). The hippocampi were then washed with HBSS containing 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO-Invitrogen), to stop trypsin activity, and transferred to Neurobasal medium (GIBCO-Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 supplement (1â¶50 dilution; GIBCO-Invitrogen), 25 ÂµM glutamate, 0.5 mM glutamine and 0.12 mg/ml gentamycin. The cells were dissociated in this solution and were then plated in 6-well plates (870,000 cells/well) coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/ml), or on poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslips, at a density of 80,000 cells/well (12-well plates). The cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% air, at 37Â°C, for 7 or 14 days. BDNF stimulation was carried out by adding BDNF (Regeneron or PeproTech) in Neurobasal medium to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, for the indicated period of time. When appropriate, 1.5 ÂµM Î±-amanitin or actinomycin D (transcription inhibitors), 2.0 ÂµM emetine or anisomycin (translation inhibitors) (Calbiochem), 200 nM K252a (TrkB inhibitor), 5 ÂµM U73122 (PLCÎ³ pathway inhibitor), 5 ÂµM chelerythrine (PKC inhibitor) or 1 ÂµM KN-93 (CAMKII inhibitor), 20 ÂµM PD098059 or 10 ÂµM U0126 (Ras-ERK pathway inhibitors), 30 ÂµM LY294002 or 300 nM Wortmannin (PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors) (Sigma-Aldrich QuÃ­mica) were added 30 min before BDNF stimulation, as indicated. The cells were further incubated with the signaling inhibitors for 3 h or 5 h, during BDNF stimulation. When appropriate, 100 ng/ml IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) (Sigma-Aldrich QuÃ­mica) were added in lieu of BDNF.</p>

        <title>BDNF Upregulates VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 Total Protein Levels</title>
        <p>7 and 14 DIV cultured hippocampal neurons were incubated with or without 100 ng/ml BDNF, for different time periods (30 min to 24 h), in order to determine whether acute stimulation with BDNF affects the protein expression of vesicular glutamate transporters. VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 protein levels were determined by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). At DIV7, BDNF rapidly and significantly upregulated VGLUT2 protein levels, while VGLUT1 protein levels were only transiently upregulated at the initial time points, subsequently returning to levels similar to the control condition (unstimulated neurons). In contrast, at DIV14, BDNF did not significantly change VGLUT2 protein levels but instead upregulated VGLUT1 throughout time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The increase in VGLUT2 protein levels at DIV7 and in VGLUT1 at DIV14 had distinct kinetics, and the maximal effects were found after incubation with BDNF for 3 h and 24 h, respectively. At DIV7, after a rapid increase, VGLUT2 protein levels remained high and relatively similar to the maximal value (3 h), even 24 h after incubation, while the abundance of VGLUT1 showed a slow and gradual increase, in comparison to the control. The sustained increase in VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 protein levels observed in hippocampal neurons (DIV14 and DIV7, respectively) subjected to a chronic stimulation with BDNF was not observed when the incubation was limited to 4 h, and followed by 14 h incubation in culture conditioned medium (p&gt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053793.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The effect of BDNF on VGLUT2 expression was not further examined at DIV14 because it was not significant and the endogenous expression levels of this isoform are rather low and variable, in developed neurons. These results mimic the developmental switch, from VGLUT2 to VGLUT1 expression, observed in postnatal hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Fremeau1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Wojcik1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Miyazaki1">[48]</xref>.</p>

        <p>In order to test whether the effect of BDNF resulted from an increase in protein synthesis, we used two translation inhibitors, anisomycin and emetine. Hippocampal neurons were stimulated with BDNF for 30 min or 3 h, in the presence or absence of translation inhibitors, which were added to the cultured media 30 min prior to BDNF stimulation and kept in the media during incubation with BDNF. Emetine (2 ÂµM) or anisomycin (2 ÂµM) fully abrogated the effect of BDNF on VGLUT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) and VGLUT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) isoforms at DIV7. None of the protein synthesis inhibitors reduced VGLUT1 or VGLUT2 protein levels under control conditions (p&gt;0.05), in agreement with the relatively long half-life suggested for VGLUT2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-DalBo1">[49]</xref>. However, translation inhibition was not tested at DIV14 because BDNF only upregulates VGLUT1 protein levels for long incubation periods, above the cellular toxicity threshold of emetine and anisomycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Butts1">[50]</xref>. Treatment with anisomycin or emetine alone did not alter VGLUT1 or VGLUT2 protein levels in the time periods tested (p&gt;0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that BDNF upregulates VGLUT isoforms 1 and 2 through a protein-synthesis dependent mechanism, and rule out the hypothesis of a reduction in protein degradation.</p>

A significant increase in VGLUT2 mRNA (approximately 3-fold) was also found when cells were incubated with the neurotrophin for 3 h (p&lt;0.001), with VGLUT1 mRNA levels remaining at a similar level to that of stimulation for only 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).

Moreover, IGF-I enhances the expression of TrkB receptors and the ability of BDNF to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cerebrocortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-McCusker1">[62]</xref> while bFGF rapidly stimulates BDNF expression in the hippocampal cell line HiB5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Kwon2">[63]</xref>. In this context, we tested whether acute stimulation with IGF-1 or bFGF in lieu of BDNF would affect the expression levels of VGLUT isoforms, at two different time points (4 h and 20 h). Either brief or prolonged incubation with 100 ng/ml IGF-1 or bFGF had no effect on VGLUT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>) and VGLUT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>) protein levels, at DIV7, when compared to the control condition (p&gt;0.05). Since exogenously applied neurotrophic factors are only effective when their receptors are expressed at the cell surface and free to bind their ligands, the absence of any effect on VGLUT expression could have resulted from ligand or receptor inactivity. In order to exclude this possibility, we tested the levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, upon 15 or 30 min of stimulation with IGF-1 or bFGF. The antibody used specifically recognizes the phosphorylated isoforms 1 and 2 of ERK, but not the non-phosphorylated (presumably inactive) proteins. The results show ERK1/2 phosphorylation after 15 min incubation with both IGF-1 and bFGF, and the effect of bFGF was still observed after 30 min of stimulation. These results confirm that the lack of effect of IGF-1 and bFGF on VGLUT expression was not due to inactivity of trophic factors or their receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). Therefore, we may conclude that BDNF upregulates VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 specifically through activation of TrkB receptors as K252a fully abrogated the effect in cultured hippocampal neurons at DIV7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref>) and DIV14 for VGLUT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

        <p>The specificity of BDNF signaling through TrkB activation prompted us to further assess which pathway(s) triggered by TrkB trans-autophosphorylation was (were) involved in BDNF-mediated VGLUT upregulation. For this purpose, we used the chemical inhibitors U73122 (PLCÎ³ pathway), PD098059 or U0126 (Ras-ERK pathway), and LY294002 or Wortmannin (PI3K/Akt pathway). At DIV7, U73122 fully abrogated BDNF-induced VGLUT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and VGLUT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) upregulation (p&gt;0.05), indicating that this pathway plays a key role in response to BDNF. Chemical inhibitors chelerythrine and KN-93 selectively and potently block the activation of PKC and CAMKII, respectively, two kinases that act downstream of PLCÎ³. We have found that incubation with KN-93 (1 ÂµM) prevented BDNF-induced VGLUT1 (p&gt;0.05), but not VGLUT2 upregulation (p&lt;0.05), while chelerythrin (5 ÂµM) blocked VGLUT2 upregulation (p&gt;0.05), but was without effect on VGLUT1 (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g004">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). These results indicate that BDNF regulates VGLUT 1 and 2 expression through signaling mechanisms acting downstream of PLCÎ³. VGLUT1 transient upregulation at DIV7 is dependent on CAMKII activation whereas VGLUT2 long lasting upregulation, at the same developmental stage, requires PKC activation. Blocking the Ras-ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>) or PI3-K/Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g005">Fig. 5C, D</xref>) signaling pathways with PD098059 or U0126 and LY294002 or Wortmannin, respectively, showed no significant effect (p&gt;0.05).</p>

        <title>BDNF Affects VGLUT Subcellular Distribution</title>
        <p>The subcellular distribution of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 was assessed by immunocytochemistry in cultured hippocampal neurons (DIV7) stimulated or not with 100 ng/ml BDNF, for different time periods, and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. VGLUT1-positive neuritic (presumably axonal) labeling transiently increased after 30 min - 3 h of incubation with BDNF when compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Quantification of the immunofluorescence images showed a BDNF-induced increase in the number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), integrated density (mean intensityÃpuncta area) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>) and intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>) of VGLUT1 puncta along neurites, as well as an upregulation in the total immunoreactivity in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). A small but non-significant upregulation of VGLUT1 protein levels was found in the soma, at an early time point (30 min), before the maximal increase in VGLUT1 puncta intensity (3 h) (p&lt;0.001). VGLUT2 punctate labeling was also increased in the neurites of hippocampal neurons following stimulation with BDNF for 30 min or 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). In this case, BDNF was also found to increase the number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>), integrated density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>) and intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g007">Fig. 7E</xref>) of VGLUT2 puncta in neurites, with maximal effects at 30 min of incubation with the neurotrophin. However, BDNF was without effect on total VGLUT2 immunoreactivity in the soma (p&gt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>), in contrast with the results obtained for VGLUT1.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We and others have previously shown direct presynaptic effects of BDNF, which upregulates K<sup>+</sup>-evoked [<sup>3</sup>H] glutamate release from hippocampal synaptosomes, in a subset of glutamatergic synapses expressing TrkB receptors on the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Jovanovic1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Pereira1">[64]</xref>. In the current study, we have shown that BDNF regulates VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 gene and protein expression, during development of cultured hippocampal neurons, specifically through activation of TrkB receptors and the PLCÎ³ signaling pathway. At DIV7, BDNF-induced transient VGLUT1 upregulation requires the activation of the PLCÎ³ downstream effector CAMKII, whereas VGLUT2 sustained upregulation, at the same developmental stage, depends on PKC activation. At DIV14, BDNF upregulates VGLUT1 expression with no significant effect on VGLUT2 expression, which was endogenously downregulated during this period, approximately corresponding to the developmental switch from VGLUT2 to VGLUT1 neurons in postnatal hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Fremeau1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Wojcik1">[43]</xref>. The results also indicate that BDNF affects VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 subcellular distribution, further suggesting a role in BDNF-induced short-term plasticity and LTP. These findings correlate with the BDNF-induced increase in the number of docked vesicles at the active zone and quantal glutamate release observed at hippocampal excitatory synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Jovanovic1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Tyler1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Amaral2">[65]</xref>.</p>
      <sec id="s4a">
        <title>Effect of BDNF on VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 Gene and Protein Expression</title>
        <p>In this study, we show that BDNF differentially upregulates VGLUT isoforms 1 and 2 during the development of hippocampal neurons in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), by a mechanism sensitive to inhibition of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g002">Fig. 2AâD</xref>) and translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g001">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). The BDNF-induced sustained increase in VGLUT2 protein levels contrasts with the transient upregulation of VGLUT1 protein levels induced by the neurotrophin. The latter effects correlate with the transient increase in TrkB signaling activity observed in hippocampal neurons incubated with BDNF, which reached a maximum after about 10 min of exposure to the neurotrophin and decreased to control levels after 24 h of incubation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Almeida1">[3]</xref>. These results also indicate that VGLUT1 synthesized in response to BDNF stimulation is degraded within less than 24 h. The more sustained BDNF-induced increase in VGLUT2 protein levels suggests that this transporter has a longer half-life in hippocampal neurons than VGLUT1. Alternatively, the results may indicate that the TrkB signaling pathway coupled to the regulation of VGLUT2 expression (which is distinct from the pathway responsible for VGLUT1 upregulation) may undergo a slower inactivation after desensitization of the TrkB receptors. In addition to the effect on VGLUT protein levels reported here, BDNF was previously shown to upregulate the expression of the synaptic vesicle proteins synaptophysin, synaptobrevin and synaptotagmin, but showed no effect on the presynaptic membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25, or the vesicle-binding protein synapsin-I, in organotypical cultures of hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Tartaglia1">[66]</xref>. BDNF overexpression in a Huntingtonâs disease mouse model was previously shown to prevent the decrease of striatal VGLUT1, but that effect most likely resulted from a neuroprotective mechanism of BDNF, which may have precluded the loss of glutamatergic synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Giralt1">[67]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Immunocytochemistry experiments also showed a rapid effect of BDNF on VGLUT1 protein levels in the soma, which was followed by an increase in the expression of this protein in puncta along neurites (presumably axons). These results suggest that newly synthesized vesicular glutamate transporters are delivered to neurites within 3 h, being clustered in both new and pre-existing puncta. BDNF also induced a sustained increase in the intensity of VGLUT2 puncta in neurites, but no changes were found in the somatic abundance of the transporter. This suggests that VGLUT2 synthesized in the soma following BDNF stimulation may be rapidly delivered to neurites or, alternatively, VGLUT2 may be produced locally at the neurites in response to stimulation with the neurotrophin. Furthermore, the increase noted in the number of VGLUT1/2 puncta and in the number of transporters clustered in these regions, in BDNF-stimulated hippocampal neurons may result, at least partly, from a redistribution of vesicles containing the vesicular transporters already available in neurites.</p>
        <p>VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 were initially identified as Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent inorganic phosphate transporters BNPI and DNPI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Ni1">[68]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Takamori1">[70]</xref> in screenings of cDNAs upregulated by NMDA and growth factors, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Santos2">[53]</xref>. However, the characterization of VGLUT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Zhang1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Zhang2">[72]</xref> and VGLUT2 promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Li2">[73]</xref> has only recently been performed, and no transcription factors or signaling pathways directly modulating the expression of these genes have been identified thus far, to our knowledge. Nonetheless, VGLUT1 protein levels show strong diurnal cycling, which is lost in mice lacking the period gene <italic>Period 2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Yelamanchili1">[74]</xref>. CAMKII is maximally active during the subjective day, in contrast to Erk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Ko1">[75]</xref>, and the CAMKII inhibitor KN-93 was shown to block <italic>Period 2</italic> expression while the MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 were without effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Yokota1">[76]</xref>. In agreement with these results, we have found that CAMKII inhibition blocks BDNF-induced upregulation of VGLUT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), whereas MEK/ERK inhibition had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). VGLUT1 is also upregulated in cerebrocortical and hippocampal regions of rat brains upon antidepressant treatment with fluoxetine, paroxetine or desipramine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Tordera2">[77]</xref>, or in striatal neurons due to intraperitoneal injection of methanphetamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Mark1">[78]</xref>. In turn, VGLUT2 is upregulated in vasopressin and oxytocin neurons after osmotic stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Kawasaki1">[79]</xref> or the thalamus of schizophrenic patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Smith1">[80]</xref> although, in all cases, the underlying transcriptional mechanisms are still unknown. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that glutamatergic neurons regulate glutamate release through modulation of VGLUT expression, which is endogenously regulated in developing and mature neurons enabling synaptic refinement and plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Wilson1">[44]</xref>.</p>

        <title>TrkB Activation and PLCÎ³ Signaling in BDNF-mediated Regulation of Glutamatergic Function</title>
        <p>We have found that BDNF regulation of VGLUT expression in developing hippocampal neurons depends specifically on the activation of TrkB receptors and PLCÎ³ signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053793-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), and although stimulation with BDNF is also coupled to the activation of the Ras/ERK and PI3-K signaling pathways in cultured hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Almeida1">[3]</xref> these pathways do not participate in the regulation of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 expression. Interestingly, the effects of BDNF are specific since stimulation of cultured hippocampal neurons with IGF-1 and bFGF, which also activate receptor tyrosine kinases, did not affect VGLUT protein levels. This difference may be due to a distinct location of the receptors in the cells and/or to a differential coupling to intracellular signaling mechanisms. In cultured cerebrocortical neurons, TrkB receptors were found in all major compartments of each neuron (cell bodies, dendrites, and axons) both before (DIV4) and during the peak of (DIV10) synapse formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Gomes1">[81]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The role of PLCÎ³ signaling in BDNF-induced upregulation of VGLUT protein levels in cultured hippocampal neurons correlates with its role in the modulation of other components of glutamatergic synapses by BDNF. BDNF-induced glutamate release depends on the PLCÎ³ pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Numakawa1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Matsumoto1">[83]</xref> and ceases following treatment with a synthetic glucocorticoid (DEX) that decreases glucocorticoid receptor-TrkB interaction thereby attenuating PLCÎ³ activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Numakawa2">[84]</xref>. Likewise, in cultured hippocampal neurons, BDNF enhances glutamatergic synaptic transmission by raising the presynaptic intracellular calcium concentration, due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from IP3-sensitive stores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Li3">[85]</xref>. Furthermore, in hippocampal synaptosomes, the effect of BDNF on K<sup>+</sup>-evoked [<sup>3</sup>H] glutamate release correlates with increased PLCÎ³ phosphorylation but not ERK or Akt phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Pereira1">[64]</xref>. Additionally, both the early and late phases of long-term potentiation are impaired in the CA1 hippocampus region of homozygous mice with mutant PLCÎ³ docking sites at TrkB receptors, as a result of impaired CAMKIV and CREB phosphorylation, whilst mutation of Shc docking site, upstream of Ras-Erk and PI3K/Akt, had no effect on LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Minichiello2">[18]</xref>. The effects of BDNF on LTP are likely mediated by activation of pre- and post-synaptic TrkB receptors since selectively blocking of pre- or postsynaptic signaling showed no significant reduction in LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Gartner1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Gruart1">[23]</xref>. The current results showing BDNF-induced differential upregulation of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2, via CAMKII and PKC activation, respectively, identify VGLUT as potential presynaptic molecular targets of BDNF contribution to protein-synthesis dependent mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. This is supported by evidences showing that inhibition of BDNF signaling impairs LTM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Monteggia1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Heldt1">[87]</xref>, VGLUT1 deletion results in impaired LTP, learning and memory function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Balschun1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Tordera1">[47]</xref>, and both isoforms are crucial effectors of synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Fremeau1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Weston1">[88]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In addition to the effects on VGLUT protein levels, activation of TrkB receptors by BDNF has also been shown to enhance glutamate release in cultured hippocampal neurons by increasing the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Li3">[85]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Lessmann1">[89]</xref>. Other authors have also reported that BDNF enhances presynaptic function by increasing the number of docked vesicles at the active zone and quantal glutamate release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Jovanovic1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Tyler1">[41]</xref> when the postsynaptic neuron is glutamatergic or excitatory but not when GABAergic or inhibitory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Schinder1">[90]</xref>. At the postsynaptic level, BDNF may potentiate excitatory synaptic transmission by regulating the expression and synaptic delivery of AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, through activation of PKC and CAMKII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Caldeira1">[37]</xref>, and upregulating the expression of GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B NMDA subunits in a transcription-dependent mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Caldeira2">[38]</xref>. CAMKII and PKC, activated downstream of BDNF binding to TrkB receptors and PLCÎ³ stimulation, have a key role in the potentiation of NMDA receptors by BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Crozier1">[91]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Lan1">[92]</xref>. These findings support the model whereby BDNF induces LTP through targeting of both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, critical for synaptic function. We have also found that incubation with BDNF has no effect on protein markers of GABAergic neurons, glutamate decarboxylase 65 and 67 (data not shown), further demonstrating the correlation between BDNF signaling-dependent regulation of neuronal protein levels and function.</p>
        <p>In addition to TrkB receptors, BDNF may also bind to p75<sup>NTR</sup>, abundantly expressed in the hippocampus during the late embryonic and early postnatal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Buck1">[93]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Lu1">[94]</xref> period of developmental cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Ferrer1">[95]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Gould1">[96]</xref>, although with low affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-RodriguezTebar1">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, BDNF binds to truncated TrkB receptors, but their endogenous expression does not peak until postnatal days 10â15 (P10â15), in contrast with the full-length (FL) TrkB mRNA, which reaches adult levels at birth (P0) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Fryer1">[97]</xref>. Hence, BDNF signaling in developing hippocampal neurons is essentially dependent on TrkB.FL receptor activation. This is in accordance with the results reported here showing that BDNF-induced upregulation of VGLUT was inhibited by the Trk receptor inhibitor K252a.</p>

The following evidences suggest that BDNF-induced upregulation in VGLUT clustering in neurites may significantly potentiate excitatory neurotransmission: 1) VGLUT expression directly correlates with synaptic strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Wojcik1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Wilson1">[44]</xref> and biogenesis or recycling of synaptic vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Fremeau1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-WallenMackenzie1">[98]</xref>; 2) VGLUT1 deficient mice exhibit decreased spontaneous glutamate release and quantal synaptic transmission due to exocytosis of partially filled vesicles in hippocampal synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Wojcik1">[43]</xref>; 3) VGLUT1 overexpression not only rescues this phenotype but also enhances AMPA receptor-mediated evoked EPSCs by increasing glutamate release per vesicle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Wilson1">[44]</xref>; 4) loss of VGLUT 1 and 2 causes changes in synaptic vesicle shape and leads to decreased number of vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Fremeau1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-WallenMackenzie1">[98]</xref>; 5) VGLUT2 deficiency decreases evoked glutamate release probability and reduces LTD at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses of young postnatal (P11âP14) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-He1">[99]</xref>; 6) even though one transporter apparently suffices to fill a vesicle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Daniels1">[100]</xref>, enhanced VGLUT expression may increase the number of transporters per vesicle, thus, accelerating the rate of vesicle filling or its volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Edwards1">[101]</xref>. Conversely, decreased VGLUT1 expression causes depressive behavior and impaired memory in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Tordera1">[47]</xref>, while VGLUT2 heterozygotes show decreased neuropathic pain and defense responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-WallenMackenzie1">[98]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053793-Moechars1">[102]</xref>. Hence, differences between transcription and translation rates or synaptic delivery of VGLUT isoforms, otherwise quite similar in function, further explain presynaptic regulation of quantal size.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the results presented herein suggest that BDNF signaling regulates differentially the gene and protein expression of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in developing and mature hippocampal neurons. Nevertheless, future in vivo studies as required for verifying the potential role of BDNF-mediated regulation of VGLUT expression in hippocampal synaptic mechanisms of short-term plasticity and long-term potentiation.</p>

          <p>Acute BDNF stimulation does not induce a sustained increase in VGLUT protein levels after removal of the neurotrophin. (AâB) Cultured hippocampal neurons at DIV14 (A) and DIV7 (B) were incubated with 100 ng/ml BDNF for 4 hours in Neurobasal medium followed by a 14 h recovery period in culture conditioned medium. Total VGLUT1 (A) and VGLUT2 (B) protein levels were compared to control (without BDNF) expression, upon normalization with Î²-Tubulin levels. Quantification of ten different experiments, performed in independent preparations, is presented as mean percentage Â±SEM compared to the control (unstimulated neurons).
