        <p><italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>Parkin</italic> mutations cause recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and SH-SY5Y cells, Parkin is recruited by PINK1 to damaged mitochondria, where it ubiquitinates Mitofusins and consequently promotes mitochondrial fission and mitophagy.</p>
        <p>Here, we investigated the impact of mutations in endogenous PINK1 and Parkin on the ubiquitination of mitochondrial fusion and fission factors and the mitochondrial network structure. Treating control fibroblasts with mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) inhibitors or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in ubiquitination of Mfn1/2 but not of OPA1 or Fis1. Ubiquitination of Mitofusins through the PINK1/Parkin pathway was observed within 1 h of treatment. Upon combined inhibition of Δψ and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), no ubiquitination of Mitofusins was detected. Regarding morphological changes, we observed a trend towards increased mitochondrial branching in PD patient cells upon mitochondrial stress.</p>
        <p>For the first time in PD patient-derived cells, we demonstrate that mutations in PINK1 and Parkin impair ubiquitination of Mitofusins. In the presence of UPS inhibitors, ubiquitinated Mitofusin is deubiquitinated by the UPS but not degraded, suggesting that the UPS is involved in Mitofusin degradation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, clinically characterized by bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity, with a monogenic cause in about 2–3% of the cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Klein1">[1]</xref>. Studying the consequences of mutations in recessively inherited PD-associated genes, such as <italic>PTEN-induced putative kinase 1</italic> (<italic>PINK1</italic>) or the E3 ubiquitin ligase <italic>Parkin</italic>, may help to understand the mechanisms underlying the disease also in sporadic, idiopathic PD patients.</p>
      <p>Although the exact cause of sporadic PD is still elusive, mitochondrial dysfunction has long been connected with the disease. Impaired respiratory chain function has been found in sporadic PD patients and different <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>Parkin</italic> knockdown models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Palacino1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Flinn1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Gegg1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Schapira1">[5]</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>Drosophila pink1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> loss-of-function mutants showed defects in mitochondrial morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Clark1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Park1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Yang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Greene1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Pesah1">[10]</xref>. Transgenic expression of <italic>parkin</italic> markedly ameliorated all <italic>pink1</italic> loss-of-function phenotypes, but not vice versa, suggesting that parkin functions downstream of pink1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Clark1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Park1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Yang1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A series of experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, SH-SY5Y cells, and primary mouse neurons provided evidence that the PINK1/Parkin pathway promotes mitochondrial fission and that loss of activity of either protein results in decreased fission and impaired tissue integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Poole1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Deng1">[12]</xref>. Inactivation of the dynamin-related protein 1 (drp1), a key factor of mitochondrial fission, enhances the <italic>pink1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic>-mutant phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Poole1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Deng1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Park2">[13]</xref>. By contrast, increased <italic>drp1</italic> gene dosage or inactivation of the mitochondrial fusion-promoting components <italic>optic atrophy 1</italic> (<italic>opa1</italic>) and <italic>mitofusin</italic> (<italic>mfn</italic>) suppress the mitochondrial phenotype in <italic>Drosophila pink1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Poole1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Deng1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Park2">[13]</xref>. Recently, these observations have been linked to mitophagy. Under stress conditions, PINK1 recruits Parkin to dysfunctional mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Matsuda1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-VivesBauza1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Rakovic1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Narendra1">[17]</xref>. The subsequent ubiquitination of Mitofusins by Parkin inhibits mitochondrial fusion and thus promotes mitochondrial fragmentation as an initial step of mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Poole2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Ziviani1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Gegg2">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In PD patient fibroblasts, only the morphological effects of mutations in Parkin have been studied so far revealing that the degree of mitochondrial branching was higher than in controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Mortiboys1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our present work, we used fibroblast cultures from PD patients carrying two mutated <italic>Parkin</italic> or <italic>PINK1</italic> alleles to investigate the consequences of mutations in endogenous PINK1 and Parkin on the ubiquitination of mitochondrial fusion and fission factors. Furthermore, we evaluated the influence of these mutations on the structure of the mitochondrial network in human cells.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Two fibroblast cultures with homozygous PINK1 mutations, p.Q456X or p.V170G, two cultures with homozygous Parkin mutations, p.V324fsX434 or p.R245fsX253, and fibroblasts from two age-matched mutation-negative healthy controls were included in the study. The effects of these mutations on <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>Parkin</italic> mRNA levels are described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Rakovic1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Grnewald1">[22]</xref>.

        <title>Decreased Mfn2 levels after valinomycin or CCCP treatment in control fibroblasts</title>
        <p>First, we determined the endogenous levels of Mfn2 in the <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>Parkin</italic> mutants and controls under basal conditions and after exposure to 1 µM valinomycin for 12 h. This treatment caused a drop in the protein levels of Mfn2 in controls but not in either of the mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016746-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore in controls, Mfn2 had an additional band on the Western blot, which was about 8 kDa larger in size than the non-modified form, consistent with monoubiquitination of the protein. By contrast, protein levels of OPA1 and Fis1 were unchanged in all cell cultures when incubated with valinomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016746-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and modified forms of these proteins were not detectable. Protein levels of the mitochondrial marker voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) were comparable in all samples under basal and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016746-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>).</p>

            <title>Expression of mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins after valinomycin treatment.</title>
            <p>Fibroblasts from a healthy control, a homozygous <italic>PINK1</italic> mutant and a homozygous <italic>Parkin</italic> mutant were cultured under basal conditions or treated with 1 µM valinomycin for 12 h. The protein levels of (A) Mfn2, (B) OPA1 and Fis1 were investigated by means of Western blotting. Valinomycin exposure caused a decrease in Mfn2 levels in controls, but not in <italic>PINK1</italic>- or <italic>Parkin</italic>-mutant cells. The protein levels of OPA1 and Fis1 were not influenced by this treatment in any of the cell cultures. Under basal and stress conditions, expression of the mitochondrial marker VDAC1 was comparable in mutants and controls. (C) Mutant cells were incubated with scrambled siRNA, <italic>Mfn1</italic> siRNA, <italic>Mfn2</italic> siRNA or a combination of <italic>Mfn1</italic> and <italic>Mfn2</italic> siRNA for 40 h. Western blot analysis was performed with an antibody against Mfn2. The Mfn2 level decreased only when <italic>Mfn2</italic> siRNA was employed, confirming the specificity of the anti-Mfn1 antibody used in our study. β-actin served as a loading control. Fis1 – fission 1; Mfn1 – mitofusin 1; Mfn2 – mitofusin 2; OPA1 – optic atrophy 1; VDAC1 – voltage-dependent anion channel 1.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To test whether the used Mfn2 antibody specifically binds Mfn2, a knock-down experiment with siRNA against <italic>Mfn1</italic> or <italic>Mfn2</italic> was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016746-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This experiment showed a drop in Mfn2 level only when siRNA against <italic>Mfn2</italic> was employed, confirming the specificity of the antibody.</p>
        <p>In this experiment also the Mfn2 homolog mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Koshiba1">[26]</xref> was investigated and showed comparable effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016746.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Since the available Mfn1 antibody was less sensitive than the Mfn2 antibody, out of the series of experiments for Mfn2 described in this article, only selected ones were repeated for Mfn1 (see supplementary material).</p>
        <p>Reduced Mfn2 levels in controls but not in <italic>PINK1</italic>- and <italic>Parkin</italic>-mutant fibroblasts were also detected after incubation with the protonophore cyanide <italic>m</italic>-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; 10 µM for 12 h) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016746.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Since valinomycin and CCCP had identical effects on Mfn2, only results from the experiments using valinomycin are shown.</p>

      <sec id="s2b">
        <title>In control fibroblasts, Mfn2 is ubiquitinated after valinomycin exposure and is detected in the mitochondrial fraction</title>
        <p>Next, we intended to verify whether the additional band on the Mfn2 blot, which is present only in controls after valinomycin- or CCCP-induced stress, is indeed explained by ubiquitination of the protein. For this, we performed immunoprecipitation using an antibody against Mfn2. Whole cell lysates from non-treated and valinomycin-treated (1 µM, for 6 h) controls were employed. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody against ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016746-g002">Figure 2</xref>, left panel) or with an antibody against Mfn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016746-g002">Figure 2</xref>, right panel). On both blots, bands of the size of mono- and polyubiquitinated or multiple monoubiquitinated Mfn2 were only detected in valinomycin-treated but not in non-treated controls. Immunoprecipitation was also performed with cell lysates from valinomycin-treated <italic>PINK1</italic>- and <italic>Parkin</italic>-mutant fibroblasts. Western blot analysis with an Mfn2 antibody showed only the non-modified form of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016746.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Taken together, these findings supported our previous results and underline that Mfn2 is ubiquitinated via the PINK1/Parkin pathway.</p>

To exclude that proteasomal inhibition influences the effect of the potassium ionophore valinomycin, the mitochondrial membrane potential in control fibroblasts was monitored during 9 h of treatment with valinomycin alone or in combination with epoxomicin.

For that we treated control fibroblasts with valinomycin to induce ubiquitination. After 6 h we added MG132 or DMSO (dissolvent for MG132) and harvested cells at different time points. Western blot analysis revealed that upon 6 h of UPS inhibition, levels of non-modified Mitofusins were almost at the same level as before treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016746-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

Here, we expand our previous results using these PD patient cells to characterize effects of the PINK1/Parkin pathway on mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins on the endogenous level.</p>
      <p>Several studies reported that mitochondrial stress, such as exposure to membrane potential inhibitors, initiates the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Matsuda1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-VivesBauza1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Rakovic1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Narendra1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Gegg2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Tanaka1">[28]</xref>. Therefore, we treated our fibroblast cell cultures with the mitochondrial uncoupling agents valinomycin and CCCP or the superoxide generator H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. All treatments resulted in decreased Mfn2 signal in the controls but not in the mutants. However, the effect after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> incubation was the least pronounced. Moreover, high-molecular-weight Mfn2 bands were detected in the controls, indicative of Mfn2 poly- or multiple monoubiquitination. By contrast, the protein levels of OPA1 and Fis1 were not altered in mutants compared to controls under stress conditions. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the mitochondrial phenotype caused by <italic>pink1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> loss-of-function mutations could at least partially be suppressed by <italic>opa1</italic> knockdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Yang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Poole1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Deng1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Park2">[13]</xref>. Conversely, in SH-SY5Y cells, overexpression of <italic>OPA1</italic> prevented changes in mitochondrial morphology induced by <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>Parkin</italic> knockdown. However, similar to our findings, no alterations in OPA1 processing were observed in these cells lacking PINK1 or Parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Lutz1">[29]</xref>. These apparent discrepancies could be explained by differences in OPA1 function in arthropods compared to mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Jeyaraju1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>By means of immunoprecipitation, the additional anti-Mfn2 reactive bands indeed proved to represent ubiquitinated forms of the protein. These findings are in line with recent publications reporting that in wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> and SH-SY5Y cells Mitofusins are ubiquitinated in response to mitochondrial stress. This modification was, however, impaired in treated <italic>Parkin</italic> or <italic>Pink1</italic> knockdown cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Poole2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Ziviani1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Gegg2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Tanaka1">[28]</xref>.

Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the “increased” mfn levels in <italic>pink1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> knockdown flies may reflect an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in these mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Narendra1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Of note, all experiments performed for the Mfn2 interaction partner Mfn1 in this study indicate similar behavior of both Mitofusins in the PINK1/Parkin pathway.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we were able to rescue the ubiquitination of Mfn2 when <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>Parkin</italic> was re-expressed in <italic>PINK1</italic>- or <italic>Parkin</italic>-mutant cells. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, transgenic expression of <italic>parkin</italic> in pink1 loss-of-function mutants markedly ameliorated all mitochondrial phenotypes, but not vice versa, leading to the conclusion that parkin functions downstream of pink1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Clark1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Park1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Yang1">[8]</xref>. However, to our surprise, we were not able to detect ubiquitinated Mfn2 when <italic>PINK1</italic> mutant cells were transfected with <italic>FLAG-Parkin</italic>. Given the weak signal of ubiquitinated Mfn2 after <italic>PINK1</italic> transfection in the <italic>Parkin</italic>-mutant cells, a possible explanation for this discrepancy might be that the used antibody is not sensitive enough to detect the likely even lower levels of ubiquitinated Mfn2 in the <italic>PINK1</italic>-mutant fibroblasts.</p>
      <p>When we determined the subcellular localization of non-modified and ubiquitinated Mfn2 in control fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells, all Mfn2 forms were exclusively found in the mitochondrial fraction. Ubiquitination occurred already within one hour of treatment with valinomycin. Contrary to our expectations, inhibition of the UPS with epoxomicin or MG132 neither increased nor preserved the levels of ubiquitinated Mfn2 over time. Ubiquitination of Mfn2 in control cells was apparently absent using valinomycin in combination with a proteasomal inhibitor. However, this was not explained by interference of epoxomicin with the effect of the mitochondrial uncoupler valinomycin. According to the literature, proteins targeted for degradation can only enter the UPS after their ubiquitin chain has been removed. This deubiquitination is performed by the 19S regulatory complex of the UPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Kaiser1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Yao1">[32]</xref>. Epoxomicin is a potent inhibitor of the 20S proteasome subunit, where protein degradation takes place, but does not influence the deubiquitinase activity of the 19S particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016746-g010">Figure 10</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Verma1">[33]</xref>. Consequently, our data suggest that, in the presence of epoxomicin or MG132, ubiquitinated Mitofusins are solely deubiquitinated but not degraded by the UPS leading to constant levels of non-modified Mfn1/2 in the stressed control cells. Under stress conditions without UPS inhibition, however, the turnover of ubiquitinated Mfn1/2 in the cytosol is probably occurring too rapidly to be detected in a fractionation experiment. In line with our hypothesis, inhibition of lysosomal degradation did not prevent Mfn2 ubiquitination in control fibroblasts. At first sight, there appears to be a discrepancy between our data and a recently published report showing that the ubiquitinated forms of Mitofusins may be preserved upon treatment with the UPS inhibitor MG132 and the uncoupler of the mitochondrial membrane potential CCCP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Tanaka1">[28]</xref>. However, this can be explained by the fact that cells overexpressing <italic>Parkin</italic> were used in that study, whereas our experimental setup was based on endogenous levels of Parkin. It is conceivable that under conditions of overexpressed <italic>Parkin</italic>, the balance between Parkin-mediated ubiquitination and deubiquitination by the UPS is shifted towards ubiquitination, thus leading to accumulation of ubiquitinated Mitofusins in their system. Interestingly, the degradation of the yeast Mfn1/2 homologue Fzo1 is also dependent on the UPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Cohen1">[34]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Possible scenario of Mfn1/2 deubiquitination and degradation at the UPS.</title>
          <p>Under valinomycin stress, Mitofusins are ubiquitinated by Parkin. Poly-ubiquitinated Mitofusins are subsequently recognized by the intrinsic ubiquitin-binding activity of the 19S particle of the 26S proteasome. At the 19S regulatory complex the ubiquitin chain is disassembled, and the substrate is unfolded before it can enter the cavity of the 20S subunit where proteolysis takes place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Kaiser1">[31]</xref>. Simultaneous treatment with epoxomicin (or MG132) inhibits the degradation function of the 20S core particle but does not influence the deubiquitylase activity of the 19S subunit. Consequently, poly-ubiquitinated Mitofusins are deubiquitinated at the proteasome but cannot be degraded. Mfn1/2 – mitofusin 1/2; Ub – ubiquitin; UPS – ubiquitin proteasome system.</p>

      <p>In a recent publication, the mitochondrial membrane potential was identified as an important cellular parameter to differentiate between functional and dysfunctional mitochondria. Following fission, the refusion of daughter mitochondria requires a membrane potential beyond a certain threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Twig1">[35]</xref>. We hypothesize that Parkin-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Mfn1/2 prevents this refusion. Such isolated dysfunctional mitochondria likely undergo mitophagy and require both functional Parkin and PINK1. This notion is supported by colocalization of PINK1 and partially also of Parkin with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a marker of autophagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Kawajiri1">[36]</xref>, and by abrogation of Parkin-induced mitophagy upon treatment with bafilomycin, a lysosomal inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Narendra2">[37]</xref>.

          <p>By means of fission, mitochondria are randomly divided. Damaged mitochondria can be distinguished from functional mitochondria, for instance, by a difference in membrane potential. Dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential are detected by PINK1, which recruits Parkin. Next, Parkin ubiquitinates Mfn1/2 which localize to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Subsequently, ubiquitinated Mitofusins are degraded by the UPS, preventing fusion of dysfunctional with functional mitochondria. By this, dysfunctional mitochondria are selected out from the general pool of mitochondria and subsequently undergo mitophagy.

      <p>According to our current knowledge, mitophagy is the only mechanism by which mitochondria are recycled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Chen1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, impairment of mitophagy due to PINK1 or Parkin mutations presumably leads to accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in the cell.

In accordance with our hypothesis, two studies in HeLa cells provided evidence that overexpression of Parkin leads to a significant loss of mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Kawajiri1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Narendra2">[37]</xref>. However, when we compared the expression of various mitochondrial markers in our <italic>PINK1</italic>- and <italic>Parkin</italic>-mutant as well as control fibroblasts, no changes indicative of differences in mitochondrial mass were identified. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that mitophagy is highly selective in an endogenous model and thus does not result in a readily observable reduction in mitochondrial mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Chen1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Kanki1">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To obtain insight in the consequences of altered Mfn1/2 ubiquitination on mitochondrial morphology, we determined the degree of branching of the mitochondrial network by measuring the form factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Mortiboys1">[21]</xref> in <italic>PINK1</italic>-, <italic>Parkin</italic>-mutant and control cells. In line with our qualitative observations, this quantitative assessment showed no differences between mutant and control fibroblasts under basal conditions. By contrast, mitochondrial branching was found to be significantly increased in non-treated <italic>Parkin</italic>-mutants in an earlier study on fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Mortiboys1">[21]</xref>. When we stressed the mutant and control cells with valinomycin, the form factor decreased in all three samples. However, we detected a trend towards more fragmented mitochondria in control cells, supporting our hypothesis. It will be interesting to see whether this trend holds up in a larger sample of control, <italic>PINK1</italic>- and <italic>Parkin</italic>-mutant fibroblast cultures. In the above-mentioned study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Mortiboys1">[21]</xref>, fibroblasts were exposed to rotenone, an inhibitor of the respiratory chain complex I. This treatment caused mitochondrial fragmentation in <italic>Parkin</italic>-mutant and control cells similar to the effect of valinomycin in our cells. In this published study, however, no differences in branching were detected between the investigated groups after exposure to mitochondrial stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016746-Mortiboys1">[21]</xref>. Since mitochondrial fusion and fission are transient events, dynamic quantification methods would be useful to determine the impact of PINK1 and Parkin mutations on mitochondrial morphology.</p>
      <p>Confirming the results from arthropod studies and expanding on our previous findings, we showed that endogenous mutations in PINK1 and Parkin impair ubiquitination of mitofusins in human fibroblasts. In addition, our results imply that the UPS is involved in the degradation of Mitofusins under mitochondrial stress conditions.</p>

          <p><bold>Treatment with valinomycin alone or in combination with epoxomicin causes a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential.</bold> Control fibroblasts were incubated with either 1 µM valinomycin alone or with 1 µM valinomycin plus 10 µM epoxomicin. The membrane potential was measured at different time points and corrected for protein concentration. Exposure to the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin did not influence the membrane potential over time. In the graph mean values +/− standard deviation of three independent experiments are given. Δψ – mitochondrial membrane potential.</p>
