Due to their physico-chemical complexity with many micro-niches, they teem with bio-diversity, both phylogenetically and functionally. A single gram of soil has been estimated to contain thousands to millions of different bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Torsvik1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Gans1">[2]</xref> interwoven in extremely complex food webs. Communities of soil microbes carry out a multitude of small-scale processes that underlie many environmentally important functions. However, the explicit functional and ecological roles of individual taxa remain uncertain because most microbes withstand laboratory cultivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Prosser1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Fierer1">[4]</xref>. Therefore the most basic questions in microbial ecology “who is out there?” and “what are they doing?” are still often unanswered for many environments and for many microbial taxa. Ideally, especially the second question requires simultaneously information about the identity of taxa within a community and about functional processes performed. While soils seem to harbor the most complex microbial communities, these considerations apply to many other environments as well, like e.g. oceans and sediments.</p><p>With metagenomic technologies new dimensions in the characterization of complex microbial communities have been reached. Large scale shotgun sequencing approaches allow the discovery of many novel genes found in the environments independent of cultivation efforts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-MartinCuadrado1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Venter1">[8]</xref>. Sequencing of large genomic inserts that contain phylogenetic “anchors” allows a direct link to the microbial taxon. However, in almost all of the metagenomic studies, a separate accompanying molecular typing method-usually based on PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes-is needed to characterize the gene discoveries in the context of the microbial phylogenetic diversity of the sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Tringe1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Gill1">[9]</xref>.</p><p>These PCR-based typing methods-though very powerful, in particular when combined with the novel pyro-sequencing technology-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Huber1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Sogin1">[11]</xref> have some well-known drawbacks: (1) bias is introduced by primers and/or exponential amplification; (2) simultaneous quantitative assessment of all three domains of life is impossible and (3) persistence of free DNA can bias the measurement of community responses to environmental changes.</p><p>Furthermore, DNA-based metagenomic and diversity studies do not allow us to draw conclusions on the expression state of the genes and therefore the functional role of genes or organisms in the investigated environment remains uncertain. In analogy to postgenomic studies of cultivated organisms, a logical next step in the metagenomic area therefore includes meta-transcriptomic technology.</p><p>First attempts to study the transcription of genes in environmental samples have been performed. They involved specific purification steps to selectively enrich for mRNA of bacteria or eukarya by depleting ribosomal RNA or enriching for polyA-tailed mRNA, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Bailly1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Poretsky1">[13]</xref>. A more large scale (pyro-)sequencing approach was recently adapted for use with bacterial and archaeal mRNA from an environmental marine sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-FriasLopez1">[14]</xref>. It involved an <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification step to maintain small sample size and fast preparation.</p><p>In order to overcome some of the limitations of the approaches mentioned above, we explore here the possibility to analyse the total RNA pool of a community, as it is naturally enriched not only in functionally but also taxonomically relevant molecules, i.e. mRNA and rRNA, respectively.</p><p>This offers the opportunity to link community structure and function in a single experiment, and to reach beyond the community's genomic potential as assessed in DNA-based methods, towards its <italic>in situ</italic> activity. Furthermore, the use of total RNA avoids extensive cleaning or amplification steps of mRNA molecules, enabling fast preparation even from difficult samples, such as soils, which are notoriously enriched for humic acids and other substances inhibiting molecular biological applications.</p><p>We have published initial results of the approach earlier in the context of characterizing the transcriptional activity of particular organisms from soil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Leininger1">[15]</xref>. Here we present and validate the “double-RNA” approach for in-depth characterization of a soil microbial community by studying mRNA and rRNA molecules simultaneously from the same sample. Our approach ensures (i) fast preparation of the RNA in the light of the short half life of mRNA molecules, it avoids (ii) biases introduced by PCR or cloning procedures and (iii) obtains qualitative and quantitative information simultaneously of genes from organisms of all three domains of life, the archaea, bacteria and eukarya. Since highly parallel sequencing was used for this approach, which produced many, but short reads (100 bp), we have set up an appropriate bioinformatic analysis pipeline that allows to reliably extract in-depth functional and taxonomic information from this dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Community profiling based on SSU and LSU rRNA-tags</title><p>The sandy soil ecosystem studied here stems from a conservation area and is comparably poor in nutrients and of neutral pH. It has been the subject of a variety of studies. Many molecular data are therefore available which facilitate result interpretation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Leininger1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Treusch2">[20]</xref>. We generated cDNA from the transcriptome of this soil community by a non-targeted approach applying random-hexamer primed reverse transcription on total RNA. The cDNA was subjected directly to pyrosequencing without any prior PCR or cloning steps (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">materials and methods</xref> for details). Several potentially biasing steps were therefore avoided. One experiment resulted in 258,411 RNA-derived sequence tags of ∼98 bp. We set up a two-step analysis process to identify rRNA- and mRNA-derived tags (“ribo-tags” and “mRNA-tags”, respectively) for efficiently and reliably obtaining taxonomic and functional information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002527-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In the first step, all RNA-tags were compared against a small subunit and a large subunit rRNA reference database (SSUrdb and LSUrdb, respectively) that we compiled from publicly available sources (SILVA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Pruesse1">[21]</xref>, RDP-II<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Cole1">[22]</xref>, Genbank nucleotide; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">materials and methods</xref> for details). These two databases contain sequences from all three domains of life (SSUrdb: 137,160 sequences; LSUrdb: 6,247 sequences; see Supplement <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s011">Table S1</xref> in Supporting Information, SI). This approach enables the first simultaneous taxonomic analysis of communities based on the two most commonly used taxonomic marker molecules. The output file was analyzed with the program MEGAN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Huson1">[23]</xref>. In the second stage, all unassigned RNA-tags were compared against the Genbank non-redundant protein database to identify mRNA-tags.</p><fig id="pone-0002527-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002527.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview about the double RNA analysis pipeline.</title><p>Refer to text for details.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0002527.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>The validity of our taxonomic analysis was tested with two simulated datasets composed of 43 small or large subunit rRNAs from bacterial (32), archaeal (5) and eukaryotic (6) representatives (see Supplement <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s001">Methods and Results S1</xref> in SI for details). Both databases, though very different in size and sequence composition, produced a similarly high taxonomic resolution power not only at the taxonomic level of domain and phylum, but also at the level of order for most of the species tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s013">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s014">S4</xref> in SI give details). These results also showed that neither reference database introduced a major artificial “community” shift; rather, both correctly reflected the test set's “community” structure. In addition, none of the ribo-tags were taxonomically wrongly assigned. Even with a ribo-tag length of 100 bp the power of resolution sufficed for our approach (this has also been demonstrated by other simulations, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Wang1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Liu1">[25]</xref>). Additionally, we simulated a more natural situation by removing all reference sequences similar to test rRNAs from the databases, according to similarity distributions of ribo-tags from our soil dataset against the reference databases (see Supplement <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s001">Methods and Results S1</xref> in SI for details). The identified thresholds reflected the median similarity of SSU and LSU ribo-tags (98% and 93% respectively; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s002">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s003">S2</xref> in SI) to their best BLAST match in the reference databases. No significant decrease in taxonomic resolution was observed for the SSUrdb and no ribo-tag was incorrectly assigned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s015">Table S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s004">Figure S3</xref> in SI). The much smaller LSUrdb assigned 5% of the ribo-tags incorrectly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s015">Table S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s005">Figure S4</xref> in SI). When removing all reference sequences ≥86% similar to test sequences from the SSUrdb (to simulate a situation reflecting to the lowest decile similarity for SSU ribo-tags observed in the soil dataset), 5% of the ribo-tags were incorrectly assigned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s015">Table S5</xref> in SI). These results indicated a robust performance of the taxonomic binning approach. Encouragingly, the taxonomic resolution power will only improve further as (1) read lengths increase –250 bp are now possible, and 450 bp will soon be achievable; and (2) rRNA reference databases compile ever more sequences.</p><p>The soil dataset contained 193,219 RNA-tags which had significant BLAST hits against the rRNA reference databases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002527-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002527-g002">Fig 2</xref>).

This procedure was repeated 200 times resulting in a statistical coverage of 13.3 for each position in SSU rRNA (for an assumed length of 1500 bp) and 6.7 for LSU rRNA sequences (for an assumed length of 3000 bp) within the test set.

No such assignments were observed above a BLASTN score of 71 bits. Manual inspections of the alignments from the simulated data lead us to choose 86 bits as the minimum BLASTN score for an RNA-tag to be considered as ribo-tag. These alignments are always longer than 40 bases and correspond to an e-value of 2e-16 for SSUrdb alignments. In addition, a relative threshold was introduced in the taxonomic binning procedure applying MEGAŃs LCA algorithm. Here, ten percent was chosen as cut-off, which means that the taxonomic information of all reference sequences on the BLAST hit list which are within 10% of the score of the BLAST top hit were included in the taxonomic binning of the respective ribo-tag. Increasing this cutoff to 20% or more, i.e. making the taxonomic assignment of a ribo-tag less strict, led to a very minor shift in taxonomic resolution (data not shown), showing that the chosen relative cut-off is already rather relaxed.</p><p>The rRNA reference databases were screened for taxonomically wrongly assigned reference sequences using simulated ribo-tag datasets. Since those consisted of ribo-tags of known origin, an assignment congruent with the taxonomic resolution power of the database for the respective taxon was expected. Where results deviated from these expectations, they were manually inspected. Especially the BLAST hit lists of ribo-tags with poor taxonomic resolution (mainly the taxonomic levels “cellular organism”, “domain” and several prokaryotic “phyla”) were analysed in detail. For example, a single acidobacterial reference sequence wrongly affiliated to another bacterial phylum would result in a drastic under-representation of acidobacteria, because the LCA algorithm would group the acidobacterial ribo-tags at the bacterial domain level. In the analysis of a natural community, this would introduce a strong artificial community shift, biasing against acidobacteria. Suspicious reference sequences were compared by BLAST against NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database and removed from the reference database. The test set was subsequently compared to the refined reference database, to verify an improved performance for the respective taxon and/or to identify additional wrongly affiliated reference sequences. Applying this iterative procedure, more than 600 bacterial sequences with wrong affiliations in the NCBI taxonomy were removed from the SSUrdb.</p><p>In order to extend the sensitivity and robustness analysis (see Supplement <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s001">Methods and Results S1</xref> in SI), we attempted to simulate the situation where ribo-tags would be as similar to the database as in median case, by removing entries from the database. Database filtering was carried out by aligning the full-length SSU and LSU rRNA sequences from seven selected test species to all entries in the respective reference database, using BLASTN with modified scoring parameters (mismatch penalty = 1, gap open cost = 2, gap extension cost = 1). In all cases where the full-length test sequence showed higher similarity than the threshold to a database sequence, this sequence was removed from the database. The procedure was carried out independently for each test species with the respective sample median similarities used as thresholds (98% for the SSUrdb and 93% for the LSUrdb), thus producing 7 filtered versions of the LSUrdb and SSUrdb. For the SSUrdb, the lowest decile similarity (86%) was also removed in a separate filtering. The simulated SSU and LSU ribo-tags from the test species were then aligned to respective filtered database versions using BLASTN and taxonomically assigned using MEGAN, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Assembly of a “composite community” rRNA sequence</title><p>Using MEGAN, all 1,113 putative SSU ribo-tags assigned to the archaeal GroupI.1b were extracted from the dataset. The assembly program CAP3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Huang1">[41]</xref> was then used to attempt to assemble the data (default parameters) which resulted in a single contiguous sequence contig with a length of 1,502 bp assembled from 1105 of the extracted ribo-tags.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Functional analysis of putative mRNA-tags</title><p>All RNA-tags without a significant similarity against the rRNA reference databases (BLAST score threshold below 86 bits), were translated in all six reading frames and aligned to the NCBI non-redundant protein database (release of June 25, 2007) using BLASTX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Altschul1">[42]</xref> and analysed with MEGAN. The resulting tags with at least one BLAST alignment producing a bitscore of 30 or above were assigned as putative mRNA transcripts. Manual inspection revealed that sequences with BLAST hits close to a bitscore of 30 produce apparently meaningful alignments. In addition, the coverage of the ribosomal reference databases, compared to the true distribution of all existing ribosomal sequences, is expected to be much better than the coverage of Genbank nr compared to all existing protein coding sequences. This assumption, together with the short lengths of the translated reads (approximately 30 amino acids) means that possibly true mRNA transcripts would be missed, were we to use a higher bitscore limit.</p><p>Putative mRNA sequences were annotated using the MG-RAST (Meta Genome Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology; v1.2) server at the Argonne National Library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://metagenomics.nmpdr.org" xlink:type="simple">http://metagenomics.nmpdr.org</ext-link>), using subsystem-based annotation based on the SEED database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Overbeek1">[32]</xref>. Subsystems are groups of genes, or functional roles, acting together in a biological process, e.g. in a metabolic pathway. These are grouped into subsystem categories. The MG-RAST annotation pipeline assign some putative genes to more than one subsystem, i e predicts that these genes have multiple functions. In such cases, each assignment was counted in the statistic Total Subsystem Assignments in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s018">Table S8</xref> in SI (so that the gene was counted more than once). As a consequence of this, the sum of the relative subsystem counts (“Share of subsystem classified genes”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002527-g006">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s007">Figures S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s008">S7</xref> in SI) add up to more than 100%. In addition to the putative mRNA-tags, subsystem annotation of two metagenome datasets was also carried out using the same methodology. The first of these contains genomic sequences from a sample collected previously from the same site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Treusch1">[19]</xref> and the second from farm soil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Tringe1">[7]</xref> (see for details <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s018">Table S8</xref> in SI). For each subsystem, the relative population was calculated, i.e. the putative genes assigned to a particular subsystem divided by the total number of genes assigned to subsystems. In addition to manual comparison of relative populations between the samples putative mRNA-tag dataset and genomic sequence from the same site, these datasets were compared statistically using the method described in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-RodriguezBrito1">[43]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002527.s019">Table S9</xref> in SI). In order to rule out that the difference in abundance was not an artifact caused by the shorter length of the putative mRNA-tags, compared to the longer genomic reads obtained using Sanger sequencing, the genomic reads from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Treusch1">[19]</xref> were fragmented to a number of shorter reads and re-analysed using the MG-RAST server. From each genomic read, seven fragments were randomly generated with a length identical to the average length of the mRNA-tags (98bp), such that the total sequence length was close to that of the un-fragmented sample. The distribution of subsystem categories for the short fragments did not show any deviances larger that 10% compared to the original dataset, for the subsystems or subsystem categories abundant in the mRNA sample (data not shown). This showed that the observed abundance is not an artifact caused by shorter read length of the mRNA-tags. A study where 454 transcripts were functionally categorized and compared to Sanger sequenced ESTs in the plant <italic>Medicago</italic>, also showed that 100bp length is sufficient for meaningful functional classification comparable to traditional ESTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002527-Cheung1">[44]</xref>.</p><p>The putative mRNA-tags were taxonomically binned by analysing the output file of the BLASTX comparison against the NCBI nr protein database with MEGAN.
