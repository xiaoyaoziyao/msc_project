<abstract>
<p>Mutations of the <italic>PTEN-induced putative kinase 1</italic> (<italic>PINK1</italic>) gene are a cause of autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson’s disease. Recent studies have revealed that PINK1 is an essential factor for controlling mitochondrial quality, and that it protects cells from oxidative stresses. Although there has been considerable progress in the elucidation of various aspects of PINK1 protein regulation such as activation, stability and degradation, the transcriptional regulation of <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA under stress conditions remains unclear. In this study, we found that nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), an antioxidant transcription factor, regulates <italic>PINK1</italic> expression under oxidative stress conditions. Damaged mitochondria arising from stress conditions induced NRF2-dependent transcription of the <italic>PINK1</italic> gene through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Either an ROS scavenger or forced expression of KEAP1, a potent inhibitory partner to NRF2, restricted <italic>PINK1</italic> expression induced by activated NRF2. Transcriptionally up-regulated PINK1 diminished oxidative stress-associated cell death. The results indicate that <italic>PINK1</italic> expression is positively regulated by NRF2 and that the NRF2-PINK1 signaling axis is deeply involved in cell survival.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The <italic>PINK1</italic> gene encodes a 581-amino-acid protein that harbors an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence followed by a putative transmembrane region and a serine/threonine kinase domain [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic>PINK1</italic> gene can cause familial Parkinson’s disease [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142438.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PINK1 protects cells against various stresses through activation of Akt via mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142438.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], regulation of Bcl-xL [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142438.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and elimination of damaged mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142438.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. When mitochondria are damaged and lose membrane potential, PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane of depolarized mitochondria. We have shown that PINK1 forms a complex with Sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing 1 (SARM1) and Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and this complex is important for the import of PINK1 to the outer membrane and accumulation of PINK1 on depolarized mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Accumulated PINK1 recruits Parkin, a PD-linked E3 ubiquitin ligase, and Parkin can mediate the autophagic elimination of depolarized mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, there has been considerable progress in the elucidation of PINK1 protein regulation, while its transcriptional regulation has been barely explored [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) transcription factor has been reported to control <italic>PINK1</italic> gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, we have found that it is not powerful enough to activate the PINK1 promoter in a line of neuronal cells under oxidative stress conditions, and we therefore aimed to elucidate the complex mechanism of <italic>PINK1</italic> gene expression. By searching the PINK1 promoter, we found the presence of antioxidant responsive elements (ARE), which is the binding sequence of NRF2.</p>
<p>NRF2, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, is a labile protein that is stabilized under an oxidative stress condition and up-regulates cytoprotective genes, such as those for NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (<italic>NQO1</italic>), glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferases (<italic>GST</italic>s), glutamate cysteine ligase (<italic>GCL</italic>), and heme oxygenase 1 (<italic>HO-1</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. NRF2 deficiency largely abolishes the constitutive and/or inducible expression of defense enzyme genes in response to oxidative stress. Loss of expression of NRF2 significantly enhances the susceptibility of mice to various oxidative stress-related pathologies, including chemical carcinogenesis, hyperoxia, hemolytic anemia and neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Under normal or unstressed condition, NRF2 is kept in the cytoplasm and is rapidly degraded by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and Cullin 3 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Under an oxidative stress condition, oxidants and electrophiles oxidize critical cysteine residues in KEAP1 and then NRF2 is released from KEAP1 [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The released NRF2 translocates into the nucleus, forms heterodimers with small Maf proteins, binds to ARE, and activates transcription of target genes [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>PINK1 is necessary for mitochondrial quality control and contributes to mitophagy [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142438.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To maintain an appropriate level of PINK1 in cells, transcription of <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA must be activated. Here, we report that reactive oxygen species (ROS) inactivate KEAP1 and release NRF2 from KEAP1 binding. The released NRF2 activates transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA. In this study, we showed that the NRF2-PINK1 signaling axis has a significant role in cell survival.</p>

To establish stable cell lines expressing the PINK1-promoter-Luciferase cassette, the construct (pGL4.14 [luc2/Hygro]-PINK1 promoter [3060 bp]) described above was transfected to SH-SY-5Y cells. After selection with hygromycin, optimal clones were obtained. To analyze the significance of the ARE sites (TGA- - - -GC, 9 bp; ARE1, -2632 to -2624 bp; ARE2, -1742 to -1734 bp; ARE3, -660 to -652 bp; ARE4, -235 to -227 bp) in the PINK1 promoter, the sequence was mutated to TAG- - - -CG.

<title>Transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>PINK1</italic> under oxidative stress conditions</title>
<p>To examine the effect of oxidative stress on expression of <italic>PINK1</italic>, a reporter assay was carried out using the PINK1 promoter (3 kbp)-luciferase-reporter construct (PINK1 pro-luc). We used human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells for this assay because the cells are often used as <italic>in vitro</italic> models to analyze neuronal function and Parkinson’s disease. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with PINK1 pro-luc for 24 h and then treated with a neurotoxic reagent, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA); a metal-stress inducer, CdCl<sub>2</sub>; an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory complex I, rotenone; and an ROS inducer, paraquat for 48 h. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0142438.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A–1D</xref>, these reagents increased the luciferase activity of PINK1 pro-luc in a dose-dependent manner. We next examined effects of the reagents on expression of endogenous <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA at regular time intervals. These reagents increased <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA levels at 12–48 h (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E–1H</xref>).

<title>NRF2-mediated induction of <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA</title>
<p>We next attempted to identify a possible target transcription factor(s) that up-regulates <italic>PINK1</italic> expression. FOXO3a has been reported to control <italic>PINK1</italic> expression [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; however, forced expression of FOXO3a did not show any increase in luciferase activity of the delivered PINK1 pro-luc in this experimental setting (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). This prompted us to further search for a functional sequence(s) of the PINK1 promoter. Sequence analysis showed the existence of putative four antioxidant responsive elements (ARE) in the PINK1 promoter. These ARE candidates (ARE1, -2632 to -2624 bp; ARE2, -1742 to -1734 bp; ARE3, -660 to -652 bp; ARE4, -235 to -227 bp) were matched to the general consensus sequence (TGA-—-—GC), which is the binding site of NRF2. PINK1 pro-luc was used to determine whether the expression of PINK1 is dependent on NRF2. As a result, we found that aberrant overexpression of wild-type NRF2 (NRF2-WT) greatly increased the luciferase activity (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). The promoter activity induced by NRF2 was approximately 20-fold higher than that induced by FOXO3a. NRF2-mediated increase in activation of the PINK1 promoter was also observed in different cell lines (<xref rid="pone.0142438.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). In different cell lines such as HCT-15 and HCT116, FOXO3a also increased the luciferase activity. Based on the homology of cross-species orthologues, NRF2 has been divided into six domains, Neh1 to Neh6 [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and Neh4 and Neh5 are transcription activation domains [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. When a deletion mutant of NRF2 lacking the Neh4 and Neh5 domains (NRF2-Mut) was used to assess NRF2 function as a transcriptional regulator for the PINK1 promoter, NRF2-Mut showed only slight activity compared to that of the WT counterpart (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). We also confirmed that <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA level was increased by overexpression of NRF2-WT but not by overexpression of NRF2-Mut (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). To determine whether lack of ARE sites for NRF2 binding decreases the promoter activity, the PINK1 promoter with mutation of the ARE sites (ARE1~4) were newly constructed. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0142438.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>, promoter activity of all mutant constructs was decreased compared with WT-promoter even when NRF2-WT was overexpressed. Mutation of ARE1 reduced the promoter activity with the highest level. By mutating all ARE sites (ARE1~4), the promoter activity was completely diminished (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). To examine physical binding of NRF2 to the ARE sites, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was employed. With the DNA probes matched to the ARE sites (ARE1~4) in the PINK1 promoter, we found that all ARE probes was able to form complex with proteins in nuclear extracts of SH-SY5Y cells (<xref rid="pone.0142438.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). The shifted bands were of the NRF2, because supershifted bands were detected by the NRF2 antibody. We also tried to detect intranuclear binding of NRF2 to the ARE sites in the PINK1 promoter. By ChIP analysis, we found that overexpression of NRF2-WT increased the binding of NRF2 to the ARE sites in cells (<xref rid="pone.0142438.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>). These results indicate that NRF2 transcriptionally up-regulates <italic>PINK1</italic> expression via binding to the ARE sites of the PINK1 promoter.</p>

<title>Involvement of ROS in the NRF2-PINK1 signaling axis</title>
<p>We next used <italic>tert</italic>-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a strong inducer of NRF2 [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], to examine whether endogenous NRF2 regulates <italic>PINK1</italic> expression. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0142438.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, tBHQ increased the luciferase activity of PINK1 pro-luc in a dose-dependent manner. Real-time PCR analysis showed that tBHQ increased <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA levels from 6 h to 48 h (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Almost the same results were obtained using stable cell lines expressing PINK1 pro-luc (<xref rid="pone.0142438.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). Induction of <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA by tBHQ was also confirmed in mature neurons derived from human iPS cells (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). To evaluate whether the induction of <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA by tBHQ depends on NRF2 activity, we employed three types of siRNAs against NRF2. The siRNAs used were all confirmed to have suppressive effects on NRF2 expression in both mRNA and protein levels (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Using the validated NRF2 siRNAs, we found that the tBHQ-induced <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA level was reduced to almost the basal level (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). In protein level, PINK1 is constitutively degraded by PARL, a mitochondrial proteinase, under normal conditions, while PINK1 escapes from PARL-processing and accumulates on mitochondria under mitochondrial depolarized conditions [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To examine possible linking between mRNA and protein levels of PINK1, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with tBHQ and CCCP, a strong inducer of mitochondrial depolarization (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). Single tBHQ-treatment caused slight increase in PINK1 protein. Single CCCP-treatment induced strong accumulation of PINK1 protein by depolarization of mitochondria. tBHQ + CCCP supplied much higher level of PINK1 protein than that supplied by single CCCP-treatment (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). These results indicate that NRF2-derived <italic>PINK1</italic> mRNA expression is important to regulate the cellular PINK1 level.</p>

<p>We also examined other NRF2 inducers for <italic>PINK1</italic> expression. NRF2 inducers including sulforaphane [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], caffeine [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and curcumin [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] induced increased activity of the PINK1 promoter (<xref rid="pone.0142438.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Since these chemical substances including tBHQ are known to inactivate KEAP1, a negative regulator of NRF2, through oxidative stress-mediated ROS production in mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we further investigated an event triggering activation of NRF2 and subsequent <italic>PINK1</italic> induction. Forced expression of aberrant KEAP1 efficiently suppressed the luciferase activity of PINK1 pro-luc induced by tBHQ (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Treatment of the cells with tBHQ increased production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, one of the ROS, and the anti-oxidant <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine (NAC) quenched the produced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). This NAC treatment effectively suppressed tBHQ-induced PINK1 expression (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Interestingly, in other cases of stimulation with oxidative stress inducers, 6-OHDA and CdCl<sub>2</sub>, the chemical-enhanced production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and PINK1 was greatly suppressed by pretreatment with NAC (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B, 4D and 4E</xref>). These results suggest that ROS production in damaged mitochondria is a critical step for activation of NRF2, which is caused by ROS-mediated inactivation of KEAP1, eventually leading to the transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>PINK1</italic>.</p>

<title>Cytoprotective function of PINK1 induced by NRF2</title>
<p>We finally examined the physiological significance(s) of PINK1 induced by NRF2 in cells. To study the cytoprotective function of the NRF2-PINK1 axis against oxidative stress-stimulated cell death, NRF2 was down-regulated using three types of siRNAs in SH-SY5Y cells. Knockdown of NRF2 markedly reduced the ratio of cell survival with 6-OHDA treatment (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>).

We then examined the involvement of PINK1 in this cytoprotective machinery. We used pDNAs expressing the wild type of PINK1 (PINK1-WT) or kinase-dead type of PINK1 (PINK1-KD) for an experiment on rescue of NRF2-knockdown. Over-expression of PINK1-WT, but not that of PINK1-KD, partially rescued the reduction of cell survival under the NRF2-knockdown condition (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that NRF2 functions as a critical transcriptional up-regulator of the <italic>PINK1</italic> gene in response to various stresses. <italic>PINK1</italic> transcriptionally up-regulated by NRF2 has a protective effect on mitochondria, giving cells an advantage for cell survival.</p>
<p>Based on the results of differential gene expression analysis of metastatic cancer cells, we previously showed that the expression levels of <italic>PINK1</italic> were much higher in cancer cell lines with higher metastatic potential than in cancer cell lines with lower metastatic potential [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. NRF2 expression level also positively correlates with tumor grade. A high expression level of NRF2 stimulates metastatic potential and enhances survival of cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142438.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The present findings regarding the functional link between NRF2 and PINK1, therefore, may also be relevant to cancer progression.</p>
<p>The induction rate of <italic>PINK1</italic> expression by NRF2 differed depending on the cell line (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0142438.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). It has been reported that NRF2 forms heterodimers with small Maf proteins (MafF, MafG, and MafK), binds to ARE, and activates transcription of target genes [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The different expression patterns of small Maf proteins may affect NRF2-derived <italic>PINK1</italic> expression, since we found a very large individual variation in the expression of Maf proteins in different cell lines (data not shown). This possible link warrants further investigations. Mei <italic>et al</italic>. reported that FOXO3a regulates <italic>PINK1</italic> expression in T-lymphocytes upon growth factor/serum deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; however, the level of <italic>PINK1</italic> expression induced by FOXO3a in SH-SY5Y cells was much lower than that induced by NRF2. We confirmed up-regulation of <italic>PINK1</italic> expression using tBHQ, an NRF2 inducer, in SH-SY5Y and human matured neurons. These results suggest that <italic>PINK1</italic> transcription is differentially regulated in various cell lineages in which NRF2 has a significant role in <italic>PINK1</italic> transcription, especially in neuronal cells under stress conditions.</p>
<p>NRF2 is an antioxidant transcription factor that positively regulates basal and inducible expression of a large number of cytoprotective genes. When cells are in a non-stressed basal state, NRF2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by KEAP1 through binding between NRF2 and KEAP1. Under an oxidative stress condition, oxidants and electrophiles oxidize cysteine residues in KEAP1, leading to release of NRF2, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and induce the expression of its target genes. Indeed, we found that NRF2 functions as a novel transcriptional regulator of the <italic>PINK1</italic> gene via activation of the ARE sequence in the PINK1 promoter. This NRF2-PINK1 signaling axis plays a significant role in cell survival, because induction of oxidative stress-stimulated cell death in NRF2-down-regulated cells was rescued by over-expression of PINK1 (<xref rid="pone.0142438.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). In addition, PINK1 is involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis through various mechanisms such as removal of damaged mitochondria and reduction of ROS. It is hence reasonable to assume that NRF2, an antioxidant transcription factor, actually regulates <italic>PINK1</italic> gene expression. Komatsu <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the selective autophagy substrate p62 activates NRF2 through inactivation of KEAP1 [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This mitophagy-related pathway may help us to understand how the NRF2-PINK1 pathway is controlled in mitochondrial homeostasis.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PD. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an increase in ROS production, which is closely linked to neuronal cell death. Therefore, it is important to remove dysfunctional mitochondria and then to synthesize fresh mitochondria for appropriate maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. For the renewal of mitochondria, the <italic>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)</italic> gene is important. PGC-1α is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142438.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We found that this gene also contains the ARE sequence of the NRF2-binding site in its promoter region. It is hence possible that NRF2 in turn regulates mitochondrial biogenesis through up-regulation of PGC-1α under stress conditions. This pathway may compensate the lack of mitochondria after mitophagy associated with the NRF2-PINK1 signaling axis.</p>
<p>The above-described molecular pathways to activate NRF2 may not function properly in PD, resulting in insufficient prevention of the progression of neurodegeneration. Thus, NRF2 and the NRF2-triggerd signaling axis could be targets for PD therapy. In fact, modulation of NRF2 has been studied as a therapeutic approach in PD. Treatment with Naringenin, a natural flavonoid compound that causes a dramatic increase in the protein level of NRF2, was shown to have a strong protective effect against 6-OHDA-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similarly, other chemical compounds that induced high levels of NRF2 were also reported to protect against neuronal damage in a neurotoxin-induced PD model [<xref rid="pone.0142438.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142438.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, NRF2 has become a potential therapeutic target to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration, and the NRF2-PINK1 pathway is also expected to be an emerging target to counteract mitochondrial dysfunction and its consequences in PD.</p>
