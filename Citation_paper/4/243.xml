        <p>Autophagy-dependent mitochondrial turnover in response to cellular stress is necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis. However, the mechanisms that govern the selective targeting of damaged mitochondria are poorly understood. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been shown to be essential for the selective clearance of damaged mitochondria. Parkin is expressed in the heart, yet its function has not been investigated in the context of cardioprotection. We previously reported that autophagy is required for cardioprotection by ischemic preconditioning (IPC). In the present study, we used simulated ischemia (sI) in vitro and IPC of hearts to investigate the role of Parkin in mediating cardioprotection ex vivo and in vivo. In HL-1 cells, sI induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria and mitochondrial elimination. IPC induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts and in vivo in mice subjected to regional IPC. Mitochondrial depolarization with an uncoupling agent similarly induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria in cells and Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. Mitochondrial loss was blunted in Atg5-deficient cells, revealing the requirement for autophagy in mitochondrial elimination. Consistent with previous reports indicating a role for p62/SQSTM1 in mitophagy, we found that depletion of p62 attenuated mitophagy and exacerbated cell death in HL-1 cardiomyocytes subjected to sI. While wild type mice showed p62 translocation to mitochondria and an increase in ubiquitination, Parkin knockout mice exhibited attenuated IPC-induced p62 translocation to the mitochondria. Importantly, ablation of Parkin in mice abolished the cardioprotective effects of IPC. These results reveal for the first time the crucial role of Parkin and mitophagy in cardioprotection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cellular homeostasis depends upon adequate protein and organelle quality control. Cells have evolved selective clearance mechanisms to eliminate misfolded and aggregated proteins or dysfunctional organelles. Molecular chaperones in the heat shock family of proteins facilitate the refolding of misfolded proteins. Unrepaired misfolded proteins are ultimately targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Willis1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Goldberg1">[2]</xref>. Elimination of larger dysfunctional complexes, aggregated proteins or organelles such as mitochondria is accomplished via autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Goldberg1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Geisler1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Mizushima1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-VivesBauza1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is great interest in determining how autophagy can selectively recognize and remove damaged mitochondria. Several groups have shown that in neuronal cells, Parkin is involved in the selective targeting and degradation of damaged mitochondria through autophagy (mitophagy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-VivesBauza1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Matsuda1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Narendra1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Narendra2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-VivesBauza2">[9]</xref>. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>) stabilizes mitochondrial outer membrane-associated protein PINK1, a kinase that signals Parkin recruitment to the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-VivesBauza1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Matsuda1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Narendra1">[7]</xref>. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase found in the liver, kidneys, testis, brain, skeletal muscle, and heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Kitada1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Kitada2">[11]</xref>. Under basal conditions, Parkin is mainly found in the cytosol where its ubiquitin ligase activity is inhibited by an unknown mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Matsuda1">[6]</xref>. However, under physiologic and pathologic stress, Parkin translocates to damaged mitochondria in a PINK1-dependent manner to ubiquitinate mitochondrial proteins such as VDAC1, Mfn1, Mfn2 and other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Geisler1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Gegg1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Poole1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Ziviani1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, p62/SQSTM1/sequestosome-1 (referred to as p62 hereafter) has been shown to bind ubiquitinated mitochondria through its ubiquitin binding domain, and to recruit the phagophore (cup-shaped early stage autophagosome) through an LC3 binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Bjorkoy1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Donaldson1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Pankiv1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Seibenhener1">[18]</xref>. Ablation of p62 has been shown to attenuate the degradation of mitochondria compromised by chemical uncouplers that dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential, revealing its role in mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Geisler1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Ding1">[19]</xref>, although this is controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Narendra3">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Okatsu1">[21]</xref>. We previously reported that ischemic preconditioning in isolated rat hearts mediates cardioprotection against I/R injury through an autophagy-dependent pathway involving p62 recruitment to mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Huang1">[22]</xref>. IPC has been shown to involve opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Hausenloy1">[23]</xref>, and we have demonstrated a role for the permeability transition pore in mediating mitophagy in starved HL-1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Carreira1">[24]</xref>. For these reasons, we sought to determine if Parkin plays a role in IPC-induced cardioprotection. Here we demonstrate that Parkin mediates cardioprotection through p62 and mitophagy.</p>

        <p>Parkin (<italic>Park2</italic>) gene knockout mice (Parkin<sup>−/−</sup>) and control C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Coronary occlusion was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Huang2">[27]</xref>. Briefly, 10–12 week old <italic>Parkin</italic> knockout and control mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of ketamine (10 mg/kg) and xylazine (1 mg/kg). Isoflurane anesthesia was used throughout the procedure. Pressure-controlled ventilation (Harvard Apparatus) was maintained at a rate of 140 bpm and a pressure of 9 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. To induce IPC, a PE-10 tube was placed on the surface of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) which was ligated together with an 8-0 silk suture for 3 minutes followed by 3 minutes reperfusion for 3 cycles. For biochemical studies, hearts were excised immediately after IPC and put in cold PBS. Risk area of infarction was dissected out and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sham-operated mice had a suture placed around the LAD that was not tightened for the length of the procedure. For infarct size determination, hearts were subjected to 20 minutes ischemia with or without IPC. The suture was released but left in position, and after verifying adequate reperfusion, the chest was closed and the mice were allowed to recover for 22 hr. Sham-operated mice were handled in parallel. After 22 hr, mice were anesthetized, the chest re-opened, and the hearts were injected with 1% Evans Blue and then harvested. Transverse 1 mm thick slices of the ventricles were stained in 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma).</p>

        <p>Our previous work demonstrated a role for autophagy in the cardioprotection afforded by ischemic preconditioning (IPC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Huang4">[29]</xref>. Mitochondria are one target of autophagy, and a number of groups have shown that Parkin is important for mitophagy in neuronal tissues.

        <title>Parkin and p62 mediate mitophagy in response to ischemic stress</title>
        <p>Mitochondria are a frequent target of autophagy. To determine the effects of simulated ischemia on mitochondrial loss, mitochondrial content was compared in HL-1 cells treated with siRNA to downregulate p62/SQSTM1 or a control siRNA. Simulated ischemia resulted in substantial mitochondrial loss which was attenuated when p62 was downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020975-g007"><bold>Fig. 7A and B</bold></xref>). HL-1 cells were transfected with mCherry-Parkin and subjected to simulated ischemia for 15–45 min. The percentage of cells showing mitochondrial depletion increased with the duration of simulated ischemia and was much more pronounced in the mCherry-Parkin-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020975-g007"><bold>Fig. 7C–F</bold></xref>). However, mitophagy was not simply an artifact of overexpression of mCherry-Parkin, as mitochondrial content per cell also diminished in non-transfected cells subjected to simulated ischemia. To determine if the disappearance of mitochondria was a consequence of mitochondrial outer membrane degradation, we repeated the experiments using an antibody to COX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020975-g007"><bold>Fig. 7E and F</bold></xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Parkin has been shown to play a central role in mitochondrial quality control in the brain, but its role in heart has not been examined to date, although both organs consist of long-lived cells with a high mitochondrial content. Because we have previously shown a role for autophagy in cardioprotection by IPC, we considered whether mitochondria were an important target of autophagy; in particular, we considered whether Parkin might play an important role in mitophagy in the setting of IPC. The results presented herein reveal an important role for Parkin and p62 in mediating mitophagy in response to ischemic stress in HL-1 cells, and in mediating IPC-dependent cardioprotection in vivo.</p>
      <p>Studies dating back to the 1970s have described the occurrence of mitochondria in autophagosomes in heart tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Decker1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Sybers1">[36]</xref>. More recently, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore has been implicated in signaling autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Elmore1">[37]</xref>, but the mechanism by which cardiac mitochondria might be targeted for selective removal has not been elucidated. We have shown that HL-1 cells undergo cyclophilin D-dependent mitophagy in response to starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Carreira1">[24]</xref>, but this is the first study to examine the processes mediating mitophagy in response to ischemic stress in the heart.</p>
      <p>Why would removal of mitochondria be beneficial? Selective removal of the mitochondria with the lowest threshold for opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) would leave behind a population of robust mitochondria better-equipped to resist ischemic stress. Since depolarized mitochondria will hydrolyze ATP in a futile effort to restore membrane potential, elimination of these mitochondria would actually result in increased ATP content after I/R despite the reduced numbers of mitochondria. Selective removal of damaged mitochondria might also reduce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although we did not measure ROS production in this study, we previously reported that sulfaphenazole attenuates ROS production and protects the heart via autophagy, and that stimulation of autophagy attenuates ROS production by HL-1 cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Huang5">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Yuan1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The limitations of this study are that we have not measured PINK1, the mitochondrial outer membrane kinase that is stabilized as membrane potential decreases, nor have we measured mitochondrial membrane potential concurrently with Parkin or p62 translocation. We saw a consistent reduction in both mitochondrial antigens in Parkin-transfected cells. Although the magnitude of reduction was greater for Tom70 than COX4, the immunostaining for COX4 was done on a different set of cells, non-concurrently. Further work will be needed to determine if outer membrane and inner membrane antigens disappear concurrently—consistent with organellar destruction—or if outer membrane proteins are selectively degraded as suggested by Chan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Chan1">[40]</xref>. We expect that mitophagy is selective and self-limited since the process is restricted to depolarized mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Kim1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Kim2">[42]</xref>. Global depolarization of mitochondria with an uncoupler such as FCCP is known to trigger generalized mitophagy and extensive loss of mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Narendra4">[43]</xref>. Cells that eliminate mitochondria will need to replace them in order to fully restore ATP production capacity. Thus it will be important to assess mitochondrial biogenesis in future studies. Since biogenesis likely counterbalances mitophagy, it will be important to develop better methods to measure mitochondrial turnover in vivo.</p>
      <p>The evidence presented in this study indicates that Parkin triggers mitophagy and mediates cytoprotection in HL-1 cells subjected to ischemic stress. These findings, coupled with the fact that IPC is abolished in Parkin knockout mice, lead us to conclude that Parkin mediates IPC through ubiquitination of mitochondrial membrane proteins and recruitment of p62 to facilitate autophagic engulfment of the decorated mitochondria.</p>
      <p>The autophagic removal of depolarized mitochondria mediated by Parkin and p62 may represent an important element of mitochondrial quality control. Loss-of-function mutations of Parkin are linked to some cases of Parkinson Disease and are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Bueler1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Dodson1">[45]</xref>. While the role of Parkin in the heart is as yet unknown, it is interesting to note that the incidence of heart failure and coronary artery disease is doubled in elderly patients with Parkinson Disease compared to age-matched peers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020975-Zesiewicz1">[46]</xref>.</p>
