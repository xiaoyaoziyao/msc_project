<abstract>
<p>Loss of Parkin, encoded by <italic>PARK2</italic> gene, is a major cause of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease. In Drosophila and mammalian cell models Parkin has been shown in to play a role in various processes essential to maintenance of mitochondrial quality, including mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis and degradation. However, the relevance of altered mitochondrial quality control mechanisms to neuronal survival <italic>in vivo</italic> is still under debate. We addressed this issue in the brain of <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice using an integrated mitochondrial evaluation, including analysis of respiration by polarography or by fluorescence, respiratory complexes activity by spectrophotometric assays, mitochondrial membrane potential by rhodamine 123 fluorescence, mitochondrial DNA content by real time PCR, and oxidative stress by total glutathione measurement, proteasome activity, <italic>SOD2</italic> expression and proteins oxidative damage. Respiration rates were lowered in <italic>PARK2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> brain with high resolution but not standard respirometry. This defect was specific to the striatum, where it was prominent in neurons but less severe in astrocytes. It was present in primary embryonic cells and did not worsen <italic>in vivo</italic> from 9 to 24 months of age. It was not associated with any respiratory complex defect, including complex I. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential in <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice was similar to that of wild-type mice but showed increased sensitivity to uncoupling with ageing in striatum. The presence of oxidative stress was suggested in the striatum by increased mitochondrial glutathione content and oxidative adducts but normal proteasome activity showed efficient compensation. <italic>SOD2</italic> expression was increased only in the striatum of <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice at 24 months of age. Altogether our results show a tissue-specific mitochondrial defect, present early in life of <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, mildly affecting respiration, without prominent impact on mitochondrial membrane potential, whose underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated, as complex I defect and prominent oxidative damage were ruled out.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been thought to play a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Parkinsonian syndromes are induced in humans and animals by complex I inhibitors, such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or rotenone, and complex I activity has been reported to be reduced in different tissues from patients, suggesting that this defect may contribute to neuronal degeneration in PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Schapira1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Mann1">[2]</xref>. Mitochondrial dysfunction has also been suggested to contribute to oxidative damage and apoptosis in idiopathic PD brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Hauser1">[3]</xref>. Identification of genetic causes of familial PD reinforced a central role for mitochondria in PD pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Cardoso1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Corti1">[5]</xref>. Indeed most autosomal recessive forms were found to be caused by the alteration of a gene encoding a protein localized to mitochondria, either in particular contexts, as in the case of Parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Darios1">[6]</xref> and DJ-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-CanetAviles1">[7]</xref>, or constitutively for PINK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Valente1">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, studies in various models and from many independent laboratories have provided evidence for interaction between the <italic>PARK2</italic> and <italic>PINK1</italic> genes and their protein products in a common pathway centered on maintenance of mitochondrial quality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Corti2">[9]</xref>. In cell models Parkin and PINK1 regulate the elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria through mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Narendra1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Matsuda1">[15]</xref>. Parkin and PINK1 have also been involved in mitochondrial fission and fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Yang1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Deng1">[18]</xref>, mitochondrial transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Wang1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Liu1">[20]</xref>, and mitochondrial biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Shin1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Pacelli1">[22]</xref>, processes that are also relevant to mitochondrial quality. Consistent with these findings, <italic>PARK2</italic> or <italic>PINK1</italic> inactivation have been reproducibly linked with partial mitochondrial depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Exner1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Mortiboys1">[25]</xref>, reduced respiration rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Pacelli1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Gandhi1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Morais1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Zhang1">[27]</xref> and/or reduction in the enzymatic activity of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Gandhi1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Muftuoglu1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of the PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitochondrial quality control mechanisms for neuronal cells has recently been questioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Sterky1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-VanLaar1">[32]</xref>. In addition, PINK1- or Parkin-deficient mouse models have less consistently shown mitochondrial defects than cellular models, possibly due to differences in the ages and tissues examined and in the methodologies used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Morais1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Gautier1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Stichel1">[37]</xref>. Several groups, including ours, have generated Parkin-deficient mice and shown that, in general, they do not present with overt signs of neuronal degeneration in the nigrostriatal pathway, even at high ages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Goldberg1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Fournier1">[42]</xref>. In some cases, including our model, moderate alterations in dopamine handling evocative of presymptomatic changes have been reported in the striatum, such as increased extracellular dopamine content, enhanced dopamine metabolism via monoamine oxidase and decreased motor activation following amphetamine-induced dopamine-release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Goldberg1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Itier1">[39]</xref>. Therefore, despite the lack of manifest parkinsonian phenotype, these mice may be valuable for investigation of early disease-related modifications and compensatory mechanisms. To clarify discrepancies in the literature regarding the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in these models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Palacino1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Stichel1">[37]</xref>, we have investigated mitochondrial functions, including respiration, respiratory complexes activity and inner membrane potential, in mice carrying a germline homozygous deletion of <italic>PARK2</italic> exon 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Itier1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>To address potential technical biases underlying the literature discrepancies, we analyzed respiration in different mitochondrial and tissue preparations, including crude mitochondrial pellets from striatum and cortex, purified mitochondria from whole brain, and post-nuclear supernatants from midbrain and striatum; we also examined primary embryonic neurons and astrocytes from striatum or cortex. We provide evidence for tissue- and cell-type-specific reduction of mitochondrial respiratory capacity in <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. These defects were observed in the absence of overt oxidative damage, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential or defective enzymatic activities of the respiratory chain complexes, thus leaving open their underlying mechanisms.</p>

<title>Generation of experimental groups</title>
<p><italic>PARK2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were generated and brought into the C56Bl/6j genetic background as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Itier1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Fournier1">[42]</xref>.

After weaning, male and female mice were separated and maintained at a maximum of five littermates per cage, with food and water ad libitum, and at constant temperature (20°C+/−2°C) with a 08:00–18:00 light cycle. The experiments were performed on female mice (n = 42 per genotype) as follows, with n corresponding to the number of animals per genotype, 24-month-old mice were used for respiration analyses on crude mitochondrial pellets (n = 8), purified mitochondrial pellets (n = 2) or post-nuclear supernatants (n = 8), and oxidative stress evaluation with glutathione and proteasome studies (n = 5), 9-month-old mice for respiration analyses on post-nuclear supernatants (n = 7), 12-month-old mice for respiratory chain complexes assays (n = 7), and oxidative stress evaluation with glutathione and proteasome studies (n = 5). For all applications, mice were killed by decapitation, without prior anesthesia.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Tissue preparation</title>
<p>After mice decapitation, liver and brain were rapidly removed and the regions of interest dissected on ice. All samples were manually homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer with a Teflon pestle. The scheme depicting the different tissue preparations and their use is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0099898.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p>
<p><underline>Crude mitochondrial pellets from the striatum or cortex</underline> were obtained by homogenization in 9 volumes of Buffer A (50 mM Tris HCl, 5 mM Glucose, 1 mM Pyruvate, 1 mM EGTA, 150 mM KCl, pH 7.5). Centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 g gave post-nuclear supernatant. The nuclei and tissue particles in the pellet was subjected to a second identical cycle of homogenization and centrifugation. The two post-nuclear supernatants were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g to obtain the crude mitochondrial pellet that was diluted in 120 and 240 µl of Buffer A for striatal and cortical mitochondria respectively. These suspensions were used for respiration and protein assay. Between 5 and 10 µg mitochondrial proteins were used per run of respiration.</p>
<p><underline>Purified brain mitochondria</underline> were obtained by homogenization of a whole brain in 1 mL Mannitol-Sucrose (MS) isolation medium (225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mg/mL fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (FAF-BSA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Chinopoulos1">[43]</xref>. The homogenate volume was brought to 1.5 ml. The supernatant of a first centrifugation during 6 min at 500 g was centrifuged during 10 min at 14 000 g to obtain the crude mitochondrial pellet that was diluted in 200 µl of 12% Percoll solution in MS buffer, layered on top of a discontinuous Percoll gradient (200 µl of 12% Percoll on top of 1 mL of 24% Percoll in MS buffer), and centrifuged during 18 min at 17 000 g. The resulting mitochondrial pellet was washed twice with MS buffer with centrifugation during 7 min at 17 000 g the first time and during 5 min at 14 000 g the second time. The last purified mitochondrial pellet was diluted in 100 µl MS buffer and used for respiration (5 µg of mitochondrial proteins per run) and protein assays.</p>
<p><underline>Liver, ventral midbrain and striatal post-nuclear supernatants</underline> were obtained by homogenization in 9 volumes of 300 mM sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, followed by centrifugation during 10 minutes at 1000 g. The post-nuclear supernatants were directly used for respiration and protein assays, as well as for the analysis of inner mitochondrial membrane potential. Each run of respiration assay used 300 µg of protein of post-nuclear supernatant from midbrain or striatum and 1 mg from liver.</p>
<p><underline>Primary striatal or cortical neurons</underline> were prepared at embryonic day 16 by a method adapted from Friedman et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Friedman1">[44]</xref>. In summary, following centrifugation through a BSA cushion, primary neurons were seeded onto poly-ornithine and laminin coated Seahorse 24-well plates (175,000 cells/well for striatal neurons and 140,000 cells/well for cortical neurons) and cultured for 7 days at 37°C, 5% CO2 in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1 mM glutamax.</p>
<p><underline>Astrocytes</underline> were isolated from striatum or cortex of newborn mice as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Morganti1">[45]</xref> and cultured in poly L-lysine coated tissue culture flasks (75 cm2) for 7 days. Astrocytes were then trypsinized, plated in Seahorse 24-well plates (40,000 cells/well) and cultured for another 4 days at 37°C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and1% penicillin streptomycin.</p>

<title>Respiration assays</title>
<p>For mitochondrial preparations or post-nuclear supernatants, the rate of oxygen consumption was measured in a Clark-type electrode. Mitochondrial pellets were analyzed by classical respirometry using Hansatech electrode (Cambridge, UK). The respiration medium was 100 mM KMES, 5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 3 mM EDTA, 0.4% w/v FAF-BSA, pH 7.4 for crude mitochondrial pellets. It was 125 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM HEPES, 200 µM EGTA, 0.2% w/v FAF-BSA, pH 7.4 for purified mitochondria. Post-nuclear supernatants were analyzed by high resolution respirometry with an Oroboros apparatus (Innsbruck, Austria) using 100 mM KCl, 40 mM sucrose, 10 mM TES, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.4% w/v FAF-BSA, pH = 7.2 as respiration medium.</p>
<p>Common recorded parameters were the respiration rate in the presence of 10 mM glutamate, 5 mM malate and 1 mM ADP, in the presence of 1 µg/mL oligomycin, a complex V inhibitor, and in the presence of 1 mM KCN ( = non-respiratory oxygen consumption). These parameters allowed the calculation of state 3 respiration = respiration in the presence of substrates+ADP - non-respiratory oxygen consumption, state 4 respiration = respiration in the presence of oligomycin - non-respiratory oxygen consumption, and respiratory control ratio = state 3/state 4, evaluating the efficiency of the oxidative phosphorylation coupling. Two additional parameters were recorded with Oroboros electrode: basal respiration (in the presence of substrates before ADP addition) and maximal respiration rate (maximal rate obtained by progressive additions of 1.25 µM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (cccp), a protonophore dissipating the inner membrane potential, performed after the step with addition of oligomycin). These additional parameters were used to calculate the respiratory reserve = maximal respiration - basal respiration.</p>
<p>For primary neurons and astrocytes, respiration was analyzed in a XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) in the presence of 25 mM glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Wu1">[46]</xref>. Subsequent steps included complex V inhibition by oligomycin, inner membrane potential dissipation by tri-fluorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (fccp), and respiration inhibition by rotenone and antimycin, complex I and complex III inhibitors respectively. For each cell type, preliminary experiments determined the concentration of these agents to optimally inhibit or stimulate respiration without inducing toxicity (as mentioned in the figure legend). To measure the relative cell density and viability in each well after respiration measurements, cells were incubated during 20 minutes with 2 µg/ml calcein-AM, a cell-permeant fluorogenic esterase substrate whose fluorescence emission was measured at 532 nm, with excitation set at 650 nm. For astrocytes, calcein global fluorescence was not proportional to cell number seeded, so the non-mitochondrial OCR, which measures non mitochondrial oxidase activity, was used to control for cell density equivalence. Cells from wild type and <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were seeded in different wells of the same plate and only experiments with similar cell densities were used for analysis. The recorded parameters were initial respiration, state 4 respiration rate (respiration under oligomycin inhibition minus non-respiratory oxygen consumption under rotenone and antimycin) and maximal respiratory rate (respiration under fccp minus non-respiratory oxygen consumption). The initial respiration rate slightly differs from the basal respiration recorded with mitochondrial pellets or post-nuclear supernatants because ADP level cannot be controlled in intact cells. The difference between maximal and initial respiration was thus named spare respiratory capacity instead of respiratory reserve. Coupling efficiency was evaluated by the ratio between initial respiration rate and respiration under oligomycin (both after subtraction of the non-respiratory oxygen consumption).</p>

<title>High resolution respirometry and cell-type specific analysis detect a respiration defect in PARK2<sup>−/−</sup> mice</title>
<p>Reductions in uncoupled respiratory rates have previously been observed in the striatum or the substantia nigra of <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice by two independent groups, with however partial inconsistency with respect to the associated state 3 and state 4 respiration rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Palacino1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Stichel1">[37]</xref>. Both reports relied on the analysis with standard oxygraphy of relatively crude mitochondrial pellets obtained by two successive centrifugation steps.

<p>Considering that mild respiration defects might not be detectable in crude mitochondrial pellets we next prepared whole brain purified mitochondria from 24-month-old mice and found similar state 3 and state 4 respiration as well as respiratory control in <italic>PARK2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099898-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Although mitochondrial enrichment of the preparation was shown by the higher specific respiratory rates as compared to those of crude mitochondrial pellets, the respiratory control ratio of these purified mitochondria was only slightly increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0099898.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Considering the need to use whole brain instead of specific brain region, the improvement of respiratory control ratio did not appear sufficient to pursue that procedure in a higher number of animals.</p>
<p>Furthermore we reasoned that altered mitochondria were likely to be eliminated during mitochondrial purification. That procedure might thus be inappropriate when addressing mitochondrial quality control as is the case in the absence of Parkin. Very low respiration rates such as those observed without mitochondrial enrichment can only be analyzed with high resolution respirometry using Oroboros technology. We therefore optimized this technique for the analysis of post-nuclear supernatants. The relative rapidity of this tissue preparation allowed the parallel study of striatum, midbrain and liver from each mouse. With this method the respiratory control ratios were above 10 in midbrain and striatum, indicating excellent mitochondrial preservation. These ratios were similar between <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and wild type mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0099898.s002">Figure S2</xref>). An example of curve obtained with 300 µg striatum post-nuclear supernatant is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099898-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. 24-month-old <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice showed significant decreased respiratory reserve in striatum when compared to wild type mice (p = 0.028 using Mann and Whitney test).

<p>Using the same approach we then studied younger mice at 9 months of age to address the presence of the respiratory defect earlier in life. <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice presented with a decrease in state 3 respiration rate and respiratory reserve in midbrain and striatum that was similar to the pattern observed in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099898-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As previously observed in aged mice, the decrease was only significant in the striatum (p = 0.05 for state 3 respiration with Mann and Whitney test).</p>
<p>Liver showed a significant age-associated decrease in respiratory reserve capacity in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099898-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast the respiratory capacity in striatum and midbrain post-nuclear supernatants was not modified by age.</p>
<p>Even precisely limited brain regions contain distinct cell populations, which essentially are astrocytes and neurons. These cells present with strikingly different energetic metabolism and thus may develop different responses to the absence of Parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Magistretti1">[53]</xref>. Using Seahorse technology to evaluate the respiration of cultured cells in multi-wells plates, we addressed this question by comparing <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and wild type pure primary embryonic neurons or neonatal astrocytes from striatum or cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099898-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In striatal neurons, the maximal respiration rate and spare respiratory capacity were significantly reduced in the absence of Parkin. In contrast they were similar in <italic>PARK2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and wild type cortical neurons. Astrocytes strikingly differed from neurons with respect to their uncoupled maximal respiration, which was equal or often lower than their initial respiration. As a result, their spare respiratory capacity appeared null or negative. This observation contrasted with previously reported maximal respiration rates in astrocytes that were at least two-fold higher than basal respiration using Seahorse protocols without the step of oligomycin inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Larsen1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-GimenezCassina1">[55]</xref>.

<title>Mitochondrial inner membrane potential of PARK2<sup>−/−</sup> mice was normal but showed greater sensitivity to uncoupling with ageing in the striatum</title>

<p>In both <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and wild type brain ageing had a clear impact on the Δψm response to increasing doses of the uncoupler cccp with a significant drop of the mean Δψm under 8 µM cccp treatment from 9 to 24 months of age in the striatum and midbrain (p = 0.022 and 0.035 in midbrain and p = 0.001 and &lt;0.001 in striatum of <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and wild type mice respectively using Mann and Whitney test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099898-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

The drop of Δψm between condition C (highest value under oligomycin) and condition F or G (uncoupled by either 4 or 8 µM cccp) was then calculated for each mouse.

<p>Post-translational modifications regulating the activity of mitochondrial proteins involved in the import, catabolism or oxidative phosphorylation of respiratory substrates could also underlie the respiration defect observed in <italic>PARK2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.

We therefore searched for evidence of oxidative stress in midbrain and striatum of <italic>PARK2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Ageing however being known to have significant influence on oxidative stress, we analyzed the combined influence of age and genotype on the parameters of oxidative stress using multiple comparison by the Holm-Sidak test. Proteasome activity significantly increased with age in striatum (p&lt;0.001) but not midbrain, without influence of the genotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099898-t002">Table 2</xref>). Similarly the midbrain mitochondrial glutathione content increased with age (p&lt;0.001 when comparing 12-month-old to 24 month-old mice) without influence of the genotype). In contrast, significant interaction between age and genotype was observed for the striatal mitochondrial glutathione content (p = 0.015). Ageing led to a significant increase in striatal mitochondrial glutathione in wild type mice (p&lt;0.001 when comparing 12-month-old to 24 month-old wild type mice) but had no effect in <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. At 12 months of age the striatal mitochondrial glutathione levels were significantly higher in <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice than in wild type mice (p&lt;0.011 when comparing 12-month-old wild type to 12-month-old <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice with Mann and Whitney test).

<p>Altogether, our results show an increase in oxidative stress in the striatum mitochondria of <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (increased glutathione levels, increased oxidative adducts and, with age, increased SOD2 expression). That increase is however moderate (normal SOD2 expression at 12 months of age, normal proteasome activity).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent work, based on the analysis of cell models overproducing Parkin and subjected to pharmacological treatments leading to immediate and global depolarization of the mitochondrial network, attributed to Parkin a central role in the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Narendra3">[12]</xref>. These studies predict that loss of function of the PINK1/Parkin pathway should lead to progressive mitochondrial impairment, possibly representing a primary mechanism of neurodegeneration in autosomal recessive PD. However, whether Parkin-dependent mitochondrial quality control plays indeed a role <italic>in vivo</italic> under physiological conditions and during aging, remains debated.</p>
<p>We addressed this issue by revisiting mitochondrial functions in <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice using recently developed, robust and sensitive technologies. The simultaneous analysis of minimal amounts of post-nuclear supernatants from different tissues with high resolution respirometry revealed a reliable respiratory defect specifically in the striatum of <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, which was not exacerbated by ageing. The presence of this defect was confirmed in primary embryonic striatal neurons and was not found in cortical neurons from <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice using the Seahorse technology, supporting its region-specificity and early appearance in life.</p>
<p>Contrary to previous observations in cell and zebrafish models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Mortiboys1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Grunewald2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Flinn1">[57]</xref>, the constitutive deletion of <italic>PARK2</italic> in mice did not result in significant changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, overt oxidative stress markers or defective activity of mitochondrial complex I or other respiratory chain complexes despite the presence of significant respiratory defect. With ageing however the mitochondrial potential in the striatum showed increased sensitivity to uncoupling, with a greater impact in <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> than in wild type mice, indicating less efficient compensation for an induced proton leak. As this defect cannot be ascribed to an age-dependent decline of respiratory capacity, it may be secondary to an age-dependent alteration of the inner membrane composition or defect in OXPHOS substrate transport or oxidation, all of which could add a burden to the preexisting respiration defect in <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>The relatively mild modifications of mitochondrial function in <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice suggest that Parkin does not play a predominant role in base-line mitochondrial quality control <italic>in vivo</italic>. Its constitutive depletion may be compensated for by parallel, redundant or alternative mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, already proposed to intervene following PINK1 depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Dagda1">[60]</xref>. This possibility is supported by the recent observation in the heart of <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice showing absence of a functional defect of mitochondria in the myocardium under basal conditions but defective clearing of damaged mitochondria following myocardiac infarction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Kubli1">[61]</xref> and accumulation of mitochondria with abnormal ultrastructure in myocytes during aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Kubli2">[62]</xref>. Therefore, as in cardiac tissue, the mitochondrial quality control function of the PINK1/Parkin pathway may become essential in the central nervous system under stress conditions, for example following accumulation of oxidative stress during ageing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Harman1">[63]</xref>. Consistent with this possibility, mitochondrial stress caused by the conditional expression of mitochondrial unfolded ornithine transcarbamylase has been recently shown to lead to dopaminergic neurodegeneration and a parkinsonian phenotype in <italic>PINK1−/−</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Moisoi1">[64]</xref>.</p>
<p>Contrary to humans, the short life-time of rodents may not allow full unmasking of a phenotype following disruption of the PINK1/Parkin pathway, explaining the moderate mitochondrial defect and lack of overt neurodegeneration in <italic>PARK2−/−</italic> mice. Signs of oxidative damage were mild in aged <italic>PARK2−/−</italic> mice. Compensatory mechanisms such as the increase in glutathione levels, specifically in the mitochondrial fraction, may enhance the cellular antioxidant capacity and counteract oxidative stress in these mice. The relative content of reduced and oxidized glutathione should be determined in this fraction to properly evaluate the efficiency of this mechanism. Of note, we previously reported a selective increase in reduced glutathione content in total extracts from striatum and primary mesencephalic neurons of <italic>PARK2−/−</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099898-Itier1">[39]</xref>. The increase of SOD2, often used as a marker of oxidative stress, is also a protective mechanism efficiently neutralizing superoxide anions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our work revealed an early respiration defect in <italic>PARK2−/−</italic> mice that may reflect a disease-relevant preclinical modification in autosomal recessive PD. Future studies are required to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this modification and determine their relation to the mitochondrial quality control activity of the PINK1/Parkin pathway. To fully appreciate the role of PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitochondrial quality control in the physiopathology of autosomal recessive PD, it will also be essential to determine whether stress conditions exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and unmask a neurodegenerative phenotype in the brains of <italic>PARK2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice.</p>
