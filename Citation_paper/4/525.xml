<abstract>
<p>An international effort is underway to establish a representative system of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Southern Ocean to help provide for the long-term conservation of marine biodiversity in the region. Important to this undertaking is knowledge of the distribution of benthic assemblages. Here, our aim is to identify the areas where benthic marine assemblages are likely to differ from each other in the Southern Ocean including near-shore Antarctica. We achieve this by using a hierarchical spatial classification of ecoregions, bathomes and environmental types. Ecoregions are defined according to available data on biogeographic patterns and environmental drivers on dispersal. Bathomes are identified according to depth strata defined by species distributions. Environmental types are uniquely classified according to the geomorphic features found within the bathomes in each ecoregion. We identified 23 ecoregions and nine bathomes. From a set of 28 types of geomorphic features of the seabed, 562 unique environmental types were classified for the Southern Ocean. We applied the environmental types as surrogates of different assemblages of biodiversity to assess the representativeness of existing MPAs. We found that 12 ecoregions are not represented in MPAs and that no ecoregion has their full range of environmental types represented in MPAs. Current MPA planning processes, if implemented, will substantially increase the representation of environmental types particularly within 8 ecoregions. To meet internationally agreed conservation goals, additional MPAs will be needed. To assist with this process, we identified 107 spatially restricted environmental types, which should be considered for inclusion in future MPAs. Detailed supplementary data including a spatial dataset are provided.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The high-latitude Southern Ocean, south of the Polar Front, is globally significant for conservation due to its unique species and environments. The presence of high levels of endemism shows it to be a distinct ‘realm’ within the Earth’s oceans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Griffiths1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Kaiser1">[3]</xref>. The region is remote and has been altered less by human pressures than most other parts of the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Halpern1">[4]</xref>. However, exploitation has occurred across all its major marine ecosystems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Kock1">[5]</xref>. This has prompted the establishment of international agreements, in particular, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to conserve the biodiversity while, among other roles, managing exploitation of marine living resources in the region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Kock1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Constable1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>An international effort is underway to establish a representative system of marine protected areas (MPAs) for the Southern Ocean and CCAMLR has the primary responsibility for developing this system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-SCCAMLR1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-SCCAMLR2">[9]</xref>. CCAMLR aims to complete this task to meet marine protection objectives set by The United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-SCCAMLR1">[8]</xref>. CCAMLR has identified the development of a broad-scale classification of the Southern Ocean and a finer-scale, classification of its biodiversity as necessary to achieve this aim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-SCCAMLR3">[10]</xref>. Our aim is to complement this process by identifying the areas where benthic marine assemblages are likely to differ in near-shore Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. We achieve this by using a hierarchical spatial classification of the benthic environment and assessing the extent to which the existing system of MPAs encompasses the benthic diversity.</p>

<title>Developing a hierarchical classification of the benthic environment in the Southern Ocean</title>
<p>Regional classifications are important to MPA planning and aim to identify biogeographic patterns by spatially subdividing an area, such that assemblage compositions within each subdivision are expected to be homogeneous relative to adjacent regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Spalding1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Harris1">[11]</xref>. Classifications aim to separate different assemblages and, in particular, identify areas within which species that are endemic or have restricted ranges will reside. Importantly, this process also aims to identify ecological separation (poor connectivity) for species common across assemblages. For example, some widespread species show genetic differentiation suggesting that gene flow is restricted between isolated sub-populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Arango1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Hemery1">[15]</xref>. Therefore, at a finer-scale, higher heterogeneity is likely to be present than is often considered in the historical biogeography in the region e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Longhurst1">[16]</xref>. The focus of the classification developed here is to identify possible general patterns of assemblages and of more restricted benthic species and populations at a circumpolar scale.</p>
<p>Physical environmental data can be used as surrogates for biodiversity where biological data are scarce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Delegationsof1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Pressey1">[18]</xref>. Ideally, the process of subdivision would be done largely, if not entirely, on the basis of biological data. However, biological data paucity is prevalent across marine ecosystems globally leading to a necessity to use surrogates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-McArthur1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Huang1">[20]</xref>. On a circum-Antarctic scale, biological data are limited, particularly for the Amundsen Sea, eastern Antarctica, under ice shelves and below 1500 m <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Griffiths2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Gutt1">[23]</xref>. While this paucity of biological data introduces uncertainty into regionalisation or MPA planning processes, environmental data can be used to assess the similarity or differences between regions for the purposes of these planning processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Delegationsof1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Pressey1">[18]</xref>. In fact, additional biological data does not always greatly increase the efficiency of protected area planning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Grantham1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>When utilizing physical environmental data in this way, a classification method should be chosen that enhances the biological relevance of the results, for example by incorporating known relationships between the physical environment and biodiversity. Recent research within the Southern Ocean has primarily focussed on using statistical clustering methods to identify areas with relatively dissimilar attributes, examples include: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Harris1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Grant1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Penhale1">[26]</xref>. This approach has particular utility when synoptic data are available on abiotic factors that are known to be drivers or correlates of biological patterns but few data are available on actual biological patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Clarke1">[27]</xref>. Where the relationships between the distribution of benthos and abiotic factors can be reasonably inferred, they can be manually incorporated to delineate regions rather than relying on an unsupervised classification e.g. clustering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Harris1">[11]</xref>. For instance, the continental shelf usually supports distinct species assemblages when compared to the deeper ocean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Brandt1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Kaiser2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Koubbi1">[29]</xref>; this has also been observed on seamounts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Brandt2">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, the utility of biogeographical classifications to MPA planning is improved by a hierarchical (nested) classification, which shows the subdivision at increasingly finer scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Spalding1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Huang1">[20]</xref>. This approach was used by Spalding et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Spalding1">[2]</xref> and Last et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Last1">[31]</xref> to identify distinct regions based on taxonomic composition and the degree to which separation might occur as a result of patterns of dispersal, life histories of taxa, and isolation.</p>
<p>While a circumpolar classification of the pelagic environment has been completed and adopted by CCAMLR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Grant1">[25]</xref>, no equivalent, accepted benthic bioregionalisation currently exists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Penhale1">[26]</xref>, although there are sufficient data to develop one. Databases of molluscs, bryozoans and zooplankton are being compiled and analysed, albeit they are limited in their geographic extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Griffiths1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Linse1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Barnes1">[35]</xref>. The SCAR-MarBIN database is improving data availability at a circumpolar scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Danis1">[36]</xref>. The relationships between depth, geomorphology and species distributions have been investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Kaiser2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Brandt3">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Koubbi2">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, the connectivity between populations has been explored using genetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Hoffman1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Daz1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-GonzlezWevar1">[41]</xref>. The Biogeographic Atlas of the Southern Ocean, when published, will contribute to bringing together much of this research (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.atlas.biodiversity.aq" xlink:type="simple">www.atlas.biodiversity.aq</ext-link>). However at the time of writing, no synthesis of this recent research exists for the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>Here we present a circumpolar hierarchical classification of the benthic environment based on Last et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Last1">[31]</xref> and intended for general use in spatial planning and management. The classification includes the identification of ecoregions, bathomes and environmental types, the latter of which are based on geomorphic features. Similar to the Delegations of Australia and France, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Delegationsof1">[17]</xref>, ecoregions were delineated by accounting for recent biogeographic research, patterns of endemism and the influence of environmental drivers as potential barriers to dispersal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100551-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Environmental types represent the lowest order in the hierarchy and we used these to assess the representativeness of currently designated MPAs. We also identified environmental types which have restricted distributions and are probable locations for the focus of future MPA design.</p>

<title>The framework used to classify ecosystems within the Southern Ocean.</title>
<p>Ecoregions were defined on the basis of important environmental drivers and their potential to prevent dispersal. Biogeographic patterns identified in the literature were also incorporated. A hierarchical approach was then applied within each ecoregion, nesting the two main habitat types (geomorphic features within bathomes) to identify environmental types.</p>

<title>Environmental drivers</title>
<p>Environmental drivers are the physico-chemical processes and other factors that set the habitat conditions and influence the distribution and abundance of taxa, including their connectivity between similar habitats. Reduced connectivity can give rise to divergent evolution of similar taxa. Two major environmental drivers are depth and geomorphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Kaiser2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Koubbi1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Beaman1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Barry1">[44]</xref>. Other important drivers include seabed temperature, icebergs and sea ice coverage, sea-surface productivity and ocean currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Hall1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Gutt3">[48]</xref>.</p>
<sec id="s1b1">
<title>Depth</title>
<p>The Southern Ocean contains a smaller proportion of depth-restricted species than other oceans, probably due to the presence of a deeper shelf, deep-water formation (Antarctic Bottom Water), lack of thermocline and the intermittent glaciations of the shelf, creating less difference between environments on the shelf and the deep sea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Brey1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Clarke3">[51]</xref>. Wide depth ranges in Antarctic species have been typically associated with survival in deep-sea refuges e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Brey1">[49]</xref>. That is, sub-populations of eurybathic shelf species may have endured past glaciations on the slope or deeper, which could have then served as a potential source for shelf (re-) colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Kaiser2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Brey1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Brandt4">[52]</xref>. Thatje et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Thatje1">[50]</xref> suggested, that life on the Antarctic continental slope during the last glacial maximum may have been extremely difficult due to turbidity currents cascading down the slope. Sedimentation processes would not have occurred everywhere though, and were probably more pronounced along canyons compared to adjacent flanks and plateaus leaving some scope for slope fauna to survive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Kaiser2">[28]</xref>. Limited depth distributions of shelf species, on the other hand, could serve as evidence for survival through glaciations in ice-free refuges on the continental shelf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Barnes2">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>Many benthic species do have restricted depth ranges and depth-related factors can be strong barriers to dispersal of benthic species [37,38,54,55,56 and see ‘Barriers to dispersal’ section]. For instance, the octopus genus <italic>Paraledone,</italic> the echinoid genus <italic>Sterechinus</italic>, the ostracod genus <italic>Macroscapha</italic> and the amphipod genus <italic>Eurythenes</italic> show niche separation by depth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Daz1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Allcock1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Havermans1">[59]</xref>. This depth partitioning gives rise to different assemblage structures in different depths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Barry2">[60]</xref>, the ranges of which can be characterized as bathomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Last1">[31]</xref>. Furthermore, molecular studies show widely distributed species often represent species complexes, with each individual species having a much more restricted range size. For example, isopods: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Held1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Held2">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Leese1">[62]</xref>; crinoids: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Wilson1">[13]</xref>; and ophiuroids: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Hunter1">[55]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s1b2">
<title>Geomorphic features</title>
<p>Geomorphic features are a classification of the seabed based on its surface morphology, and have been shown to be significant for delineating benthic habitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Harris2">[63]</xref>. The features used here are meso-scale habitat features related to the sedimentary habitat along with the near-bottom conditions of the ocean environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Last1">[31]</xref>. Major habitat characteristics include the availability of hard-rock surfaces and the erosion or deposition of sediment along with their physical attributes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Beaman1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-OBrien1">[64]</xref>. For example, Antarctic shelf depressions eroded during glacial maxima now have low currents and fine sediments, providing appropriate habitats for mobile deposit feeder and infaunal communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Gutt2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-OBrien1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Post2">[65]</xref>. The species rich coral-sponge communities found within some shelf-cutting canyons are postulated to be due to an abundance of food contained in channelled water sourced from productive shelf regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Post1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Schlacher1">[66]</xref>. Elsewhere, canyons are shown to alter current flow causing upwelling and mixing which are attributed to enhanced local biological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Harris3">[67]</xref>.

<title>Barriers to dispersal</title>
<p>The geographic distribution of a species and genetic connectivity between subpopulations is linked to the ability of individuals to disperse away from their parents. This ability will be constrained by dispersal barriers including the distance between suitable habitats, geomorphic barriers and steep environmental clines. Long-distance dispersal in benthic organisms is confined to passive oceanic transport of adults or via turbidites (i.e. rafting), and transport during pelagic larval stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Bradbury1">[92]</xref>.</p>
<p>Habitats may support different species assemblages where the distance between suitable habitats is greater than the distance over which a species can disperse. While the dispersal distances for most species in the Southern Ocean are unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Potthoff1">[93]</xref>, it is likely that the dispersal range for many brooding species will be restricted; brooding species protect and feed their offspring without a pelagic larval stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Thatje1">[50]</xref>. Within the Southern Ocean, benthic communities have more species with either lecithotrophic (non-feeding) larval development or brooding than species with planktotrophic (feeding) larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Thatje1">[50]</xref>. While the strong, circumpolar currents of the Southern Ocean may assist the dispersal of some species with pelagic larval stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Thornhill1">[94]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Matschiner1">[95]</xref>, predation, parasitism and starvation will constrain the probability of moving great distances, especially for lecithotrophic larvae which have a limited food source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Thornhill1">[94]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Cowen1">[96]</xref>.

<p>Geomorphic barriers, steep ecoclines and ocean currents can also cause ecological and genetic differentiation. For example, differences in seabed temperature across relatively short distances can cause genetic differentiation within a species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Arango1">[12]</xref>. Similarly, genetic variation can occur through the inhibition of adult migration by geomorphic features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Shaw1">[97]</xref>.

We also identify those environmental types that have distributions restricted by geographic area and location. The environmental types within these restricted locations are not necessarily more important than others ecologically.

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Broad spatial boundaries, termed benthic ecoregions, were identified according to the primary environmental drivers and dispersal barriers that drive the distribution of Southern Ocean benthic biodiversity. Within these ecoregions, biodiversity patterns are further driven by finer-scale spatial processes. Therefore, we applied a hierarchical framework based on Last et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Last1">[31]</xref> to identify each environmental type. Bathomes (broad-scale depth classes) were nested within ecoregions, and geomorphic features were nested within bathomes. Each environmental type is therefore a unique combination of geomorphic feature, bathome and ecoregion. The nesting of geomorphic features within bathomes avoids the potential for false within-class homogeneity that can arise if such features are not modified by depth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Williams1">[115]</xref>. The analysis was performed using both manual and automated processing within a geographic information system and is further described in the following six sections. Further detail of the analysis is provided as supplementary information including ecoregion boundary descriptions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100551.s002">Text S1</xref>), the spatial coverage of each level of the classification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100551.s001">Table S1</xref>) and a description of the methods used to generate geomorphic features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100551.s003">Text S2</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Benthic ecoregions</title>
<p>The primary environmental drivers used to identify benthic ecoregions were depth, geomorphology, seabed temperature, sea ice concentration and chlorophyll-a as a proxy for productivity. The three major types of barriers to dispersal we used were; 1) the distance between potential habitat types (i.e. bathomes and geomorphic features); 2) large geomorphic barriers and; 3) presence of steep ecoclines in temperature, ice or productivity. The influence of both frontal and seabed currents were considered as either dispersal barriers or assisting connectivity between habitats (as further described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100551.s002">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>We initially delineated the distinct environments of the continental shelf and slope from the deeper ocean and then applied bathomes based on depth-species relationship studies to further account for the depth structuring of benthic assemblages. The 4000 m bathymetric contour was the most appropriate to generally separate the geomorphic features associated with the shelf and slope of the Antarctic continent from the geomorphic features associated with the abyssal ocean. Exceptions to this contour included parts of the East Indian Abyssal, Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, Kerguelen and Pacific Basin ecoregions which were adjusted to better capture geomorphology. Where the structural slope of the Oates ecoregion extends past the 4000 m contour in the Indian Ocean sector, the boundary of the structural slope was used in preference to the 4000 m contour. The boundary between the Kerguelen ecoregion and the Antarctic continent was defined by the southern limit of the contourite drift (i.e. a geomorphic feature), the slope of the broader Kerguelen Plateau (i.e. including Banzare and Elan Banks) and the canyon at 77.5<sup>o</sup>E, 61.5<sup>o</sup>S. Similar to Spalding et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Spalding1">[2]</xref> we included the seamounts and the seamount chain near to 120<sup>o</sup>W within the Amundsen ecoregion.</p>
<p>Where possible, previously defined ecoregions were reviewed and incorporated especially: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Griffiths1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Spalding1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Delegationsof1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Grant1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Linse1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Clarke2">[33]</xref>. These studies have focussed primarily on the Antarctic continental shelf and slope where more data are available. The previously defined boundaries were upheld if the ecoregion contained levels of endemism greater than 10% as reported by Linse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Linse1">[32]</xref> or Griffiths et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Griffiths1">[1]</xref>. In each case, these boundaries were adjusted to better reflect the distribution of bathomes and geomorphic features. For instance, geomorphic features can act as barriers to dispersal for some benthic species leading to genetic distinctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Shaw1">[97]</xref>. Therefore, if deemed more appropriate, features such as canyons were used to replace the previously defined boundaries. Also, where a previously defined boundary divided a feature such as a canyon, it was redrawn to capture the entire feature. Within the deeper ocean, ecoregion boundaries were defined by considering the effect of structuring agents on patterns of biodiversity.</p>
<p>For areas without previously defined ecoregions, we initially identified where areas of similar habitat types (predominantly bathomes and geomorphic features) were separated by more than 200 km. This distance is based on the general global maximum of 200 km for dispersal distance across multiple marine species even where uncertainly is accounted for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Palumbi1">[116]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Halpern2">[117]</xref>. Spatial separation is assumed to increase the likelihood of areas of the same habitat type supporting genetically dissimilar species due to isolation and therefore contributes to the separation of ecoregions. All data layers were then used to corroborate or refute the validity of these regions defined by the separation of similar types of areas by the minimum distance. For instance, where large geomorphic barriers, including ridges, could contribute to separating areas of deeper habitats this would be seen as an ecoregion boundary between these two areas of habitat. Similarly, rapid changes in seabed temperature, sea ice, persistent productivity and ocean currents were also considered as signifying potential barriers to dispersal or where an ecoregion boundary could be most meaningful ecologically.</p>

<title>Geomorphic features</title>
<p>We identified geomorphic features based on O’Brien et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-OBrien1">[64]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100551-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100551-t003">Table 3</xref>). This dataset, however, did not cover all areas within the study region due to the absence of data in areas of persistent ice cover. All areas not covered were located on the Antarctic continental shelf and we classified them as ‘Shelf’. We also modified some features. ‘Fracture zone cliffs’ and ‘Canyon axes’ had been mapped as lines by O’Brien et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-OBrien1">[64]</xref>. We converted ‘Fracture zone cliffs’ to areas through interpretation of the bathymetry contours with contours located close together considered part of the cliff. ‘Canyon axes’ were converted to areas by applying a 5 km buffer around the axes to capture both the canyon and its surrounding zone of influence. We deemed a 5 km buffer to be the most appropriate distance to ensure connectivity within dendritic canyon systems and discontinuity between single channelled canyon systems. The geomorphic features classified by O’Brien et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-OBrien1">[64]</xref> as ‘Wave affected banks’ are identical to their ‘Shelf banks’, but at depths of less than 200 m. This depth modification of geomorphology is captured by our nested hierarchical analysis and therefore these features were combined and renamed ‘Banks’. The ‘Coastal terrane’ of South Georgia Island was reclassed as ‘Island coastal terrane’ to be consistent with other island areas. The Antarctic ice shelf including areas under floating ice tongues termed ‘ice shelf cavities’ were excluded.</p>

<title>Nesting data layers</title>
<p>Bathomes were nested within ecoregions, and geomorphic features were nested within bathomes to identify environmental types except for the following seven geomorphic features. Four geomorphic features ‘Shelf’, ‘Cliff’, ‘Coastal terrane’ and ‘Island coastal terrane’ were not further modified by depth. Seamounts and Seamount ridges were classed by only their shallowest bathome. Canyons were classed by whether they commenced on the shelf or slope. The environmental types were reviewed to minimise the potential for false heterogeneity. Environmental types with a very small area or restricted distribution were checked and dissolved into the surrounding environmental type if deemed invalid. For example, small patches of shallow rugose ocean floor within the South Atlantic ecoregion initially appeared as a restricted or rare environmental type. Upon review, this environmental type was found to be a processing artefact caused by the presence of adjacent seamounts. It was therefore eliminated by reclassing it as the most appropriate surrounding environmental type.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b5">
<title>Representation of MPAs</title>
<p>We condensed the geomorphic features into four broad classes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100551-t003">Table 3</xref>). The distributions of existing MPAs and environmental types were overlaid. For each geomorphic class within each ecoregion that contains an existing MPA, we calculated; 1) the proportion of area within an MPA and, 2) the proportion of the number of environmental types with at least part of their area within an MPA. The total number of environmental types and seafloor area of each geomorphic class was also calculated.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b6">
<title>Restricted environmental types</title>
<p>We specifically identified those environmental types which had a restricted spatial distribution. We assumed environmental types to have restricted distribution if they were either small in number (3 or less) or are predominantly limited to a particular discrete location without replication within an ecoregion. Since our focus was identifying areas where additional MPAs are required to fill large gaps in representation, restricted environments were not identified within regions where proposed MPAs have been identified through fine-scale MPA planning processes. Therefore, the region east of 30<sup>o</sup>E to 150<sup>o</sup>W and south of 60<sup>o</sup>S was excluded from the restricted environments analysis. Instead, the proposed MPAs within these regions were compiled and incorporated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Delegationsof1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-NZand1">[106]</xref>.</p>

<title>The benthic ecoregions, restricted environments and marine protected areas identified within the Southern Ocean.</title>
<p>An environmental type is a unique combination of an ecoregion, bathome and geomorphic feature. Existing marine protected areas and regions where planning processes are underway to propose future representation, were identified. Where large gaps in existing and proposed representation were found, the locations of geographically restricted environmental types were identified. These restricted environments indicate areas of potential future marine protected area selection since there are limited spatial options for protecting the biodiversity for which these environments are a surrogate.</p>

<p>The ecoregion boundaries reflect many of the broad patterns of the underlying data used for the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100551-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Generally, ecoregion boundaries most closely resemble depth, geomorphology and seabed temperature with productivity and ice cover tending to contain stronger within ecoregion variation (e.g. around polynyas or persistent productivity hotspots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100551-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The Southern Ocean is dominated by deeper environments with over 85% of the seabed deeper than 2000 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100551-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). This is also reflected in the geomorphology where over 75% of the Southern Ocean is made up of three geomorphic types, Rugose Ocean Floor, Abyssal Plain and Lower Slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100551-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The Atlantic basin, the largest ecoregion, is dominated by depths greater than 4500 m.</p>
<p>Within the deeper environments of the Southern Ocean, the primary drivers of the classification were the distribution of rare and mostly isolated shallow habitats often associated with seamounts, seamount ridges, plateaus and islands. Also important was the presence of mid-ocean ridges and large plateaus that separate deeper habitats. On the shelf and slope, where survey effort is higher, biological data on species distributions (in the form of previous biogeographical research) were the key drivers. Therefore, our results broadly reflect that of Spalding et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Spalding1">[2]</xref>, the Delegations of Australia and France, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Delegationsof1">[17]</xref> and Clarke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Clarke2">[33]</xref> with some boundaries adjusted to more closely reflect the distribution of bathomes and geomorphic features.</p>
<p>In contrast to most other recent benthic classifications in the region examples include: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Spalding1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Delegationsof1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Linse1">[32]</xref>, the results of this study encompass the deeper environments of the Southern Ocean as well as the continental shelf and islands. While the Global Oceans and Deep Seabed (GOODS) biogeographic classification provides a global scale classification, the only previous benthic classification to include these deeper environments at a circum-Antarctic scale was exploratory and incomplete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Penhale1">[26]</xref>. This exploratory classification identified 20 regions using the statistical relationships between three physical datasets of depth, slope and seabed temperature. The classification presented here incorporates known or inferred relationships between the benthic biology and the physical environment and their influence on barriers to dispersal. The seamount classification provided by Clark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Clark1">[120]</xref> provides a biologically meaningful classification of seamounts and we also consider two of the four criteria used (i.e. summit depth and seamount proximity). However, the Clark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Clark1">[120]</xref> classification incorporates seamounts i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Kitchingman1">[121]</xref> identified using a technique we found to overestimate the number of seamounts and therefore preferred the hand drawn seamounts identified by O’Brien et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-OBrien1">[64]</xref>. For the continental shelf and islands, this work provides a physical underpinning and whole of Southern Ocean context for the patterns in biodiversity found by Clarke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Clarke2">[33]</xref>, the Delegations of Australia and France, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Delegationsof1">[17]</xref> and Spalding et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Spalding1">[2]</xref>. In addition to the identification of the regions themselves, we also offer a classification of the seabed habitats contained within each ecoregion.</p>
<p>Environmental types were mostly identified by nesting together ecoregions, bathomes and geomorphic features to avoid the potential for false within-class homogeneity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Williams1">[115]</xref>. However, there were some exceptions. To add utility to MPA planning, we reflect the variety of three geomorphic features by classifying seamounts and seamount ridges by only their shallowest bathome and canyons by whether they commence on the shelf or slope. When an MPA is placed to protect the benthos of integral physical features (e.g. those likely to contain vulnerable marine ecosystems) that have a high level of connectivity among the habitats they contain, such as seamounts, seamount ridges or canyons, the feature should be included as a whole and therefore the internal bathome changes become less relevant to spatial MPA planning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-UQEC1">[122]</xref>. The coastal terrane of some islands and the Antarctic continent represent areas adjacent to rugged coastlines with highly irregular depth structuring which could not be fully resolved with the depth data used and were therefore not further classed by bathomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-OBrien1">[64]</xref>. Future MPA planning within regions where finer-scale bathymetry is available should further class these environmental types by the bathomes they contain and could be guided by the framework we provide. A level 2 nesting (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100551-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) provides a broader spatial management unit. For instance, a level 2b nesting of geomorphic features within ecoregions identifies 210 types. However, caution should be used when not further nesting geomorphic features within bathomes (i.e. level 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100551-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) since this can result in false within-class homogeneity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Williams1">[115]</xref>. Some environmental types are described within the ‘restricted environmental types’ section below.</p>
<p>According to the advice of the Science Committee to CCAMLR, we treat the benthic and pelagic environments separately <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Penhale1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-SCCAMLR4">[123]</xref>. The assumption is that these environments are decoupled due to the extreme depths and complex topography and oceanography of the Southern Ocean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Smith1">[75]</xref>. However, there is increasing evidence of interaction, and coupling may be favoured by intense seasonality and quick and efficient cycling through the pelagic food web <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Gili1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Smith1">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Grebmeier1">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Suhr1">[91]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-SchnackSchiel1">[124]</xref>. We partially account for this interaction by considering sea surface productivity, the duration of ice cover and frontal systems within the analysis.</p>
<p>The classification we provide aims to capture the larger scale patterns by incorporating a combination of physical and biological data and also taking into consideration probable barriers to dispersal. As new data become available they can be used to refine the classification. Increasing knowledge, especially of cryptic species (i.e. species that are morphologically similar but differ genetically) seems most likely to lead to adjustment of the boundaries and the identification of further within-region heterogeneity, and not to a fundamentally different view of the distribution of habitats. Biogeographic classifications aim to identify general patterns within complex and diverse systems and therefore false heterogeneity for some species is inevitable. However, for the purposes of MPA planning, incorporating the general geographic and depth distribution patterns will increase the chance of representing the range of species habitat requirements within the final MPA system. The ecoregions and the environmental types can be used to consider the representativeness of biodiversity in a system of MPAs across the whole of the Southern Ocean.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Assessment of Representativeness</title>
<p>We found the level of existing representation for each environmental type across geomorphic classes is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100551-g004">figure 4</xref>). None of the 23 ecoregions contains a system of MPAs that is representative of the benthic biodiversity they contain, with 12 ecoregions having no MPAs. Of the remaining 11 ecoregions, none includes a system of MPAs that sample each of the environmental types present in the ecoregion. The three ecoregions which perform the best are 1) Del Cano where South Africa declared the Prince Edward Islands MPA in 2012, 2) the South Orkney Islands, where CCAMLR established its first entirely high seas MPA in 2009 and 3) the Kerguelen Plateau where Australia and France have established MPAs. For some geomorphic classes, the number of environmental types in MPAs especially within the Ross Sea, Oates, Deep Kerguelen and Antarctic Peninsula ecoregions, is greater than 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100551-g004">figure 4</xref>). However, the area of seabed in MPAs for these geomorphic classes is less than 1% suggesting that only a small portion of each environmental type is represented in MPAs.</p>

<p>We have provided an assessment of progress toward a representative system of MPAs. The primary aim of the analysis described here is to identify important gaps in the protected area system, particularly related to ecoregions and environmental types. We have not identified how the biodiversity within a region needs to be adequately included in MPAs in order to achieve viability of the protected biodiversity; requirements will vary between different ecoregions and environmental types.</p>
<p>There are a number of existing conservation planning processes directed towards resolving some of these gaps in the existing system of MPAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100551-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), including Eastern Antarctica <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Delegationsof1">[17]</xref> and the Ross Sea for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-NZand1">[106]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Ainley1">[125]</xref>. These proposals will help fill the gaps for achieving a Southern Ocean system of MPAs. Analyses such as the one we present here could be used to help assess progress towards a representative system of MPAs covering each of the ecoregions and which areas may be most suitable for filling gaps. An accounting procedure to help assess the adequacy of MPAs would improve future assessments.</p>
<sec id="s3b1">
<title>Restricted environmental types</title>
<p>In this study we contribute to Southern Ocean MPA planning processes by identifying environmental types with a restricted spatial distribution and within ecoregions largely lacking any existing or proposed representation in MPAs. We identify 107 restricted environmental types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100551-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The distribution of restricted environments is driven by rare environmental units that arise when a component of the hierarchical classification is scarce. The island arc, a geomorphic feature within the Southern Sandwich Islands ecoregion, is the only habitat of its kind in the Southern Ocean. Therefore the ecosystems associated with the particular environments created where a ridge of volcanic islands is formed adjacent to a subduction zone can only be protected in this location. Other restricted environments arise from an uncommon combination of geomorphic features and bathomes. There are many seamounts within the Pacific basin ecoregion however there are only two, the Belgica Guyot and the Lecointe Guyot, that have very shallow mounts of less than 200 m depth. Furthermore, there are only five discrete locations within the CCAMLR region where these shallow seamount environmental types occur.</p>
<p>Maud Rise is another example of a biologically important region containing restricted environmental types. At Maud Rise, oceanography, sediment characteristics and sea ice processes have been linked to high biodiversity throughout all trophic levels from pelagic predators to benthic species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Brandt2">[30]</xref>. Maud Rise is an underwater plateau and slope region with two associated seamounts within the Atlantic Basin ecoregion. Four of the six environmental types of Maud Rise are restricted. These include: 1) the only seamount in the ecoregion with a mount in the –1500 to –2000 m bathome; 2) the only seamount ridge within the ecoregion with a mount in the –1000 to –1500 m bathome and; 3) the only plateau in the ecoregion with two environmental types resulting from plateau areas within the –2000 to –3000 m bathome and –3000 to –4500 m bathome. The Maud Rise seamount is suspected to contribute to the most recurring open-ocean polynya in the Southern Ocean which forms over Maud Rise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Brandt2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Martin1">[126]</xref>. These polynyas drive convection which influences interaction between surface productivity, the benthos and the upwelling of nutrients all of which may contribute to the rich and prospering food web in the region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Brandt2">[30]</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The international effort overseen by CCAMLR to establish a representative network of MPAs within the Southern Ocean has already made a significant step in declaring the world’s first MPA within the high seas located outside national jurisdiction. The efforts to achieve the conservation commitments made by CCAMLR and parties to the Antarctic Treaty sets a precedent for conservation within other high seas regions of the global ocean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100551-Christiansen1">[101]</xref>. However the current levels of representation clearly contain significant gaps that future conservation planning efforts need to address. The environmental types presented here are an improvement on previous statistical classifications because, rather than opting for a method that identifies statistically dissimilar areas within the data, we have identified environmental types using known and probable relationships between biogeographic patterns, environmental drivers, and knowledge of dispersal of benthic taxa. The classification of environmental types allows the gaps in the MPA network to be quantified. It also provides a new circum-Antarctic map of environmental types that can be used to support spatial management aimed at conserving benthic biodiversity across the entire Southern Ocean.</p>
