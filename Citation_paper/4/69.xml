<abstract>
<p>Kidins220/ARMS is a transmembrane protein playing a crucial role in neuronal and cardiovascular development. Kidins220/ARMS is a downstream target of neurotrophin receptors and interacts with several signalling and trafficking factors. Through computational modelling, we found two potential sites for alternative splicing of Kidins220/ARMS. The first is located between exon 24 and exon 29, while the second site replaces exon 32 by a short alternative terminal exon 33. Here we describe the conserved occurrence of several Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms at RNA and protein levels. Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms display spatio-temporal regulation during development with distinct patterns in different neuronal populations. Neurotrophin receptor stimulation in cortical and hippocampal neurons and neuroendocrine cells induces specific Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms and alters the appearance kinetics of the full-length transcript. Remarkably, alternative terminal exon splicing generates Kidins220/ARMS variants with distinct cellular localisation: Kidins220/ARMS containing exon 32 is targeted to the plasma membrane and neurite tips, whereas Kidins220/ARMS without exon 33 mainly clusters the full-length protein in a perinuclear intracellular compartment in PC12 cells and primary neurons, leading to a change in neurotrophin receptor expression. Overall, this study demonstrates the existence of novel Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms with unique properties, revealing additional complexity in the functional regulation of neurotrophin receptors, and potentially other signalling pathways involved in neuronal and cardiovascular development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of a fertilised egg into an adult organism requires massive changes in gene expression in a relatively short amount of time. To overcome these challenges, many genes undergo alternative pre-mRNA splicing to regulate gene expression and to generate spatio-temporally encoded protein isoforms with different functions. Up to two thirds of human genes are estimated to undergo alternative splicing throughout development, and impairments of certain splicing events have been linked to genetic diseases [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For example, the specific expression patterns of alternative splice isoforms of GPR56 play a role in folding and shaping of gyri in mammalian forebrains, while an in frame 15 bp deletion mutation in GPR56 leads to the selective bilateral disruption of the Sylvian fissure [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
<p>During embryogenesis, the development of many tissues, including the nervous and cardiovascular systems, relies on the correct distribution of growth factors and their receptors, which is finely tuned by alternative splicing at the level of their mRNA or interacting partners [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129944.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Members of the neurotrophin (NT) family and their receptors tropomyosin receptor kinases TrkA, TrkB, TrkC and p75<sup>NTR</sup> are major players in the development of the nervous system. Upon ligand binding, Trk receptors promote neuronal growth and survival, whereas p75<sup>NTR</sup> modulates NT signalling via its heterodimerisation with Trk receptors [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, p75<sup>NTR</sup> binds to pro-neurotrophins to initiate separate signalling cascades that antagonise the effects of NT, indicating that the balance between pro- and mature NT plays a critical role in fine-tuning the signalling output of these growth factors [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Alternative splicing provides an additional layer of regulation to these events. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a TrkB ligand, undergoes alternative splicing [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129944.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which finely regulates mRNA localisation and as result its expression at distinct locations in axon and dendrites [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129944.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, mRNA levels of specific splice variants of BDNF have been found to be altered in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. TrkB itself has various splice isoforms, which have been shown to differentially regulate TrkB signalling [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Interestingly, the expression of a truncated Trk splice variant is specifically enhanced by amyloid beta (Aß) and may function as a compensatory response in AD neurons to promote cell survival [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A similar compensatory mechanism is likely to occur in motor neurons in which the intracellular sorting and trafficking of TrkB receptors is impaired by down-regulation of the dynein adaptor BICD1 [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to the nervous system, NTs and their receptors are essential factors in the formation of the heart and critical regulators of vascular development. NTs modulate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, operating in close synergy with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its receptors (VEGFRs) and co-receptor neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although nervous and cardiovascular systems were considered to undergo independent developmental programs, recent evidence suggests that tight links exist between them. However, a precise understanding of the mechanisms enabling functional crosstalk between these tissues remains speculative [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Kinase D Interacting Substrate of 220 kDa (Kidins220), also known as Ankyrin-repeat Rich Membrane Spanning protein (ARMS), has been proposed as a signalling/trafficking mediator between these systems [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Indeed, mice lacking Kidins220 display striking developmental abnormalities in heart, vasculature and nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129944.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Kidins220 binds to Trk receptors via its fourth transmembrane domain [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and to p75<sup>NTR</sup> at the endmost 250 carboxy-terminal residues. Kidins220 has been demonstrated to form a ternary complex with Trk receptors and p75<sup>NTR</sup>, altering the affinity of nerve growth factor (NGF) for TrkA [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Stimulation with NGF or BDNF induces the phosphorylation of Kidins220, suggesting that Kidins220 may be a direct substrate for these receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Based on these findings, it was suggested that Kidins220 might be involved in fine-tuning the affinity of NT for their receptors [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Interestingly, NT receptors are not the only receptor tyrosine kinases that interact with Kidins220. In fact, Kidins220 has been shown to bind to VEGFR-2 and 3 [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and its genetic ablation in mice generates vascular phenotypes closely resembling those observed in Nrp1 knockout animals [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129944.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These findings lead to the hypothesis that Kidins220 plays a crucial role in modulating the crosstalk between different signalling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
<p>The carboxy-terminal region of Kidins220 hosts a kinesin-interacting motif (KIM), which binds to kinesin light chain 1 and 2, and recruit the kinesin-1 motor complex. Kidins220 mutants lacking a functional KIM domain display impaired neurite transport in PC12 cells and deficits in NT signalling and neurite differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Kidins220 might therefore link signalling receptors to motor proteins and regulate the intracellular trafficking of receptor complexes to their target destinations [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, a further connection to the intracellular trafficking machinery has been identified. The carboxy-terminal region of Kidins220 and in particular its PDZ binding motif interacts with SNX27, a member of the sorting nexin family [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. SNX27 is a cargo specific adaptor of the retromer complex [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which regulates multiple cargo-sorting events within the endosomal network. Knockdown of SNX27 causes a strong decrease in the plasma membrane levels of Kidins220 in HeLa cells [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, knockdown of Vps35, which is responsible for cargo recognition within the retromer complex, also decreases the cell surface expression of Kidins220 [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
<p>The p75<sup>NTR</sup> binding site, the KIM domain and the PDZ binding domain are located at the carboxy-terminus of Kidins220 and are all encoded in mouse by exon 32. This work provides the first functional characterisation of the alternative splicing variants of Kidins220, including two alternative terminal exon (ATE) splice forms, which lead to changes of Kidins220’s carboxy-terminus. Using rat PC12 cells, mouse primary neurons, and mouse and human tissue samples, we provide evidence that Kidins220 undergoes a finely-tuned spatio-temporal regulation of splicing in mouse and human tissues, which is likely to be conserved also in other species. Interestingly, the expression of specific Kidins220 splice isoforms is regulated by NT, suggesting the existence of a feedback mechanism linking NT signalling and the expression of scaffolding proteins controlling NT receptor complex assembly and trafficking.</p>

<title>Computational evidence supports alternative splicing of mouse and human Kidins220</title>
<p>Based on previous results suggesting sequence heterogeneity in the central domain of rat Kidins220 [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we investigated whether Kidins220 might undergo alternative splicing in this region, which in turn may support its complex functions in the nervous and cardiovascular systems. To examine the exon-intron structure of mouse (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) and human (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>) Kidins220, we searched the UCSC genome database for Kidins220 cDNA and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). We found evidence of potential alternative splicing between exons 24 and 29 of the Kidins220 sequence. We also found evidence for a possible alternative terminal exon (ATE) splicing of Kidins220 by a splice out of the terminal exon 32 and replacement by a much shorter exon 33. These findings appear to be conserved, since we found alternative splicing sites in mouse, rat and human sequences (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Alternative splice isoforms of Kidins220 lacking exons 24–29 are present in adult mouse and human tissues</title>
<p>To verify the expression of alternative splice isoforms of Kidins220 between exon 24 and 29, we sequenced Kidins220 in mouse (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) and human (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) RNA tissue panels. We extracted RNA from wild type adult mouse tissues and compared them to a commercial RNA panel from a pool of healthy adult human tissues. The RNA from both panels was reverse-transcribed, amplified using specific Kidins220 primers (see <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>) and analysed by standard gel electrophoresis (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). As a control (N) of the quality of our cDNA and Kidins220 expression, we designed primers specific for invariant regions of Kidins220, such as exons 3 and 8 in the case of mouse samples (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) and for exons 9 and 13 for human samples (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To investigate potential alternative splicing patterns, we selected primers specific for exons 24 and 30 for both panels. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, we observed a mouse-specific and a human-specific “default pattern”, which is identical in several tissues. In the mouse tissue panel, we obtained three different bands ranging between 400 and 700 bp (samples B, E-F, H-K, M-Q and S; <xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), whereas the human “default pattern” comprises only a single band migrating between 500 and 600 bp (samples A, B, D-F, I-O and P-U; <xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). However, this pattern differed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle (indicated by arrowheads), both in mouse and human tissues. Additionally, a different splice pattern was detected in mouse testis (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, arrowhead).</p>

<title>Kidins220 undergoes alternative terminal exon splicing in mouse and human tissues</title>
<p>To investigate potential ATE splicing, we analysed cDNA from mouse and human tissues using specific primers. According to our bioinformatics analysis (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129944.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Fig), exon 32 could be potentially spliced out and replaced by a much shorter exon 33. To test this hypothesis, cDNA was amplified using primers designed to recognise mouse (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and human (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) exons 31, 32 and 33.

<p>Strikingly, we found evidence of ATE only in tissues not presenting “default patterns” and therefore where specific splice variants in the region between exons 24 and 29 were detected. Accordingly, we observed ATE in mouse and human brain, heart, skeletal muscle (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129944.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129944.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>) and mouse testis (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Sequencing of the different amplified bands in <xref rid="pone.0129944.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> revealed two different alternative endings: ATE C1, which encodes a small portion of exon 32 (the first 81 bp of exon 32) and exon 33, and ATE C2 which encodes exon 33 only (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Alternative splice variants of Kidins220 are translated into specific proteins in embryonic and adult mouse brain</title>
<p>The pattern of RNA expression (Figs <xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129944.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and the computational analysis (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0129944.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> Figs) suggest that Kidins220 splice variants displays a complex tissue-specific distribution yielding the translation of several proteins of different length and domain composition. To test this hypothesis, we generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against alternative splice isoforms m1, m6 and ATE C2 (see <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). These antibodies were tested for their ability to specifically recognise different Kidins220 splice variants (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). To facilitate this, antibodies m1 and m6 were pre-incubated with vehicle or with an excess of m1 and m6 peptides prior to western blotting using extract from embryonic (E) or adult (A) mouse brain (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). The antibody m1 recognises a single band at 220 kDa in both adult and embryonic extracts, whereas the antibody m6 revealed a band at the same molecular weight only in the embryonic sample.</p>
<p>To test the specificity of the ATE C2 antibody, we opted to use GST-fusion proteins with exon 32 (GST-mEx32; canonical Kidins220) or exon 33 (GST-mEx33; correspondent to ATE C2). As shown in <xref rid="pone.0129944.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>., an antibody directed against ATE C2 detects GST-mEx33, but not GST-mEx32, which is instead recognised by an antibody (GSC16), raised against the carboxy-terminus of full-length Kidins220 [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Importantly, the signals detected by the m1, m6 and ATE C2 antibody are specific, since they are blocked by pre-incubation with the immunising peptides (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We then used these specific antibodies to test for protein expression using embryonic and adult mouse brain lysates (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Splice isoform m1, which contains exon 24 to 30 and corresponds to full-length Kidins220, was mainly expressed in adult brain, as hardly any expression was detected in embryonic tissue. Isoform m6, however, shows an opposite distribution pattern with high expression levels during embryogenesis and an absence in adult brain (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). In contrast, the splice variant ATE C2 was found only in adult brain tissue (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), mimicking the expression pattern seen for splice isoform m1. As an internal control, we used an antibody raised against the amino-terminus of Kidins220 (KNA), which confirmed the higher expression levels of Kidins220 in the nervous system during embryonic development compared to adulthood (N-term; <xref rid="pone.0129944.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129944.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>

<title>Different neuronal populations display specific Kidins220 splice variants</title>
<p>The alternative splice variants of Kidins220 in the nervous system and their developmental regulation begs the question whether distinct neuronal populations differ in terms of their repertoire of Kidins220 isoforms and whether the presence of these variants changes during neuronal differentiation.</p>
<p>To address this point, we prepared primary cortical and hippocampal cultures (from E18.5 embryos) and primary motor neurons (from E13.5 embryos), and extracted RNA from these cells at different days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV). Strikingly, we found isoforms m4 and m6 from DIV 1 to DIV 7 in all neuronal populations (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129944.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0129944.g005" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Cortical and hippocampal neurons show similar Kidins220 expression patterns between exons 24 and 30: from DIV 11 onwards, both populations express isoforms m1 and m3 in addition to isoforms m4 and m6. Motor neurons, however, show the highest variety of Kidins220 splice isoforms in the nervous system, with the expression at DIV 13 of isoform m5 in addition to those previously described for cortical and hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>Also the occurrence of ATE variants differs between the three neuronal populations (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129944.g005" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0129944.g005" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). In cortical neurons, the ATE C2 isoform appears to gradually increase during <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation, whereas the ATE C1 has its strongest expression between DIV 5 and 7 and then decreases to basal levels at DIV 14 (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). Hippocampal neurons show a different pattern: the ATE C2 isoform displays a gradual increase until DIV11, but is absent at DIV 14. In contrast, ATE C1 is constantly present until DIV 14 (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Strikingly, motor neurons appear to lack any significant ATE splicing (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). These differences in the composition and timing of expression of Kidins220 may reflect the distinct requirements of these neuronal populations in terms of neurotrophin signalling for their differentiation and/or survival.</p>

<title>BDNF and NGF modulate Kidins220 alternative splicing</title>
<p>Kidins220 binds to Trk receptors and p75<sup>NTR</sup>, and is a downstream target of Trk activation [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Transfected Kidins220 isoform m6 displays a similar distribution, with areas of extensive colocalisation between exogenous and endogenous Kidins220 at the level of neurite extensions in PC12 cells (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129944.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In HEK cells, we also found colocalisation between endogenous and exogenous Kidins220 isoform m6 (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). In contrast, isoform m6/C2 was found to distribute in intracellular puncta in the cell body in both PC12 and HEK cells, with negligible accumulation in the neurite tips in PC12 cells. Expression of these Kidins220 variants in primary wild type hippocampal neurons yields similar results, with isoform m6 distributed in axon and dendrites, whereas isoform m6/C2 is retained in the soma (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, overexpression of this ATE splice variant alters the distribution of endogenous full-length Kidins220, which could no longer be detected in the neurite tips or at the plasma membrane in both both PC12 and HEK cells (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129944.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Kidins220 ATE C2 leads to increased TrkA expression</title>
<p>Because Kidins220 forms a ternary complex with the TrkA receptor and p75<sup>NTR</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we then investigated whether the overexpression of Kidins220 isoform m6 and m6/C2 (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>) alters the cellular distribution and/or expression levels of TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup>, which are both endogenously expressed in PC12 cells.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="pone.0129944.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>, overexpression of the full-length Kidins220 isoform m6 did not alter TrkA expression levels, which were comparable to those found in untransfected cells. However, overexpression of the short isoform m6/C2 lead to a drastic increase of TrkA expression levels (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>), suggesting a specific role for the long carboxy-terminus of Kidins220 in TrkA homeostasis. Similar results have been obtained using HEK cells stably transfected with TrkA (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). Importantly, this regulation appeared to be specific, since overexpression of either isoforms did not affect p75<sup>NTR</sup> levels (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we describe the characterisation of several alternative splice isoforms of Kidins220, a scaffold protein for NT receptors and VEGFRs. Two major splicing regions have been identified by our work: the first maps to the central portion of Kidins220 encoded by exons 24 to 29, whilst the second results from the alternative terminal exon (ATE) splicing of exon 32 and a previously uncharacterised exon 33. Kidins220 splicing is regulated in space and time, and is highly conserved in mouse and humans. Importantly, these splicing events determine the acquisition (or the loss) of important protein-protein interaction domains, which might cause additional and still poorly understood structural changes. This novel mechanism has therefore the potential to regulate Kidins220 functions in specific tissues during development and adulthood.</p>
<p>We confirmed bioinformatics evidence on the existence of Kidins220 splice variants by showing their presence in different mouse, rat and human cells and tissues at both RNA and protein levels. By investigating the occurrence of Kidins220 RNA in mouse and human tissue panels, we found in addition to a conserved “default pattern” of Kidins220 isoforms, which remains constant in a variety of tissues, alternatively spliced isoforms in brain, heart, skeletal muscle and in mouse testis (Figs <xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129944.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Similar splice isoforms were found also in rat PC12 cells (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). We were able to detect six different splice isoforms in the central region of Kidins220 in mice (m1-6; <xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>) and rat (r1-4, 6,7; <xref rid="pone.0129944.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>), but only three in humans (h1-3; <xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). This is due to the fact that exons 27 and 28 are undetectable in the human genome (data not shown), thus limiting the splicing diversity in humans. We also found that mouse testis had a different splicing pattern to other tissues, whereas human testis did not show any detectable difference. To date, nothing is known about the role of Kidins220 in testis and how this alternative splice isoform pattern could affect the functionality of this organ in mice. In Kidins220<sup>lox/lox</sup> mice, a cDNA-polyA cassette encoding full-length Kidins220 corresponding to isoform m1, was inserted downstream of exon 16 (25). As a result, these animals only express this Kidins220 splice variant. Although Kidins220<sup>lox/lox</sup> females are viable and lack overt behavioural phenotypes (25), Kidins220<sup>lox/lox</sup> males are sterile (data not shown), suggesting that the expression of the Kidins220 m1 isoform is not sufficient for physiological testis function, which requires the correct pool of Kidins220 splice variants (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Kidins220 plays an important role in the development of the nervous and the cardiovascular systems [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129944.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], where it binds to NT and VEGF receptors. It is therefore not surprising to find several Kidins220 variants in heart and brain. While Kidins220 splice isoforms between exon 24 and 29 change during brain development, they remain invariant in heart, with a characteristic isoform pattern (data not shown). We believe that this specific pool of Kidins220 isoforms is required for a fully functional cardiovascular system, since at a more careful phenotypic examination, Kidins220<sup>lox/lox</sup> mice, which only express the Kidins220 m1 spice variant under the endogenous promoter [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129944.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], display heart abnormalities, which include atrial dilation (data not shown).</p>
<p>Whilst potential binding partners for the region encoded by exons 25 to 29 remain unknown, Kidins220 isoform m6/C2 lacks its kinesin binding motif (KIM), its p75<sup>NTR</sup> binding site and its PDZ binding domain. Kidins220 is responsible for neurite outgrowth upon BDNF stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and is found in the neurite tips of differentiating PC12 cells [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To reach neurite tips, Kidins220 relies on its KIM domain to bind kinesin 1 via the kinesin light chain (KLC1/2). This microtubule-dependent motor mediates the transport of Kidins220 to the microtubule plus end, which is located distally in differentiated axons and dendrites. Crucially, neurite tips are active sites for NT signalling [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Consequently, this process might be important during the development of a functional neuronal network, but less so once neurons are fully differentiated. This prediction was confirmed by our experimental evidence showing that ATE splicing occurs mainly during adulthood and after several days <italic>in vitro</italic> in cortical and hippocampal cultures. Interestingly, Kidins220 RNA did not display any ATE splicing in motor neurons over 13 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>), suggesting that the carboxy-terminus of Kidins220 encoded by exon 32 is required for the development and/or maintenance of this type of neuron, e.g. to ensure physiological neurotrophin signalling by modulating the distribution and levels of Trk and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors.</p>
<p>Hardly anything is known about the role of Kidins220 in adult tissues, since ablation of Kidins220 is embryonic lethal [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The study of Kidins220 splice variants might represent a novel strategy to unravel these still unknown functions. For example, alterations in the region between exon 24 and 29 might lead to structural changes, or alter the recruitment of yet undiscovered binding partners. Similarly, whereas ATE splicing seems to drive an overall loss of function by the loss of various binding sites encoded by exon 32, nothing is known about possible gain of functions, which may be mediated by exon 33-specific binding partners. Crucially, it remains to be elucidated which combinations of ATE and central domain alternative splicing are expressed in different tissues, how they might be changing over time and which specific role they might have.</p>
<p>In differentiated PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons, we showed different localisations of full-length Kidins220 isoform m6 with or without its ATE splicing C2 (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129944.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). Whilst Kidins220 with a long carboxy-terminus encoded by exon 32 (aminoacid 1–1793) co-localises with endogenous Kidins220 (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>), overexpression of its shorter version in which this exon has been replaced by exon 33 (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>, m6/C2; aminoacid 1–1420), seems to act in a dominant-negative fashion by altering the distribution of endogenous Kidins220. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0129944.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129944.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>, m6/C2 displays a punctate localisation in the cell body, and appears to sequester endogenous Kidins220 in these puncta (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). This alternative distribution is likely to be driven by the loss of the KIM domain, and the inability of m6/C2 to recruit kinesin-1, and possibly other motor proteins [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], thus impairing its transport to the neurite tips. However, this change in localisation may be due to novel binding partners of the m6/C2 isoform, which may restrict Kidins220 distribution to the cell body. In this regard, given the role of Kidins220 in NT signalling, its splice variants might play different roles in signalling endosomes [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or recycling endosomes [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], whose in depth analysis will be provided in future studies.</p>
<p>Since the m6/C2 splice isoform lacks its p75<sup>NTR</sup>-binding site, it is neither expected to be transported together with p75<sup>NTR</sup>, nor to form a ternary complex with TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup>. We found that this isoform increased the cellular level of TrkA (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129944.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>), but not of p75<sup>NTR</sup>. The molecular mechanism responsible for this strong increase of TrkA expression remains yet to be determined. Kidins220 isoform m6/C2 might sequester TrkA receptors in the cell body and prevent its targeting to lysosomes or other degradation pathways [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129944.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This may be due to the interaction of the retromer/SNX27 complex to full-length Kidins220 via its PDZ binding domain [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which is lost in Kidins220 m6/C2 splice variants. Alternatively, Kidins220 m6/C2 might promote TrkA recycling or regulate its translation. It is therefore likely that Kidins220 regulates NT signalling and function not only by modulating the intracellular trafficking of NT receptors but also by directly affecting receptor homeostasis.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that increasing Kidins220 levels lead to the decreased association of p75<sup>NTR</sup> with TrkA [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this light, Kidins220 ATE splicing could provide an effective tool to fine tune NT signalling throughout development. On the other hand, NTs may influence Kidins220 function by controlling the kinetics of expression of its isoforms, as shown by the accelerated appearance of isoform m1 upon BDNF stimulation in cortical and hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="pone.0129944.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>), or the expression of additional Kidins220 splice variants in PC12 cells upon NGF stimulation (<xref rid="pone.0129944.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). This feedback mechanism may represent an important pathway controlling how a target cell responds to NTs by adapting its repertoire of Kidins220 isoforms, and as a consequence, the strength of NT signalling output. NT signalling would therefore not only depend on the regulation of the alternative splicing of the NT ligand (e.g. BDNF) [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and its receptors (e.g. TrkB) [<xref rid="pone.0129944.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but also on the compendium of Kidins220 isoforms generated by alternative splicing.</p>
<p>In summary, Kidins220 is a crucial protein for neuronal and cardiovascular development, which by undergoing alternative splicing, might adapt to specific requirements during development, such as the varying intracellular distribution of growth factor receptors or the modulation of specific signalling events. Future studies will determine the exact role of Kidins220 isoforms in this process, and its regulation in the maintenance of the nervous and cardiovascular systems during adulthood.</p>
