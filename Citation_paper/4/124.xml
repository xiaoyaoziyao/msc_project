      <abstract>
        <p>Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is characterized by abundant secretion of various proteins in senescent cells and implicated in tumor progression and inflammatory responses. However, the profile of secreted proteins in SASP is different from cell type to cell type, and currently, universal markers for SASP have not been reported. In the present investigation, we show that SASP-responsive alkaline phosphatase (SASP-RAP) serves as a sensitive, general and convenient marker for SASP. Etoposide-treated cells exhibited a senescent phenotype characterized by senile morphology, positive staining for senescence-associated β-galactosidase, growth arrest and induction of p53 and p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>. In SASP-RAP-transfected cells, exposure to etoposide increased secretion of SASP-RAP time-dependently. The kinetics of secretion was closely correlated with that of activation of the p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> promoter and the p16<sup>INK4a</sup> promoter. The enhanced secretion of SASP-RAP by senescence was also observed in cells treated with other senescence inducers such as trichostatin A, doxorubicin and 4-phenylbutylic acid. The induction of SASP-RAP by senescence was similarly observed in natural replicative senescence. To confirm selectivity of the SASP-RAP response, cells were treated with senescence-related and -unrelated stimuli (IL-1β, LPS, TNF-α and TGF-β), and induction of senescence markers and activity of SASP-RAP were evaluated in parallel. Unlike etoposide, senescence-unrelated stimuli did not induce p53 and p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>, and it was correlated with lack of induction of SASP-RAP. In contrast, senescence-unrelated stimuli up-regulated conventional indicators for SASP, <italic>e.g.,</italic> MMP-3, IL-6 and TIMP, without induction of senescence. SASP-RAP thus serves as a selective, convenient and general marker for detection and monitoring of SASP during cellular senescence.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest induced by telomere shortening (replicative senescence), oncogene activation and DNA damage (premature senescence) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Collado1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Kuilman1">[2]</xref>. Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has been identified as a typical feature of senescent cells, which is characterized by increased expression and secretion of cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other secretory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Coppe1">[3]</xref>. Generally, cellular senescence is an anti-tumorigenic mechanism via induction of growth arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Collado1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Rodier1">[4]</xref> and triggering immune-mediated clearance of pre-malignant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Kang1">[5]</xref>. However, on the other hand, SASP causes abundant secretion of various bioactive proteins from senescent cells and thereby activates neighboring non-senescent cancer cells, leading to promotion of tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Bavik1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Coppe2">[7]</xref>. SASP is also considered to be a mechanism responsible for chronic inflammation observed during aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Freund1">[8]</xref>. Towards better understanding of senescence-associated pathologies, detection and monitoring of SASP are essential.</p>
      <p>SASP is widely observed in a variety of cell types including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Coppe1">[3]</xref>. Usually, it is accompanied by other senescence phenotypes; <italic>e.g.,</italic> morphological features (large, flat and multinucleated), senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Dimri1">[9]</xref> and activation of p53–p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> and p16<sup>INK4a</sup>–Rb signaling cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Kuilman1">[2]</xref>. However, the profile of secreted proteins in SASP is different from cell type to cell type, or dependent on different cellular contexts. Some SASP-related factors are up-regulated and secreted in some senescent cells but not in other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Coppe1">[3]</xref>. Furthermore, production of many SASP factors is not specific to senescence. For example, SASP-related cytokines, chemokines and MMPs are also produced in response to inflammatory stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Hayden1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Qiu1">[12]</xref>. Because of this reason, an array of indicators (mRNAs and proteins) must be evaluated by expensive, time-wasting assays, <italic>e.g.,</italic> ELISA, RT-PCR and Northern/Western blot analysis, to prove SASP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Coppe2">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Freund2">[13]</xref>. To date, selective, universal and convenient assays for SASP have not been established yet.</p>
      <p>During the past decades, secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) has been used as a reporter to evaluate activity of certain promoter/enhancer elements. Normally, alkaline phosphatase is not secreted, but the recombinant SEAP originated from placental alkaline phosphatase is efficiently secreted from transfected cells. The level of SEAP activity detected in culture medium is directly proportional to changes in SEAP mRNA and protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Berger1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Cullen1">[15]</xref>. As a reporter, SEAP has several important advantages over other reporter molecules including luciferase and β-galactosidase. Because preparation of cell lysates is not required, it is possible to monitor activity of certain promoters/enhancers continuously using identical culture cells. The assay of SEAP using culture medium is faster, easier and less expensive than assays for other reporter enzymes. Furthermore, detection of SEAP activity is very sensitive using a chemiluminescent assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Alam1">[16]</xref>. Other important advantage of SEAP is that background signals due to endogenous alkaline phosphatases are nearly absent. It is because, unlike most endogenous alkaline phosphatases, SEAP is extremely heat stable and resistant to L-homoarginine. The activity of endogenous alkaline phosphatases present in samples can be eliminated completely by preheating the sample at 65°C and assaying in the presence of L-homoarginine without affecting SEAP activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Cullen1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, we found that, in cells stably transfected with a <italic>SEAP</italic> gene under the control of constitutively active promoters, secretion of SEAP was enhanced during the course of senescence. We also found that it is a general phenomenon that is observed in different cell types triggered by different senescence inducers. The kinetics of SEAP secretion was closely correlated with the kinetics of other senescence markers. Furthermore, the specificity of the response of SEAP to senescence was superior to other conventional markers for SASP such as cytokines, chemokines, MMPs and tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMP). In the present report, we demonstrate several data that support our conclusion and propose that SASP-responsive alkaline phosphatase (SASP-RAP) serves as a selective, convenient and general marker for detection and monitoring of SASP during cellular senescence.</p>

        <title>Induction of Senescence by Etoposide</title>
        <p>Previous reports demonstrated that low concentrations of etoposide, a genotoxic agent, induced senescent morphology in fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Leontieva1">[29]</xref>. To examine whether etoposide induces senescence in NRK-52E cells, we treated the cells with 1 µg/ml etoposide, and microscopic analysis was performed after 3 days. The etoposide-treated cells exhibited a large, extended and flattened cell shape typical of senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, top). This morphological change was associated with positive staining for SA-β-gal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom). Quantitative analysis showed that 60–70% of etoposide-treated cells exhibited a senescent phenotype when assessed by morphological changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and SA-β-gal staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Although cell death was not significantly induced by 3 day-exposure to etoposide (not shown), the number of viable cells in the etoposide group was less than half of that in the untreated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting induction of growth arrest. Etoposide also increased p53 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) and induced expression of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), both of which are well-known markers for senescence.</p>

        <title>Response of SEAP/SASP-RAP to Etoposide-induced Senescence</title>
        <p>In SASP, a wide range of proteins including cytokines/chemokines, growth factors, proteinases and their regulators are secreted abundantly. It indicates that SASP is caused not through activation of particular signaling pathways, but via activation of general machinery responsible for transcription, translation and/or protein secretion. If so, some secretory reporter protein could serve as an indicator for SASP. To examine this possibility, NRK-52E cells were transfected with a SEAP gene under the control of the SV40 promoter and stimulated with etoposide for up to 72 h. Eight hours before sampling, the medium was changed with fresh 1% FBS. After 8 h, culture media and cells were collected and subjected to chemiluminescent assay and formazan assay, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, secretion of SEAP increased in etoposide-exposed senescent cells in a time-dependent manner. The increase in SEAP activity was not due to altered cell number, because the significant up-regulation of SEAP was observed even when the SEAP activity was normalized by the number of viable cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, following the exposure to etoposide, a time-dependent increase in SEAP secretion was also observed in cells that produce SEAP under the control of other constitutively active regulatory elements including the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These results suggest a possibility that SEAP serves as an indicator for SASP.</p>

        <p>We compared the kinetics of SEAP activity with that of the senescence biomarkers in etoposide-treated cells. Induction of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> and p16<sup>INK4a</sup> is known to be a typical phenomenon observed in senescent cells. Therefore, cells were transfected with p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>-Luc or p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-Luc that introduce a luciferase gene under the control of the p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> promoter or the p16<sup>INK4a</sup> promoter. The cells were then exposed to etoposide for up to 72 h and subjected to luciferase assay. The luciferase activity was normalized by the values of formazan assay. The results showed that the time-dependent increase in SEAP activity was closely correlated with the induction of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> and p16<sup>INK4a</sup> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g002">Figures 2D, 2E</xref>).</p>
        <p>SASP may be induced by transcriptional activation via particular kinases and transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Freund2">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Chien1">[30]</xref>. To examine whether the induction of SEAP occurs at the transcriptional level, we established NRK-52E cells constitutively expressing SEAP under the control of the SV40 promoter. When the NRK/SV-SEAP cells were treated with etoposide, the expression of SEAP mRNA was up-regulated in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). It was associated with a time-dependent increase in SEAP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). These results suggest that, like conventional SASP factors, transcriptional activation is also involved in the up-regulation of SEAP in senescent cells.</p>
        <p>Previous reports suggested that, among various kinases and transcription factors, p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) contribute to the transcriptional induction of SASP factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Freund2">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Chien1">[30]</xref>. We examined roles of several kinases and NF-κB in the induction of SEAP by etoposide. For this purpose, cells were treated with etoposide in the presence of inhibitors of Akt (Akti-1/2), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (PD98059), p38 MAP kinase (SB203580), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SP600125) and NF-κB (DHMEQ), and activity of SASP-RAP was evaluated. The result showed that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase or NF-κB, but not other kinases, significantly attenuated induction of SEAP activity in senescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). This result further confirmed the close correlation between expression of SASP factors and induction of SEAP. Based on these results, we use the word “SASP-RAP (SASP-responsive alkaline phosphatase)” instead of “SEAP” in the following studies.</p>

        <p>The induction of SASP-RAP by senescence was not restricted to a particular cell type and was generally observed in different cells. Consistent with the results in NRK-52E cells, treatment of MEF with etoposide for 3 days induced a large, extended and flattened cell shape typical of senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, top). It was associated with induction of SA-β-gal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom). All etoposide-treated MEF exhibited this senescent phenotype. When MEF were transfected with SASP-RAP and treated with etoposide, activity of SASP-RAP in culture media was up-regulated dose-dependently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Cellular senescence is classified into premature senescence caused by, for example, DNA damage, and replicative senescence caused via telomere shortening. To investigate whether SASP-RAP is also responsive to replicative senescence, natural senescence of NHMC was used as an experimental model. We found that, when NHMC were serially passaged (1∶ 3 passage), the growth was arrested at 14<sup>th</sup> passage (P14). The growth arrested NHMC exhibited a large, extended and flattened cell shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g003">Figure 3E</xref> top) and positive staining for SA-β-gal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, middle and bottom) typical of senescence. Of note, all P14 cells exhibited the senescent phenotype, which was never observed in P9 cells. We then compared SASP-RAP activity in senescent NHMC (P14) with that in non-senescent cells (P9). P8 and P13 cells were co-transfected with SASP-RAP and EGFP, and seeded in 96-well plates. The 8 h-conditioned media were used for chemiluminescent assay, and the cells were used for; 1) fluorescent microscopy to evaluate transfection efficiency, and 2) formazan assay to assess the viable cell number. The SASP-RAP activity was normalized by both transfection efficiency and viable cell number, and the resultant values were used for comparison. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, SASP-RAP activity significantly increased in replicative senescent cells, when compared with non-senescent NHMC cells.</p>

        <title>Selectivity of SASP-RAP Response to Senescence</title>
        <p>To detect SASP, current approaches use some non-specific, conventional SASP factors, <italic>e.g.</italic>, cytokines, chemokines and MMPs. However, many of these SASP-related factors are up-regulated under situations other than senescence. To confirm selectivity of the SASP-RAP response to senescence, NRK-52E cells were treated with several popular inflammation/tumorigenesis-related stimuli including IL-1β, LPS, TNF-α and TGF-β. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g004">Figures 4A and 4B</xref>, etoposide (positive control) induced p53 and p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>, whereas other stimuli did not induce these senescence markers. When the cells were transfected with SASP-RAP, etoposide induced SASP-RAP activity, whereas none of the senescence-unrelated stimuli triggered up-regulation of SASP-RAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The lack of up-regulation was observed not only in NRK-52E cells but also in SASP-RAP-transfected MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). On the other hand, conventional indicators for senescence including IL-6, MMP-3 and TIMP were up-regulated by the senescence-unrelated stimuli without induction of senescent morphology, positive staining for SA-β-gal and the senescence marker p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052305-g004">Figures 4E–G</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Cellular senescence and its characteristic feature SASP are implicated in various pathophysiological contexts including malignancy, inflammation and aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Rodier1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Campisi1">[33]</xref>. Inhibitors of SASP may be considered as therapeutic agents for a wide range of age-related diseases. Towards better understanding of SASP and development of agents that effectively inhibit SASP-related pathologies, establishment of convenient assays for SASP is essential. Evaluation of various SASP-related molecules is not convenient for this purpose. It is because; (1) the expression/secretion profile of SASP is dependent on cell types or triggers, and an array of SASP factors are often undetectable in certain senescent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Coppe1">[3]</xref>, and our unpublished observation), (2) production of many SASP factors, especially inflammatory molecules, is not specific to cellular senescence, and (3) conventional evaluation of various SASP factors requires expensive, time-wasting assays. To date, selective, convenient and general assays have not been established for SASP. In the present report, we suggest SASP-RAP as a useful indicator for SASP during cellular senescence. We showed that it is useful to detect SASP in different cell types under different senescent contexts. SASP-RAP can be used for detecting SASP occurred in both telomere-dependent (replicative) and -independent (premature) senescence.</p>
      <p>SASP-RAP assay has several advantages over conventional approaches to SASP. First and foremost, in contrast to the current indicators for SASP, SASP-RAP activity is not influenced by senescence-unrelated, non-specific factors such as inflammatory stimuli. Selectivity and specificity of SASP-RAP are thus superior to the conventional markers, as was demonstrated in this report. Second, detection of conventional SASP factors is often difficult in senescent cells, whereas detection of SASP-RAP in transfected cells is easy. Activity of this enzyme can be measured very sensitively and quantitatively by using conventional chemiluminescent systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Kasai1">[34]</xref>. The assay is simple and quick, and can be completed within 1–1.5 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Kasai2">[35]</xref>. No special instruments or apparatus are needed other than a luminometer. It is contrastive to other conventional approaches, e.g., ELISA, RT-PCR and Northern/Western blot analyses to detect SASP-related cytokines, chemokines and metalloproteinases. The third advantage of the SASP-RAP assay is its low-cost performance. The assay does not require expensive reagents. Small scale assays using 96- or 384-well plates are feasible for evaluation of SASP-RAP. This property allows for economical, high-throughput screening of anti-SASP agents useful for the treatment of cancers and chronic inflammation. The fourth advantage of using SASP-RAP is that, in contrast to other conventional systems, it does not need cell lysates. Only 5 µl of culture medium is sufficient for quantitative assessment of SASP-RAP activity. It means that continuous monitoring of SASP is feasible using serial sampling of conditioned media from identical cell cultures, as shown in this report.</p>
      <p>In the SASP-RAP assay, conditioned media are used for evaluation of enzyme activity, and therefore, cells are available for formazan assay. The latter is useful for normalization of SASP-RAP activity to exclude influences of different cell number. However, normalization by formazan assay may underestimate SASP-RAP activity. Based on our experience, SASP-RAP activity was induced by etoposide approximately 7 folds when normalized by values obtained from formazan assay. However, the induction was even higher, approximately 30 times, if SASP-RAP activity was normalized by values obtained from direct cell counting (data not shown). The formazan assay is based upon metabolic reduction of tetrazolium salts to colored formazans by mitochondrial enzymatic systems. Activity of mitochondrial enzymes could be up-regulated in senescent cells with SASP.</p>
      <p>Currently, it is unclear how secretion of SASP-RAP is induced by senescence. It may be caused by activation of transcription, enhancement of translation and/or accelerated secretion. In the present investigation, we showed that the up-regulation of SASP-RAP by senescence occurred, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, we also found that p38 MAP kinase and NF-κB partially mediated the induction of SASP-RAP. These findings are consistent with previous reports showing a role of the p38 MAP kinase - NF-κB axis in the transcriptional induction of conventional SASP factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Freund2">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Chien1">[30]</xref>. However, activation of NF-κB seems to be necessary but not sufficient to induce SASP-RAP, because several NF-κB activators alone did not increase SASP-RAP activity. More general machinery may be involved in the induction of SASP-RAP in senescent cells.</p>
      <p>SASP may be induced by chromatin modification, rather than changes in individual transcription factors, because dramatic chromatin alterations occur at senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Funayama1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Narita1">[37]</xref>. In senescent cells, disorganization of the nuclear architecture and loss of perinuclear heterochromatin are common findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Shin1">[38]</xref>. Because heterochromatin governs gene silencing and genomic stability, loss of this epigenetic mechanism during senescence may lead to increased transcription of various genes. Moreover, hypermethylation is another general mechanism for transcriptional suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Kulis1">[39]</xref>, and during senescence, global DNA methylation is known to decrease in the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052305-Wilson1">[40]</xref>. In senescent cells, therefore, loss of these suppressive mechanisms may lead to a global increase in transcriptional activity and thereby induce a wide range of molecules including SASP-RAP.</p>
