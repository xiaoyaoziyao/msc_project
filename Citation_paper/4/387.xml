        <p>Interaction networks are central elements of ecological systems and have very complex structures. Historically, much effort has focused on niche-mediated processes to explain these structures, while an emerging consensus posits that both niche and neutral mechanisms simultaneously shape many features of ecological communities. However, the study of interaction networks still lacks a comprehensive neutral theory. Here we present a neutral model of predator-prey interactions and analyze the structural characteristics of the simulated networks. We find that connectance values (complexity) and complexity-diversity relationships of neutral networks are close to those observed in empirical bipartite networks. High nestedness and low modularity values observed in neutral networks fall in the range of those from empirical antagonist bipartite networks. Our results suggest that, as an alternative to niche-mediated processes that induce incompatibility between species (“niche forbidden links”), neutral processes create “neutral forbidden links” due to uneven species abundance distributions and the low probability of interaction between rare species. Neutral trophic networks must be seen as the missing endpoint of a continuum from niche to purely stochastic approaches of community organization.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Ecological networks such as food-webs, pollination or host-parasitoid systems are among the most complex ecological systems. They exhibit structural patterns with key characteristics that give important information on their underlying ecological mechanisms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Stouffer1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Bascompte1">[3]</xref>). Early studies of trophic networks have used a variety of indices to characterize these patterns, including the number of interactions or links (<italic>L</italic>), link density (i.e. number of links per species, <italic>D = L/S</italic>) and connectance (proportion of links realised compared to all potential links, <italic>C = L/S<sup>2</sup></italic>). Many scale-invariant patterns have been found and debated (e.g. the relative proportions of primary producers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers; omnivory; intervality; cycling/looping - see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Ings1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Cohen1">[7]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Among these patterns the density of links in networks has been of central interest as it is associated with the complexity-stability relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-May1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Sol1">[9]</xref>. Two major complexity-diversity scaling laws have been proposed: in the first case, consumers are constrained to a constant number of interactions (“link species scaling law” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Cohen1">[7]</xref>), while in the second they are constrained to feed on a constant proportion of the species pool (“constant connectance” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Martinez1">[10]</xref>). These scaling laws have been extensively tested, and the current consensus is that observed patterns take an intermediate form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-SchmidAraya1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Beckerman1">[12]</xref>. Beyond complexity-diversity relationships, two other patterns, related to the structure of links among species, have particularly been investigated during the past decade. Nestedness measures to what extent interactions by specialists are nested within those realized by generalists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Bascompte2">[13]</xref>, and modularity measures the compartmentalization of the network into relatively independent community modules (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-May1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Rezende1">[14]</xref>). A nested interaction structure is hypothesized, at least, to buffer communities against extinctions or temporal fluctuations in the abundance of specialist species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Burgos1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Memmott1">[16]</xref> and to promote species coexistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Bastolla1">[17]</xref>. Modularity is hypothesized to increase the stability of interaction networks since disturbances are less likely to spread across different modules that are weakly connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-May1">[8]</xref>; see however <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Pimm1">[18]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Many attempts have been made to elucidate the processes responsible for these observed patterns (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Stouffer1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Dunne1">[6]</xref>). Most of the models used, either phenomenological or population based (<italic>sensu</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Stouffer1">[1]</xref>), have in common that they assume ecological niche differentiation. The niche is often represented by body size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Cohen1">[7]</xref>, but also by other traits such as foraging behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Guill1">[19]</xref> or approximated by phylogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Cattin1">[20]</xref>. The importance of the niche concept has however been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Hubbell1">[21]</xref> and this perspective has yet to be integrated into the study of ecological networks. The neutral theory posits that speciation, dispersal, and demographic stochasticity are the main processes responsible for community structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Hubbell1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Bell1">[22]</xref>. Using this parsimonious approach, common ecological patterns such as the shape of species–abundance distributions, species–area relationships, and distance decay in community similarity have all been found without invoking niche differences among species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Hubbell1">[21]</xref>). Beside their intrinsic interest (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Gravel1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Chave1">[26]</xref>), neutral models provide an adequate null hypothesis to the niche theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Thompson1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Gotelli1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A neutral network assembly theory should help in disentangling the complexity of ecological interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Krishna1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Vzquez1">[30]</xref>, either by providing a realistic explanatory framework or at least an adequate null model. A niche-based network perspective considers species interactions to be constrained by specific functional traits (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Rossberg1">[31]</xref>), while a neutral one would only consider random interactions among individuals. Some previous studies have integrated randomness into mutualistic networks either as a null hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Vzquez2">[32]</xref> or as a neutral based model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Krishna1">[29]</xref>. Solé <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Sol1">[9]</xref> also simulated population dynamics from random networks. Those pioneering studies found that a decreasing connectance with species richness, nested and modular structures could emerge from neutral assembly and interactions. However, these approaches have essentially been phenomenological and have thus not explicitly explored the simultaneous effects of neutral dynamics and neutral interactions on network structure.</p>
      <p>In this study we simulate bipartite predator-prey networks (two trophic levels) with explicit neutral dynamics within each trophic level (neutral competitive interactions) and between levels (neutral predatory interactions). We investigate the structure of the emerging neutral networks by calculating species diversity, species relative abundance, density of links, connectance, nestedness, and modularity at equilibrium, and we compare our results with empirical values from the literature. We find that patterns of connectance and the complexity-diversity relationship in simulated neutral networks mimic those observed in empirical interaction networks. We also find that neutral networks may be nested and modular like those found in bipartite empirical networks. We then show how, within this neutral context, realistic network structure emerges simply from combining the patterns of relative species abundances found at each trophic level. Neutral dynamics create “neutral forbidden links” responsible for realistic ecological network complexity and organisation.</p>

        <title>Model description</title>
        <p>We simulated the dynamics of neutral bipartite predator-prey networks, in which individuals belonging to the higher trophic level (i.e. predators) consume any individuals of the lower trophic level (i.e. prey). Intra-guild predation is not allowed. We considered a single local community connected to a large metacommunity. Neutrality occurs at two levels: (i) at the community level we assumed ecological equivalence between individuals and species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Hubbell1">[21]</xref>, and (ii) at the network level we assumed equivalence in the potential diet of individuals and species, i.e. any predator individual can feed on any prey individual with the same probability (a neutral interaction).</p>
        <p>Three parameters determine the dynamics within each trophic level: reproduction rate <italic>f</italic>, immigration rate <italic>m</italic>, and carrying capacity as the number of individuals <italic>K</italic>. Initially, the prey and predator communities are composed of <italic>K<sub>prey</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>pred</sub></italic> individuals of a single species, respectively. Then the dynamical procedure iterates the following four actions at each time step: (i - interactions) each predator individual consumes a prey individual at random and the chosen prey individual dies (which approximates the case of a host-parasitoid network); (ii - birth) each individual gives rise to a single offspring with probability <italic>f</italic>; (iii - immigration) for each birth event, there is a probability <italic>m</italic> that the offspring is replaced by an immigrant, i.e. from a species not found in the local community but from an infinite regional species pool with a uniform abundance distribution as in Bell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Bell1">[22]</xref>; and (iv – density regulation) if the community exceeds its carrying capacity, individuals in excess are removed at random <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Hubbell1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Bell1">[22]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Parameters and simulations</title>
        <p>We simulated communities with carrying capacities of 5000 prey and 1000 predator individuals, corresponding to a scenario in which predators are larger bodied and thus have lower abundances than their prey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Jonsson1">[33]</xref>. We also simulated communities with alternative carrying capacities of prey and predators to assess the robustness of our results to different parameter values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038295.s004">Text S4</xref>). Birth rates were fixed at <italic>f<sub>pred</sub></italic> = 0.2 for predators and <italic>f<sub>prey</sub></italic> = 0.4 for prey. The birth rate was twice as high for prey as for predators, reflecting the accompanying differences in body size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Brown1">[34]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We simulated different immigration rates to vary species richness and abundance distributions (immigration rates were set equal for prey and predators and ranged between 1.10<sup>−5</sup> and 1.10<sup>−2</sup>). This range ensured a sufficient equilibrium species richness without too many species having unrealistically short life spans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Ricklefs1">[35]</xref>. We first simulated the model for 100 000 time steps and determined the number of steps that were sufficient to reach an asymptote in community structure. We then carried out 30 replicated runs of 10 000 time steps for each immigration rate.</p>

        <title>Network properties</title>
        <p>During each simulation, the species richness of prey (<italic>S<sub>prey</sub></italic>) and predator communities (<italic>S<sub>pred</sub></italic>) and abundances were recorded. Evenness (<italic>E<sub>prey</sub></italic> and <italic>E<sub>pred</sub></italic>) of each community was estimated using Pielou's index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Pielou1">[36]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The matrix of interactions <italic>M(t)</italic> (also called the matrix of links) is a <italic>S<sub>prey</sub></italic>×<italic>S<sub>pred</sub></italic> sized matrix summarizing the realized links (presence/absence) between each pair of predator and prey species at a given time step. <italic>M(t)<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>,<italic>j</italic></sub> = 1 when at least one individual of predator species <italic>j</italic> had consumed at least one individual of prey species <italic>i,</italic> and <italic>M(t)<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>,<italic>j</italic></sub> = 0 otherwise. This matrix was used to compute the following descriptors of network complexity: (i) the number of realized links in the network <italic>L</italic> (the sum of <italic>M(t)</italic>); (ii) the link density <italic>D</italic>, the ratio between the number of links and number of predator species (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0038295.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>); and (iii) connectance <italic>C</italic>. We used directed connectance, defined as the proportion of realized links among the total number of potential links <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Martinez2">[37]</xref>, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0038295.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>for bipartite acyclic networks.</p>
        <p>We fitted the power law relationship between the number of realized links and species richness, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0038295.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This relationship allows a direct comparison of the two alternative complexity-diversity relationships. An exponent of a = 1 yields the link species scaling law, where <italic>L/S</italic> is invariant to <italic>S</italic>. An exponent of a = 2 yields constant connectance, where <italic>L/S</italic> scales linearly with <italic>S</italic>. Note that the number of potential links is <italic>S</italic><sup>2</sup> in multi-trophic networks, but <italic>S<sub>prey</sub></italic>×<italic>S<sub>pred</sub></italic> in bipartite acyclic networks. Consequently, we corrected the power law for bipartite networks by using<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0038295.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We combined all simulated networks (30 replicates for each immigration rate) to estimate the slope of the complexity-diversity relationship. We used a type II Standardized Major Axis (SMA) regression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Warton1">[38]</xref> because there was error variance in both the independent (<italic>L</italic>) and the dependent (<italic>S<sub>prey</sub></italic>×<italic>S<sub>pred</sub></italic>) variables.

        <p>We estimated the nestedness of interactions within each bipartite network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Bascompte2">[13]</xref> using the function ‘nestedness’ of the ‘bipartite’ package for R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-RodriguezGirones1">[40]</xref>.

To emphasize nestedness instead of disorder, we used the nestedness <italic>N</italic> that is usually expressed as <italic>N</italic> = (100−<italic>T</italic>)/100, with values ranging from 0 to 1 (maximum nestedness).

        <p>Because nestedness and modularity measures are potentially affected by the number of species and the number of links within the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Fortuna1">[44]</xref>, , we also estimated relative nestedness and modularity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Bascompte2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Krishna1">[29]</xref>.

These relatively low values for a neutral model illustrate how only a small fraction of potential interactions may be realized even in a network in which virtually all links are possible at any one moment. This range of connectance is consistent with values reported for real networks, particularly bipartite networks where these values vary between 0.01 and 0.38 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Fortuna1">[44]</xref>. Low connectance values are usually attributed to a restriction of interactions, also called “forbidden links” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Jordano1">[5]</xref>, because of niche incompatibilities that emerge from various constraints such as body size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-SchmidAraya1">[11]</xref>, morphology, phenology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Olesen1">[46]</xref> and phylogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Rezende1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Bersier1">[47]</xref>.

This value falls between the link scaling law (slope = 1) and that predicted by the constant connectance hypothesis (slope = 2), which is the actual consensus on complexity-diversity relationships for both niche assembly models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Beckerman1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Montoya2">[48]</xref> and empirical data (for example 1.4 for the 113 webs catalog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Cohen1">[7]</xref>; 1.4 for 50 pelagic lake food webs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Havens1">[49]</xref>; 1.73 for 12 highly resolved food webs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Martinez1">[10]</xref>; 1.5 for 19 diverse food webs from a variety of habitat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Dunne1">[6]</xref>).</p>
        <p>We found both nested and modular patterns in neutral predator-prey networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038295-g005">Figure 5</xref>). It has been suggested that nested patterns in food-webs are caused by species traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Kondoh1">[50]</xref>, for instance body size (interspecific hierarchy hypothesis as in the cascade model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Cohen1">[7]</xref>) or specific resource qualities (the optimal diet choice theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Macarthur1">[51]</xref>). As an alternative we suggest that neutral interactions may also produce both nested and modular patterns without any niche differentiation between species. We therefore conclude that the occurrence of nested and modular patterns cannot discriminate between neutral and non-neutral network organization. That said, we found that neutral networks were significantly more nested than expected under the null model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038295-g005">Figure 5</xref>), and that nestedness values were located in the upper limit of empirical values for antagonist networks. This is in accordance with Krishna <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Krishna1">[29]</xref> who found that nestedness of a mutualist neutral network assembled with a phenomenological model was high in comparison to empirical networks. In addition, we found that neutral networks are lightly less modular than expected under the null model, with modularity values located at the lower limit of empirical values for antagonist networks. This suggests that neutral models of interaction networks tend to overestimate realized nestedness and underestimate realized modularity making deviations from neutral predictions potentially useful as measures of niche importance in structuring species interaction networks.</p>

        <title>Abundance patterns and neutral structure in networks</title>
        <p>In our neutral perspective, individuals interact at random so that a species is more likely to interact with others when abundant. Not surprisingly, we found that both prey and predators had non–uniform species abundance distributions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038295.s002">Text S2</xref>). Consequently, the probability that a given predator and a given prey species interact is highly variable. Especially, rare species make very improbable potential links in the network, that we call “neutral forbidden links”. For example, the probability with which a predator and a prey species that have each a relative abundance of 1% will encounter each other and interact is 0.01×0.01 = 0.0001. In other words, there will be on average 1 link per 10 000 predator individuals. To illustrate the relationship between patterns of relative species abundance distributions and network structures we simply calculated the expected matrix of species interactions from the equilibrium distributions of relative abundances for predator and prey communities obtained in our simulations (i.e. phenomenological model as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Stouffer1">[1]</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038295.s003">Text S3</xref>). We found a strong correlation between the structures of networks assembled with the dynamical and the phenomenological model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038295.s003">Text S3</xref>, C: <italic>r</italic> = 0.99; <italic>Q</italic>: <italic>r</italic> = 0.95; <italic>N</italic>: r = 0.29). This confirms that food web structures within neutral networks mainly result from combining the relative abundance distributions found within each level.</p>
        <p>The presence of neutral forbidden links clearly explains low connectance values in neutral networks, because it decreases the number of links effectively realized. Neutral forbidden links also explain nested patterns. Indeed, links mostly occur between abundant predator and prey species and they become rarer when at least one species becomes rare. In that way, a rare species is likely to realize a subset of the links realized by more abundant species within each trophic level, producing a nested distribution of links in the network. Nested patterns of interactions maximise species ‘niche overlap’ (i.e. shared interactions) which does not favor the emergence of independent modules. However, some modules still occur in neutral networks because of stochastic effects.</p>
        <p>The occurrence of neutral forbidden links also explains why the slope of the complexity-diversity relationship varies with immigration. At low immigration rates, turnover is low, most species are abundant and any species is likely to realize a high number of links. The slope of the complexity-diversity relationship is elevated because there are only few neutral forbidden links. At high immigration rates however, there is a large number of rare and short-lived species realizing few links because of high species turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Hubbell1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Ricklefs1">[35]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038295.s002">Text S2</xref>). The slope of the complexity-diversity relationship is then much shallower, and species tend to have a constant (and maximum) number of links (as proposed by the link species scaling law). These results show how immigration and neutral drift, by shaping the abundance distribution of species, can produce either a single large-scale or different small-scale complexity-diversity relationships. This corresponds to what is observed in empirical networks which alternatively support the link scaling law, the constant connectance hypothesis or fall in between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-SchmidAraya1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Beckerman1">[12]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Species relative abundance has already been proposed as one of several factors affecting network structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Vzquez1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Vzquez2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Stang1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Poulin1">[53]</xref>. Here we have provided a conceptual development to this proposition. Along with the phenomenological model proposed by Krishna <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Krishna1">[29]</xref> for mutualism, our results can be seen as an endpoint of a continuum from network structures that are completely determined by species relative abundances (neutral model) to those in which niches entirely drive species interactions (niche model). Our main result is that neutral forbidden links could shape network structure, just as niche-mediated forbidden links do. We should expect that, even if they are neutral, links between abundant species occur consistently through time, while links between transient and rare species are much more ephemeral. Those weak links would be undetectable in the field or would require very intensive sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Martinez2">[37]</xref>, and can appear as niche forbidden links. A recent study by Dorado <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Dorado1">[54]</xref> illustrates this limitation in nature, showing that rare species only realize a few links at a time and thus appear as specialists.</p>

        <title>Robustness of neutral forbidden links</title>
        <p>Our approach promotes the occurrence of neutral forbidden links because we assumed that each predator individual feeds on a single prey individual at a time and we assessed the network structure in a snapshot. The concept is however robust to these assumptions. Neutral forbidden links occur because of the uneven relative abundance distribution of species rather than their absolute abundance. The first assumption means that a single species cannot realize more links than its absolute abundance. This constrains the network to a maximum number of links and consequently connectance. This upper bound on network complexity may also occur <italic>in natura,</italic> as the number of potential links does not account for constraints posed by species densities. Typically, connectance is calculated as L/S<sup>2</sup>. This metric does not take into account that some species are not abundant enough to realize all potential links, even if each individual could potentially feed on multiple preys. We tested the robustness of our results to the finite number of individuals by performing simulations with different sets of <italic>K<sub>pred</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>prey</sub></italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038295.s004">Text S4</xref>). Varying <italic>K<sub>pred</sub></italic> or <italic>K<sub>pred</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>prey</sub></italic> shifts the saturation of link number to higher values of species richness (Figure A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038295.s004">Text S4</xref>) but does not affect the complexity-diversity relationship (Figure B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038295.s004">Text S4</xref>). The analysis of network structure at a single moment in time also restricts network complexity. One might hypothesize that the number of links would accumulate over time until all species eventually interact with each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Schoenly1">[55]</xref>. However, we found that when connectance is compiled over several time steps, even if it increases slightly, it remains at low values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038295.s005">Text S5</xref>). This result supports the idea that some links between abundant species occur consistently through time, while the neutral forbidden links remain sporadic and thus do not contribute much to network structure. We also note that available data in the literature are commonly derived from restricted temporal windows, and thus record fewer links than would be found with more prolonged sampling efforts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Nielsen1">[56]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>The literature on interaction networks has largely ignored the implications of the neutral theory, despite its more widely recognized importance in structuring horizontal diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Chave1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Alonso1">[57]</xref>. We have shown that a neutral network assembly model can lead to realistic patterns of network organization such as the complexity-diversity relationship, nestedness and modularity. Beyond the neutral assumption, our results suggest that the shape of species abundance distributions creates neutral forbidden links between species, which has profound impacts on network complexity and deserves as much attention as niche-mediated constraints. Along with Krishna <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Krishna1">[29]</xref>, we advocate considering neutral interactions as a potential driver of network dynamics. We do not argue that networks are organized exclusively by neutral processes, but instead that, just as neutral and niche processes can simultaneously shape the structure of competitive communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Gravel1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Thompson1">[27]</xref>, these two forces are likely to act together to shape the structure of ecological networks. The challenge is thus no longer to assess whether niche or neutral processes operate in networks but to disentangle their relative contributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038295-Alonso1">[57]</xref>. This stresses the need for temporal data to assess the dynamics of network structure and to measure, for instance, the turnover of links over time. We view our neutral network assembly model as a useful null model, as any deviation from its predictions can be used to quantify the extent to which niche assembly processes constrain network organization.</p>
