<title/>
<p>The neurotrophins are neuropeptides that are potent regulators of neurite growth and survival. Although mainly studied in the brain and nervous system, recent reports have shown that neurotrophins are expressed in multiple target tissues and cell types throughout the body. Additionally, dysregulation of neurotrophins has been linked to several disease conditions including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, psychiatric disorders, and cancer. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family that elicits its actions through the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase type 2 (Ntrk2). Together BDNF and Ntrk2 are capable of activating the adhesion, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and proliferation pathways. These pathways are prominently involved in reproductive physiology, yet a cross-species examination of BDNF and Ntrk2 expression in the mammalian uterus is lacking. Herein we demonstrated the conserved nature of BDNF and Ntrk2 across several mammalian species by mRNA and protein sequence alignment, isolated <italic>BDNF</italic> and <italic>Ntrk2</italic> transcripts in the uterus by Real-Time PCR, localized both proteins to the glandular and luminal epithelium, vascular smooth muscle, and myometrium of the uterus, determined that the major isoforms expressed in the human endometrium were pro-BDNF, and truncated Ntrk2, and finally demonstrated antibody specificity. Our findings suggest that BDNF and Ntrk2 are transcribed, translated, and conserved across mammalian species including human, mouse, rat, pig, horse, and the bat.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one member of the neurotrophin family of secreted growth factors which also comprises nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3), and neurotrophin-4/5 (Ntf5). The neurotrophins are classically known for their participation in the development, growth, function, and survival of neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Chao1">[1]</xref>. They induce a myriad of actions by signalling through the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase family (Ntrk1 – formerly TrkA, Ntrk2 – formerly TrkB, Ntrk3 – formerly TrkC, and NGFR – formerly p75NTR). BDNF binds with a high affinity to Ntrk2, which has at least three isoforms, a full length transmembrane receptor, and two truncated receptors. Mainly studied in the nervous system, the interaction between BDNF and the full length Ntrk2 receptor has also been shown to activate adhesion, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and proliferation pathways via the ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and the phospholipase Cγ1-Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Chao1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Minichiello1">[3]</xref>. In addition to participating in many physiological processes, the neurotrophins have been linked to numerous pathologies (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, cancer) and psychiatric disorders (bipolar, schizophrenia, depression) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Chao1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Chao2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Geiger1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although abundant in the nervous system, BDNF and Ntrk2 are expressed in other cell types and tissues, and <italic>BDNF</italic> mRNA is found in the majority of the human body organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Pruunsild1">[6]</xref>. In humans, mature BDNF is sequestered in platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Yamamoto1">[7]</xref> and released upon their degranulation. As such, BDNF has access to all tissues and organs. Motile cells including activated T cells, B cells, and monocytes have been shown to express BDNF <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Kerschensteiner1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Rost1">[9]</xref>, as have eosinophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Noga1">[10]</xref>, dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Noga2">[11]</xref>, and endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Nakahashi1">[12]</xref>. In mice, the visceral epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Lommatzsch1">[13]</xref>, and airway epithelium are significant sources of BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Hahn1">[14]</xref>. As for Ntrk2, a comprehensive analysis of Ntrk2 immunoreactivity was assessed and it was found to be expressed mainly in glandular cells of the salivary gland, small intestine, colon, endocrine pancreas, bone marrow hematopoietic cells, monocytes/macrophages of the lymph nodes and spleen, and in the epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Shibayama1">[15]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that neurotrophins in the brain are regulated by neuronal activity (Ca++ influx induced transcription) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-West1">[16]</xref>, and steroid hormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Solum1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Meyer1">[20]</xref>, and that tissue-specific expression is driven by multiple promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Metsis1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the interaction between the BDNF-Ntrk2 ligand-receptor pair has been shown to activate the adhesion, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and proliferation pathways in other body systems, very few studies have addressed their physiological role in reproduction. While BDNF and Ntrk2 expression has been demonstrated in some reproductive tissues including the ovary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Anderson1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Harel1">[23]</xref>, and placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Kawamura1">[24]</xref>, their uterine expression under physiological conditions has been questionable. BDNF expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Kawamura2">[25]</xref>, and human uterus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Kawamura3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Russo1">[27]</xref> and by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Lommatzsch1">[13]</xref>, and rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-KrizsanAgbas1">[18]</xref> uterus. While Ntrk2 could not be detected in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Lommatzsch1">[13]</xref> and human uterus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Shibayama1">[15]</xref>, others have been successful <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Anger1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Huang1">[29]</xref>. To date only one study has looked for the presence of both ligand and receptor simultaneously, in the murine uterus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Lommatzsch1">[13]</xref>. Moreover, the uterine expression of BDNF and Ntrk2 has not been examined in species other than the mouse, rat, and human.</p>
<p>Herein we present a comprehensive overview of the conserved nature of BDNF and Ntrk2 expression in the uterus of several mammalian species including human, mice, rats, pigs, horses, and bats.</p>

<title>RNA and Protein Extraction</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from all mouse, rat, and human endometrial samples using the RNA/Protein Plus kit (Norgen Biotek, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The protocol was modified slightly from the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, approximately 25 mg of frozen uterus was minced with a scalpel, placed in 300 μl of lysis reagent from the kit, and disrupted on ice using a sonicator (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON, Canada) for roughly 5 seconds. Samples were centrifuged at 4°C at 13000 rpm for 2 minutes. Genomic DNA was removed using a column separator from the RNA/Protein Plus kit, and the remainder of the procedure was performed according to the protocol provided. RNA concentration and quality were assessed by spectrometry (Beckman Coulter, Mississauga, ON, Canada). RNA was extracted from horse and pig endometrium using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA concentration and purity was measured using the GeneQuant pro RNA/DNA calculator (Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK).</p>
<p>Protein extraction from human endometrium (n = 8) and mouse brain as a positive control was performed in 200 μl of RIPA buffer. The tissue was disrupted on ice using a sonicator three times, for 5 seconds. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant collected. Protein concentration was measured on a microplate reader at 595 nm using the Bio-Rad protein assay based on the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Real-Time PCR</title>
<p>RNA from mouse, rat, human, pig, and horse was reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad), according to kit protocol. PCR primers were designed using human GenBank sequences for BDNF mRNA (NM_001143809.1) and Ntrk2 mRNA (NM_006180.3). Primers were designed against a 300 bp span within the coding region of the gene, and whenever possible were designed to span an intron. Primer3 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/" xlink:type="simple">http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/</ext-link>) was used for primer design and primers were tested for hairpins, self-dimers, and hetero-dimers using OligoAnalyzer 3.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.idtdna.com/analyzer/applications/oligoanalyzer/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.idtdna.com/analyzer/applications/oligoanalyzer/</ext-link>). Primer sequences for <italic>BDNF</italic> were (Forward: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GAGCTGAGCGTGTGTGACAG</named-content>, Reverse: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTTATGAATCGCCAGCCAAT</named-content>), and for <italic>Ntrk2</italic> (Forward: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CAATTGTGGTTTGCCATCTG</named-content>, Reverse: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGCAAAATGCACAGTGAGGT</named-content>). Primers were ordered from Mobix Laboratory (McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada), and diluted to a working concentration of 10 pmol/μl with DNase/RNase free water.</p>
<p>cDNA for 3 animals per group was pooled and used to isolate <italic>BDNF</italic> and <italic>Ntrk2</italic> transcripts. Real-Time PCR was performed in triplicate in a 10 μl reaction volume (2 μl pooled cDNA, 5 μl SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen), 1 μl forward primer, 1 μl reverse primer, and 1 μl RNase/DNase free water) using the capillary-based LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC, Canada). The program was denaturation: 95°C for 15 min; amplification: 55 cycles: 95°C for 10 s, 56°C for 5 s, 72°C for 20 s; melting curve: 70–95°C at a rate of 0.1°C per second. Amplification and melt curves were analyzed for each species using the LightCycler software (Roche Diagnostics). PCR products were collected, and sent for sequencing (Laboratory Services, University of Guelph). Each sequence was searched under the BLASTN analysis on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. Sequences were submitted to NCBI GenBank (accession numbers and PCR product melting temperatures are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094036-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Extracted protein (60 μg) from human endometrium was run on a 4–20% gradient gel (Thermo-Scientific) at 150 V for 50 minutes. Protein was transferred to PVDF membrane (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada) at 40 V for 90 minutes. Blots were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with 5% skim milk/TBS-T, and subsequently probed with 1∶1000 rabbit anti-BDNF (Abcam) or 1∶1000 rabbit anti-Ntrk2 (Abcam), overnight at 4°C. Anti-Rabbit-ECL secondary (GE, Mississauga, ON, Canada) at a concentration of 1∶5000 was applied for 1 hour at room temperature, blots were briefly washed in TBS-T and TBS, then incubated with ECL substrate (Thermo-Scientific) for 5 minutes. Exposures were performed using x-ray film (Thermo-Scientific), and the exposure times were 60, and 45 minutes for BDNF and Ntrk2 respectively.</p>

<p>When the coding regions of the BDNF and Ntrk2 genes were compared, they were very homologous between the species examined (human, mouse, rat, pig, horse). The mRNA for both genes had less homology between species as compared to the protein. BDNF mRNA ranged from 90–98% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094036-t002">Table 2</xref>), and protein from 95–99% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094036-t003">Table 3</xref>).

A 25 kDa band was observed in the mouse brain, but not in the human uterus. A band of approximately 35 kDa was seen in all women, and in the mouse brain. However, in the uterine homogenates a doublet was found as compared to a single band in the mouse brain, and in patient 5. Blots were subsequently stripped and probed for beta-actin as a loading control.</p>

<title>Ntrk2 isolation in the Human Uterus by Western Blot</title>
<p>The same samples of human endometrium and mouse brain were probed for Ntrk2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094036-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) expression by Western Blot. A single or double band of roughly 40 kDa were observed in some women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094036-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) and in mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094036-g006">Figure 6B:</xref> 9). A larger band of approximately 55 kDa, which was much more abundant in the mouse brain, was observed in all endometrial samples as a faint double band. A 100 kDa band which was heavily expressed in the mouse brain was observed in all uterine homogenates. Finally, a larger band of 120 kDa was seen in the positive control, and very faintly in a few of the human uteri. Blots were stripped and probed for beta-actin as a loading control.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, using complementary molecular techniques, we demonstrated the conservation of the coding region of BDNF and Ntrk2 across several mammalian species, the mRNA expression of both genes within the uterus, and the uterine localization of both proteins in two species that menstruate (humans and bats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Zhang1">[34]</xref>), and four that do not (mice, rats, pigs, and horses). Additionally, we have shown that several protein isoforms of each gene were present in the human uterus, and that the antibodies employed in this study were specific to BDNF and Ntrk2 respectively. BDNF and Ntrk2 are part of the complex messenger system that is the neurotrophins, which regulate several physiological pathways, and thus we suggest are potentially important to uterine function.</p>
<p>Our results show that both BDNF and Ntrk2 are highly conserved across the mammalian species studied, with protein sequences having greater homology than mRNA sequences. This was not entirely unexpected, as in some cases multiple codons exist for a single amino acid, and thus a base-pair substitution in the mRNA sequence might not alter the protein. Over time, as each of the species studied evolved, silent mutations in the genes likely arose. During evolution, Gotz et al., suggest that BDNF was more highly conserved than NGF across vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Gotz1">[35]</xref>. In our study the PCR primer pairs designed to isolate <italic>BDNF</italic> and <italic>Ntrk2</italic> were capable of doing so in the uterus of all animals (except for <italic>Ntrk2</italic> in the porcine uterus), and both antibodies employed in this study demonstrated specific uterine immunoreactivity for BDNF and Ntrk2 in each of the six mammals examined, supporting high sequence homology amongst orthologs over evolution.</p>
<p>Antibody specificity in the current study was ascertained in two ways. Firstly, by ensuring bands of the appropriate size were seen when Western blot was performed with human recombinant BDNF and Ntrk2. Secondly, mouse brain sections (positive control tissue) were stained for BDNF and Ntrk2 with primary antibodies which had been pre-absorbed with BDNF and Ntrk2, respectively. In sections incubated with pre-absorbed BDNF primary antibodies the staining was less intense than the positive control, which had been stained with anti-BDNF, but more intense than the negative control. Ideally pre-absorption obliterates all staining as the antibody should be completely bound by the excess protein. In the case of pre-absorbed BDNF, some of the BDNF bound to the anti-BDNF antibody may have bound to endogenous Ntrk2 receptors, and thus given a faint signal when the secondary antibody was applied. Ntrk2 staining in the mouse brain was obliterated by pre-absorption. The results of the antibody specificity tests indicated that the antibodies used for immunohistochemistry and Western blot were specific and capable of detecting BDNF and Ntrk2 within the mammalian uterus.</p>
<p>While there are a few studies demonstrating the independent expression of BDNF and Ntrk2 in the uterus, the results of the present study are the first to show that both ligand and receptor are co-expressed, and co-localized in the uterus of several mammalian species. Our results show BDNF and Ntrk2 expression in the glandular epithelium, luminal epithelium, vascular smooth muscle, and myometrium of the human, mouse, rat, pig, and bat uterus. A similar pattern of expression was also observed in the uterus of the pregnant mare. This is the first comprehensive and cross-species comparison of BDNF and Ntrk2 mRNA, and protein in the mammalian uterus. Even though BDNF expression has been seen in uterine pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Bao1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Browne1">[37]</xref>, BDNF and Ntrk2 expression in the non-pregnant, healthy uterus has been equivocal. Although there are sparse reports of BDNF in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Lommatzsch1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Kawamura2">[25]</xref>, rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-KrizsanAgbas1">[18]</xref>, and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Kawamura3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Russo1">[27]</xref> uterus, and Ntrk2 in the human uterus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Anger1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Huang1">[29]</xref>, others have not been able to localize the Ntrk receptor family in the murine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Lommatzsch1">[13]</xref> nor human uterus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Shibayama1">[15]</xref>. However, the latter study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Shibayama1">[15]</xref> published in 1996, may not have been able to detect Ntrk2 owing to limitations in the sensitivity of PCR techniques then available. Additionally, the co-localization of BDNF and Ntrk2 demonstrated in this study contrasts the results of Lommatzsch et al. (1999) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Lommatzsch1">[13]</xref>, where <italic>BDNF</italic> mRNA was only observed in the uterine epithelium and stroma, not myometrium, and Ntrk2 immunoreactivity was not observed at all. Again, this may have been due to methodological limitations. The probe designed for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization may not have detected all forms of BDNF (pre-, pro-, etc.), and if that particular form was present in the myometrium it would have falsely appeared negative. Also, Ntrk2 appears to exist in low abundance in the uterus; the exposure length to obtain a positive Western blot band is one hour, after loading 60 μg of protein homogenate. Perhaps the antibody used in the previous report was not as sensitive as the antibody employed in this study.</p>
<p>Neurotrophin signalling and regulation is complicated for several reasons: each receptor can bind more than one ligand with varying affinity, multiple splice and transcript variants of ligands and receptors exist, several post-translational modifications may be present, ligands are first translated as pro-proteins which bind receptors, and ligands can exist as monomers or dimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Chao1">[1]</xref>. Thus, the expression of BDNF and Ntrk2 were demonstrated by Western blot in the human endometrium to gain insight into which isoform predominates. A doublet band of roughly 35 kDa was found to be the most widely expressed form of BDNF in the uterus. These bands are likely pro-BDNF which has previously been reported to have a similar mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Teng1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Gray1">[39]</xref>. Smaller bands of approximately 15 kDa likely represent the mature form of BDNF, and are less abundant than the larger bands. It has been suggested that pro-BDNF and mature BDNF have opposing functions. Specifically, pro-BDNF inhibits nerve growth and BDNF promotes and sustains it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Koshimizu1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Sun1">[41]</xref>. As for Ntrk2, variability was seen between patients for the bands lower than 100 kDa, but a band at approximately 100 kDa was consistent amongst them all. This band likely represents a truncated version, of which there are two at 95 kDa, of the 140 kDa receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Klein1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Baxter1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>We speculate that the abundant BDNF and Ntrk2 isoforms found in the human uterus may serve to inhibit the classical BDNF-Ntrk2 pathways, and also prevent nerve growth into a tissue that is degraded and shed in a cyclical manner. However, the degree to which nerves innervate the endometrial layer of the uterus under physiological and pathological conditions remains under debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Newman1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Donnez1">[50]</xref>. In support of our hypothesis, expression of the truncated Ntrk2 was capable of inhibiting sensory nerve innervation of the mammary gland in response to mature BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Liu1">[51]</xref>. BDNF and Ntrk2 have also previously been shown to activate the adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Geiger1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Zhou1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Cassens1">[55]</xref>, angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Nakamura1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Kermani1">[57]</xref>, apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Geiger1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Douma1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Wang1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Lee1">[60]</xref>, and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Kawamura5">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Tervonen1">[61]</xref> pathways, mainly in the brain and nervous system. Each of these pathways is also of paramount importance in the reproductive processes of the female mammal. However, little is known about the role of BDNF and Ntrk2 in reproductive physiology. While the literature supporting BDNF expression, particularly in the brain and serum, during pregnancy is growing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Garces1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-SchulteHerbruggen1">[65]</xref>, its specific function is still unclear. One group has reported that paracrine BDNF/Ntrk2 signalling induced cytotrophoblast differentiation, proliferation, and survival in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Kawamura2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-Kawamura4">[30]</xref>, while another showed that BDNF inhibited neurite outgrowth in a superior cervical ganglion/myometrium explant co-culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094036-KrizsanAgbas1">[18]</xref>. While the role of BDNF/Ntrk2 in reproductive physiology remains a mystery we suggest that this signaling pathway is potentially important in normal uterine physiology and pathology.</p>
<p>Herein we have given a complete and comprehensive overview of BDNF and Ntrk2 in the mammalian uterus. Firstly, gene conservation was demonstrated for both BDNF and Ntrk2 across species. Secondly, transcripts for both <italic>BDNF</italic> and <italic>Ntrk2</italic> were isolated in the uterus of several mammals. Thirdly, the antibodies were confirmed to be specific for the proteins of interest. Fourthly, protein translation and localization was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in menstruating and non-menstruating species, and finally the prominent BDNF and Ntrk2 isoforms were identified in the human endometrium. As several of the major pathways central to reproductive biology have been reported to be induced by BDNF-Ntrk2 binding, we suggest that the function of this ligand-receptor pair within the mammalian uterus merits further attention.</p>
