We attempt to test this hypothesis by examining effect of sensory neuron-derived endogenous BDNF on the regeneration of ascending sensory neurons. We use sensory neurons as the model for the following reasons. First, sensory neurons straddle peripheral and central nervous systems and thus can bypass the BBB when BDNF is applied to the peripheral nerves. Secondly, following peripheral nerve injury, BDNF is upregulated in sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Zhou1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Lee1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Sebert1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Michael1">[31]</xref> and the upregulation of BDNF causes an increased anterograde transport of BDNF into the spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Tonra1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Zhou2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Wang1">[32]</xref>. Thirdly, sensory neurons express BDNF receptors trkB, trkC and p75NTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Ibanez1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Foster1">[34]</xref> which are essential for the internalization and axonal transport of BDNF. Fourthly, the role of BDNF in the regeneration of sensory neurons in the spinal cord is controversial as several previous studies showed that the delivery of exogenous BDNF into the spinal cord does not promote the regeneration of dorsal root into the spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Bradbury1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Ramer1">[10]</xref>, most likely due to the suppressive sequestration by truncated trkB on astrocytes. In the present study, we also examined the effects of exogenous BDNF injected into the sciatic nerve or peripheral tissues (footpad) on the regeneration of ascending sensory neurons and on the functional recovery after spinal cord injury. We found that in contrast to the application of BDNF into the spinal cord, peripherally derived (applied) BDNF is effective in promoting the regeneration of ascending sensory neurons and functional recovery. We propose that peripherally derived BDNF may have a therapeutic potential for the spinal cord injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Upregulation of BDNF immunoreactivity in the spinal cord and DRG on the conditioning lesion side</title><p>Immunohistochemical examination of spinal cord specimens showed that the BDNF expression was different in animals with or without preconditioning lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001707-g001">Figure. 1</xref>).

Two paradigms were used to test the hypothesis. The first was to induce BDNF upregulation by lesioning sciatic nerve and by using the BDNF neutralizing antibody to block peripheral BDNF. The enhanced regeneration of sensory neurons by conditioning sciatic nerve lesion was almost completely blocked by peripheral injection of the BDNF antiserum. The second was to deliver exogenous BDNF into the sciatic nerve or peripheral tissues in the spinal cord injury model. Peripheral application of BDNF not only promotes the regeneration of ascending sensory neurons but also promotes the functional recovery after spinal cord injury.</p><p>The phenomenon that conditioning lesion increases the intrinsic growth capability of adult sensory neurons was discovered many years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-McQuarrie1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-McQuarrie2">[46]</xref> and confirmed by studies using spinal cord injury as a model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Richardson1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Neumann1">[22]</xref>. These discoveries have generated great interest because the conditioning lesion can be used as a model to investigate the mechanisms of why CNS fails to regenerate after injury. In the present study, we examined whether increased expression of BDNF in sensory neurons plays a critical role in the enhanced regeneration in this model. We found that in the conditioning lesion model, most regenerated neurons express BDNF but not p75NTR. The neutralization of endogenous BDNF with BDNF antibodies <italic>in vivo</italic> dramatically blocked the enhanced regeneration of sensory neurons and reduced the expression of GAP-43 in sensory neurons. Neurite growth assay in the presence of BDNF antibody <italic>in vitro</italic> showed the significant reduction in the neurite growth of conditioning lesioned DRG neurons.</p><p>Several pieces of evidence support the notion that peripherally derived BDNF may play a role in the regeneration of ascending sensory neurons. We found that BDNF is accumulated in the spinal cord stump caudal to the lesion site. Quantitative data showed that the level of BDNF was higher in the ipsilateral stump caudal to the lesion site and in the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord. These results are consistent with increased expression of BDNF in the DRG and spinal cord after sciatic nerve injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Zhou1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Michael1">[31]</xref> and consistent with the anterograde transport of BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Zhou2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Lessmann1">[47]</xref>. Current data with ELISA assay technique also showed increased level of BDNF in the ipsilateral DRG one week after sciatic nerve lesion. The pattern of BDNF expression suggests that the increased BDNF from spinal cord regions may be partially derived from the anterograde transport from DRG. In fact, previous studies showed that sciatic nerve lesion increased BDNF anterograde transport in the sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Curtis1">[16]</xref>.

These results are very exciting and surprising because the dogmatic view believes peripherally-derived neurotrophic factor would not be able to act on CNS. Furthermore, we found that injected BDNF into the footpad accumulated within the nerve terminals and in the sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001707.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Exogenous BDNF to the peripheral sensory neurons would not only directly activate peripheral sensory neurons and promote their regeneration after central axon injury, but also could be transported transganglionically into the spinal cord. The regeneration of ascending sensory neurons promoted by peripheral administration of BDNF may have clinical significance as an injection of BDNF into the footpad is simple and clinically practical in patients. The surgical procedure and possible inflammation due to the delivery process had no effect on the regeneration. Whether the exogenous BDNF has any effects on the regeneration of descending neurons needs further investigation, but this is likely as we found more GAP-43 labeled fibres in the injury site in the BDNF treated group than the BSA group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001707.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p>Our results that exogenous BDNF is effective for the regeneration of ascending sensory neurons after spinal cord injury are in contrast with those of exogenous BDNF in a dorsal root injury model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Bradbury1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Ramer1">[10]</xref>, where the delivery of exogenous BDNF into the spinal fluid had no effect on the regrowth of damaged axons across the dorsal root entry zone and into the spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Bradbury2">[57]</xref>. Our finding is also in contrast to the recent study showing endogenous trkB ligands (BDNF and NT4) suppress the functional mechanosensory plasticity (sprouting) in the deafferented spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Ramer2">[58]</xref>. This contradiction may be due to the different capacity in diffusion of BDNF in CNS and PNS. It is known that truncated trkB expressed by astrocytes prevents the diffusion of BDNF into the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Frisn1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Biffo1">[8]</xref> whereas BDNF injected into periphery can freely diffuse and acts on sensory nerves and terminals. The studies on BDNF with other delivery methods further support this notion. Genetically modified cells secreting BDNF promoted axonal regrowth across transected adult rat spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Qiu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Menei1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Jin1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Liu2">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Koda1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Blesch1">[63]</xref>. In addition, BDNF directly delivered to cell bodies was able to promote axonal regeneration in chronically injured spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Kwon1">[64]</xref>. These delivery methods for BDNF overcome the diffusion barrier and thus showed positive roles for the regeneration of the spinal cord.</p><p>BDNF may promote the regeneration of sensory neurons by increasing intracellular cAMP and down-stream signal CREB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Gao1">[65]</xref>. Intraganglionic cAMP injection can mimic the effect of conditioning peripheral nerve lesion to promote the regeneration of central branch in the injured spinal cord. Indeed the level of cAMP in the DRG was increased after conditioning peripheral lesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Qiu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Neumann2">[25]</xref>, and myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG)/myelin no longer inhibited axonal growth, which is protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent. Injection of cAMP into DRG can also mimic all these effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Qiu1">[24]</xref>. It was reported previously that neurotrophins elevated the intracellular levels of neuronal cAMP and neurons primed with neurotrophins were able to overcome the growth inhibition from MAG or myelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Cai1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Song1">[66]</xref>. Most recently it was discovered that neurotrophins activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) in a Trk-dependent way and activated Erk inhibited phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4). Inhibition of PDE4 allows cAMP to be elevated and, consequently, to overcome axonal growth inhibition from MAG or myelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Gao2">[67]</xref>. In the present study, we found that after conditioning sciatic nerve lesion the majority of regenerating sensory neurons expressed BDNF and p-CREB but not p75NTR. Our previous studies showed that sciatic nerve transection significantly increased p75NTR in glia but decreased p75NTR in neurons in the DRG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Zhou3">[35]</xref>. p75NTR expression in glial cells may have a role in nerve regeneration opposing that in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-KoichiTomita1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Zhou6">[69]</xref>. Our data suggest that sciatic nerve lesion-induced differential expression of p75NTR in neurons and glia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001707-Wang2">[70]</xref> may play a partial role in the enhanced regeneration of ascending sensory neurons.</p><p>In summary, conditioning sciatic nerve lesion induced the upregulation of BDNF in the DRG and in the injured spinal cord. Blockade of endogenous BDNF <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> suppressed the enhanced neurite growth and regeneration of sensory neurons induced by conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve. Peripheral administration of exogenous BDNF promotes regeneration of sensory neurons and functional recovery after spinal cord injury.
