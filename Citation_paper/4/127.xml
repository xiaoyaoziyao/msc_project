          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Cellular senescence can be a functional barrier to carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that inflammation modulates carcinogenesis through senescence and DNA damage response (DDR). We examined the association between senescence and DDR with macrophage levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments tested the ability of macrophages to induce senescence in primary cells. Inflammation modulating microRNAs were identified in senescence colon tissue for further investigation.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Quantitative immunohistochemistry identified protein expression by colon cell type. Increased cellular senescence (HP1γ; P = 0.01) or DDR (γH2A.X; P = 0.031, phospho-Chk2, P = 0.014) was associated with high macrophage infiltration in UC. Co-culture with macrophages (ANA-1) induced senescence in &gt;80% of primary cells (fibroblasts MRC5, WI38), illustrating that macrophages induce senescence. Interestingly, macrophage-induced senescence was partly dependent on nitric oxide synthase, and clinically relevant NO• levels alone induced senescence. NO• induced DDR <italic>in vitro</italic>, as detected by immunofluorescence. In contrast to UC, we noted in Crohn’s disease (CD) that senescence (HP1γ; P&lt;0.001) and DDR (γH2A.X; P&lt;0.05, phospho-Chk2; P&lt;0.001) were higher, and macrophages were not associated with senescence. We hypothesize that nitric oxide may modulate senescence in CD; epithelial cells of CD had higher levels of NOS2 expression than in UC (P = 0.001). Microarrays and quantitative-PCR identified miR-21 expression associated with macrophage infiltration and NOS2 expression.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Senescence was observed in IBD with senescence-associated β-galactosidase and HP1γ. Macrophages were associated with senescence and DDR in UC, and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with primary human cells showed that macrophages induce senescence, partly through NO•, and that NO• can induce DDR associated with senescence. Future experiments will investigate the role of NO• and miR-21 in senescence. This is the first study to implicate macrophages and nitrosative stress in a direct effect on senescence and DDR, which is relevant to many diseases of inflammation, cancer, and aging.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with high morbidity, poor quality of life and an increased risk of colon cancer in over 3.5 million people in the United States and Europe, with a steadily growing prevalence in Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Loftus1">[1]</xref>. The most important risk factors for colon cancer development in IBD patients are duration and extent of inflammation. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), a subtype of IBD, develop colon cancer with a five-fold overall relative risk compared to population controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Ekbom1">[2]</xref>. Colon tissue from IBD patients has been used to study the relationship between inflammation and cancer, with an emphasis on DNA damage. IBD is associated with increased etheno-DNA adducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Nair1">[3]</xref>, microsatellite instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Hofseth1">[4]</xref>, p53 mutational load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Hussain1">[5]</xref> and clonal expansion of cells with mutations in polyguanine tracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Salk1">[6]</xref>. UC tissues show initial activation of p53 in response to nitric oxide (NO•) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Hofseth2">[7]</xref>, and eventual inactivation of p53 with increasing mutation load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Hussain1">[5]</xref>, resulting in a pattern of mutation unique compared to spontaneous colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Ambs1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Evidence suggests that senescence acts as a barrier to carcinogenesis in UC and that this barrier is reduced in dysplastic lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Risques1">[9]</xref>. Inflamed colons from UC patients have increased expression of the DNA damage response pathway (DDR) sensor protein γH2A.X <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Risques2">[10]</xref>, which leads to activation of the stress-associated p53 pathway. DDR is implicated in the induction of premature cellular senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Bartkova1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Bartkova2">[12]</xref>, independently of telomere length, which classically regulates senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Jones1">[13]</xref> in cellular aging.

      <p>Macrophages are a key component of a chronic inflammatory response and constitute part of the heterogeneous population of cells in tumors.

We quantified macrophages in the lamina propria using quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) to identify macrophage numbers within the mucosa (i.e. macrophage infiltration). Levels of macrophage infiltration were correlated to DDR and senescence. Normal colonic epithelial cells can produce endogenous NO•, thus we also measured levels of NOS2 by IHC in the epithelium.

            <p>Normal human fibroblasts (WI38 and MRC5) were grown in coculture with murine macrophages (ANA-1), or with the NO• donor spermine NONOate (Sper/NO•). Senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity was used to determine to the percent of senescent fibroblasts divided by the number of total fibroblasts. Results are shown from three experiments, with each experiment done in triplicate. (A) Normal human fibroblasts were cocultured with macrophages, with and without the NO• synthase inhibitor L-NAME (500 µM). Macrophages induced senescence in WI38 and MRC5 cells. Senescence was partially abrogated by L-NAME in WI38 and MRC5 cells. (B) The NO• synthase inhibitor L-NAME reduces diffused NO• in media of cocultures comprised of normal human fibroblasts (WI38 or MRC5) and macrophages (ANA-1). 100 µl of media from three separate cocultures was aliquoted with 100 µL of 5 µM of DAF in 96-well plates. Plates were read for DAF-fluorescence as an indicator of NO•. Addition of the NO• inhibitor L-NAME resulted in decreased levels of NO• in both WI38 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008) and MRC5 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) cells. Fluorescence measurements from cocultures were normalized by subtracting the DAF fluorescence measured in media from wells with fibroblasts only. (C) Fibroblasts were dosed with 0.09 µM, 3 µM and 10 µM Sper/NO•, Sper/NO• that was previously incubated in media with sodium hydroxide (vehicle) for 48 hours (exhausted donor), and media alone (negative control) overnight (16 hrs). These concentrations were selected to achieve steady state concentrations of 4.5 nM, 15 nM and 50 nM NO• respectively. 10 µM and 3 µM Sper/NO• induced significant levels of senescence (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001).

        <p>To determine if NO• produced by macrophages may be capable of inducing senescence in stromal fibroblasts, macrophages and fibroblasts were cocultured in media with and without the NO• synthase inhibitor <italic>N</italic>-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 500 µM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis). DAF-FM diacetate (4-amino-5-methylamino-2′, 7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate; DAF, Invitrogen, Carlsbad) was used to assess the amount of NO• diffused into the media of cocultured cells. As expected, L-NAME led to decreased NO• present in the media of cocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044156-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; WI38, <italic>P</italic> = 0.008, MRC5; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03).

        <p>To determine if NO• alone could induce cellular senescence, normal human fibroblasts were exposed to clinically relevant levels of NO• and examined for SA-βgal activity. To achieve target steady state levels of 4.5 nM, 15 nM and 50 nM NO•, fibroblasts were incubated with 0.9 µM, 3 µM and 10 µM of the NO• donor Spermine NONOate (Sper/NO•). These doses were chosen because they are consistent with known levels of steady state NO• secreted by macrophages in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Espey1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Ridnour1">[36]</xref> and levels of NO• detected in ulcerative colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Lundberg1">[37]</xref>. NO• concentrations at or below 50 nM are below the limit of detection for our NO• gas analyzer. To confirm that Sper/NO• was producing NO• levels near our target concentration, we measured NO• produced by 100 µM Sper/NO• (expected concentration of 500 nM NO•) and found steady state levels of 380 nM NO• at 4 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044156.s007">Figure S7</xref>; SD ±35 nM; n = 3), similar to the expected concentrations calculated from our previously published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Thomas2">[29]</xref>.

        <p>Macrophages were associated with senescence in epithelial cells in UC, but thus far we could not identify a driver of senescence in CD. Based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies that identified NO• as an inducer or senescence, we hypothesized that NO•, secreted by macrophages and produced by epithelial cells themselves may modulate senescence. To study this model of extracellular and intracellular-induced senescence, IHC for NOS2 was performed on tissue. Significantly more epithelial cells were positive for NOS2 in CD than in UC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044156-g004">Figure 4</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0017) while no significant difference was observed comparing stromal cells of CD and UC. Increased levels of epithelial NOS2 in CD were consistent with an increase in senescence-associated HP1γ in CD compared to UC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044156-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We were not able to stratify CD tissues to investigate if epithelial cell NOS2 expression correlated with senescence because all CD tissues had high senescence, possibly due to the combined effects of NO• from macrophages and intracellular NO• from epithelial cells. There are no primary epithelial cells of a colonic origin to test our proposal that NO• from epithelial cells is directly related to senescence <italic>in vitro</italic>.

        <p>After establishing that macrophages are associated with senescence in UC, and directly induce senescence in an NO•-dependent fashion <italic>in vitro</italic>, we performed microRNA microarray expression analysis on RNA extracted from both UC and CD tissues to identify candidate microRNAs which may have a role in senescence.

        <p>Colon adenomas are premalignant lesions in which high levels of cellular senescence serves as a barrier to a malignant transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Bartkova2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Kuilman1">[38]</xref>. In order to identify microRNAs whose expression is associated with cellular senescence in multiple disease states, we examined microRNAs expression patterns in senescent adenomas to compare to senescent-associated microRNAs from UC and CD. As expected, adenomas expressed high levels of senescence-associated HP1γ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044156.s003">Figure S3E</xref>) and we previously have shown that these adenomas are positive for SA-βgal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Fujita1">[39]</xref>. This confirms high levels of cellular senescence in these tissues. We next performed microRNA microarray profiling of colonic adenomas and paired normal tissue, and compared these results with our findings in IBD. Among the 31 microRNAs altered in adenomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044156-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044156.s012">Table S3</xref>), miR-21 had the highest fold change increase in adenomas, consistent with our previous qRT-PCR data on miR-21 in adenomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Schetter1">[40]</xref>. MiR-21 was the only microRNA that was associated with both NOS2 and CD68 in IBD; thus miR-21 is commonly associated with macrophages linked to senescence in IBD and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and NO• which induces senescence <italic>in vitro</italic>. We have previously reported that miR-21 expression is associated with NOS2 expression in colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Schetter2">[41]</xref> providing more confidence that this association is relevant.

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Cellular senescence is one of the many links between aging and cancer, and may occur through several mechanisms including telomere dysfunction and oncogenic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-DePinho1">[42]</xref>. UC has been theorized to be a disease of cellular aging, based on evidence of telomere attrition and chromosomal instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Risques2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-OSullivan1">[43]</xref>. We found that senescence-associated HP1γ expression in colonic epithelia was increased in UC colons in association with a high number of macrophages. This association is consistent with the hypothesis that macrophages may directly or indirectly induce cellular senescence in adjacent epithelial cells, which we observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our findings suggest that in addition to cell intrinsic mechanisms such as replicative telomere shortening, microenvironmental cues such as infiltrating immune cells and their derived factors may regulate epithelial cell senescence in cancer-prone lesions. This is consistent with a recent report associating high levels of infiltrating lymphocytes with telomere shortening and senescence in UC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Risques3">[44]</xref>. Stromal senescent fibroblasts can also secrete proinflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-6, IL-8 and Gro-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Campisi3">[45]</xref> that can contribute to IBD, consistent with our observations.</p>
        <p>High macrophage infiltration was associated with increases in the DDR sensor molecule γH2A.X, an indicator of active DNA damage response signaling by upstream DDR kinases including ATM and ATR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Rogakou1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Jackson1">[47]</xref>, and phosphorylation of downstream stress response protein Chk2 in colonic epithelial cells of inflamed, cancer-prone tissue of UC patients. The increased level of γ-H2A.X in UC colon, when compared to normal colon, is consistent with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Risques2">[10]</xref> and suggests that DDR may lead to cellular senescence in a proinflammatory environment. It is not clear if the DDR response associated with macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic>, and induced by NO• <italic>in vitro,</italic> is pro- or anti-carcinogenic, but DDR has previously been hypothesized to be an anti-cancer barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Bartkova1">[11]</xref>. It is possible that macrophages and/or NO• induce the DDR pathway leading to cellular senescence, and limiting proliferation of cells as a barrier to cancer. Alternatively, senescent cells in the microenvironment may themselves be procarcinogenic by secreting cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-1α and IL-1β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Kuilman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Coppe1">[48]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest that macrophages induce cellular senescence in a NO• dependent manner. Macrophages or clinically relevant concentrations of NO• induce cellular senescence in normal human fibroblasts and the NO• synthase inhibitor L-NAME proportionally reduced both NO• and senescence. L-NAME is often considered a nonselective NO• synthase inhibitor, but it has been previously shown to more efficiently block NO• production from NOS3. NOS3 is known to be important in the regulation of NOS2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Connelly1">[49]</xref>, thus we hypothesize that L-NAME may decrease the amount of NO• by inhibiting NOS3 activity and down regulating NOS2 expression. This may be especially relevant at the low levels of steady state NO• (50–100 nmol) expected with 10 µM of Sper/NO• <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Thomas3">[50]</xref>. NO• has been implicated in the activation of the DDR pathway in cell lines and primary cells of patients with Barrett’s esophagus. Specifically, NO• donor MAHMA-NONOate induces γH2A.X in Barrett’s esophagus non-dysplastic, high-grade dysplastic, and adenocarcinoma cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Clemons1">[51]</xref>. Interestingly, Dickey <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that NO• induces γH2A.X <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that γH2A.X is induced in unexposed cells adjacent to cells exposed to irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Dickey1">[52]</xref>. We have also shown that NO• induces γH2A.X in normal human fibroblasts.</p>
        <p>NOS2 is increased in colon adenomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Ambs1">[8]</xref>; when NOS2 is overexpressed in p53 wild type cells, p53 accumulates and induces a negative feedback loop that down regulates NOS2 expression to decrease nitrosative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Forrester1">[53]</xref>. In contrast, NOS2 overexpression of NOS2 in p53 mutant cells leads to increased angiogenesis and tumorigenicity of human cancer cells as xenografts in immunosuppressed mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Ambs2">[54]</xref>. We hypothesize that NOS2 expression in IBD patients with intact and activated p53 serves as a barrier to carcinogenesis, based on the literature and our <italic>in vitro</italic> data that NO• induces senescence and DDR. However, once p53 is inactivated in IBD by mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Hussain1">[5]</xref>, nitrosative stress induced by NOS2 may not induce senescence due to loss of p53, and may become procarcinogenic. We plan to investigate these hypotheses should <italic>in vitro</italic> models with primary epithelial cells lines become available.</p>
        <p>The miR-146a/b family of microRNAs that are elevated in senescent fibroblasts and thought to modulate senescence through effects on IL-6 and IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Bhaumik1">[55]</xref>. We find that miR-146 expression correlates to NOS2 expression levels in IBD tissues, consistent with a role for miR-146 and NO• in senescence. MiR-21 is an oncogenic microRNA with known roles in inflammation, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We found that miR-21 expression is associated with high NOS2 and CD68 expression in UC and CD, as well as colon adenomas. Mir-21 has previously been shown to be increased in active ulcerative colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Wu1">[56]</xref> and upregulated during DNA damage by hydrogen peroxide and ionizing radiation associated with reactive oxygen species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Simone1">[57]</xref>. Inflammatory stimuli, such as <italic>Corynebacterium parvum</italic>-induced inflammation in mice, results in elevated levels of miR-21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Mathe1">[58]</xref>. MiR-21 can activate the NO• pathway <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Weber1">[59]</xref> and miR-21 levels can be regulated by NF-kappaB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Shin1">[60]</xref>. Our data suggests that miR-21 may have a role in senescence, although future studies are needed to confirm these results in a second population using a more sensitive assay like RT-PCR, and in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to show a direct effect. While at first a role in senescence may seem counterintuitive given the oncogenic role of miR-21, other oncogenes, including RAS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-DeNicola1">[61]</xref>, have roles in oncogene-induced senescence. Interestingly, the RAS pathway has been shown to increase miR-21 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Frezzetti1">[62]</xref>, and NO• can activate the RAS pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Oliveira1">[63]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that in IBD, NO• leads to RAS activation and miR-21 transcription that is in part responsible for senescence in IBD. Future studies should explore if miR-21 is induced by NO• in a RAS-dependent manner and contributes to senescence.</p>
        <p>Our study revealed a significance difference in senescence between CD and UC; higher HP1γ-associated senescence was observed in CD than in UC, and may reflect a critical difference between these two chronic inflammatory diseases. Genome wide association studies have shown thus far that some susceptibility loci are shared by both UC and CD, while others are solely associated with one but not the other disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Abraham1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Rivas1">[67]</xref>. For example, inflammatory pathways involving IL-23/IL-17 are both implicated in UC and CD, but <italic>NOD2</italic> is associated solely with CD. <italic>NOD2</italic> is required for tolerization of macrophages to bacterial peptides, including ligands for TLR2 and TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Hedl1">[68]</xref>. Macrophages from CD Leu1007insC Nod2 homozygote individuals fail to develop tolerance to repeated stimulation with ligands, leading to the production of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Hedl1">[68]</xref>. Mice carrying a similar variant of NOD2 have elevated levels of NF-kappaB and IL-1βin response to MDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Maeda1">[69]</xref>. TNFα and IL-1β both contribute to NOS2 expression and NO• production <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Espey1">[35]</xref>, and IL-8 has been shown to be a prosenescent cytokine important to senescence induced by DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Coppe1">[48]</xref>. The presence of senescence cells can cause age-related, chronic conditions in addition to inhibiting carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Baker1">[70]</xref>. We summarize these data in a model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044156.s009">Figure S9</xref>), and propose that regulation of NO• by proinflammatory cytokines contributes to up regulation of the DNA damage response pathway and senescence based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays.</p>
        <p>Our findings related to inflammatory bowel disease may be applicable to other precancerous states associated with inflammation, and also those associated with oncogenic stress. Macrophages have long been implicated in association with tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044156-Pollard1">[27]</xref>, and many questions remain on how immunity is involved in carcinogenesis. Before now, there had been no direct connection established between macrophages or NO• and senescence. Future studies may focus on the modulation of senescence through immune response to improve cancer outcome.</p>
