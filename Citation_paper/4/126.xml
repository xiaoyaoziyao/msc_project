        <p>Aging is the main risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, the aspects of the aging process that predispose the brain to the development of AD are largely unknown. Astrocytes perform a myriad of functions in the central nervous system to maintain homeostasis and support neuronal function. <italic>In vitro</italic>, human astrocytes are highly sensitive to oxidative stress and trigger a senescence program when faced with multiple types of stress. In order to determine whether senescent astrocytes appear <italic>in vivo</italic>, brain tissue from aged individuals and patients with AD was examined for the presence of senescent astrocytes using p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression as markers of senescence. Compared with fetal tissue samples (<italic>n</italic> = 4), a significant increase in p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-positive astrocytes was observed in subjects aged 35 to 50 years (<italic>n</italic> = 6; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) and 78 to 90 years (<italic>n</italic> = 11; <italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>). In addition, the frontal cortex of AD patients (<italic>n</italic> = 15) harbored a significantly greater burden of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-positive astrocytes compared with non-AD adult control subjects of similar ages (<italic>n</italic> = 25; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) and fetal controls (<italic>n</italic> = 4; <italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>). Consistent with the senescent nature of the p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-positive astrocytes, increased metalloproteinase MMP-1 correlated with p16<sup>INK4a</sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, beta-amyloid 1–42 (Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>) triggered senescence, driving the expression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase. In addition, we found that senescent astrocytes produce a number of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), which seems to be regulated by p38MAPK. We propose that an accumulation of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-positive senescent astrocytes may link increased age and increased risk for sporadic AD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60–80% of all cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Thies1">[1]</xref>. The disease is characterized by brain atrophy, extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, intra-neuronal accumulation of phosphorylated tau, neuronal and synaptic loss, and inflammation. Despite being the focus of intense research, the cause of AD, especially sporadic AD, is still unclear. The greatest risk factor for AD is aging, although the mechanism underlying the contribution of aging to the development AD is poorly understood.</p>
      <p>A recent development in the basic biology of aging, with possible implications for AD, is the recognition that senescent cells accumulate <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Herbig1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Michaloglou1">[4]</xref>. Although senescent cells increase with age in several tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Jeyapalan2">[5]</xref>, little is known about the potential appearance of senescent cells in the brain. The senescence process is an irreversible growth arrest that can be triggered by various events including telomere dysfunction, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and oncogene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Rodier1">[6]</xref>. Although it was once thought that senescent cells simply lack function, it is now known that senescent cells are functionally altered. They secrete cytokines and proteases that profoundly affect neighboring cells, and may contribute to age-related declines in organ function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Campisi1">[7]</xref>. For example, senescent fibroblasts produce an altered secretory pattern referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Coppe1">[8]</xref>. The SASP is characterized by the expression of a complex mixture of factors including reactive cytokines and proteases that create a proinflammatory microenvironment. The relevance of senescent cells to the aging process has been demonstrated by the phenotypic improvement observed following the targeted removal of senescent cells in a progeroid mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Baker1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Astrocytes comprise a highly abundant population of glial cells, the function of which is critical for the support of neuronal homeostasis. Astrocytes regulate the contents of the synaptic cleft and synaptic transmission as part of the tripartite synapse, control CNS metabolism, and maintain blood brain barrier integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Sofroniew1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Halassa1">[11]</xref>. Impairment of these functions through any disturbance in astrocyte integrity is likely to impact multiple aspects of brain physiology. Interestingly, astrocytes undergo a functional decline with age <italic>in vivo</italic> that parallels functional declines <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Pertusa1">[12]</xref>. We demonstrated that in response to oxidative stress and exhaustive replication, human astrocytes activate a senescence program accompanied by the expression of p16, p21, p53, 53BP1; G1 cell cycle arrest; a reduction in telomere length; and increased co-localization of the histone chaperone HIRA and the promyelocytic leukemia PML proteins, a requirement for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Bitto1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The importance of senescent astrocytes in age-related dementia has been the subject of recent discussion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Salminen1">[14]</xref>, but to date, there is little evidence to suggest that senescent astrocytes accumulate in the brain. In this study, we examined brain tissue from aged individuals and patients with AD to determine whether senescent astrocytes are present in these individuals. Our results demonstrate that senescent astrocytes accumulate in aged brain, and further, in brain from patients with AD. Furthermore, since Aβ peptides induce mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and alterations in the metabolic phenotype of astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Abramov1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Allaman1">[17]</xref>; we examined whether Aβ peptides initiate the senescence response in these cells. <italic>In vitro</italic>, we found that exposure of astrocytes to Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> triggers senescence and that senescent astrocytes produce high quantities of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine known to be increased in the CNS of AD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Glass1">[18]</xref>. Based on this evidence, we propose that accumulation of senescent astrocytes may be one age-related risk factor for sporadic AD.</p>

        <title>Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> Peptide Leads to Astrocyte Senescence</title>
        <p>The mechanisms of Aβ-induced neurotoxicity are not fully understood; however, recent studies suggest a role for nonfibrillar soluble oligomers of Aβ in the deleterious effects of Aβ on synaptic plasticity and learned behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Freir1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Cleary1">[22]</xref>.

        <p>Due to the potential impact of senescent cells on tissue microenvironment, it is important to characterize the secretory pattern that is produced during senescence. We examined the secretory pattern of senescent astrocytes using a protein expression array. This analysis revealed an elevated production of multiple inflammatory cytokines by senescent astrocytes. The most dramatic increase was observed in IL-6 production, which increased 10-fold. Production of RANTES, IL-8, and ICAM-1 was elevated at least 2-fold relative to pre-senescent astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045069-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Increased cytokine production was specific to a subset of cytokines; for example, IL-2, IL-3, and IL-4 showed little to no induction relative to IL-6. One component of the SASP present in multiple cell types is IL-6. IL-6 may act in concert with other pro-inflammatory cytokines to induce local inflammatory responses including the recruitment of natural killer cells to aid in the clearance of senescent cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Salminen1">[14]</xref>.

        <title>p38MAPK is Activated in Senescent Astrocytes and is Required for Generation of the SASP</title>
        <p>Whereas p16<sup>INK4a</sup> is a robust biomarker for detecting senescent astrocytes both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in tissues, elevated expression of this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor is not essential for the generation of a SASP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Coppe2">[38]</xref>.

      <p>Elevated markers of DNA damage have been observed in astrocytes found in regions of the brain that are vulnerable to AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Myung1">[43]</xref>. While a role for senescent astrocytes in the aging brain has been postulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Salminen1">[14]</xref>, evidence for the existence of these cells has been lacking. Our study provides evidence supporting the existence of senescent cells in the human brain. We demonstrated relatively high numbers of senescent astrocytes in brain tissue from aged individuals and patients suffering from AD. Further studies will be required in order to definitively demonstrate a casual connection between the appearance of senescent astrocytes and CNS dysfunction. Furthermore, the number of cases was limited by the availability of post-mortem samples. This was partly due to the low rate of autopsies in general <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Ahronheim1">[44]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Evidence coming mainly from fibroblast models indicates that senescent cells secrete pro-inflammatory mediators and proteases that not only potentiate clearance of senescent cells through immune surveillance, but may also contribute to age-related declines in organ function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Campisi1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Coppe1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Coppe3">[45]</xref>. Consistent with these observations, we found that the accumulation of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-positive astrocytes is accompanied by an increase in MMP-1/collagenase, a metalloproteinase able to degrade collagen types I, II, and III, at the extracellular matrix. In agreement with these results, increased expression of MMP-1 has been reported in normal senescent human and Werner fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-West1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Tresini1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Zeng1">[47]</xref>. Additionally, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicate an altered pattern of secretion in senescent astrocytes that is characterized by significant increases in IL-6 production. We propose a key role for p38MAPK in the regulation of IL-6 in these cells. Overall, these results provide support for a SASP in human astrocytes during aging <italic>in vivo</italic>. Several inflammatory markers found to be robustly changed in other cell types were not as dramatically altered in senescent (replicative) astrocytes according to our array <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Freund1">[25]</xref>. Potential reasons for this discrepancy are the nature of senescence induction in the astrocytes and cell-type specific differences. Furthermore, only a subset of factors indicative of the SASP was measured in the antibody array. Further analysis will be required to determine whether the full breadth of SASP factors is altered in the secretion pattern of senescent astrocytes.</p>
      <p>The data suggest that several factors may contribute to the appearance of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-positive cells. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease correlated with the burden of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-positive astrocytes. Also within our cohort of patients, a subset of patients exists with documented history of severe hypoxic episodes or cerebral ischemia. These patients show high positive staining for p16<sup>INK4a</sup>. This effect was most pronounced in a 49-year-old male AD patient with a family history of AD and neuropathologic evidence of hypoxia. Interestingly, similar p16<sup>INK4a</sup> levels were observed in a non-AD patient with a clinical history of repeated hypotensive and hypoxic events due to cardiac failure. Although patient numbers are too small to perform a statistical evaluation of the relationship between clinical history and the appearance of senescent astrocytes, we propose that the number of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-positive astrocytes is a reflection of the cumulative impact of multiple stressors resulting from ischemic events, focal areas of cellular damage secondary to ROS production, Aβ deposition, or other insults. The fact that senescence is a common response to multiple injuries or genetic abnormalities supports the concept that the accumulation of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-positive senescent astrocytes may link aging as a risk factor for sporadic AD. Interestingly, senescence in the CNS may not be exclusively limited to astrocytes. We observed nuclei that were positive for p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, but not GFAP, in the frontal cortex (data not shown). Senescence in other cell types of the CNS, including neurons, has been postulated as important risk factor for AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Golde1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>In vitro</italic>, the exposure of astrocytes to oligomeric species of Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> peptides or cell-derived Aβ induces astrocyte senescence as measured by several markers of the senescent arrest. Similarly, Aβ peptides accelerate the senescence of endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in the zebrafish model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Donnini1">[49]</xref>. The level of soluble Aβ oligomers in AD brain correlates better with disease severity as compared with the level insoluble fibrillar Aβ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-McLean1">[50]</xref>; therefore, we chose to use Aβ oligomers at concentrations previously shown to affect astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Hu1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Hou1">[52]</xref>. Compared with cell-derived Aβ, a considerably higher concentration of synthetic Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> peptide, micromolar and nanomolar respectively, was required to induce senescence in cultured human astrocytes. The increased dosage of synthetic versus cell-derived Aβ oligomers required to trigger senescence, correlates with reports on the effects of Aβ on rat hippocampal long-term potentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Walsh1">[53]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Thus, it appears that the cellular stress induced by Aβ results in activation of the senescence program. In fact, astrocytes are very sensitive to stress, rapidly triggering the senescent phenotype in response to a mild oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Bitto1">[13]</xref>.Consistent with this concept, we have demonstrated that astrocytes cultured at 7% oxygen have an extension in their replicative life span compared with those cultured at 20% oxygen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045069.s002">Figure S1</xref>). Based on these results, and our previously published findings indicating increased sensitivity of astrocytes to oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Bitto1">[13]</xref>, we hypothesize that there is a functional relationship between Aβ and senescence, and that Aβ may induce oxidative stress to trigger the senescent program in astrocytes, thereby contributing to astrocyte dysfunction. The chronic, subtle loss of astrocyte ability to maintain homeostasis throughout the CNS is now thought to underlie AD pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Verkhratsky1">[54]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A common pathological feature of many neurodegenerative disease states, including AD, is reactive astrogliosis, which is a well-characterized spectrum of changes that occurs in astrocytes in response to a variety of insults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Hamby1">[55]</xref>. It remains to be determined how our finding of stress-induced senescence in astrocytes relates to reactive astrogliosis; however, we propose that these two phenotypes may be interrelated given that astrocytes are highly susceptible to stress-induced changes. Based on the results presented here, we propose that the presence of senescent astrocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of AD and may represent a link between the aging process and progression of the disease.</p>

The Aβ produced by these cells is biologically relevant as judged by a significant disruption in working memory when delivered to rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Cleary1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Poling1">[60]</xref>. CHO cells, originally derived from Chinese hamster ovary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Puck1">[61]</xref>, were available and carried in our laboratory. Aβ-secreting 7PA2 or untransfected control CHO cells were grown to near confluence and incubated in serum-free DMEM or MCDB105 media for 24 hours. Conditioned media was collected and cleared of cells by centrifugation at 200 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. Media was then concentrated 15X using 3,000 MWCO centrifugal filters (Millipore; Cork, Ireland). Concentrated media was stored at −80°C prior to treatment. The presence of soluble Aβ oligomers in conditioned media was verified by immunoblot using anti-Aβ antibody (2C8) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA). Levels of Aβ in 7PA2 conditioned media are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045069.s003">Figure S2</xref>.</p>

        <title>Staining for Senescence-associated β-galactosidase</title>
        <p>Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA β-gal) staining was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045069-Dimri1">[62]</xref>. Briefly, following exposure to Aβ peptides or conditioned media, astrocytes were fixed in 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 minutes and stained for SA β-gal activity overnight. The percent of positive (blue) cells were counted and expressed relative to the level of positive cells in vehicle-treated controls. At least 200 cells were counted.</p>

        <title>Analysis of Inflammatory Factors Secreted by Astrocytes</title>
        <p>Pre-senescent (early-passage) and senescent (late-passage) human astrocytes were incubated with serum-free MCDB105 media to generate conditioned media. After a 48-hour incubation period, media was collected and cells were trypsinized and counted to determine the cell number for normalization. Human inflammation antibody array (RayBiotech, Inc.; Norcross, GA) was used to detect secreted inflammatory factors present in the conditioned media according to the product manual. The intensity of the signal on the array membranes was quantified by densitometry, normalized to cell number, and analyzed using the RayBio® Analysis Tool.</p>

        <title>Role of p38MAPK in IL-6 Secretion</title>
        <p>Human astrocytes were triggered to undergo stress-induced premature senescence by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (200 µM for 2 hours). Five days following senescence induction, astrocytes were treated with 10 µM of the p38MAPK pharmacological inhibitor SB-203580 (Enzo Life Sciences Inc.; Farmingdale, NY) or vehicle for 48 hours and then incubated in serum-free MCDB105 for conditioned media collection. Pre-senescent astrocytes were also treated with 10 µM SB-203580 or vehicle in the same manner prior to conditioned media collection. Conditioned media was collected from pre-senescent and senescent cells after a 24-hour incubation period in serum-free MCDB105. The level of IL-6 in conditioned media was quantified by IL-6 ELISA (R&amp;D Systems, Inc.; Minneapolis, MN) and normalized to cell number.</p>

        <p>Early-passage human astrocytes were treated for 24 hours with oligomerized Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> at a final concentration of 5 µM in astrocyte media; 0.05% DMSO was used as control. After 24 hours, media was replaced. Cell lysate was collected 4 days post-treatment in RIPA buffer. Western blot analysis was performed under standard conditions using 25 µg of total cell proteins for anti-p16<sup>INK4a</sup> (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-β-actin (Sigma Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) as a loading control. In order to detect activation of the p38MAPK signaling pathway, antibodies recognizing p38MAPK and phospho-p38MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), along with antibodies against Hsp27 (R&amp;D Systems; Minneapolis, MN) and phospho-Hsp27 (Ser82) (Cell Signaling Technology; Danvers, MA).</p>
