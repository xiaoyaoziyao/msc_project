<abstract>
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through TrkB activation is central for brain functioning. Since the demonstration that plasmin is able to process pro-BDNF to mature BDNF and that these two forms have opposite effects on neuronal survival and plasticity, a particular attention has been paid to the link between tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)/plasmin system and BDNF metabolism. However, t-PA via its action on different N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits is also considered as a neuromodulator of glutamatergic transmission. In this context, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of recombinant (r)t-PA administration on brain BDNF metabolism in rats. In the hippocampus, we found that rt-PA (10 mg/kg) administration induced a progressive increase in mature BDNF levels associated with TrkB activation. In order to delineate the mechanistic involved, plasmin activity was assessed and its inhibition was attempted using tranexamic acid (30 or 300 mg/kg, i.v.) while NMDA receptors were antagonized with MK801 (0.3 or 3 mg/kg, i.p.) in combination with rt-PA treatment. Our results showed that despite a rise in rt-PA activity, rt-PA administration failed to increase hippocampal plasmin activity suggesting that the plasminogen/plasmin system is not involved whereas MK801 abrogated the augmentation in mature BDNF levels observed after rt-PA administration. All together, our results show that rt-PA administration induces increase in hippocampal mature BDNF expression and suggests that rt-PA contributes to the control of brain BDNF synthesis through a plasmin-independent potentiation of NMDA receptors signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serves survival and differentiation functions during the development of the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-CohenCory1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Park1">[2]</xref>. In addition, BDNF has been reported to be central to adult brain functions including neuronal survival, maintenance and repair, modulating dendritic branching and spine morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Horch1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Tanaka1">[4]</xref> and to be involved in activity-dependent synaptic modifications involved in learning and memory formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-McAllister1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Waterhouse1">[7]</xref>. BDNF also represents a crucial signaling molecule in adaptative brain plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Cowansage1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Lipsky1">[10]</xref>. At the molecular level, BDNF is synthesized as pre-pro-BDNF that is processed to pro-BDNF by removal of the signal peptide. Pro-BDNF is then cleaved into mature BDNF within the endoplasmic reticulum by furin and/or in regulated secretory vesicles by protein convertase 1 whereas extracellularly, this cleavage is achieved by plasmin and some metalloproteinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Lu1">[11]</xref>. Although the proteases as well as the compartment involved in the processing of pro-BDNF remain debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Barker1">[12]</xref>, mature BDNF signals through its high-affinity for tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor, thereby impacting positively brain function. Since the direct use of BDNF is limited by its pharmacokinetic profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Greenberg1">[13]</xref>, strategies aimed at inducing mature BDNF production appear to be a promising option in the treatment of variety of CNS pathologies.</p>
<p>Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a serine protease that has been initially characterized to promote fibrinolysis in the vascular compartment through conversion of plasminogen into plasmin. However, t-PA production is not confined to endothelial cells since it is also synthesized by neurons and glia and exerts important function in the brain parenchyma by interacting with various substrates, proteins and receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Samson1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Yepes1">[15]</xref>. In physiological conditions, t-PA is involved during development, in neuronal migration and synaptic outgrowth while in the adult brain, t-PA is implicated in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and different cognitive functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Huang1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Zhuo1">[18]</xref>. However, in pathological conditions, experimental data have revealed that t-PA could have adverse effects and acts as pro-hemorrhagic and pro-excitotoxic factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Yepes1">[15]</xref>. To explain this multifaceted role, several plasmin-dependent and -independent mechanisms have been identified. Hence, it has been shown that t-PA through plasmin activation influences matrix degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Chen1">[19]</xref> and allows the extracellular conversion of pro-BDNF into its mature form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Pang1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Nagappan1">[21]</xref>. Concerning plasmin-independent mechanisms, several studies have reported in glial cells and/or in neurons that t-PA can interact with lipoprotein-receptor-related protein (LRP), annexin II and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Yepes1">[15]</xref>. Concerning this latter, several groups have evidenced interaction and/or proteolytic implication of t-PA with different NMDAR subunits and suggested that t-PA should be also considered as a neuromodulator of glutamatergic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Samson1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Regarding the potential link between t-PA and BDNF metabolism through either plasmin activity or activity-dependent secretion of BDNF through elevation of intracellular calcium levels mediated by the activation of NMDA receptors, the objective of our study was to investigate the effect of exogenous t-PA administration (recombinant (r)t-PA) on brain levels of mature BDNF in rats. In order to gain insight into mechanistic, rt-PA and plasmin activities were measured and a pharmacological approach using non-subunit-specific MK801 targeting NMDARs and tranexamic acid (TXA) as plasmin inhibitor was designed. In addition, the activation of TrkB receptors was assessed.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>The experiments were carried out on adult male Wistar rats (290–310 g; Depré, Saint-Doulchard, France) and were conducted according to the French Department of Agriculture guidelines (license 21CAE099) and performed in order to comply with the ‘<italic>Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments</italic>’ ARRIVE guidelines. The animals were housed five per cage and kept under 12/12 h light/dark cycle and allowed <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water. The experimental procedures were approved by the local committee for ethic in animal experimentation (agreement 6112). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used. Due to the duration of anesthesia and the potential effects of barbiturate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Anderson1">[22]</xref> and ketamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Kotermanski1">[23]</xref> on NMDA receptor signaling, all surgery was performed under chloral hydrate anesthesia (400 mg/kg, i.p.). Head/body temperatures were monitored and controlled during surgical procedure. The choice of doses and the route of administration of drugs have been made in agreement with the literature. All treated animals have been included in this study. In order to minimize the impact of circadian cycle, animals were homogeneously allocated in each group with respect to the time of day at which the injection occurred.</p>
<p>After anesthesia (400 mg/kg; chloral hydrate; i.p.), animals were perfused with vehicle (L-Arginin 3.5% in deionized water, n = 10) or rt-PA 10 mg/kg i.v. (undialyzed, n = 10) combined or not with tranexamic acid (30 or 300 mg/kg, n = 5 and n = 8, respectively) as a bolus (10% of total dose) followed by a 60 min perfusion (90% of total dose) using pump infusion (Harvard Apparatus, 55–4150) to mimic the clinical utilization of rt-PA. For MK801 treatments, two doses were used (0.3 or 3 mg/kg, i.p., n = 5 and n = 8, respectively) as a bolus immediately after the beginning of vehicle or rt-PA infusion. Since blood contains BDNF, 2 h or 24 h after the beginning of drugs administration, animals were transcardially perfused with saline during 5 min to flush out blood from vasculature to avoid contamination, and then, the brains were removed. The cortices, striatum and hippocampi were quickly dissected on glass slide at 0°C. The different brain structures were immediately weighted and frozen at −80°C until further use.</p>

<title>Western Blotting</title>
<p>To assess the expression of the pro-BDNF, mature BDNF, Full length (FL)-TrkB, phosphorylated (p)-TrkB and β-actin by Western blotting analyses, the different cerebral samples were first homogenized in seven volumes of lysis buffer [bi-distilled water containing 100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1% triton X-100, 1% protease inhibitors (Sigma P8340)] as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Quirie1">[24]</xref>. Then, the total protein extracts were sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000×<italic>g</italic> for 20 min. An aliquot of supernatant was kept for BCA protein measurement and the remaining protein extracts were stored at −80°C.</p>
<p>Equal amounts of proteins were dissolved in Laemmli solution (62.5 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromophenol blue) with 2-mercaptoethanol 5% and were heated at 85°C for 10 min. Proteins were separated on 10% (p-TrkB) or 12% (Pro-BDNF, FL-TrkB and mature BDNF) SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and were electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membrane (0.2 μm pore size) in cold transfer buffer [10 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (pH 9.9) and 20% methanol]. Specificity of the different BDNF antibodies was characterized previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Madinier1">[25]</xref>. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C in 5% non-fat dry milk or 7.5% BSA (p-TrkB) in TBS [20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6) and 137 mM NaCl] containing 0.1% Tween 20 to block unspecific binding. They were then washed, incubated for 3 h at room temperature (RT) with anti-pro-BDNF (1/2000), anti-BDNF (1/3000 with 5% non fat dry milk), anti-FL-TrkB (1/1000), anti p-TrkB (1/1000 with 5% BSA) or anti-β-actin antibodies (1/5000). The membranes were washed with TBS-0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 2 h (RT) with either horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgGs or anti-rabbit IgGs. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ECL+, GE Healthcare, Orsay, France). The membranes were stripped and probed with an anti-β-actin antibody (1/5000) used as internal control. Pro- and mature BDNF, FL-TrkB, p-TrkB and β-actin band densities were determined by scanning densitometry (GS-800, Bio-rad, Ivry sur Seine, France). A computer-based imaging system (Quantity One, Bio-rad, Ivry sur Seine, France) was used to measure the relative optical density of each specific band. Data normalized on β-actin expression were expressed as percentage of increase as compared to control values.</p>

<title>Effect of rt-PA on t-PA Activity and Mature BDNF Expression</title>
<p>t-PA activity and mature BDNF expression were assessed in the striatum, the cortex and the hippocampus 2 h and 24 h after administration of either rt-PA (10 mg/kg, i.v., n = 10) or vehicle (n = 10). Concerning t-PA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092416-g001">figure 1</xref>), our results revealed that rt-PA induced a significant increase only in the hippocampus, 2 h and 24 h after perfusion as compared to vehicle treated animals. Concerning mature BDNF expression, Western blotting assessments showed that rt-PA treatment was associated with a significant and progressive rise of mature BDNF only in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092416-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Regarding both t-PA activity and mature BDNF expression in other brain regions, rt-PA exerted no significant effect and thus, whatever the time points considered.</p>

<title>Effect of MK801 on rt-PA-induced Mature BDNF Expression</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Regarding the relevance of stimulating BDNF metabolism in various CNS pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Binder1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Autry1">[27]</xref>, the objective of our study was to assess the effect of exogenous t-PA administration in the maturation of this neurotrophin. For this purpose, we studied the effect of rt-PA on the expression of both pro-BDNF and its mature form and we delineate the mechanistic involved through a pharmacological approach. The present study reveals that i) rt-PA induced a rise in mature BDNF expression and subsequent TrkB receptor activation and that these effects are ii) region-dependent and iii) mediated by NMDAR activation rather than through increase in plasmin activity.</p>
<p>Since the initial <italic>in vitro</italic> demonstration that proteolytic conversion of pro-BDNF to mature BDNF can be achieved by extracellular proteases such as the t-PA/plasmin system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Pang1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Lee1">[28]</xref> and that these two BDNF forms have the propensity to produce diametrically opposite effects on neuronal survival and plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Lu1">[11]</xref>, a particular attention has been paid to the potential relation between t-PA activity and BDNF metabolism. <italic>In vivo</italic>, endogenous brain t-PA activity has been shown to be increased by enriched environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-HoriiHayashi1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Obiang1">[30]</xref>, electroconvulsive therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Segawa1">[31]</xref> and after physical activity paradigms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Ding1">[32]</xref> whereas prenatal restraint stress of rat dams induces decrease in t-PA activity in the offspring of both sexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Yeh1">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, a positive link has been established between t-PA activity and mature BDNF levels in these studies, suggesting the implication of t-PA in the maturation of BDNF. Using systemic administration of rt-PA as an original approach to increase t-PA activity, the present study provides strong arguments for the contribution of t-PA-dependent mechanism in the control of mature BDNF expression. Of note, our results showed that t-PA administration increased significantly t-PA activity only in the hippocampus. Since it has been shown that blood-brain barrier is permeable to t-PA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Benchenane1">[34]</xref> and reported that endogenous content of t-PA inhibitors differ among the different brain structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Vivien1">[35]</xref>, our data suggest a low level of these inhibitors in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Recent literature reports that t-PA could act on BDNF metabolism through a plasmin-dependent processing of pro-BDNF to the mature form. Although debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Barker1">[12]</xref>, these assertions came initially from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using neuronal culture. Hence, it has been shown that upon high frequency stimulation, the extracellular cleavage of pro-BDNF was reduced when cultured hippocampal neurons were treated with the membrane impermeable plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Nagappan1">[21]</xref>. More recently, the implication of t-PA/plasmin system was also suggested <italic>in vivo</italic>, in studies showing that physical exercise induces a correlation between mature BDNF levels and t-PA gene induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Sartori1">[36]</xref> and more strikingly, that 2,7-Bis-(4-Amidinobenzylidene)-Cycloheptan-1-one Dihydrochloride (t-PA STOP) blocks exercise-induced increase in mature BDNF expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Ding1">[32]</xref>. In order to assess whether plasmin activation was implicated in the increase in mature BDNF expression observed in rt-PA-treated animals, we modulated plasmin activity through tranexamic acid, a synthetic lysine analog that shows high affinity to lysine binding sites of plasminogen and plasmin. Using two different doses, when injected in combination with rt-PA, tranexamic acid failed to counteract the rise in mature BDNF expression observed in animals receiving rt-PA alone. Although tranexamic acid induces convulsions in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Furtmuller1">[37]</xref> and is contraindicated in epileptic patients, the absence of direct arguments for the penetration of this compound from blood to brain could explained this observed lack of effects. In order to clarify these data, we measured through specific enzymatic assay, hippocampal plasmin activity in control animals and in animals treated by rt-PA alone or in association with tranexamic acid. As compared to vehicle-treated animals, rt-PA induced no increase in plasmin activity in the hippocampal tissues despite a major rise in the circulating compartment. In addition, in the hippocampal area, basal plasmin activity was found barely detectable suggesting that plasmin activity is locally controlled to avoid a deleterious extracellular proteolysis. In line with this assumption, several studies have reported that the principal physiological plasmin inhibitor, the α2-antiplasmin, is highly expressed in rodent hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Menoud1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Kawashita1">[39]</xref>. Besides, it has been shown that the t-PA substrate plasminogen is localized intracellularly, mainly in the neuronal somata of the CA3 and CA1 layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Taniguchi1">[40]</xref>. Overall data suggest that rt-PA-induced increase in hippocampal mature BDNF expression is a plasmin-independent mechanism.</p>
<p>As stated in the introduction, t-PA effect is not restricted to plasmin-dependent mechanisms. Among its different functions, t-PA is now considered as a neuromodulator of glutamatergic signaling mediated by NMDARs. Indeed, t-PA has been shown to interact with NMDAR subunits such as GluN1, GluN2B and GluN2D with several potential mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Samson1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Yepes1">[15]</xref>. Thus, it has been reported that t-PA could increase NMDAR calcium permeability through proteolytic cleavage of the amino terminal domain of the GluN1 subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Nicole1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Benchenane2">[42]</xref>. In addition, the interaction between t-PA and GluN2B subunit has been reported in the setting of alcoholism leading to an upregulation of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Pawlak1">[43]</xref> while more recently, a preferential activation with GluN2D subunit-containing NMDA receptors influencing spatial memory has also been evidenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Obiang2">[44]</xref>. Besides, t-PA might modulate indirectly NMDA-evoked current through its ability to signal via LRP-1, a membrane receptor tethered to NMDARs by the intracellular scaffold protein, PSD-95 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Martin1">[45]</xref>. Regarding the potential multi-subunit interactions of t-PA with NMDAR, we choose the non-subunit-specific NMDAR antagonist MK-801 to assess whether the increase in mature BDNF expression observed in rt-PA-treated animals could be mediated by NMDAR activation. When injected just after the beginning of rt-PA perfusion, both doses of MK801 completely negated the rise in mature BDNF expression induced by rt-PA, strongly suggesting that the increase in hippocampal mature BDNF expression is mediated by a rt-PA impact on NMDAR signaling. Regarding the mechanism potentially involved, it can be suggested that calcium influx induced by NMDAR activation could induce BDNF gene expression as suggested by a study showing in rats that exercise-induced increase in hippocampal BDNF mRNA levels is completely prevented by NMDAR blockade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Vaynman1">[46]</xref> and/or that NMDAR activation could impinge activity-dependent secretion of mature BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Kolarow1">[47]</xref>. According to the evolution of pro-BDNF expression that was found stable over the different time points despite an increase in the mature form, our data could support the idea that rt-PA-induced increase in mature BDNF expression results from the processing of pro-BDNF associated with its continuous synthesis. In addition, although the precise interactions of rt-PA with the different NMDAR subunits are not investigated here, it is conceivable to hypothesize that the confinement of rt-PA-induced increase in mature BDNF expression to the hippocampus could be due to the specific composition in NMDAR subunits of this brain structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Baron1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Paoletti1">[49]</xref>. This hypothesis is in line with a study showing that rt-PA incubation increased survival in hippocampal but not in cortical neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Echeverry1">[50]</xref>. Finally, as compared to <italic>in vivo</italic> studies concluding on the involvement of the t-PA/plasmin by showing that t-PA STOP blocked exercise-induced mature BDNF expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Ding1">[32]</xref>, our results could lead to a reinterpretation. Indeed, it is important to notice that t-PA STOP has also been shown to attenuate t-PA-dependent potentiation of NMDA-induced calcium influx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Liot1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>By virtue of its essential role in development, neuronal health and plasticity, BDNF deregulation has been implicated in many psychiatric disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Autry1">[27]</xref>. In addition, regarding its contribution to post-stroke neuroplastic changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Cowansage1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Lipsky1">[10]</xref>, strategies aiming at upregulating mature BDNF levels or mimicking BDNF signaling may offer clinically relevant therapeutics. In the present study, we also analyzed whether the rise in mature BDNF observed in rt-PA-treated animals was associated with the activation of its high affinity receptor TrkB by assessing the phosphorylation state of this receptor. Our data revealed that the increase in mature BDNF levels after rt-PA treatment was associated with TrkB receptor activation. In addition, a causative link between mature BDNF expression and TrkB receptor phosphorylation was suggested since MK801 but not tranexamic acid, abolished TrkB receptor activation. According to the fact that BDNF binding to TrkB receptors elicits several intracellular signaling cascades that mainly impact neuronal outcome positively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Reichardt1">[52]</xref>, t-PA administration or interventions aimed at increasing t-PA activity such as physical exercice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Ding1">[32]</xref> could represent an interesting strategy in various neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with low level of BDNF and/or requiring an overproduction of this neurotrophin. Besides, since rt-PA-induced increase in mature BDNF and subsequent TrkB receptor activation occurred only in the hippocampus, it can be hypothesized that exogenous t-PA could impact activity-dependent synaptic modifications and induce neurogenesis and improve memory formation in this structure. Lastly, strategies aimed at increasing t-PA activity could be specially relevant in humans carrying val66met polymorphism that are suspected to have a reduced activity-dependent BDNF secretion and are subjected to impaired episodic memory function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Autry1">[27]</xref> and are at risk for psychiatric diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Aas1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study strongly suggests that exogenous t-PA induces increase in hippocampal mature BDNF expression through NMDAR activation. Although our results do not presage the mechanisms that would be implicated in pathophysiological situations such as stroke in which t-PA has also been reported to potentiate NMDAR signaling to an excitotoxic threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Baron1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092416-Parcq1">[54]</xref>, overall results may underlie a possible beneficial, structure-dependent and extra-fibrinolytic effect of exogenous t-PA. Since rt-PA is the only approved treatment of thromboembolic stroke, the potential occurrence of similar mechanisms in experimental stroke models warrants future studies.</p>
