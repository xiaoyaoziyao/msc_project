      <abstract>
        <p>Bacteria belonging to the SAR11 clade are among the most abundant prokaryotes in the pelagic zone of the ocean. 16S rRNA gene-based analyses indicate that they constitute up to 60% of the bacterioplankton community in the surface waters of the Red Sea. This extremely oligotrophic water body is further characterized by an epipelagic zone, which has a temperature above 24°C throughout the year, and a remarkable uniform temperature (∼22°C) and salinity (∼41 psu) from the mixed layer (∼200 m) to the bottom at over 2000 m depth. Despite these conditions that set it apart from other marine environments, the microbiology of this ecosystem is still vastly understudied. Prompted by the limited phylogenetic resolution of the 16S rRNA gene, we extended our previous study by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of SAR11 in different depths of the Red Sea’s water column together with the respective 16S fragment. The overall diversity captured by the ITS loci was ten times higher than that of the corresponding 16S rRNA genes. Moreover, species estimates based on the ITS showed a highly diverse population of SAR11 in the mixed layer that became diminished in deep isothermal waters, which was in contrast to results of the related 16S rRNA genes. While the 16S rRNA gene-based sequences clustered into three phylogenetic subgroups, the related ITS fragments fell into several phylotypes that showed clear depth-dependent shifts in relative abundances. Blast-based analyses not only documented the observed vertical partitioning and universal co-occurrence of specific phylotypes in five other distinct oceanic provinces, but also highlighted the influence of ecosystem-specific traits (e.g., temperature, nutrient availability, and concentration of dissolved oxygen) on the population dynamics of this ubiquitous marine bacterium.</p>

      <p>Large-scale 16S rRNA gene sequence surveys of numerous oceans have identified the SAR11 lineage within the <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> to be among the most ubiquitous bacterioplankton in the pelagic zone of marine ecosystems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Morris1">[1]</xref>. Members of this clade typically constitute between 25–50% of the total surface microbial community in coastal and open ocean environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Morris1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Eiler1">[3]</xref>. With an estimated global population size of 2.4×10<sup>28</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Morris1">[1]</xref>, these microbes are among the most successful organisms on the planet, and are actively involved in the cycling of nutrients in the ocean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Rapp1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Sun1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Based on genomic and physiological analyses of the few available pure cultures, <italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter ubique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Rapp1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Tripp1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Giovannoni1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Oh1">[9]</xref>, SAR11 cells have been shown to be photoheterotrophic, rely heavily on reduced sulphur compounds, and possess genes necessary for synthesizing essential vitamins and amino acids. However, the oxidation of simple sugars and the utilization of dissolved organic phosphates seem to be a special adaptation to the nutrient status of their respective marine environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Sowell1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Schwalbach1">[11]</xref>.

Sequences from these studies demonstrate stable phylogenetic clusters that are widespread across global scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Morris1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Pommier1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Brown3">[24]</xref>, exhibit distinct vertical distribution along the water column <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Carlson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-GarcaMartnez1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Field1">[25]</xref>, and illustrate spatio-temporal peaks of abundance that correlate with various physicochemical conditions of their environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Eiler1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Morris2">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Martiny1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The divergence into several phylogenetic clusters that are ubiquitous in similar environments implies the presence of “ecotypes” in populations of SAR11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Brown3">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Giovannoni3">[30]</xref>. Ecotypes are groups of very closely related organisms with distinct physiological adaptations to the prevailing condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Cohan1">[31]</xref>. While an understanding of the environmental constraints (e.g., temperature, light availability, and nutrient gradients) that select for the success of one ecotype over the other is at an advanced stage for the cyanobacteria of the genus <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Rocap1">[32]</xref>, knowledge of the respective micro-niches in SAR11 populations are still unclear. In spite of this, the combined analysis of the ITS and the corresponding 16S loci has provided a backbone to address questions on the macro- and micro-niches of potential ecotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-GarcaMartnez1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Stingl1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Brown2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Brown3">[24]</xref>, since they provide different levels of phylogenetic resolutions.</p>
      <p>Our recent survey of bacterioplankton communities of the north-eastern sector of the Red Sea demonstrated that members of the SAR11 clade constituted two thirds of bacterial communities in the surface waters of this saline water body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Ngugi1">[33]</xref>. Phylogenetic analyses of this clade further indicated that the predominant SAR11 sequence-types, which constituted ∼50% of total 16S rRNA gene sequences, grouped within the Surface 1a and b clusters. Surprisingly, the Red Sea’s population of SAR11 closely resembled that in the Sargasso Sea in spite of the geographic distance and considerable differences in physicochemical conditions between these water bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-DuRand1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Qian1">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A remarkable feature of the Red Sea, which sets it apart from most other oligotrophic provinces of the world’s oceans, is the isothermal (∼22°C) and isohaline (40.6 psu) deep water mass (from 200 m to the bottom) that characterizes the entire basin of this ecosystem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Manasrah1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Stambler1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Edwards1">[39]</xref>. Except for the Mediterranean Sea, which is connected to the Red Sea and has an average temperature of 14°C from roughly 300 m to the bottom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Zaballos1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Danovaro1">[41]</xref>, temperature in most global oceans decreases with depth to 3–5°C below 500 m. A persistently high surface water temperature (i.e., ∼24°C in spring and up to 35°C in summer) coupled to prolonged thermal stratification and a slow turnover rate of the deep-sea water mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Cember1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Stein1">[43]</xref> as is the case in the Red Sea, should have a significant impact on the composition and the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Consequently, we hypothesize that the assemblage of heterotrophic communities degrading DOC in the water column of the Red Sea, especially the deeper layers, should be different from other oligotrophic oceans with moderately lower temperatures.</p>
      <p>Here, we exploited the heterogeneity of the ITS loci in conjunction with partial 16S rRNA genes to investigate the microdiversity of SAR11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-GarcaMartnez1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Brown1">[15]</xref> in the water surface (10 m), the mesopelagic (200–700 m), and the bathypelagic (1500 m) zones of the Red Sea’s water column. This approach allowed for a robust linkage of 16S rRNA gene clusters (referred to here as subgroups) with ITS clusters (referred to here as phylotypes) of hitherto undescribed ecotypes. Publicly available metagenomic libraries provided an excellent means to compare the distribution of dominant “ecotypes” from four distinct marine ecosystems with a seasonally similar (summer) dataset from the Red Sea using blast-based searches.</p>

        <title>Diversity and Community Structure of 16S-23S ITS Sequences</title>
        <p>We generated a total of 2,346 sequences that spanned the 16S-23S ITS region (∼1,200 bp long; 109–247 clones per library; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050274-t001">Table 1</xref>) from water samples that had been collected at 10 m (<italic>n</italic> = 11) and four samples of a water-column (at 50, 200, 700, and 1,500 m depths; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050274.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The surface water samples spanned the coastal and open-ocean environments of the north-eastern sector of the Red Sea, whereas the water-column samples were obtained from a site in the central region. The diversity captured by the 16S rRNA gene-sequence fraction (∼700 bp) of the amplicons was three times higher in deep water samples than those from the surface; the same was true for the sampled species diversity as reflected by the Simpson’s Reciprocal Index (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050274-t001">Table 1</xref>). At the same distance threshold (3%), the diversity covered by the ITS fragments (∼400 bp) was generally higher than that of the 16S rRNA gene. The overall diversity for all libraries was 10 times higher at the ITS level (975 OTUs) than at the 16S rRNA gene-level (98 OTUs). Also, in contrast to 16S rRNA gene sequences, surface water samples produced up to 23-folds the diversity observed in the deeper waters at the ITS level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050274-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the communities in the epipelagic zone have a much higher microdiversity.</p>

        <p>The number of OTUs (at 3% sequence difference) that we retrieved from each individual sample at the 16S rRNA gene-level was accounted only by a few OTUs that ranged from 5–36 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050274-t001">Table 1</xref>). Although these also represented nearly the expected diversity as reflected by Good’s estimated coverage (88–99%), the species richness obtained from the related ITS sequences were at the lower end of the Chao1 estimates (maximum coverage of 78%). Therefore, the microdiversity within these samples would still be considered to be undersampled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050274.s002">Figure S2</xref>), which is consistent with the higher number of observed OTUs at the ITS level (69–134).</p>
        <p>Using two independent phylogenetic measures – Phylogenetic (P) test and UniFrac metric – that are not biased by the redundancy of OTU-based analyses, we found that irrespective of the sample, ITS sequences gave a considerably higher phylogenetic diversity (i.e., number of unique branch lengths on a phylogenetic tree) than their 16S rRNA counterparts; 3–7 versus 1–2, as expected and shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-GarcaMartnez1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Brown2">[23]</xref>.

        <p>UniFrac-based community clustering in conjunction with principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed a strong clustering of SAR11 from deep waters (200, 700, and 1500 m) that was significantly different from that in 10- and 50-m samples for both the 16S rRNA gene and ITS fractions (P test &lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050274.s003">Figure S3</xref>). However, we found no significant differences in community composition between surface water samples from the north and central Red Sea, and between coastal and open-ocean environments (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.01, ANOSIM).

        <p>Interestingly, several potential deep-sea phylotypes that branch off at the bases of subgroups S1a (RS1–4) and S1b (R5–7 and NA2) and were absent in the global (surface water) survey of Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Brown3">[24]</xref>, were retrieved in our study. Their absence can be explained by the fact that the majority of sequences in these phylotypes are derived from deep-sea water environments like the Red Sea (200–1500 m; this study), the Mediterranean Sea (50–3000 m; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-GarcaMartnez1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Zaballos1">[40]</xref>), Sub-Arctic North Pacific (500 m; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Suzuki1">[47]</xref>), and North Atlantic (Greenland Sea, 2000 m; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Zaballos1">[40]</xref>). While these deeply branching phylotypes do not have strong bootstrap support, their levels of (intraspecific) divergence are comparable to those encountered among the subgroups, ranging from 9–22%. This not only supports the high level of diversity of sequences within these phylotypes, but also further suggests that even though relationship between these potential phylotypes is poorly resolved, the clustering within them is indeed strong. Moreover, as mentioned by Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Brown3">[24]</xref>, they include a few sequences from previous studies where the associated 16S rRNA gene fractions were lacking (in GenBank), and could therefore previously not be phylogenetically resolved at the subgroup level.</p>
        <p>In agreement with the depth-dependent shifts in 16S rRNA subgroups, we also found a clear vertical distribution of the major phylotypes in the water column of the Red Sea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050274-g003">Figure 3</xref>). While some phylotypes were predominating and occurred only in the upper euphotic zone (P1a.3, P1b.3, and RS1–4) or in the meso−/bathypelagic layer (P2.3 and NA2), sequences related with P1b.1 were distributed throughout the water column, albeit at different proportions. Their abundance was maximal at the 50-m deep chlorophyll maximum zone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050274.s001">Figure S1</xref>), constituting up to 48% of all sequences at this depth. In the mesopelagic (200 and 700 m) and bathypelagic (1500 m) zones, which are both characterized by a uniform <italic>in situ</italic> temperature of 22°C, we observed the predominance of phylotype P2.3 (55–63%), a decrease of P1b.1 (from 34 to 13%), and a moderate increase of NA2 with depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050274-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>In order to determine the universality in the distribution and abundances of subgroups and phylotypes observed in our clone library-based results, we compared their distribution patterns in metagenomic libraries constructed from several samples that comprised seven distinct oceanic provinces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050274.s008">Table S3</xref>) including the Sargasso Sea (BATS), North Pacific Subtropicl Gyre (HOT), North-Western Atlantic Ocean (PRT), the Mediterranean Sea (three samples from different locations), and the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP, oxygen minimum zone) to a recent dataset from the Red Sea (summer, October 2008), using blast-based searches. The number of 16S rRNA gene sequences recruited from these metagenomes ranged from 27–519, whereas that of the ITS ranged from 20–133 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050274.s008">Table S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>Consistent with our clone library-based results we observed that the recruited ITS sequences gave a better and refined picture of SAR11 distribution in the water columns of these geographically and environmentally distinct marine sites than the 16S rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050274-g004">Figure 4</xref>). At the 16S level for example, sequences related to subgroup S2 dominated in nearly all samples. However, at the ITS level, the composition of phylotypes between the epipelagic zone and in the meso−/bathypelagic boundaries and between samples from BATS, HOT, MED, and the Red Sea and those from the ETSP were clearly different.

      <p>Phylogenetic comparisons of 16S rRNA genes have proven to be extremely useful for determining evolutionary relationships among prokaryotes from the domain level to that of closely related species and strains. Despite this, the evolutionary distances exhibited by 16S rRNA gene sequences of subgroups within the SAR11 clade (4–15% sequence identities; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-GarcaMartnez1">[14]</xref>) are in a range that is comparable to other well-characterized genera or even families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Thrash1">[48]</xref>. However, even among cultivated strains of this bacterium that fall on the same branch of the 16S rRNA gene tree, there is sufficient physiological and genomic evidences that support clear phenotypic differences among these organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Wilhelm1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Viklund1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Gilbert1">[49]</xref>. The underlying populations of these genetically and physiologically distinct groups, also referred to as “ecotypes” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Cohan1">[31]</xref>, are usually differentially distributed along environmental gradients. While this phenomenon is well documented for the cyanobacteria of the genus <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Johnson1">[50]</xref>, at a scale that has permitted its inclusion into large-scale oceanographic models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Follows1">[51]</xref>, analogous studies for the ubiquitous marine SAR11 bacteria and a clear understanding of the ecological functions of the ecotypes are still lacking. Together with results from other environments, we present supporting evidence for combining 16S rRNA gene phylogenies with that of the related ITS loci, which has not only allowed us to correlate 16S rRNA subgroups to ITS phylotypes in the water column of the Red Sea, but also indicated that there might be different forces shaping the speciation of SAR11 lineages in different depths of the ocean.</p>

        <title>Vertical Partitioning of SAR11 in the Red Sea</title>
        <p>The accumulating evidence from both our current and previous studies provide clear evidence that the SAR11 population in the Red Sea is highly diverse and consists of several clusters that are structured vertically along the water column.

The distinct profiles of distribution among these subpopulations also emphasizes the assumption that the SAR11 clade consists of numerous ecotypes with potentially different metabolic and ecological properties that are ecosystem specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Rusch1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Wilhelm1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Giovannoni3">[30]</xref>.

        <p>The microdiversity of SAR11 was twenty fold higher in the upper euphotic zone than in the deep-sea layers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050274-t001">Table 1</xref>). This phenomenon is most likely a consequence of the high recombination rates that have been observed among SAR11 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Vergin1">[19]</xref>, which would presumably be elevated by the higher cell densities in the upper layers of the ocean and the harsh and ever-changing mixed-layer environment, compared to the rather stable conditions in the deeper layers. This would give rise to periodic selections and subsequently to microbial speciation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Fraser1">[57]</xref>. In the Red Sea, this mixed-layer environment is characterized by relatively high temperatures (up to 30°C in summer; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050274.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and moderately high fluxes of desert dust (micronutrient) inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Sohm1">[58]</xref>.

        <p>One interesting outcome of our study is that the ratio between the microdiversity covered by ITS sequences and the “macrodiversity” represented by the 16S rRNA genes diminishes towards the meso- and bathypelagic zones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050274-t001">Table 1</xref>). Based on the isothermal and isohaline character of the deep-sea water mass of the Red Sea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050274.s001">Figure S1</xref>), which is also estimated to have a renewal exchange rate in the order of decades (∼72 years; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Cember1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Stein1">[43]</xref>), we interpret these results to indicate that the relatively stable conditions in the deeper layers allowed for the differentiation and development of specialized quintessential subpopulations of SAR11 divergent from those in the (mixed) surface-water layer. The large proportions of subgroup S2-related sequences (∼50%, at 200–1500 m) in both clone libraries (winter) and metagenomic (summer) datasets, and the moderately lower intragenetic distances of the corresponding ITS fragments (5–10%) support this argument. Moreover, the cell densities at such depths are typically one order of magnitude lower than at the surface layers, thus reducing the potential for recombination events and predation pressure. Whether our conclusions can be extended to other marine ecosystems with strong thermoclines like the Sargasso Sea, should be a subject of great ecological interest. Also, since our work only represents a snap shot of the microdiversity in the north-eastern sector of the Red Sea, it will be necessary to demonstrate the universality of our findings across the whole Red Sea basin. This is particularly important due to antagonistic temperature–salinity effects on the surface water and nutrient imports from the Indian Ocean into the southern Red Sea’s waters.</p>

        <title>Emerging Biogeographical Patterns</title>
        <p>Despite numerous descriptions and evidence of the oceanic distribution, abundance, and activity of members of the SAR11 clade, the relationship between “ecotypes” and ecological niches occupied by these bacteria has remained unexplored owing to the paucity of representative strains or genomes covering the entire lineage of SAR11. However, cross-ecosystem comparisons of the Red Sea with three of the most comprehensively studied sites in the global oceans (HOT, BATS, and ETSP) provide insights on the potential effects of temperature, seasonality, depth, and ecosystem-specific traits on ecotype distribution along the water column. Phylotype P1a.2 was for example, only encountered in the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP), where the respective water temperatures at depths of 50 and 110 m were lower (∼14.0°C) than the temperature range (20–27°C) across the same depths in BATS, HOT, and the Red Sea. Along with the recent findings of Brown et al. (2012), which were based on metagenomic datasets of various pelagic (marine) environments around the globe, our results underscore the exceptional differences in the population of SAR11 from tropical and temperate oceans, particularly the striking absence of phylotypes P1a.1 and P1a.2 in tropical marine environments. This is equivalent with a temperature-dependent pattern of distribution that has been described for bacterial assemblages in pelagic environments of marine ecosystems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Ngugi1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Falcn1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Yooseph1">[75]</xref>, or ecotypes of <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Rocap1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Johnson1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Follows1">[51]</xref> and the SAR86 clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Dupont1">[76]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Vertical differentiation in phylotype composition is also evident in the water column of these distinct ecosystems (Red Sea, BATS, HOT, and ETSP). This is probably correlated with changes in seawater chemistry (e.g., nutrient and O<sub>2</sub> concentration) that varies greatly along the water column and might be ecosystem specific. Nutrient concentrations (e.g., inorganic nitrogen and phosphate) at the HOT and BATS sites can be several orders of magnitude lower than those in the Red Sea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Wu2">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-CavenderBares1">[77]</xref>, whereas in the ETSP they can be considerably higher at the surface, but extremely diminished below the oxycline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Faras1">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Stewart1">[79]</xref>. Metagenomic-based comparative analyses also indicate that there is a large variation of phosphate uptake genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Martiny1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Coleman1">[80]</xref> among SAR11 populations found in phosphate-depleted environments like the Sargasso Sea (0.2–1 nM DIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Wu2">[62]</xref>) compared to those with moderately high DIP concentrations (0.03–0.95 µM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Martiny2">[81]</xref>) like the Indian Ocean, which is closer to the Red Sea. Moreover, many phosphate acquisition genes are almost absent in coastal strains (HTCC1002 and HTCC1062; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Martiny1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Coleman1">[80]</xref>) belonging to phylotype P1a.1, which is absent in the Red Sea, but present in their open-ocean counterparts in P1a.3 (HTCC7211). Altogether, these results imply that there is a correlation between the physiological and genetic attributes of representative SAR11 strains within these phylotypes and the environmental conditions in their native marine environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Schwalbach1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Sowell2">[82]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The total fluorescence in summer peaks at a much lower depth in the Red Sea (∼75 m; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050274.s001">Figure S1</xref>), BATS (80–120; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Giovannoni3">[30]</xref>), and HOT (∼110 m; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Campbell1">[83]</xref>) compared to the ETSP (∼20 m; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Galn1">[84]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Bryant1">[85]</xref>). Such strong differences in nutrient availability would also have implications on the population dynamics of heterotrophic communities like SAR11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Giovannoni3">[30]</xref>, which thrive on a diverse array of dissolved organic compounds, including those derived from the metabolic activities of phytoplanktons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Tripp1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Sun1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Morris2">[26]</xref>. While some of the phylotypes do seem to co-occur in the water column of these marine ecosystems, both the carbohydrate utilization patterns of cultivated <italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter ubique strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Schwalbach1">[11]</xref> and genomic evidences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Viklund1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Grote1">[44]</xref> suggest that the distribution of phylotypes P1a.1 (HTCC1062) and P1a.3 (HTCC7211) might be linked with the productivity of the ocean.</p>
        <p>A critical parameter that has often been overlooked by all previous studies is the effect of oxygen on the metabolism and populations dynamics of these bacteria. The pelagic water masses at ETSP are extremely O<sub>2</sub>-depleted (&lt;1 µM below the oxycline, 50–100 m; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Revsbech1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Stewart2">[87]</xref>), unlike those at BATS, HOT, MED, and the Red Sea sites, where the concentrations of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> are relatively high (∼100–250 µM) from the surface to a depth of approximately 200 m. In line with this important difference we observed that SAR11 communities at ETSP were significantly distinct from the rest of the subtropical sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050274-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In the waters of Red Sea and ETPS, phylotypes P2.3 and NA2 seem to preferentially occur in O<sub>2</sub>-deficient deep-sea water masses; ranging from &lt;90 µM O<sub>2</sub> in the Red Sea (700–1500 m; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050274.s001">Figure S1</xref>) to &lt;5 µM O<sub>2</sub> in ETSP (from ∼110 m downwards; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Bryant1">[85]</xref>). Although the specific metabolic capabilities that enable some members of this clade to thrive in O<sub>2</sub>-deficient waters remain unknown, metagenomic studies of ETSP reveal that transcripts encoding for proteins that catalyse the conversion of sulphur to sulphate (<italic>aprA</italic> gene), were not only abundant but highly expressed and mostly affiliated with SAR11 throughout the oxycline (32% of top hits; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Stewart2">[87]</xref>). While all members of this clade are unable to perform dissimilatory sulphate reduction, making them heavily dependent on reduced sulphur compounds for growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Tripp1">[6]</xref>, recent evidences from comparative genomics suggest the potential to assimilate sulphate in some strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Grote1">[44]</xref>. Together with their ability to demethylate dimethysulfoniopropionate (DMSP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Sun2">[88]</xref>), these findings suggests a role for some members of this clade in sulphur cycling of OMZs.</p>
        <p>Collectively, our comparisons highlight striking differences in the population structure of SAR11 along different depths of the water column and also between subtropical provinces of the global ocean. Together with reports from previous studies, our results therefore reinforce the general concept that the physico-chemical constraints imposed by different marine ecosystems greatly impact on the population dynamics of this ubiquitous marine bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Giovannoni3">[30]</xref>; and references therein), thereby giving rise to ecotypes in the todays oceans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Brown3">[24]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>This study evaluated the combined use of 16S rRNA gene and ITS loci to assess the microdiversity within lineages of the SAR11 clade in the Red Sea and several oceanic sites around the globe. In all cases, analyses based on the ITS region provided a significantly higher phylogenetic resolution and a refined community structure of SAR11 populations in the water column compared to the related 16S rRNA genes alone. As such, our study supports the growing use of ITS-based phylogenies to provide a scheme for classifying members of the SAR11 clade and to identify ecologically relevant trends of distribution in various disparate marine ecosystems. The high incidences of recombination events previously observed among native populations of this lineage and the high intraspecific diversity revealed by the ITS phylotypes implies a high degree of ecological differentiation within members of this clade, which may have contributed to their ecological success across different oceanic provinces. The fact that some phylotypes coexist only in certain marine environments reinforces the concept of niche partitioning that has been described for other abundant marine prokaryotes.</p>
        <p>While the microbiology of the Red Sea is still poorly understood, it is becoming increasingly clear that the diversity of SAR11 in this saline water body is as high and phylogenetically diverse as that in other tropical oceans despite of its peculiar environmental traits. Temperature is also emerging as an agent driving the separation of tropical and temperate lineages of SAR11 across the global oceans. However, the influence of other variables such as nutrient availability and the concentration of dissolved O<sub>2</sub>, cannot be underestimated, as they may also be connected with seasonality and deep-water mixing events in some oceans. Because most of the currently known metabolic information of <italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter are based on strains that were isolated from cold marine environments, additional genomic information from subtropical lineages will be necessary to help address previously unresolved questions about the metabolic capacities and evolutionary histories of tropical lineages of this ubiquitous marine bacterium. Furthermore, the comprehensive ITS database from our study should facilitate the design of ecotype-specific qPCR primers targeting the ITS region, thus allowing extended and meaningful seasonal surveys of SAR11 across the oceans.</p>

Amplicons were quality-assessed on agarose gels prior to purification with the QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Purified PCR products were then cloned into the pCR® 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturers protocol. Colonies with the correct insert size were then bi-directionally sequenced with M13 primers on an ABI 3730×l DNA Analyzer in the Genomics Core Lab facility at KAUST (Thuwal, Saudi Arabia), and assembled using Geneious Pro software (v5.5; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneious.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.geneious.com/</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>Following the above procedures, we obtained a total of 2,346 high-quality sequences (∼1200 bp) of the 16S-23S ITS region. The 16S rRNA gene and ITS portions of these sequences were then aligned with ClustalW (as implemented in Geneious), and subsequently clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with an identity match of 97% using software packages in MOTHUR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Schloss1">[89]</xref>. These 97%-identity clusters of OTUs were then used to compute diversity indices (Chao, Simpson’s Reciprocal Index, and Coverage). Alternatively, phylotype-based measures of community similarity (Phylodiversity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Faith1">[90]</xref>) as well as phylogenetic-based measures (UniFrac metric; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050274-Lozupone1">[91]</xref>) were applied to capture the genetic differences (alpha and beta diversities) between the 16S rRNA gene fragments and their corresponding ITS regions. Both of these estimates are based on a phylogenetic tree of all sampled sequences; the former calculates the total number of unique branch lengths in the tree while the later computes the branch lengths shared between sampled communities within the tree. Distance matrices generated using weighted UniFrac were also clustered into two-dimensional space by applying principal coordinate analysis (PCoA).</p>
        <p>Sequences representing each OTU (98 and 975 respectively for 16S rRNA gene and ITS loci) were further employed to infer phylogenetic relationships with their closest best BLAST hits from NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>).
