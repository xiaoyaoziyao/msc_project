<abstract>
<p>Stimulation of neurons with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) results in robust induction of SORLA, an intracellular sorting receptor of the VPS10P domain receptor gene family. However, the relevance of SORLA for BDNF-induced neuronal responses has not previously been investigated. We now demonstrate that SORLA is a sorting factor for the tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) that facilitates trafficking of this BDNF receptor between synaptic plasma membranes, post-synaptic densities, and cell soma, a step critical for neuronal signal transduction. Loss of SORLA expression results in impaired neuritic transport of TrkB and in blunted response to BDNF in primary neurons; and it aggravates neuromotoric deficits caused by low BDNF activity in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease. Thus, our studies revealed a key role for SORLA in mediating BDNF trophic signaling by regulating the intracellular location of TrkB.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sorting protein-related receptor containing LDLR class A repeats (SORLA) is a member of the VPS10P domain receptor gene family, a class of sorting proteins expressed in the mammalian nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Willnow1">[1]</xref>. Typically, VPS10P domain receptors shuttle between Golgi, plasma membrane, and early endosome and direct intracellular trafficking of target proteins to distinct subcellular compartments in neurons. SORLA is best recognized for its role as a sorting receptor for the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the main etiologic agent in Alzheimer disease (AD). SORLA interacts with APP to prevent routing of the precursor protein into late endosomes where proteolytic breakdown into neurotoxic amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Andersen1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Schmidt1">[3]</xref>. SORLA activity is perceived as neuroprotective as it reduces the extent of Aβ production and senile plaque deposition in mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Rohe1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Dodson1">[5]</xref> and in patients with sporadic AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Scherzer1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, the relevance of SORLA as a neuroprotective factor received independent support by findings that <italic>Sorl1</italic> (the gene encoding SORLA) is a downstream target of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor that signals through tropomyosin-related kinase receptor (TrkB) to promote neuronal survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Chao1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Reichardt1">[8]</xref>. In neurons, BDNF signaling increases <italic>Sorl1</italic> transcription 10-fold whereas absence of BDNF activity in mouse models with genetic (<italic>Bdnf <sup>−/−</sup></italic>) or disease-related loss of BDNF in the brain (Huntington’s disease, HD) results in impaired SORLA expression and activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Rohe2">[9]</xref>. However, the question why SORLA is part of the trophic response of neurons to BDNF stimulation remained unanswered.</p>
<p>Using proteomics approaches combined with functional studies in cultured neurons and in mouse models of HD, we now identified SORLA as novel sorting factor for TrkB that facilitates transport of this BDNF receptor along neurites to enhance BDNF signaling. Thus, BDNF-mediated induction of SORLA expression may represent a cellular mechanism to potentiate trophic signals, a pathway potentially disrupted in HD.</p>

<title>Preparation and Treatment of Primary Neurons</title>
<p>Primary cortical neurons were prepared from newborn Balb/c mice of either sex at postnatal day 1. Cortices were dissociated in papain (1 hour at 37°C) and cultured on poly-D-lysine/collagen coated culture dishes. The neurons were cultured for 5 days in Neurobasal-A medium (Gibco) including B27 supplement (Sigma), and GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Rohe2">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Neurons were treated with BDNF (150 ng/ml, Tebu-Bio) or medium only (control) for 20 minutes (BDNF/TrkB signaling) or 48 hours (BDNF-dependent proteome changes) by replacing half of the culture medium with fresh medium. For proteome analyses the cells were harvested in ice cold PBS and cell pellets were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Six individual samples of each treated and control cells were collected (n = 6).</p>

<title>Reduced Proteomic Response in SORLA-deficient Neurons Following BDNF Treatment</title>
<p>Treatment of primary neurons with BDNF results in a strong increase in SORLA mRNA and protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Rohe2">[9]</xref>. To determine what effect SORLA may have on the trophic response of neurons, we performed two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) comparing the proteomic adaptations of primary neurons either wild type (<italic>Sorl1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) or genetically deficient for SORLA (<italic>Sorl1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) to BDNF stimulation.

<title>Reduced Signal Cascade Activation in SORLA-deficient Neurons after BDNF Treatment</title>
<p>In neurons, BDNF binding to TrkB results in phosphorylation-dependent activation of TrkB and in down-stream signaling through the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Chao1">[7]</xref>. Thus, we analyzed levels of posphorylated (active) forms of TrkB (pTrkB), as well as of signal mediators ERK (pERK) and Akt (pAkt) in primary neurons following acute BDNF application (20 min, 150 ng/ml). Western blot analysis revealed significant activation of TrkB, ERK, and Akt in both genotypes after BDNF addition as the phosphorylation of all three proteins was induced upon stimulation. However, comparing the strength of signal induction documented markedly reduced activation of all three signaling cascade components in <italic>Sorl1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> compared with <italic>Sorl1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072164-g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>).

<p>To explore the relevance of SORLA activity for TrkB trafficking, we tested the subcellular localization of the receptor in the presence or absence of SORLA. Using surface biotinylation experiments, significantly fewer TrkB molecules were detected at the surface of neuroblastoma cells expressing SORLA (SY5Y-S) compared to parental control cells (SY5Y) lacking the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072164-g003">Fig. 3C and D</xref>). A shift in subcellular localization of TrkB was also seen in the murine brain in response to SORLA expression assubcellular fractionation studies documented increased levels of TrkB in the synaptic plasma membrane fraction and decreased levels in the postsynaptic density fraction of mice lacking SORLA compared with wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072164-g003">Fig. 3E and F</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, our results demonstrate that SORLA interacts with TrkB to determine TrkB surface expression. Loss of SORLA results in accumulation of TrkB at the cell surface. This is in line with our previous result demonstrating blunted signal cascade activation as this process depends on internalization and transport of activated TrkB receptors to intracellular compartments.</p>

<title>SORLA Regulates Anterograde and Retrograde TrkB Transport</title>
<p>Altered subcellular localization of TrkB and corresponding changes in TrkB signaling in SORLA-deficient neurons may be caused by defects in either anterograde, retrograde, or bi-directional transport of the BDNF receptor.

<title>SORLA Deficiency Aggravates Disease Phenotype in a Mouse Model for Huntington's Disease</title>
<p>In HD, levels of BDNF are distinctly reduced in the striatum of affected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Ferrer1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Spires1">[22]</xref>. In mouse models of the disease (HD82 mice; see method for details of the model) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Schilling1">[10]</xref> reduced BDNF activity in the striatum coincides with a significant reduction in expression of the BDNF target SORLA in the very same brain area to a similar extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Rohe2">[9]</xref>. Based on SORLA’s ability to promote neuritic transport and signaling through TrkB, loss of SORLA expression in HD may potentiate phenotypes caused by low BDNF levels. To test this hypothesis, we generated HD82 mice lacking SORLA (HD82x<italic>Sorl1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) and compared them to control HD82 animals (HD82x<italic>Sorl1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>).</p>
<p>At 10 weeks of age, HD82x<italic>Sorl1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice displayed pronounced hind limb clasping compared with HD82 control litter mates (HD82x<italic>Sorl1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) when suspended by their tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072164-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).

Worsening of neuromotoric deficits in HD82 mice lacking SORLA was also substantiated by rotarod performance testing at 10 weeks of age.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using screening approaches in primary neurons, we previously identified BDNF as a major inducer of <italic>Sorl1</italic> that activates receptor gene transcription through the ERK pathway. Induction of <italic>Sorl1</italic> transcription results in a robust increase in SORLA protein expression and activity in cultured neurons and in the mouse brain <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Rohe2">[9]</xref>. A clue towards understanding the physiological relevance of SORLA as downstream target of BDNF signaling came with the proteomics analyses in this study that documented a blunted response of SORLA-deficient neurons to BDNF application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072164-g001">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072164-g002">2</xref>). The underlying molecular mechanism was revealed in studies in cultured neurons demonstrating a hitherto unknown function for SORLA in axonal trafficking of TrkB, a step critical for efficient neurotrophin signal transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072164-g003">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072164-g004">4</xref>).</p>
<p>To elicit its biological effects, BDNF signals must be conveyed over long distances from the nerve terminal to the cell body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Ginty1">[23]</xref>. In detail, nascent TrkB receptor molecules are targeted anterogradely along the axonal path to the synapse. Following neurotrophin binding to Trk receptors, receptor-ligand complexes internalize in signaling endosomes and signaling persists within these vesicles as they move retrogradely back to the cell body to control gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Chao1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Grimes1">[24]</xref>. The detailed mechanisms of TrkB transport are not fully resolved. Conceptually, our studies support a model whereby physical interaction with SORLA facilitates neuritic transport of TrkB to and from the synapse, promoting BDNF signal transduction from nerve termini to cell soma. Lack of SORLA, as in primary <italic>Sorl1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neurons, results in enhanced accumulation of TrkB at the synaptic plasma membrane and in depletion from the post-synaptic density compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072164-g003">Fig. 3E and F</xref>). Also, anterograde as well as retrograde transport of TrkB along neurites is delayed in the absence of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072164-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Several cytosolic adaptor proteins, including GGA (Golgi-localized, gamma adaptin ear-containing, ARF-binding protein), phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1, and retromer have been shown to interact with the carboxy-terminal tail of SORLA and to direct its intracellular trafficking path <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Schmidt1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Fjorback1">[25]</xref>. Potentially, these interactions not only govern SORLA-dependent transport of APP but of TrkB as well. Clearly, the molecular mechanisms controling SORLA-dependent antero/retrograde sorting of TrkB at the synapse and its relevance for promotion of signal transduction still await elucidation.</p>
<p>A similar function as for SORLA in trafficking of TrkB has been documented for sortilin, a related receptor,of the VPS10P domain receptor family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Vaegter1">[26]</xref>. Unlike sortilin, that mainly regulates anterograde transport of TrkB, SORLA apparently controls both, anterograde and retrograde sorting of this receptor. In addition, <italic>Sorl1</italic> but not the gene encoding sortilin is induced by BDNF in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Rohe2">[9]</xref>. Thus, SORLA appears as integral part of a self-potentiating activation loop whereby BDNF distinctly induces SORLA expression to accelerate axonal transport of its cognate receptor and to strengthen trophic signals. Further support for the specificity of this activation loop stems from the fact that BDNF but not other neurotrophins (such as NGF) induced <italic>Sorl1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Rohe2">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>BDNF signaling has long been recognized as an autocrine mechanism whereby adult sensory neurons secrete BDNF to sustain their own survival signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Acheson1">[27]</xref>. A more complicated scenario is true in the striatum where BDNF produced in cortical neurons needs to be transported to striatal neurons to support their survival. Striatal neuronal cell loss due to insufficient BDNF support has been recognized as a molecular mechanism in HD, a monogenic disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion (polyQ) in huntingtin. Huntingtin is a protein that facilitates vesicular transport of BDNF along microtubules. Compared to the wild-type protein, the polyQ-mutated huntingtin fails to efficiently transport BDNF, resulting in loss of trophic support and in neuronal toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Gauthier1">[28]</xref>. Experimental evidence suggests that BDNF arrives in the striatum by anterograde transport from the cortex via cortico-striatal afferents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Conner1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Altar1">[30]</xref>. We have reported before that in Huntington diseased mice (HD82) low levels of striatal BDNF result in low levels of SORLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072164-Rohe2">[9]</xref>. Now, we show that complete loss of SORLA expression in HD82 mice aggravates the neuromotoric decline in this model of HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072164-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). These findings further support the pathophysiological relevance of impaired BDNF trophic support in HD, and the relevance of SORLA as neuronal sorting receptor for TrkB in the molecular pathogenesis of this disease.</p>
