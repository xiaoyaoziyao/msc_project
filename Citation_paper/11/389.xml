        <p>The HIV-1 matrix protein p17 is a structural protein that can act in the extracellular environment to deregulate several functions of immune cells, through the interaction of its NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region with a cellular surface receptor (p17R). The intracellular events triggered by p17/p17R interaction have been not completely characterized yet. In this study we analyze the signal transduction pathways induced by p17/p17R interaction and show that in Raji cells, a human B cell line stably expressing p17R on its surface, p17 induces a transient activation of the transcriptional factor AP-1. Moreover, it was found to upregulate pERK1/2 and downregulate pAkt, which are the major intracellular signalling components involved in AP-1 activation. These effects are mediated by the COOH-terminal region of p17, which displays the capability of keeping PTEN, a phosphatase that regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway, in an active state through the serin/threonin (Ser/Thr) kinase ROCK. Indeed, the COOH-terminal truncated form of p17 (p17Œî36) induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by maintaining PTEN in an inactive phosphorylated form. Interestingly, we show that among different p17s, a variant derived from a Ugandan HIV-1 strain, named S75X, triggers an activation of PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, and leads to an increased B cell proliferation and malignant transformation. In summary, this study shows the role of the COOH-terminal region in modulating the p17 signalling pathways so highlighting the complexity of p17 binding to and signalling through its receptor(s). Moreover, it provides the first evidence on the presence of a p17 natural variant mimicking the p17Œî36-induced signalling in B cells and displaying the capacity of promoting B cell growth and tumorigenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The three-dimensional structure of HIV-1 matrix protein p17, a 132 amino acid (aa) structural protein, has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography. Individual folded p17 molecules result composed of five major Œ±-helixes and a highly basic platform consisting of three Œ≤ strands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Massiah1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Hill1">[2]</xref>. This partially globular protein presents four helixes centrally organized to form a compact globular domain capped by the Œ≤-sheet. Basic residues exposed from the Œ≤ strands, generally conserved among different HIV-1 strains, are implicated in cell membrane binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Massiah1">[1]</xref>. The fifth helix (H5) in the COOH-terminus of the protein, projects away from the packed bundle of helixes to expose COOH-terminal residues essential for early steps during the HIV-1 infectious cycle. The most distinguishing feature when comparing X-ray and NMR solved conformation of p17 is the folding of H5 and results obtained from Verli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Verli1">[3]</xref> suggest that the biological form of this protein may have its COOH-terminal portion partially unfolded.</p>
      <p>Converging evidences suggest that p17 is generated along all the virus life cycle and plays a critical role in viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Freed1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Bukrinskaya1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Ehrlich1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Haffar1">[7]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments have shown that p17 is released by infected cells into the extracellular space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Fiorentini1">[8]</xref> and this may occur via alternative secretion pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Gould1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Nickel1">[10]</xref> or exocytotic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Dong1">[11]</xref>. However, the release of p17 in the HIV-infected microenvironment through mechanisms of virus disintegration or lysis of infected cells cannot be ruled out. P17 is detected at nanomolar concentrations in the plasma of HIV-1-seropositive individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Fiorentini2">[12]</xref> and in several anatomical compartments such as lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Popovic1">[13]</xref> and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Budka1">[14]</xref> of patients na√Øve for or successfully treated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). Recent reports have also shown that HIV-1 transcription is efficiently induced by different stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Reuse1">[15]</xref> even in the presence of protease inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Vandergeeten1">[16]</xref>, providing the evidence that p17 is continuously synthesized and released even under HAART.</p>
      <p>Besides its well established role in the virus life cycle, increasing evidences suggest a role for exogenous p17 in deregulating the biological activity of different immune cells, which may be relevant in the context of viral pathogenesis. Indeed, p17 is able of influencing the activation, the differentiation status and the proliferative capacity of different target immune cells as T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-DeFrancesco1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-DeFrancesco2">[18]</xref>, NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Vitale1">[19]</xref>, monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Marini1">[20]</xref> and plasmacytoid dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Fiorentini2">[12]</xref>. Functional activities of p17 depend on the expression of a specific receptor for p17 (p17R) on the surface of different immune cells and on the activation of specific signalling pathways triggered by interaction between the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of p17 and p17R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-DeFrancesco2">[18]</xref>. In particular, experiments performed on primary human monocytes have shown that p17 selectively activates the transcriptional factor AP-1 and triggers these cells to produce monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Marini1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The viral protein shows tendency to oligomerize, forming trimers of different crystal forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Massiah2">[21]</xref>. However, this occurs just at high millimolar concentration, as in the intracellular compartment, during viral assembly in the proximity of cell surface. At nanomolar concentration, as in the blood of HIV-1-infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Fiorentini2">[12]</xref>, the p17 is present in monomeric form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Massiah2">[21]</xref>. In this study, we investigate the biological activity of monomeric p17 protein derived from the HIV-1 BH10 (clade B) on Raji cells, a human B cell line stably expressing p17R on cell surface. Here we demonstrate that in these cells p17 transiently activates the cellular transcriptional factor AP-1 by downregulating the Akt pathway, through activation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10), a phosphatase which antagonizes PI3K activity. Activation of PTEN was found to be triggered by the Ser/Thr kinase ROCK, a downstream effector of RhoA, already known to control PTEN activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Li1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Meili1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Sanchez1">[24]</xref>. All these effects were found to be mediated by the H5 in the p17 COOH-terminus, and by the cooperation of at least two distinct functional epitopes on the viral protein. Activation of PTEN and inhibition of Akt are important events in regulating cell cycle progression and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Jiang1">[25]</xref> and are responsible for the antiproliferative effect exerted by p17 on B cells. On the contrary, a p17 variant derived from a Ugandan HIV-1 strain, named S75X, was found to trigger opposite signalling pathways, which induce B cell growth and malignant transformation. This finding suggests that p17 derived from divergent HIV-1 strains may exert a distinct biological activity on B cells and possess a different pathogenetic potential.</p>

        <title>HIV-1 p17 oligomerization in solution is dependent on ionic strength</title>
        <p>In order to simulate the conditions present in biological fluids and analyze p17 biological activity after binding to p17R, we investigated the conditions to maintain purified recombinant p17 preparations in a monomeric form. To this aim we performed gel-filtration experiments to evaluate if osmolarity of the solution could influence the p17 aggregation status. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, the increase of ionic strength resulted in a drastic reduction of p17 oligomerization, with p17 in a monomeric form already at 0.6 M NaCl (upper panel). The retention volume of the p17 monomer is equal to 8.25 ml, according to that of myoglobin contained in the standard for calibration, which has a molecular weight of 17,000 Daltons. Lowering the ionic strength of the solution by dialysis against PBS (0.13 M), we observed a gradual process of p17 oligomers formation, with a volume of retention in gel-filtration of 5.36 ml (lower panel). Stability of these p17 oligomeric forms is extremely high since they are stable and detectable by Western blot under denaturating conditions. This finding allowed us to study the development of the p17 oligomerization process in solution under different NaCl concentrations (0.5, 0.2 and 0.1 M) by western blot and to establish the molecular weight of the resulting oligomers. Western blot analysis, performed using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) MBS-3 which recognizes the functional epitope AT20 (aa 9‚Äì28) in the p17 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-DeFrancesco2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Fiorentini3">[26]</xref>, revealed that both monomeric and trimeric p17 are recognized by this mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Under reducing conditions, p17 is mostly in monomeric form in a solution containing 0.5 M NaCl (lane a), whereas it is detected as an approximately 40.000 Daltons band in solutions containing lower NaCl concentrations, i.e., 0.2 M (lane b) and 0.1 M (lane c). A further confirmation of the dependence of p17 aggregation status by the ionic strength was obtained by ELISA, allowing the binding of GST-p17 to p17 as antigen on the solid-phase under different NaCl concentrations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, binding of GST-p17 ‚Äì but not GST alone ‚Äì to p17, as detected by an anti-GST mAb, increased concomitantly to the decreased NaCl concentration in the solution.</p>

The panels are representative of four independent experiments with similar results. (B) Western blot analysis of p17 under different NaCl concentration (0.5, 0.2 and 0.1 M). In western blot analysis both monomeric and trimeric p17 are recognized by mAb MBS-3. The detection of an approximately 40.000 Dalton band (trimeric p17) increases with the decreasing of NaCl concentration (lane A: p17 in NaCl 0.5 M; lane B: p17 in NaCl 0.2 M; lane C: p17 in NaCl 0.1 M), while p17 is mostly in a monomeric form in a solution containing 0.5 M NaCl. The blot is representative of four different experiments with similar results. (C) Solid-phase ELISA to evaluate p17 oligomers formation under different saline concentration. The p17 polymers formation evaluated as binding of GST-p17 to p17, detected by mAb anti-GST, decreased by increasing NaCl concentration in the solution. Bars represent the mean ¬± SD of triplicate samples. These results are representative of four independent experiments with similar results.</p>

        <title>The COOH-terminal region of p17 is not directly involved in p17R binding</title>
        <p>To assess whether different epitopes play a role in the interaction of p17 with its cell receptor, we took advantage of a set of anti-p17 mAbs developed in our laboratory. As expected, p17 binding to Raji cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) was completely blocked by mAb MBS-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), which recognizes a linear epitope (aa 9‚Äì18) within the BH10-derived AT20 functional epitope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-DeFrancesco2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Fiorentini3">[26]</xref>. Other anti-p17 mAbs, and among them one named MK-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-DeFrancesco2">[18]</xref>, didn't show any neutralizing activity (data not shown). Surprisingly, mAb MK-18 showed a strong neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) despite its inability to recognize the AT20 peptide by solid-phase ELISA (data not shown). To identify the p17 functional region recognized by mAb MK-18 epitope mapping was performed with a series of decapeptides that completely spanned the p17 protein. The solid-phase peptides were individually screened for reactivity to mAb MK-18. Data obtained showed that the MK-18 binding region was in the p17 COOH-terminus and was included between aa 115 and 132 (data not shown). Comparison of NMR and X-ray structures of p17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Massiah1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Massiah2">[21]</xref> evidenced a strong flexibility of its COOH-terminal region, in particular of the H5, that can come in close contact with the globular head. A structural contact between NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal regions of p17 is confirmed by the development of a mAb recognizing a discontinuous epitope corresponding to aa 12‚Äì19 and aa 100‚Äì105 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Papsidero1">[27]</xref>. Therefore, the capability of displacing the binding of p17 to Raji cells by mAb MK-18 could be then attributed to the close proximity of the COOH-terminal region to the functional AT20 epitope located in the globular head of the viral protein and then ascribed to a phenomenon of steric hindrance. To better characterize the binding of p17 to Raji cells, we evaluated the capacity of a p17 protein lacking its fifth helix in the COOH-terminus to interact with cells. To generate the truncated form of the p17 protein we performed the deletion at the COOH-terminus of the BH10 p17 gene according to its secondary structure. A 96 aa long truncated form of p17 ‚Äì named p17Œî36 ‚Äì was produced and purified, whereas any attempt to purify other two COOH-terminal truncated forms of p17, the 90- (p17Œî42) and 85- (p17Œî47) aa long proteins was unsuccessful due to the predominance of hydrophobic stretches that turned these proteins into completely insoluble molecules. We have then evaluated the capability of p17Œî36 molecule to exert biological activity and shown that it was similar to p17 in its ability to bind p17R on Raji cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g003">Figure 3D</xref> shows specificity of binding of biotinylated p17Œî36 to p17Rs expressed on Raji cells since p17Œî36/Raji cell interaction was inhibited by mAb MBS-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) but not, as expected, by mAb MK-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g003">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>

        <p>Then we investigated if p17Œî36 retains the biological properties of the full-length p17. It has been recently shown that p17 activity is linked, at least in human primary monocytes, to the activation of the transcription factor AP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Marini1">[20]</xref>. We verified whether p17 binding to Raji cells was followed by a similar increase in the AP-1 DNA-binding activity. Preliminary data obtained by EMSA showed that nuclear extracts from untreated Raji cells had a basal level of AP-1 DNA-binding activity and p17 activated AP-1 DNA-binding activity in a dose-dependent manner with a peak at 1 ¬µg/ml dose (data not shown). Time-course analysis using 1 ¬µg/ml of p17 showed that the activation of AP-1 DNA-binding activity is also time-dependent with a peak (2.6¬±0.26 fold increase) at 1 h after treatment and gradually decreased at 4 h after stimulation with p17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The specificity of protein-DNA complexes was confirmed by competition experiments using an excess of specific unlabeled oligonucleotides. Moreover, pre-treatment of p17 with the neutralizing mAb MBS-3 blocked AP-1 activation (data not shown). Parallel experiments were run to assess the capability of p17Œî36 to activate AP-1. Similarly to p17, dose finding experiments established that optimal activation of AP-1 in Raji cells was achieved using p17Œî36 at the concentration of 1 ¬µg/ml (data not shown). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g004">Figure 4B</xref> we found that p17Œî36 had a stronger and more prolonged AP-1 activation than the full-length counterpart. In fact, activation of AP-1 DNA-binding activity by p17Œî36 started already at 30 min (1.4¬±0.26 fold increase), with a peak (2.2¬±0.25 fold increase) at 1 h after treatment and persisted up to 4 h after stimulation (1.6¬±0.25 fold increase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

Therefore, we assessed the possibility that PTEN, after treatment with p17Œî36 or p17, could be present in Raji cells in a different phosphorylation status. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, treatment of cells with p17Œî36 led to increased Ser/Thr phosphorylation of PTEN respect to unstimulated cells, while in contrast p17 stimulation reduced lightly the Ser/Thr phosphorylation level of PTEN. These data indicate that p17Œî36 inhibits PTEN activity by increasing Ser/Thr phosphorylation levels and, consequently, its ability to down-modulate Akt phosporylation. On the contrary, p17 treatment keeps PTEN in an active state, as attested by the low levels of pAkt. Therefore, the effects of p17 and p17Œî36 and on PI3K/Akt signalling have to be ascribed to a different modulation of PTEN activity.</p>

        <p>Since p17 is able to keep PTEN in an active state, we examined if p17 stimulation of Raji cells could activate PTEN through a pathway involving RhoA and ROCK.

        <p>We have recently described that different recombinant p17 proteins derived from Ugandan HIV-1 clade A and C isolates (S75X, S85X, S92X and S012X) are all capable of binding to p17R on Raji cells, despite differences in their primary aa sequence as compared to the BH10-derived protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Fiorentini3">[26]</xref>. Therefore we wondered if, upon their binding to p17R on Raji cells, S75X, S85X, S92X and S012X recombinant proteins trigger signalling pathways similar to the ones induced by p17Œî36. Stimulation of Raji cells for 5 min with different concentrations (ranging from 0.05 ¬µg/ml to 1 ¬µg/ml) of S85X, S92X and S012X variants induced signalling pathways which resembled that triggered by p17(data not shown). Interestingly, S75X induced an increase in the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 and Akt at every dose tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). A side by side comparison of signalling pathways triggered by p17, p17Œî36 and S75X (0.1 ¬µg/ml) confirmed the capability of S75X to induce, similarly to p17Œî36, an increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). These results highlight that one full length p17 variant, among the recombinant proteins we tested, displayed a p17Œî36-like activity despite the presence of the fifth helix H5 in the COOH-terminus of the protein. Taken together these data demonstrate that p17s derived from different HIV-1 isolates can differently impact on the signalling pathways leading to B cell proliferation.</p>

Western blot analysis of Raji lysates shows that S75X activates Akt and ERK1/2, as shown by the increased phosphorylation of both kinases at any concentration tested, verified by densitometric analysis and plotting of the pAkt/ERK1/2 and pERK1/2/ERK1/2. In the left panel, blots from one representative experiment of four with similar results are shown.

(B, C) Raji (B) and human primary B cells (C) were treated for 5 min with 0.1 ¬µg/ml of p17, p17Œî36 and S75X. Untreated cells were used as control. Western blot analysis of lysates shows that p17 inhibits the activation of Akt and induces the activation of ERK1/2 either in Raji or human primary B cells, as verified by densitometric analysis and plotting of the pAkt/ERK1/2 and pERK1/2/ERK1/2. On the contrary, p17Œî36 and S75X induce the activation of Akt and ERK1/2 at any concentration tested, verified by densitometric analysis and plotting of the pAkt/ERK1/2 and pERK1/2/ERK1/2. In the left panels blots from one representative experiment of three with similar results are shown.

        <title>P17, p17Œî36 and S75X show different effects on colony formation</title>
        <p>Several studies have established a link between the PI3K/Akt pathway and human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Jiang1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Li2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-McCubrey1">[42]</xref>. To assess the capacity of p17Œî36 and S75X to induce cell growth and malignant transformation of B cells, compared to p17 one, we evaluated their influence on the capability of Raji cells to form colonies in soft agar. At any concentration tested (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 ¬µg/ml) p17 significantly inhibited the colony-forming ability of Raji cells compared to untreated control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The colony number decreased from 152¬±25 to 107¬±17, from 158¬±13 to 82¬±19, from 151¬±15 to 115¬±19 with 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 ¬µg/ml of p17, respectively. On the contrary, p17Œî36 and S75X, used at the same concentrations, induced a significant increase of number of colonies compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In fact, when cells were treated with p17Œî36 the colony number increased to 210¬±21 (0.05 ¬µg/ml), to 239¬±17 (0.1 ¬µg/ml), to 251¬±22 (0.2 ¬µg/ml), and when S75X was used the colony number increased to 194¬±24 (0.05 ¬µg/ml), to 212¬±16 (0.1 ¬µg/ml), to 242¬±18 (0.2 ¬µg/ml). This result demonstrates the selective anti-proliferative activity of p17 but, more interestingly, the capacity of p17Œî36 and of the natural variant S75X to increase cell growth and malignant transformation of Raji cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The HIV-1 matrix protein p17 has tendency to oligomerize, forming trimers of different crystal forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Massiah2">[21]</xref> but this occurs at high millimolar concentrations only. At nanomolar concentrations, as in the blood of HIV-1-infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Fiorentini2">[12]</xref>, p17 is present in monomeric form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Massiah2">[21]</xref>. In our study, in order to reproduce conditions of p17/p17R interaction in biological fluids, we explored different conditions to obtain p17 protein preparations in a monomeric state and found that osmolarity of the solution influenced p17 aggregation. Data obtained showed that both monomeric and trimeric forms of p17 were able to interact with p17R and, as expected, to induce similar biological activities. This finding proves that p17 activity is independent from its aggregation form.</p>
      <p>The functional p17 epitope involved in p17R binding was previously found to be located at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of the viral protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-DeFrancesco2">[18]</xref> and spans from aa 9 to 28, thus including a major portion of the polybasic region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Fiorentini3">[26]</xref>. Indeed, an anti-p17 mAb (MBS-3), which recognizes this functional epitope on the native p17 protein, was found to block the p17/p17R interaction and, as a consequence, all p17 biological activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-DeFrancesco2">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Using a monomeric p17 preparation we performed experiments aimed to study p17/p17R interaction in the presence of different p17 mAbs. Among many tested, mAb MK-18, a mAb recognizing an epitope in the COOH-terminal region located between aa 115 and 132, showed a potent p17 neutralizing activity. Thus, to better characterize the involvement of the p17 COOH-terminal region in the p17R binding, we evaluated the ability of a COOH-terminal truncated form of p17 (p17Œî36) to interact with p17R. Data obtained showed that p17Œî36 is a functional protein, being able to bind to p17R expressed on Raji cells. The use of the p17Œî36 protein has then unveiled that the binding of p17 to its cellular receptor does not involve the COOH-terminal region of the viral protein. Since NMR and X-ray analysis have evidenced a close proximity of the flexible H5 Œ±-helix to the functional AT20 epitope on the globular head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Massiah1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Massiah2">[21]</xref> we hypothesize that the capability of mAb MK-18 to displace binding of p17 to p17R is likely due to mechanisms of steric hindrance. However, to better define a possible role of the H5 Œ±-helix in the p17 biological activity, we investigated the signalling events triggered by p17 and p17Œî36 protein preparations in Raji cells.</p>
      <p>We previously demonstrated that the MCP-1 expression stimulated by p17 in monocytes was primarily dependent on the activation of the transcriptional factor AP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Marini1">[20]</xref>, an indicator of external stimuli, as several signal transduction pathways converge to this molecule. However, the signalling pathways triggered by p17 have never been elucidated.</p>
      <p>Here we show that following p17R interaction, p17Œî36 was capable of inducing a stronger and more prolonged AP-1 activation than the full length BH10-derived p17 protein. This finding was attesting for a functional p17 COOH-terminal region capable of triggering a signalling cascade which is distinct from the one evoked by the globular head. Therefore, we investigated the key signalling pathways, PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK, which are involved in AP-1 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Shin1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Seger1">[31]</xref> and play a pivotal role in basic cellular functions such as cell growth, survival, migration, angiogenesis and tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Angel1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Schuurbiers1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-McCubrey1">[42]</xref>. Data obtained show that both p17 and p17Œî36 proteins induce the activation of ERK1/2, but they play opposite effects on the Akt signalling pathway. In particular, the Akt pathway was strongly activated in p17Œî36 stimulated cells, whereas it was inhibited in cells stimulated with p17. This finding allowed us to hypothesize that a NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal epitope of p17 may be responsible for an activation signal on PI3K/Akt signalling pathway opportunely balanced by a second inhibitory signal promoted by the COOH-terminal region.</p>
      <p>Akt activation is known to require the formation of PIP<sub>3</sub>, produced by PI3K action, in order to be translocated to the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Carnero1">[43]</xref>. In normal mammalian cells the levels of PIP<sub>3</sub> are tightly controlled by the combined effects of PI3K regulation and the action of phosphatases. PTEN is a lipid phosphatase, involved in regulation of cell growth, survival, invasion and tumor progression that inhibits PI3K-dependent activation of Akt by dephosphorylating PIP<sub>3</sub> to PIP<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Cantley1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Carnero1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Wu1">[44]</xref>. Inhibition of PTEN function results in increased PIP<sub>3</sub> levels and subsequent Akt hyperactivation/phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Stambolic1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Backman1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Vivanco1">[47]</xref>. PTEN possesses a COOH-terminal non catalytic regulatory domain that contains multiple putative phosphorylation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Vazquez1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Miller1">[48]</xref>, which play an important role in its complex regulation and in the control of its biological activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Torres1">[49]</xref>. Phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal region stabilizes PTEN protein in an inactive ‚Äúclosed‚Äù conformation, blocking the translocation of PTEN to the intracellular face of the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Vazquez1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Das1">[50]</xref> and effectively inhibiting the dephosphorylation of the substrates of PTEN. The demonstration that p17Œî36 increases the Ser/Thr phosphorylation levels of PTEN indicates that it is capable of stabilizing the phosphatase in an inactivated phosphorylated closed state and, consequently, of increasing Akt phosphorylation. On the contrary, p17 treatment keeps PTEN phosphatase in a not phosphorylated active state. Therefore, we can conclude that the opposite effects of p17Œî36 and p17 on PI3K/Akt signalling are due to a different capability of the two proteins to modulate PTEN activity.</p>
      <p>Recent studies have implicated the RhoA/ROCK pathway in the control of PTEN, whereby the Ser/Thr kinase ROCK, through an unknown mechanism, activates PTEN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Li1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Meili1">[23]</xref>. In our experiments ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Ishizaki1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Narumiya1">[40]</xref> completely abrogates p17 effects on PTEN and Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that the HIV-1 matrix protein, through its COOH-terminal region, down-modulates the PI3K/Akt cascade by activating PTEN via the RhoA/ROCK pathway.</p>
      <p>There is no evidence, up to date, on the presence of COOH-terminal truncated forms of p17 in HIV-1 infected patients. The HIV-1 matrix protein p17 is well conserved across other retroviral proteins. However, we recently produced four recombinant p17 proteins derived from Ugandan HIV-1 clade A and C isolates, already identified in GenBank (S75X, S85X, S92X and S012X) containing major mutation points in their primary aa sequence, as compared to the BH10-derived protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Fiorentini3">[26]</xref>. Therefore, we have tested the hypothesis on the occurrence of a natural p17 variant with a biological activity similar to p17Œî36 in terms of ability to activate the Akt signalling pathway. Indeed, among p17s derived from Ugandan HIV-1 isolates, S75X was the only one found to up-regulate the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Interestingly, data obtained by soft agar growth assay show that S75X, like p17Œî36, possesses the capability of inducing cell growth and malignant transformation of B cells, whereas the BH10-derived p17 shows an antiproliferative activity according to its Akt signalling pathway. Therefore, specific mutations within the p17 primary aa sequence are required to generate signalling pathways critical for B cell proliferation and cancer insurgence. However, if we focus our attention to the entire protein sequences, we can observe that compared to the BH10-derived p17, the Ugandan variant S75X displays major substitutions that are not limited to the region that is truncated in p17Œî36, but scattered throughout the whole protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017831-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Conformational studies and development of site-specific mutagenesis on the BH10-derived p17 framework are needed to understand how mutations in the primary sequence of S75X are linked to PI3K/Akt signalling pathway activation, B cell growth and tumorigenesis.</p>

      <p>Activation of the Akt signalling pathway is a hallmark of different types of malignancies and intensive studies on the PI3K/Akt pathway have firmly established a central role for Akt in tumorigenesis and cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Jiang1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Li2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-McCubrey1">[42]</xref>. We know that patients with HIV-1 infection have a risk of developing B-cell lymphoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Gucalp1">[51]</xref>. Consequently, a dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway in B cells, as shown for p17S75X, might contribute to the development of lymphoma in HIV-1-infected individuals.</p>
      <p>The identification of p17 variants with possible oncogenic potential may represent not only a prognostic marker for the emergence of B-cell lymphoma in HIV-1-infected patients, but also a focal point for the development of effective anti-cancer therapies. In fact, the PI3K/Akt pathway might represent a promising therapeutic target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Li2">[41]</xref>, since significant progress has been made in developing small-molecule kinase inhibitors targeting the binding of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt to PIP<sub>3</sub> or PIP<sub>2</sub>, which prevent Akt activation and membrane translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Thomas1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Kozikowski1">[53]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, p17 exhibits a high degree of plasticity and diversity that allows formation of distinct ligand-receptor interactions capable of selectively activating or deactivating a variety of signalling pathways and appears to possess multiple, seemingly, conflicting targeting signals. The recently reported interest in drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Haffar2">[54]</xref> and vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Fiorentini4">[55]</xref> specifically designed to block p17 function confirms the importance of this protein for HIV-1 infection and AIDS pathogenesis. Identification of new functional epitopes in the HIV-1 matrix protein, responsible of its extracellular actions, might be useful not only for a better and more detailed understanding of the molecular basis of its biological activities, but also for the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed to exogenously regulate p17 functions.</p>

The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice for 10 min in 5√ó packed cell volume of lysis buffer containing 10 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). The nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4¬∞C for 10 min and re-suspended in 3√ó packed nuclear volume of high-salt buffer containing 20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 420 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM DTT and a protease inhibitor cocktail. The suspension was rocked for 20 min at 4¬∞C, gently vortexed and subsequently centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min at 4¬∞C. The supernatant/nuclear extracts were collected and stored in aliquots at ‚àí80¬∞C. The protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).</p>

        <p>Nuclear extracts (10 ¬µg of protein per sample), obtained as described above from Raji cells treated or not with p17 (0.05‚Äì1 ¬µg/ml) and p17Œî36 (0.05‚Äì1 ¬µg/ml), were incubated with 32P-labelled AP-1 probe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Tiberio1">[57]</xref>, and the mobility of DNA‚Äìprotein complexes (EMSA) was analysed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Tiberio2">[58]</xref>. Protease activity was stopped by the addition of ice-cold complete medium. For competition experiments, a 100-fold excess of specific unlabelled probe was incubated with nuclear extracts before addition of the radiolabeled probe. For loading controls, the nuclear extracts were analysed also for the DNA-binding activity of octamer-1 (Oct-1), whose site is present in many housekeeping genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017831-Tiberio1">[57]</xref>. Autoradiographic signals were quantified by Molecular Dynamics PhosphoImager (MDP) analysis (Typhoon 8600; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).</p>

        <title>Western blot analysis</title>
        <p>3√ó10<sup>6</sup> cells were transferred into 10 cm dishes, treated with recombinant p17, S75X, S85X, S92X and S012X or p17Œî36 at different concentrations 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 ¬µg/ml, then lysed in 200 ¬µl of 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.6% NP40, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (sodium vanadate, PAO and sodium fluoride). When indicated, the cells were pre-treated at 37¬∞C for 20 min with Y-27632 (25 ¬µM). Equal amounts of total proteins were resolved on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated overnight at 4¬∞C with 1) mouse mAb pAkt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 2) mouse mAbs pERK1 and pERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 3) rabbit polyclonal ERK antibody (Santa Cruz), 4) mouse mAb PTEN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 5) rabbit mAb pPTEN (Ser380/Thr382/383) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The antigen-antibody complex was detected by incubation of the membranes for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Scientific) and revealed using the ECL System.</p>

        <title>Soft Agar anchorage-independent growth assay</title>
        <p>Raji cells (20000/well) were plated in 4 ml of 0.35% agarose, 5% charcoal-stripped FBS in phenol red-free RPMI 1640, with a 0.7% agarose base in six-well plates. Two days after plating, medium containing the proteins as indicated was added to the top of the layer and replaced every four days. After 10 days, 300 ¬µl of 3-[4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-y1]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) were added to each well and allowed to incubate at 37¬∞C for 4 h. Plates were then placed in 4¬∞C overnight and colonies &gt;50 ¬µm diameter were counted.</p>

        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>Data obtained from multiple independent experiments are expressed as the mean ¬± SD. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using Wilcoxon matched pairs test, one-way and two-way ANOVA when appropriate. Bonferroni's post test was used to compare data. Differences were considered significant at P&lt;0.05. Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism v.5 Software.</p>
