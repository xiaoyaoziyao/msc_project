However, histopathological studies have suggested that tumor cells might be the progenitor for tumor vasculature. Recently, we have reported that the precancerous stem cells (pCSCs) representing the early stage of developing cancer stem cells (CSCs), have the potential for both benign and malignant differentiation. Therefore, we investigated whether pCSCs serve as progenitors for tumor vasculogenesis. Herein, we report that in the pCSC-derived tumors, most blood vessels were derived from pCSCs. Some pCSCs constitutively expressed vasculogenic receptor VEGFR-2, which can be up-regulated by hypoxia and angiogenesis-promoting cytokines, such as GM-CSF, Flt3 ligand, and IL-13. The pCSCs are much more potent in tumor vasculogenesis than the differentiated tumor monocytic cells (TMCs) from the same tumor, which had comparable or even higher capacity to produce some vascular growth factors, suggesting that the potent tumor vasculogenesis of pCSCs is associated with their intrinsic stem-like property. Consistently tumor vasculogenesis was also observed in human cancers such as cervical cancer and breast cancer and xenograft lymphoma. Our studies indicate that pCSCs can serve as tumor vasculogenic stem/progenitor cells (TVPCs), and may explain why anti-angiogenic cancer therapy trials are facing challenge.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work is supported from Strategy Initiative Grant(SIG, OSU), 2006/2007 (JXG); Immunology Program Award 2007 (OSUCCC)(JXG); American Cancer society Grant #IRG-112367 (JXG); Davis/Bremer Medical Research Grant, OSU (RS); and SIG 2006(SHB).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor malignancy is determined by the growth rate, invasiveness and metastasis of tumor.

CSCs have been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis through secreting growth factor VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Bao1">[22]</xref>, although their potential for transdifferentiation into endothelial cells has not been demonstrated. Recently, we have discovered that the precancerous stem cells (pCSCs), representing the premalignant stage of developing CSCs, have the potential for both benign and malignant differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chen1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Gao2">[16]</xref>. The pCSCs can develop into tumors in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice, but not in bone marrow (BM)-reconstituted (BMR) mice, blastocyst chimera mice, and immunocompetent (IC) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chen1">[15]</xref>. In the BMR mice, however, pCSCs can differentiate into various types of tissue cells, including endothelial-like cells, suggesting that they might have the capacity to form blood vessels in tumorigenic environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chen1">[15]</xref>.

In the pCSC-derived tumor, tumor blood vessels were essentially derived from transplanted pCSCs. The pCSCs are much more potent in tumor neo-vascularization compared to the differentiated tumor monocytic cells (TMCs) derived from the same tumor. Various types of human cancer cell lines that should contain pCSCs and CSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Kondo1">[24]</xref> also exhibited the potential for tumor vasculogenesis in tumor xenografts. Tumor vascular endothelial cells were inevitably defective in phenotype and function with remarkable variations between individuals. Consistently, most endothelial cells were abnormal in human tumor vasculature. Thus, pCSCs can serve as tumor vasculogenic stem/progenitor cells.

To test the hypothesis, we transplanted intraperitoneally (i.p.) or subcutaneously (s.c.) pCSCs (clone 2C4) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing pCSCs (clone 2C4G2 derived from 2C4 clone) into SCID mice, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chen1">[15]</xref>.

Importantly almost all tumor blood vessels or capillaries exhibited strong GFP-specific green fluorescence in the 2C4G2-derived, but not in 2C4-derived tumors, regardless of i.p. or s.c. transplanted tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1B and F</xref>; red arrows indicate representative vessels, which are the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1A and E</xref> indicated by green arrows), suggesting that not only tumor cells but also tumor vascular endothelial cells (TVECs) can be derived from pCSCs.</p><p>Since paraffin-embedded tissue sections usually demonstrate high background of auto-fluorescence, we further verified pCSC-derived TVECs in tumors by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of successive sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1C &amp; G</xref>). Successive sections from the same tumors either derived from 2C4G2 or 2C4 cells were stained with the same high affinity rabbit monoclonal (mAb) antibody to GFP followed by secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. As expected, the sections of 2C4G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), but not 2C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>) cell-derived tumors demonstrated GFP-positive tumor cells as well as GFP-positive blood vessels, consistently with the observations under fluorescent microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1B &amp; F</xref>). Endothelial cells of capillaries in 2C4G2 cell-derived tumors were strongly stained in nuclei and cytoplasm by mAb to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>); in contrast, no endothelial cells were stained by the same mAb to GFP in 2C4 cell-derived tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>). Moreover, pCSCs not only serve as progenitors for capillary endothelial cells, but also for the endothelial cells of larger blood vessels, because endothelial cells in various sizes of blood vessel of the tumors were GFP-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1</xref> &amp; Supplementary (s) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1C,E,F</xref>). Endothelial cells were stained either in cytoplasm alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001652.s001">Fig. S1E</xref>) or in both cytoplasm and nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001652.s001">Fig. S1F</xref>). Some of them may be weakly stained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001652.s001">Fig. S1H</xref>). The weak stained endothelial cells were unlikely non-specific, because the same antibody did stain endothelial cells in 2C4 cell-derived tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1G, H</xref>, &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001652.s001">Fig. S1A, B</xref>). This is consistent with our previous report that GFP in pCSCs can be down-regulated when they were differentiating into lineage-specific progenies, as demonstrated by flow cytometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chen1">[15]</xref>. The finding supports that GFP may be down-regulated or inactivated when progenitors differentiate into progenies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Klug1">[26]</xref>.</p><p>The high affinity of rabbit mAb to GFP greatly promoted specificity of IHC staining. The high specificity lends us capability to directly investigate multipotency of pCSCs in well-preserved tissue sections with almost null background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). With the advantage, we also identified pCSC-derived red blood cells (RBCs) in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). In the capillary beds of 2C4G2 cell-derived tumors, many of RBCs were GFP-positive with variable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1C &amp; D</xref>). Even in the bigger blood vessels, GFP-positive RBCs were also observed together with GPF-negative RBCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001652.s001">Fig. S1F,G</xref>). These GFP-positive RBCs are truly derived from 2C4G2 pCSCs, because no GFP-positive RBCs were detected in the 2C4 tumors using the same mAb to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g001">Fig. 1G &amp; H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001652.s001">Fig. S1A, B</xref>).

Receptor 2 for VEGF (VEGFR-2) is most important for angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, because it mediates almost all cellular response to VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Ferrara1">[28]</xref>. Moreover, VEGFR-2 is not only expressed on endothelial cells to promote their proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Stratmann1">[29]</xref>, but also on the stem/progenitor cells to mediate vasculogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Yang1">[8]</xref>. To investigate whether the vasculogenic capacity of pCSCs is associated with VEFGR2-mediated signaling pathway, we first examined whether pCSCs constitutively expressed VEGFR-2 by flow cytometry.

These cytokines can be detected in tumor environments and have been reported having effects on tumor angiogenesis. 2C4 cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of a cytokine alone or in combination, and analyzed for cell proliferation and VEGFR-2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). While all the cytokines appeared to promote pCSC expansion except for IL-6, the viable cell counts were marginally or significantly increased only in the cultures with GM-CSF, IL-13, FL, or IL-13 plus FL, compared to the cultures absent of exogenous cytokines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001652.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). There was no significant synergistic or additive effect between them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001652.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).

Interestingly, IL-4 almost completely inhibited VEGFR-2 expression induced by GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

Histological analysis revealed that the vasculature in pCSC-derived tumors was much more mature and dense than in TMC-derived tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). Most capillary cells exhibited endothelial-like morphology in pCSC-derived tumors, while most cells lining up the vessel wall of TMC-derived tumors were monocytic in morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>).

To determine the cell origin of tumor vasculature, we examined neomycin-expressing cells within tumor vasculatures by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, as both 2C4 and 3B11 cells carried neomycin gene integrated into genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chen1">[15]</xref>.

Note that the expression pattern of neomycin was different between pCSCs and TMC-derived tumors. In pCSC-derived tumors, neomycin was strongly detected in cytoplasm but weakly in nuclei; however, it was strongly detected in both cytoplasm and nuclei in TMC-derived tumors.

The results suggest that both pCSCs and TMCs have the potential of vasculogenesis, although the vasculogenic capacity between them is different.

While pCSCs and TMCs expressed comparable levels of HIF-1α, VEGFR-2, VEGF and Ang-1 transcripts, the pCSCs expressed lower levels of transcripts of VEGR1 and Tie1/2 than TMCs, and even did not constitutively express Tie1, Tie2, and Ang-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>).

The results suggest that tumor cell-derived vascular endothelial-like cells were defective in phenotype and functions.

The specificity of these primers was verified by their respective capability to detect corresponding mRNAs in MV411 and 2C4 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

The conclusion is supported by the following evidences: first, the pCSCs have the potential to differentiate into endothelial-like cells <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chen1">[15]</xref> and <italic>in vitro</italic>; second, pCSC-derived TVECs were dominant in tumor vasculature; third, some pCSCs constitutively expressed the receptor VEGFR-2 (Flk-1) and ligand VEGF, which may drive pCSC-derived TVPCs to differentiate into endothelial cells probably through an autocrine mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Yamashita1">[45]</xref>; fourth, instead of freezing, fixation of pCSC-derived tumors with formalin to preserve fine structure of tumor vasculatures allowed us to directly visualize the pCSC-derived GFP<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells that aligned on vessel walls; fifth, the pCSCs responded well to both hypoxia and angiogenic cytokines; Sixth, the blood vessels in human cancer xenografts were also overwhelmingly derived from the transplanted human tumor cell lines, which should contain pCSCs and/or CSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Bao1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Kondo1">[24]</xref>. Subcutaneous transplantation of human MV411 cells into SCID mice led to the formation of xenograft lymphoma, in which almost all vascular endothelial cells were derived from MV411 cells. Finally, TVECs in human native cancers such as cervical and breast cancers were found to be defective in phenotype and function (VWF expression).</p><p>It has long been observed that the endothelial cells of tumor vessels are abnormal concerning their morphology and phenotype as revealed by electronic microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Hammersen1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Hashizume1">[46]</xref> and IHC staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chang1">[47]</xref>, respectively. This abnormality exhibited as the mosaic blood vessels, in which, e.g., both CD31<sup>+</sup>CD105<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells and CD31<sup>−</sup>CD105<sup>−</sup> cells formed luminal surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chang1">[47]</xref>. The abnormal phenotypes of tumor vascular endothelial cells had been ascribed to the tumor cells that aligned on the defective walls of tumor vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chang1">[47]</xref>, or to the tumor environments which caused abnormal differentiation of normal endothelial progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Fukumura1">[48]</xref>. However, our studies indicate that these abnormal vascular cells, at least some of them, may be derived from tumor cells such as pCSCs and CSCs rather than from normal progenitors. Expression of one or two endothelial markers on tumor vascular endothelial cells does not seem to sufficiently prove that they are derived from normal progenitors. Examination of vascular endothelial cell markers in tumor xenografts and the specimens of human cervical and breast cancer revealed that little normal endothelial cells could be detected in these cancers. None of the cases examined of each type of cancer expressed a complete array of normal endothelial markers, suggesting that these endothelial cell markers are randomly expressed depending on environmental cures. Consistently, pCSCs in responding to hypoxia expressed little up-regulated CD31, although their morphology was changed into endothelial-like and their genes for vascular growth were up-regulated. The pCSC-derivation of TVECs may explain why they are phenotypically multifaceted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Bertolini1">[42]</xref>. It is likely that most tumor vasculature are derived from pCSCs and/or CSCs, especially from those having the potential to differentiate into endothelial-like cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chen1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Gao2">[16]</xref>. The markers for TVPCs remain to be elucidated. However, VEGFR-2 might be a candidate marker of TVPCs, because VEGFR-2-mediated signaling is required for both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Millauer1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Yang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Yamashita1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Reyes1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Clauss1">[50]</xref>.</p><p>A critical question, however, remains to be answered: what is the status of angiogenesis in tumor neo-vascularization? While Lyden et al showed that impaired recruitment of BM-derived endothelial and hematopoietic precursor cells blocked tumor angiogenesis and growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Lyden1">[9]</xref>, Larrivee et al demonstrated that the contribution of BM-derived precursor to tumor angiogenesis is minimal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Larrivee1">[10]</xref>. The argument appears to be reconciled by the recent finding showing that BM-derived precursors seems dominant in early tumor but greatly diluted in later tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Nolan1">[51]</xref>. Combined with our findings, we propose that angiogenesis is required for efficient tumor vasculogenesis. In early tumor, endothelial cells from pre-existing blood vessels or circulating endothelial progenitors may proliferate and sprout surrounding cancer cell aggregates; simultaneously tumor cell-derived progenitors start a process of vasculogenesis. In animal models as well as human tumor xenograft models, we observed various stages of developing blood vessels, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g007">Fig. 7</xref>. Initially the progenies of pCSCs or CSCs form an aggregate in tumorigenic niches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g007">Fig. 7a, e</xref>). With the enlargement of the aggregates, pCSCs or CSCs that have the properties of TVPCs line up to form branching lumens and tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g007">Fig. 7b, e</xref>). The tubes were extended and elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g007">Fig. 7c, e</xref>), and the newly formed vasculature merged with host vessel sprouts from pre-existing blood vessels surrounding tumor capsule to form functional neo-capillary network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g007">Fig. 7d, e</xref>). Without angiogenesis, tumor vasculogenesis might be aborted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Lyden1">[9]</xref>. This model emphasizes that the formation of tumor vasculature requires the mechanisms of both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, and may explain the respective roles of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001652-g007">Fig. 7e</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001652-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001652.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>The putative cellular mechanism for tumor vasculogenesis.</title><p>TVPCs within tumor cell aggregates line-up along the branching lumen (A, circles), and form tubes (A &amp; B, green arrows).

It is well-known that both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis are mediated by the same growth factors and receptors. Most important factors are VEGF and Ang-1/2, which bind receptors VEGFR-1/2 and Tie1/2, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Shibuya1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Koblizek1">[53]</xref>. Among them, VEGFR-2-mediated signaling is critical for vasculogenesis in embryonic and tissue vasculogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Yang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Sakurai1">[54]</xref>, and Ang-1/2 and Tie-1/2 are mainly responsible for angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Koblizek1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Peters1">[55]</xref>. While the vascular growth factors mainly determine the capacity of tumor angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Bergers1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Bao1">[22]</xref>, their effect on tumor vasculogenesis seems to be limited. The notion is supported by the fact that TMCs that produced comparable or even higher levels of growth factors or receptors had much less capacity of tumor vasculogenesis, when compared to pCSCs. The different vasculogenic capacity between pCSCs and TMCs does not seem to associate with expression of VEGFR-2 on these cells, because they expressed comparable VEGFR-2 transcripts. TMCs expressed higher levels of VEGFR1 and Tie2 than that of pCSCs. VEGFR1 has been shown to limit the mitogenic function of VEGFR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Hicklin1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Rini1">[57]</xref> and, thus might limit VEGF-induced vasculogenesis. Tie2/Ang-2 signaling has been shown anti-angiogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Maisonpierre1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Lobov1">[59]</xref>. Whether vasculogenic capacity of TMCs is limited by these two factors remains elusive.</p><p>As discussed above, examination of human cervical and breast cancer specimen revealed that most blood vessels in invasive cancer were derived from tumor cells because little normal endothelial cells were detected. This observation suggests that in addition to capability to produce vascular growth factors, the status of vasculogenesis in tumor may be determined by frequency and intrinsic properties of tumor cell-derived vascular progenitors. This explains why most clinical trials of anti-angiogenic therapy have failed to block tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Medina1">[25]</xref>. Currently anti-angiogenic drugs are screened by using <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenic models composed of normal endothelial progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Medina1">[25]</xref>. As a result, while screened drugs are effective on normal endothelial progenitors, they may be resisted by TVPCs. Thus, pCSCs and CSCs may be main targets for anti-angiogenic cancer therapy. In addition, cytokines such as GM-CSF, FL and IL-13 can up-regulate VEGFR-2 expression on pCSCs. Whether these factors promote pCSC-mediated vasculogenesis needs further investigation.</p><p>In addition to pCSCs, we also show that TMCs have the potential of tumor vasculogenesis, suggesting that pCSCs are not a sole population having activity of TVPCs. This is not surprising, because monocytes are highly plastic in differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Gao3">[23]</xref>. It has been reported that monocytes or myeloid cells have the capability to transdifferentiate into endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Bailey2">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-FernandezPujol1">[62]</xref>. Monocytes have been shown to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Ribatti1">[63]</xref>. On the other hand, activated monocytes can secrete soluble (s) VEGFR1 to inhibit angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Eubank1">[64]</xref>. It should be noted that vasculogenic capacity of TMCs was less than that of pCSCs, despite both of them are derived from the same tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Chen1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Gao3">[23]</xref>, and that TMCs expressed high level of VEGFR1. Whether TMCs can produce sVEGFR1, leading to defective tumor vasculogenesis; or their vasculogenic capacity is hierarchically reduced when they developed from pCSCs. Further elucidating these issues will facilitate understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor vasculogenesis.</p><p>A solid tumor has been considered a neo-organ in the body, consisting of various components including stromal and parenchymal cells; the latter are composed of pCSCs, CSCs and terminal differentiated cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001652-Gao2">[16]</xref>.
