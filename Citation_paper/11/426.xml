<abstract>
<p>How extracellular molecules influence the direction of axon guidance is poorly understood. The HSN axon of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is guided towards a ventral source of secreted UNC-6 (netrin). The axon’s outgrowth response to UNC-6 is mediated by the UNC-40 (DCC) receptor. We have proposed that in response to the UNC-6 molecule the direction of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth is stochastically determined. The direction of guidance is controlled by asymmetric cues, including the gradient of UNC-6, that regulate the probability that UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth is directed on average, over time, in a specific direction. Here we provide genetic evidence that a specialized extracellular matrix, which lies ventral to the HSN cell body, regulates the probability that UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth will be directed ventrally towards the matrix. We show that mutations that disrupt the function of proteins associated with this matrix, UNC-52 (perlecan), UNC-112 (kindlin), VAB-19 (Kank), and UNC-97 (PINCH), decrease the probability of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth in the ventral direction, while increasing the probability of outgrowth in the anterior and posterior directions. Other results suggest that INA-1 (α integrin) and MIG-15 (NIK kinase) signaling mediate the response in HSN. Although the AVM axon also migrates through this matrix, the mutations have little effect on the direction of AVM axon outgrowth, indicating that responses to the matrix are cell-specific. Together, these results suggest that an extracellular matrix can regulate the direction of UNC-6 guidance by increasing the probability that UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity will be oriented in a specific direction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Axons are guided by cues emanating from the surrounding extracellular environment. A major challenge has been to understand how extracellular cues specify the direction of axon guidance. The formation of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> HSN axon is a model for studying axon guidance. Details of HSN axon development were described in Adler et al., 2006. Immediately after hatching, the neuron extends short neurites in random directions from the cell body. However, the neurites soon become restricted to the ventral side of the cell where a ventral leading edge forms. This leading edge is just dorsal of a band of longitudinal body-wall muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>). At this interface the ventral surface of HSN pauses and expands until, abruptly, neurites extend and invade the specialized basement membrane that separates the muscles and the epidermis. This matrix contains specialized structures that allow the muscle cells to attach to the epidermis. In fact, it is somewhat surprising that circumferentially migrating axons transverse this specialized complex matrix instead of taking a seemingly easier route along the matrix at the internal side of the muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-White1">[1]</xref>.</p>

<p>The major extracellular cue that directs HSN axon formation and guidance is UNC-6 (netrin) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Hedgecock1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Asakura1">[5]</xref>. Recent evidence suggests that the response mediated by the UNC-40 (DCC) receptor to the UNC-6 <italic>molecule</italic> is stochastic; axon outgrowth activity is induced and is randomly oriented in different directions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Xu1">[7]</xref>. A second UNC-40-mediated response is to the UNC-6 <italic>gradient</italic>. This separate response increases the probability that the randomly directed axon outgrowth activity induced by the first signal will be oriented towards the ventral UNC-6 source. In wild-type animals, the separate effects of the two signals are not observed since the UNC-6 gradient increases to nearly 100% the probability that UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity will be directed ventrally. The evidence for the separate signals comes from the phenotypes caused by the <italic>unc-40(ur304)</italic> mutation, and by mutations that disrupt the function of UNC-53, a cytoskeletal binding protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Xu1">[7]</xref>. The <italic>unc-40(ur304)</italic> mutation encodes an UNC-40 variant, UNC-40 (A1056V), that is proposed to partly mimics the confirmation of UNC-40 when UNC-6-ligated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Xu1">[7]</xref>. UNC-53 is thought to repress UNC-6-independent UNC-40 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>. In the <italic>unc-40</italic> and <italic>unc-53</italic> mutants, randomly directed UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity is induced in the <italic>unc-6(−)</italic> background and the axon has a probability of protruding in each direction. In the <italic>unc-6(+)</italic> background, UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity and axon protrusion is ventral. The interpretation is that in the mutants an UNC-40 signal induces stochastically directed axon outgrowth activity, which in the <italic>unc-6(−)</italic> background cannot be oriented towards the ventral UNC-6 source.</p>
<p>The conclusion that a separate process orients the outgrowth activity raises the possibility that external asymmetric factors, besides the UNC-6 gradient, could help regulate the probability that the UNC-40-mediated outgrowth activity will be oriented ventrally. Although an extracellular molecule might not induce the UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity itself, the asymmetric distribution of that molecule could provide directional information for UNC-6 guidance by altering the probability of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth at each side of the neuron. Previous evidence suggests that the Wnt EGL-20 functions in this manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>. EGL-20 is required to prevent UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity in the anterior and posterior directions. This observation indicates that the UNC-6 gradient by itself is not sufficient to prevent the direction of axon outgrowth activity from fluctuating.</p>
<p>Our conclusion that the direction is stochastically determined in response to UNC-6 raises the question of how the neuron decides the direction of UNC-6 guidance. In wild-type animals, the probability that the HSN axon will protrude ventrally is very high. However in some mutants, such as <italic>egl-20</italic>, the probability that UNC-40 will asymmetrically localize to the ventral side of the neuron is comparatively lower, whereas the probability of localization to the anterior and posterior sides is higher. Yet, the HSN axon is still guided to the ventral midline by UNC-6. This observation is evidence that the direction of UNC-40 axon outgrowth activity, and the outward force it generates, fluctuates during axon outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>. A biased random walk is a mathematical formulization of a path consisting of a succession of movements in which the direction at each step is randomly determined with a consistent bias for a specific direction. Despite the fact that there is a probability that the axon will be directed anteriorly or posteriorly, the UNC-6 gradient creates an overall bias for ventral outgrowth so that on average, over time, the axon is directed ventrally. Another characteristic of a random walk is that the mean square displacement (msd) will increase only linearly with time, whereas the msd increases quadratically with time for straight-line motion. Based on this property, it would be expected that on average it would take longer for an axon to develop in a mutant than in a wild-type animal since the same amount of force could not move an extension as far in the same amount of time. In fact, in mutants, such as <italic>egl-20,</italic> the formation of a morphologically mature axon is delayed in an UNC-40-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>We reasoned that the extracellular matrix that is just ventral of the HSN cell body could, along with the gradients of UNC-6 and EGL-20 wnt, affect the probability that the UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity directs the axon ventrally. In part because the basement membrane molecule UNC-52 (perlecan) is strongly associated with this specific matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Rogalski1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Mullen1">[9]</xref> and it has been shown to affect UNC-6 guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Merz1">[10]</xref>. We were also intrigued by similarities between HSN axon development and the invasion of the anchor cell into the vulval epithelium. In both cases UNC-6 directs a cell extension through a basement membrane and in both cases UNC-40 becomes localized within a cell to the side that protrudes into the basement membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Hagedorn1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Ziel1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the anchor cell, the integrin heterodimer INA-1/PAT-3 is required to localize UNC-40 (DCC) to the invasive membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Hagedorn2">[13]</xref>. In neurons, INA-1/PAT-3 is known to mediate a response to UNC-6 through interactions with MIG-15, a homologue of Nck-interacting kinase (NIK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Shakir1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Poinat1">[16]</xref>. Intriguingly, when axonal growth cones reach the muscle/epidermis matrix in <italic>mig-15</italic> mutants they abnormally spread and will sometimes elongate in the anterior and posterior directions, <italic>i.e.,</italic> the invasion of this matrix is disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Teulire1">[15]</xref>. This phenotype is comparable to the HSN anterior and posterior axon protrusion phenotype observed in Wnt/PCP mutants. We therefore hypothesized that INA-1/MIG-15 signaling might affect HSN guidance by similarly regulating the localization of UNC-40 towards the muscle/epidermis matrix.</p>
<p>Here we provide evidence that the muscle/epidermis extracellular matrix and integrin/MIG-15 signaling regulate UNC-6 axon guidance by helping create a directional bias for UNC-40-mediated outgrowth activity in HSN. We show that mutations that alter the muscle/epidermal extracellular matrix do not prevent UNC-6 from inducing an asymmetric localization of UNC-40 within the neuron. However, they do affect the probability of where UNC-40 asymmetrically localizes within the neuron. In comparison to wild-type animals, the probability of UNC-40 localizing to the ventral side of the neuron decreases, while the probability of UNC-40 localizing at the anterior or posterior sides of the neuron increases. This phenotype is also observed in <italic>ina-1</italic> and <italic>mig-15</italic> mutants, and we confirm that <italic>mig-15</italic> functions cell autonomously in HSN. Axon development is consistent with the mutations causing the direction of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity to fluctuate within the neuron. As predicted by the biased random walk model, the axon may protrude from the cell body in the anterior or posterior direction but it nearly always reaches the ventral midline. Furthermore, there is an UNC-40-dependent delay in axon development. We also note that the effect the muscle/epidermis extracellular matrix has on the direction of axon outgrowth is cell specific; similar outgrowth patterns are not observed for the AVM axon, which also is guided into and through this matrix by UNC-6 and UNC-40 signaling.</p>

<title>Analysis of the Timing of HSN Axon Outgrowth</title>
<p>HSN neurons were visualized using an integrated <italic>unc-86::myrGFP</italic> transgenic strain, <italic>kyIs262</italic>. Synchronized populations were obtained by allowing eggs to hatch overnight in M9 buffer without food. The resulting L1, L2, and L3 nematodes larvae were mounted on a 5% agarose pad. Larval staging was determined by the gonad cell number. An outgrowth was defined as a protrusion if it extended a distance greater than the length of two cell bodies. A precocious phenotype was scored in the L1 or L2 stage if either HSN in an animal showed a predominate axon. Only one HSN was counted as having an axon per animal. The ventral neurite was scored if it had any ventral filopodia or a leading edge formation during middle L3 stage, and the most prevalent direction of growth was noted. The standard error of proportion was calculated for this purpose. Images were taken using epifluorescent microscopy with a Zeiss 63× water immersion objective.</p>

To determine the HSN position and the stage of the animal, all animals were imaged by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy as well. The UNC-40::GFP localization was determined by measuring the average intensity under lines drawn along the dorsal and ventral edges of each HSN cell body by using ImageJ software.</p>
<p>For analysis of the anterior–posterior orientation of UNC-40::GFP along the dorsal surface, the dorsal segment was geometrically divided into three equal lengths (dorsal anterior, dorsal central and dorsal posterior segments). The line-scan intensity plots of each of these segments were recorded. ANOVA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/anova.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/anova.html</ext-link>) test was used to determine if there is a significant difference between intensities of three segments. The dorsal distribution was considered uniform if p≥0.05 and was considered asymmetrical if p≤0.05. Within an asymmetric population, the highest percent intensity was considered to localize UNC-40::GFP to either anterior, posterior or central domain of the dorsal surface. In addition, UNC-40::GFP is regarded as anterior-posteriorly localized if both anterior and posterior regions show significantly higher intensities than the central region.</p>

<title>Mutations that Disrupt the Muscle/epidermis Matrix Affect the Pattern of UNC-40 Asymmetric Localization in HSN</title>
<p>The HSN cell body sits just dorsal of a ventral longitudinal row of body-wall muscle cells, which are attached to the epidermis by structures that form a molecular link between the contractile apparatus of the muscle cell and the cuticular exoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Hresko1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Francis1">[18]</xref>. These structures pass through the basement membrane that separates the muscle cells from the epidermis. Serial-section electron micrographs show that the HSN neurites invades through this basement membrane during the formation of the ventral axon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Adler1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several proteins are known to play prominent roles in the structure and function of this matrix. These include: UNC-52 (perlecan), an extracellular protein of the muscle/epidermal matrix; UNC-112 (kindlin), a protein required for muscle cell-matrix adhesion complexes; VAB-19, an ankyrin repeat protein that regulates epithelial cell–matrix attachment structures; and UNC-97 (PINCH), a LIM domain adaptor protein found at extracellular matrix attachment sites. Null alleles of <italic>unc-52</italic> are lethal, whereas the <italic>e444</italic> and e998 alleles result in paralyzed, but viable animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Rogalski2">[20]</xref>. UNC-112 is observed in the vulval, spermathecal, uterine, anal sphincter/depressor muscles, and the body wall muscles, where it colocalizes with integrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Rogalski3">[21]</xref>. Null mutations of <italic>unc-112</italic> are lethal; the embryos arrest at the twofold stage and have severely disorganized body wall muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Williams1">[22]</xref>. However, animals homozygous for <italic>r367</italic> are viable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Rogalski3">[21]</xref>. VAB-19 is expressed in the epidermis, where it becomes localized to epidermal attachment structures including those adjacent to the body wall muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Ding1">[23]</xref>. Null mutations of <italic>vab-19</italic> are lethal, however the <italic>vab-19(e1036)</italic> allele has a cold-sensitive phenotype; at 22.5°C about 90% survive to the adult stage, whereas at 15°C most arrest at the twofold stage of embryonic development (Ding et al., 2003). The mutation disrupts epidermal elongation and muscle attachment to the epidermis. UNC-97 is expressed in touch neurons, sex muscles, and body wall muscles, where it colocalizes with integrin PAT-2/PAT-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Hobert1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Gettner1">[25]</xref>. Loss of <italic>unc-97</italic> function is embryonic lethal, whereas the <italic>unc-97(su110)</italic> allele is viable; it causes defective muscle attachments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Hobert1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>We find that the <italic>unc-52(e998), unc-52(e444), unc-97(su110), unc-112(r367),</italic> and <italic>vab-19(e1036)</italic> mutations alter the pattern of UNC-40 asymmetric localization in HSN. In particular, the mutations increase the probability of UNC-40 asymmetrically localizing in the anterior and posterior direction, while decreasing the probability of UNC-40 asymmetrically localizing in the ventral direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g003">3</xref>). In these experiments we first assay for the distribution of UNC-40::GFP along the dorsal-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We then assay for bias along the anterior-posterior axis by determining the UNC-40::GFP distribution along dorsal side of the neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Whereas in wildype animals UNC-40::GFP is frequently localized ventrally and in <italic>unc-6</italic> mutants UNC-40::GFP is uniformly dispersed around the periphery of HSN, in these mutants there is an increase in the probability that UNC-40::GFP will localize at either the anterior or posterior sides of the neuron.</p>

In the mutants, UNC-40::GFP can be asymmetrically localized in the anterior (C), posterior (D) or in the anterior and posterior (E) direction.

<title>The Muscle/epidermis Extracellular Matrix Inhibits Anterior and Posterior UNC-40 Localization in Response to UNC-6.</title>
<p>(A) Graph indicating the dorsal-ventral orientation of UNC-40::GFP in HSN. The graph shows the average ratio of dorsal-to-ventral intensity from linescan intensity plots of the UNC-40::GFP signal around the periphery of the HSN cell. UNC-40::GFP is ventrally localized in wild-type, but the ratio is different in <italic>unc-6(−)</italic> and the mutants. (*) statistic difference (P&lt;0.05, one-tailed Student’s <italic>t-</italic>test). Error bars represent standard error of mean. (B) Graph indicating the anterior-posterior orientation of UNC-40::GFP. To determine orientation, line-scan intensity plots of the UNC-40::GFP signal across the dorsal periphery of the HSN cell were taken, the dorsal surface was geometrically divided into three equal segments, and the total intensity of each was recorded. The percent intensity was calculated for each segment and ANOVA was used to determine if there is a significant difference between the three segments (see Experimental Procedures). The measurements were taken using only the dorsal periphery in order to minimize cell shape differences. In the mutants there is a bias for anterior or posterior localization, whereas there is a uniform distribution in <italic>unc-6(−)</italic> mutants and in double mutants with <italic>unc-6(−)</italic>.</p>

<p>Despite any changes to the extracellular matrix caused by the mutations, HSN still responds to UNC-6. This is evident because UNC-6 signaling induces the UNC-40 asymmetric localization and in these mutants UNC-40 becomes asymmetrically localized. In fact, double mutants, <italic>unc-52(e444); unc-6(ev400), unc-112(r367); unc-6(ev400),</italic> and <italic>vab-19(e1036); unc-6(ev400),</italic> are similar to <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>), <italic>i.e.</italic> there is a more uniform distribution of UNC-40::GFP around the periphery of HSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore the effect that the <italic>unc-52(e998), unc-52(e444), unc-112(r367),</italic> and <italic>vab-19(e1036)</italic> mutations have on the pattern of intracellular UNC-40 asymmetric localization depends on UNC-6 signaling.</p>
<p>We find that these mutations also affect the direction in which the axon protrudes from the HSN cell body (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097258-t001">Table 1</xref>). In particular, the percent of neurons that have an axon protruding ventrally decreases, whereas the percent that have an axon protruding anteriorly or posteriorly increases. We also tested double mutations; <italic>unc-40(e1430); unc-52(e998), unc-52(e998); unc-6(ev400), unc-40(e1430); unc-52(e444), unc-52(e444); unc-6(ev400), unc-40(e1430); unc-112(r367),</italic> and <italic>vab-19(e1036); unc-6(ev400).</italic> In these cases, the probability of dorsally directed protrusion is greater than in any of the single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g004">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097258-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Mutations Affect the Direction of HSN Axon Protrusion.</title>
<p>(A–G) Photomicrographs of L4 stage animals showing examples of the protrusion of the axon from the HSN cell body in wild-type and mutant animals. Ventral is down and anterior is to the left. Arrow indicates the PLM axon, if in the focal plane. Scale bar: 10 µm. (A) In wild-type animals, the HSN axon protrudes ventrally from the cell body. After reaching the ventral nerve chord the axon extends anteriorly and defasciculates from the cord to form synapses at the vulva. (B–E) In <italic>mig-15</italic> mutants, the HSN axon can protrude posterior (B), anterior and posterior (C), ventral (D) or anterior (E). Most axons in <italic>mig-15</italic> mutants that anteriorly or posteriorly protrude from the cell body eventually turn ventral. Only a few fail to reach the ventral nerve core (8% ±2, n = 100). (D–E) As axons cross the muscle/epidermis interface (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) they sometimes split into two parallel processes (26% ±1, n = 100). (F–I) As in <italic>mig-15</italic> mutants, the axon protrudes anteriorly, posteriorly, or ventrally in <italic>unc-52</italic>, <italic>ina-1</italic>, <italic>unc-97</italic>, <italic>unc-112,</italic> and <italic>vab-19</italic> mutants.

<p>We previously found that the UNC-6 receptor UNC-5 also can play a role in the UNC-6 guidance of the HSN axon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>. However, we find that the directional pattern of axon protrusion in <italic>unc-52(e998);unc-5(e53)</italic> and <italic>unc-5(e53); unc-112(r367)</italic> mutants is similar to the pattern observed in <italic>unc-52(e998)</italic> and <italic>unc-112(r367)</italic> mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097258-t001">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that the effects caused by the <italic>unc-52(e998)</italic> and <italic>unc-112(r367)</italic> mutations on the direction of protrusion do not require UNC-5 function.

<p>We find that <italic>mig-15</italic> and <italic>ina-1</italic> mutations similarly alter the pattern of UNC-40 asymmetric localization in HSN.

<p>We observed that in <italic>mig-15</italic> mutants the HSN neuron will often become bipolar, sending an axon in both the anterior or posterior directions. To explore further the association of this phenotype with the intracellular localization of UNC-40 we rescored the localization of UNC-40::GFP in HSN taking into consideration cases where the intensity at both the anterior and posterior sides where nearly equal and both were greater than the central domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistent with the frequent multipolar morphology of HSN in <italic>mig-15</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), the probability that UNC-40::GFP will localize primarily to both the anterior and posterior sides of the neuron is higher than in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Mutations Delay Axon Formation</title>
<p>Previously it was noted that <italic>unc-6</italic> and <italic>unc-40</italic> mutations can alter the timing of HSN axon development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Adler1">[19]</xref>. In comparison to wild-type animals, in <italic>unc-6</italic> mutants UNC-40 remains more uniformly distributed across HSN and the initial neurites that form do not develop a strong bias for the ventral direction. Normally by the early L2 larval stage HSN is polarized ventrally with neurites primarily restricted to the ventral side where a leading edge forms. Around the L3–L4 transition a single ventral axon becomes evident. However in <italic>unc-6</italic> and <italic>unc-40</italic> mutants axon development is delayed and neurite extension is not confined to the ventral side during the L3 stage. A predominate axon, which protrudes anteriorly, eventually forms however not until the L4 stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Adler1">[19]</xref>. In Wnt/PCP mutants, which have <italic>egl-20</italic>, <italic>mig-1</italic>, or <italic>vang-1</italic> mutations, the axon forms ventrally in response to UNC-6 but the development is delayed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>. In these mutants, neurites are not clearly ventrally oriented until around the L3–L4 transition. We hypothesize that this phenotype is the result of the direction of UNC-40 outgrowth activity randomly fluctuating in response to UNC-6. This fluctuation occurs because the Wnt signaling normally inhibit anteriorly and posteriorly directed UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth and in the mutants the probability of UNC-40 localization at the anterior and posterior sides increases, whereas the probability of localization at the ventral side decreases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>.</p>

<p>We previously showed that the directional response of a neuron to UNC-6 is stochastic; <italic>i.e.,</italic> there is a probability of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity occurring in any direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Xu1">[7]</xref>. We have proposed that the direction of UNC-6 guidance is determined by asymmetric cues that create a bias which directs UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth on average, over time, towards one side of the neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>. In this paper we provide evidence that the extracellular matrix acts as such a cue and provides directional information for UNC-6 guidance.</p>

<title>The Extracellular Matrix Provides Directional Information for UNC-6 Guidance</title>
<p>Axons respond to the surrounding environment and follow highly stereotyped and reproducible trajectories to their targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Raper1">[33]</xref>. During the past few decades many molecular signaling molecules that promote and guide axon outgrowth have been identified. Netrins are commonly described as tropic cues that are bifunctional, they act both as chemoattractants and chemorepellants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-TessierLavigne1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Bashaw1">[36]</xref>. A chemoattractant stimulates axon protrusion towards the site of ligand-receptor binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Huber1">[37]</xref>. In this model, the attractive UNC-6 response in HSN is greater towards the ventral source of UNC-6 because of the UNC-6 gradient and, therefore, the axon protrudes ventrally towards the UNC-6 source. In contrast, the stochastic model predicts that UNC-6 induces a stochastic fluctuation in the direction of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth. Since this response is non-directional, UNC-6 does not intrinsically function as either an attractant or repellent.</p>
<p>The results presented here indicate that the muscle/epidermis extracellular matrix is a directional cue for UNC-6 guidance. Matrix molecules, such as UNC-52 perlecan, may not themselves cause a directional response from the neuron. However, when UNC-6 induces the direction of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity to stochastically fluctuate within a neuron the interaction between the matrix and the neuron can cause directionality by increasing the probability that UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth occurs at the surface of the neuron that is in contact with the matrix. We show that when the muscle/epidermis extracellular matrix is disrupted by different mutations, UNC-6 still induces the asymmetric localization of UNC-40 in HSN, but the probability of anterior and posterior UNC-40 localization and axon outgrowth increases, whereas the probability of ventrally directed localization and outgrowth decreases. Consistent with inducing fluctuations in the direction of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity and with movement described by a biased random walk model, the HSN axon is guided by UNC-6 to the ventral nerve cord in the mutants even though axon outgrowth from the HSN cell body can be directed anteriorly or posteriorly.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g008">Figure 8</xref> graphically illustrates how altering the probability of outgrowth in each direction can influence the direction of guidance. The probability that an axon will protrude in a specific direction is controlled in part by the fluctuations of UNC-40 axon outgrowth activity that occur as the leading edge forms. These fluctuations are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g005">5</xref>. Whereas the axon protrudes from the ventral side of the cell body in wild-type animals, in <italic>unc-52</italic> and <italic>ina-1</italic> mutants there is a probability that the axon will also protrude from other sides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097258-t001">Table 1</xref>). This is consistent with the observations that the probability of UNC-40 localizing to each side of the neuron is altered by the mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g005">5</xref>). To visualize how this fluctuation effect a directional bias, we simulated a random walk of 250 steps (arbitrarily chosen) based on the probability of axon outgrowth in the dorsal, ventral, anterior, and posterior directions (for simplicity the multipolar phenotype was ignored). The probabilities are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097258-t001">Table 1</xref>. For each mutant, 10 simulations are plotted. The results graphically compare the directional bias of the system at the time of early axon protrusion and they depict how each mutation produces a different directional bias by altering the probabilities of outgrowth in each direction.</p>

<title>The directional bias during the initial protrusion of the HSN axon is altered by the mutations.</title>
<p>Simulated random walks of 250 steps were plotted from an origin (0, 0). The walks were generated using the probabilities of outgrowth in the dorsal, ventral, anterior, and posterior direction, as listed for each mutant in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097258-t001">Table 1</xref>. See text for details. (A) Plots generated to compare the effect that UNC-52 (perlecan) has on the directional bias. In the <italic>unc-52(e998)</italic> mutant there is a bias for ventral outgrowth. This bias is eliminated in <italic>unc-52(e998); unc-6(ev400)</italic> and <italic>unc-40(e1430);unc-52(e998)</italic> mutants. The difference suggests that UNC-52 alters the direction bias of UNC-6 axon guidance by altering the probability of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth in each direction. This is consistent with the evidence that <italic>unc-52(e998)</italic> alters the probability of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity in each direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The direction of the bias in the double mutants is different than that in <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> and <italic>unc-40(e1430)</italic> mutants. There is a strong bias for axon outgrowth in the anterior direction in <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> and <italic>unc-40(e1430)</italic> mutants. This outgrowth is UNC-40-independent, suggesting that the <italic>unc-52(e998)</italic> mutation also effects UNC-40-independent outgrowth activity in the double mutants. (B) Plots generated to compare the effect that INA-1 (integrin) has on the directional bias. In the <italic>ina-1(gm39)</italic> mutant there is a bias for ventral outgrowth. This ventral bias is eliminated in <italic>ina-1(gm39); unc-6(ev400)</italic> and <italic>unc-40(e1430); ina-1(gm39)</italic> mutants. The difference suggests that INA-1 alters the direction bias of UNC-6 axon guidance by altering the probability of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth in each direction. This is consistent with the evidence that <italic>ina-1(gm39)</italic> alters the probability of UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth activity in each direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The direction of the bias in the double mutants is different than that in <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> and <italic>unc-40(e1430)</italic> mutants. There is a strong bias for axon outgrowth in the anterior direction in <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> and <italic>unc-40(e1430)</italic> mutants. Because the anterior outgrowth is UNC-40-independent, the result suggests that the <italic>ina-1(gm39)</italic> mutation must also effect UNC-40-independent outgrowth activity in the double mutants.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows that at the time of early axon protrusion there is a bias for axon outgrowth in the ventral direction in <italic>unc-52</italic> and <italic>ina-1</italic> mutants. This ventral bias depends on UNC-40 and UNC-6, since in the double mutants there is no ventral bias. It is worth noting that in mutants, such as <italic>unc-40(e1430);ina-1(gm39),</italic> a substantial number of axons will initially protrude in the ventral direction. Nevertheless, the system does not create a ventral directional bias. The graphs also illustrate the strong bias for anteriorly directed axon outgrowth in <italic>unc-6</italic> and <italic>unc-40</italic> mutants and that the <italic>unc-52</italic> and <italic>ina-1</italic>mutations also affect this UNC-40-independent mediated activity.</p>
<p>If a mutation did not create any fluctuations in the direction of axon outgrowth activity, <italic>i.e.</italic> there was always a 100% probability of outgrowth in just one direction, than a corresponding line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g008">Figure 8</xref> would extend as a straight-line of 250 steps from the origin. However, a property of an object undergoing a random walk is that the distance increases only in proportion to the square root of the number of steps. We suggest that fluctuations in the direction of axon outgrowth activity could underlie the slower formation of the axon in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g006">Figure 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g008">Figure 8</xref> illustrates that mutations that cause fluctuations produce lines where the average distance from the origin to the endpoint is shorter than wildtype.</p>
<p>The ability of the direction of axon outgrowth activity to fluctuate could also underlie precocious axon formation in mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Before leading edge formation, the HSN neuron dynamically extends short neurites in different directions before they become restricted to the ventral side of the neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Adler1">[19]</xref>. In the mutants, there is an increase in the fluctuation of the direction of axon outgrowth activity. This could increase the probability that the early protrusions do not effectively retract and could increase the probability that an early protrusion continues to extend.</p>
<p>What does our analysis reveal about the molecular mechanisms of axon outgrowth? We observe that the <italic>unc-52</italic> and <italic>ina-1</italic> mutations alter the probability of UNC-40 localizing to each side of neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g005">5</xref>). This suggests that the probabilities are influenced by integrin-mediated interactions between the cell surface of the neuron and the muscle/epidermis extracellular matrix. This contact may regulate the rate of assembly and disassembly of UNC-40 complexes at the surface membrane of the neuron. Studies in vertebrates suggest that integrins can act as receptors for Netrin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Nikolopoulos1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Yebra1">[39]</xref> and so it is possible that INA-1 directly potentiates UNC-40 complex formation in response to UNC-6 that is found within the muscle/epidermis matrix. Other studies report that the enrichment of UNC-40 at the site of protrusion is important and that INA-1 likely regulates the stabilization or trafficking of UNC-40 at the cell membrane in contact with the matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Hagedorn1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Hagedorn2">[13]</xref>. The stochastic model only requires that somehow the interactions alter the probabilities of UNC-40 axon outgrowth activity occurring at each side of the neuron. The interactions do not necessarily have to affect axon outgrowth <italic>pre se.</italic> For example, contact with the matrix might alter some property of the neuron’s membrane that in turn leads to an event that influences the probability of UNC-40 complexes assembling or disassembling at that site.</p>
<p>The probabilistic approach used to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g008">Figure 8</xref> does not address the molecular mechanisms of axon outgrowth. It is based on the idea that the direction of axon outgrowth activity randomly fluctuates in response to the extracellular guidance cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kulkarni1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Xu1">[7]</xref>. We use probabilities to describe the mass effect that the molecular mechanisms have on the macroscopic movement of the axon. Although this approach does not describe molecular mechanisms of axon outgrowth, it may prove extremely valuable for understanding the effect that a mutation has on determining the direction of guidance. This approach differs from a deterministic approach. Currently a deterministic model considers that the axon outgrowth response to a guidance cue is directional (attractive or repulsive) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Kolodkin1">[40]</xref>. There is no randomness involved; the direction of outgrowth determines the direction of guidance. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which guidance cues cause an attractive or repulsive outgrowth also explains how the direction of axon guidance is determined. However, if the direction of axon outgrowth activity stochastically fluctuates in response to a guidance cue then the direction of axon outgrowth does not reveal the direction of guidance. This point is illustrated by <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097258-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g008">Figure 8</xref>. The initial axon outgrowth in a mutant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097258-t001">Table 1</xref>) is often not in the direction of guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097258-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The probabilistic approach predicts that the direction of guidance is determined by the succession of randomly directed outgrowth. Based on this concept the effect a mutation has on determining the direction of axon guidance is described by how it affects the probabilities of outgrowth in each direction.</p>

<title>A General Model for Netrin/DCC Activity</title>
<p>Besides guiding axons, UNC-6 and UNC-40 signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic> plays a role in anchor cell invasion and in the formation of presynaptic specializations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Ziel1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Hagedorn2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Poon1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-ColonRamos1">[43]</xref>. In other organisms, netrins play many diverse roles, including regulating vasculature, lung, pancreas, muscle and mammary gland development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-LaiWingSun1">[44]</xref>. Netrins and their receptors also have been implicated in the regulation of tumor development and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Mehlen1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097258-Mehlen2">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>The model we propose could have broad implications. In general netrin/DCC signaling may be used to polarize cellular activities and orient them to the surrounding environment. That is, netrin causes the direction of DCC activity to stochastically fluctuate. By increasing or decreasing the probability that DCC activity will become oriented to one particular side of the cell, external asymmetric factors orient polarized DCC activity within the cell. The cellular activities regulated by DCC may depend on the cell type and the stage of development.</p>
