        <p><italic>H. pylori</italic> drug-resistant strains and non-compliance to therapy are the major causes of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication failure. For some bacterial species it has been demonstrated that fatty acids have a growth inhibitory effect. Our main aim was to assess the ability of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to inhibit <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a mouse model. The effectiveness of standard therapy (ST) in combination with DHA on <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication and recurrence prevention success was also investigated. The effects of DHA on <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth were analyzed in an <italic>in vitro</italic> dose-response study and n <italic>in vivo</italic> model. We analized the ability of <italic>H. pylori</italic> to colonize mice gastric mucosa following DHA, ST or a combination of both treatments. Our data demonstrate that DHA decreases <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth <italic>in vitro</italic> in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, DHA inhibits <italic>H. pylori</italic> gastric colonization <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as decreases mouse gastric mucosa inflammation. Addition of DHA to ST was also associated with lower <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection recurrence in the mouse model. In conclusion, DHA is an inhibitor of <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth and its ability to colonize mouse stomach. DHA treatment is also associated with a lower recurrence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in combination with ST. These observations pave the way to consider DHA as an adjunct agent in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication treatment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection is extremely common world-wide with more than two thirds of the world population infected. This gram-negative bacterium is recognized as a major etiological factor in chronic active gastritis, gastric duodenal ulcers and gastric cancer. Successful treatment of this pathogen often leads to regression of some of its associated diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Graham1">[1]</xref>. The outcome of the infection depends on the complex interaction established between the bacteria and its host, including the virulence of the infecting strain and the genetic factors and age of the host. Environmental factors, mainly associated to diet, also contribute to this complex interplay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Peek1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication treatment has not changed to a large extent in the last decades. It relies on a triple therapy approach that combines clarithromycin or metronidazole in combination with other antibiotics and acid inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Malfertheiner1">[3]</xref>. However, this treatment regimen raises some concern mainly due to possible recurrence of infection, high cost, side effects, poor compliance to therapy and most importantly, acquired resistance to classically used antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Dammann1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Parsons1">[8]</xref>. In fact, it has been estimated that eradication therapy is unsuccessful in approximately one in every five patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Dammann1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Glupczynski1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Parsons1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Vakil1">[9]</xref>. Therefore a proper regimen should have high efficacy against clarithromycin and metronidazole-resistant strains of <italic>H. pylori</italic> because these strains are increasingly encountered in routine clinical practice.</p>
      <p>It has been proposed that certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) hold an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Bergsson1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Thompson1">[15]</xref>. Some mechanisms have been reported for PUFAs bacteria inhibitory action and gastric protective effect. These include the ability to disrupt cell membrane leading to bacteria lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Thompson1">[15]</xref>, and the ability to modulate the synthesis of mucosal anti-inflammatory prostaglandins, such as Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Das2">[16]</xref>. The decline in duodenal ulcer incidence associated with the rise in dietary intake of PUFA, independently of <italic>H. pylori</italic> treatment, led to a growing interest in the role of these fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Tamawski1">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that concentration of 2.5×10<sup>−4</sup> M of Linoleic acid (n-6 PUFA) could inhibit the growth of <italic>H. pylori in vitro</italic>. This inhibitory effect is thought to be related to the extent of unsaturation within PUFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Bergsson1">[10]</xref>. Despite the documented anti-microbial effect of PUFAs on the growth of fungi, protozoan, viruses and various types of bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Malfertheiner1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Sands1">[18]</xref>, few studies have described their action on <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth and viability.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a highly unsaturated PUFA present in fish oil, on <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and most importantly <italic>in vivo</italic> on its ability to colonize gastric mucosa. Our general aim was therefore to assess the effect of DHA on <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth using both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models. We performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> dose-response study of <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth inhibition by DHA, as well as an analysis of DHA effectiveness in inhibiting <italic>H. pylori</italic> gastric mucosal colonization in a mouse model. We also compared the effectiveness of a standard therapy (ST) combined with DHA in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication and recurrence success.</p>

        <title>Fatty acids, <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains and culture conditions</title>
        <p>DHA was obtained from <italic>Cayman Chemical Company</italic> (Michigan, USA) with a degree of purity of 99% in ethanol 0.06%. The <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains used were: SS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Lee1">[19]</xref>, B128 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Israel1">[20]</xref> and 26695 (ATCC 700392) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). <italic>H. pylori</italic> was grown on blood agar base 2 (Oxoid, Lyon, France) plates supplemented with 10% defibrinated horse blood (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 to 48 h under microaerobic conditions (7% O<sub>2</sub>, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>; Campygen gas pack; Oxoid). To determine growth kinetics, plate-grown <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains were inoculated to an initial optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.03 into liquid Brucella broth (BB) (Oxoid) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).</p>
        <p><italic>H. pylori</italic> grown for 18–20 hours yield a viable count of approximately 5.64×10<sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU)/ml.</p>

      <sec id="s2b">
        <title>DHA treatment of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cultures</title>

To establish <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth curves, 18–20 hours bacteria cultures were diluted 100-fold in 10 ml of medium with or without DHA to an initial OD of 0.03. Each experiment, consisting of a control (non-treated <italic>H. pylori</italic> culture) and <italic>H. pylori</italic> incubated with DHA at 50 µM, 100 µM, 250 µM, 500 µM and 1000 µM was performed in triplicate. <italic>H. pylori</italic> broth cultures were incubated under microaerophilic conditions, as described above. Every 6 hours, during a 48 hours period, a 200 µL sample of each bacterial culture was isolated, the OD measured and aliquots serially diluted and plated on blood agar petri dishes. After 48 hours of incubation, the number of viable bacteria was determined by colonies forming unit (CFU) counting.</p>
        <p>The ID50 values were determined for the three strains every 12 hours until 72 hours of growth in the presence of increasing concentrations of DHA from 50 to 1000 µM. ID50 corresponds to the DHA dose that leads to 50% of bacteria survival characterized by the ratio between the number of viable bacteria at a certain dose of DHA compared to the number of total bacteria in the control culture at the same time-point.</p>

        <p>Six-week-old specific pathogen-free (<italic>H. pylori</italic> free) C57BL/6 male mice (Charles Rivers, France) were orogastrically inoculated with 100 µL of a suspension of 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL of <italic>H. pylori</italic> strain SS1 known to colonize efficiently the mouse gastric mucosa, whereas control groups of mice were given peptone trypsin broth alone. This is a well-established mouse model of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Lee2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Ferrero1">[22]</xref>. The experiment consisted of four groups of twenty-four mice. Each group was further divided into four groups of six mice: control group (given peptone trypsin broth alone), non-infected DHA-treated group, <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected group and <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and DHA-treated group. Mice from DHA treated groups received drinking water supplemented with 50 µM of DHA, 24 hours after <italic>H. pylori</italic> SS1 infection and throughout the entire experiment. The DHA concentration used was determined according to the notion that the maximum daily recommendation for total n-3 PUFA in humans, is between 1–2 g/day (50 to 100 µM in the gastric milieu). To prevent any degradation of DHA due to light, the supplemented drinking water was contained in dark-coloured bottles. Toxicity signs associated to DHA treatment in mice were checked during the experiment (weight variation, appetite and liver-gastric histopathology). No toxic effects were observed: no weight variations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0035072.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and no signs of liver toxicity as indicated by histopathology analysis (data not shown). At each time-point (one, three, six and nine months) six mice from each group were sacrificed, stomachs isolated and <italic>H. pylori</italic> colonisation measured as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Ferrero1">[22]</xref>. Since <italic>H. pylori</italic> is a human-specific bacteria that is not able to colonize the mouse stomach unless inoculated, no animals were sacrificed at the time-point zero. The number of viable bacterial colonies was counted and expressed as CFU per gram of gastric tissue.</p>

        <p>PGE2 is produced in several pathological conditions by a wide variety of tissues. Increased amount of PGE2 is associated with inflammation and tissue injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Furuyashiki1">[28]</xref>. At both time-points, infected mice treated with DHA showed lower serum PGE2 levels compared with infected but non DHA-treated mice (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0284) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035072-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Altogether, these data showed that in the mouse model of chronic <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, DHA addition is accompanied by a reduction in the inflammatory response.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study identifies DHA as a novel antibacterial agent, which inhibits <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and its ability to colonize the gastric mucosa in a mouse model. It was previously demonstrated that some free fatty acids can inhibit up to 50% of <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth <italic>in vitro</italic> within a concentration of 1 mM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Petschow1">[13]</xref>, whereas 2 mM would kill all bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Petschow1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Thompson1">[15]</xref>. To our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the inhibitory effect of DHA on <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and most importantly <italic>in vivo</italic>. As we showed, DHA is able to inhibit <italic>H. pylori</italic> gastric colonization in a significant proportion of mice (50%, P&lt;0.05). The lack of effect in all DHA-treated mice may be due to variation in the delivery of DHA to animals. However, biological variability within mouse population cannot be excluded. According to these data, DHA treatment should not be regarded as a replacement strategy for conventional antibiotic treatment. However, it is very interesting that in an experiment designed to evaluate DHA effectiveness as a co-adjuvant to ST antibiotherapy to prevent <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection recurrence, the addition of DHA yielded better results than ST alone. Thus, our results support the use of DHA in combination with standard antibiotic therapy for <italic>H. pylori</italic> treatment to inhibit efficiently the infection recurrence. These data suggests DHA supplementation as a safe prophylactic/preventive strategy for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection eradication that is worth further consideration.</p>
      <p>DHA concentration was a critical point in our study, as the concentration observed to be effective varied according to the experimental model used. In <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, differences in the level of sensitivity to DHA are observed between the three <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains tested. This may be due to the high genetic variability which characterizes <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains. Despite that, 100 µM of DHA is enough to significantly inhibit bacteria growth, with a maximum inhibitory effect at 250 µM. Hence, DHA concentrations have to be optimized for different experimental settings in order to obtain optimum effects. This is not surprising and it is actually typical of experiments aiming at measuring the effect of different drugs on microbiological agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Roomi1">[29]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, several parameters such as the biodistribution of the compounds, their chemical stability, their metabolization and their resistance to the extreme acidic conditions of the gastric lumen can modulate their bioactivity. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis showed that the presence of DHA at a concentration of 50 µM in mice drinking water is efficient to inhibit significantly <italic>H. pylori</italic> gastric colonization. This concentration is within the range of concentrations reachable with diet in the human stomach for any PUFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Thompson1">[15]</xref>. Levels of DHA given to mice in our experiments are also within a safe and well tolerated range of concentrations with no toxic effects observed, in agreement with several clinical trials that have used DHA supplementation at higher doses with no reports of toxicological effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Kelley1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Duggan1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite the experimental data supporting an inhibitory effect of DHA on <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth, no association between DHA intake and <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection incidence has been made. In fact, it could be regarded as puzzling that countries like Japan and Portugal, with dietary habits including high intakes of fat fish naturally rich in DHA, exhibit some of the highest incidences of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection worldwide. There are several explanations for this apparent discrepancy: 1- DHA daily intake recommendations in grams do not have a direct translation in terms of DHA gastric concentration. It is therefore not guaranteed that a DHA concentration of 50 µM will be achieved by food consumption, even when daily intake recommendations are met; 2- DHA is typically present in food as triacylglycerol that will be hydrolysed along the digestive tract, leading to only a small amount being released as free fatty acid in the gastric milieu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Borgstrom1">[32]</xref>; 3- the high degree of unsaturation of the DHA molecule makes it vulnerable to oxidation and temperature. This can result in the modification of the DHA chemical structure, and interfere with its anti-<italic>Helicobacter</italic> properties. Hence, the level of fish consumption, or any other DHA-rich food for that matter, does not constitute an adequate measure of DHA gastric concentration and DHA availability to <italic>H. pylori</italic>. This point is well illustrated by the fact that although no association between fish intake and gastric cancer risk could be drawn from the Japanese population, the percentage of DHA in the membrane composition of erythrocytes was directly associated with a lower risk of developing gastric cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Kuriki1">[33]</xref>. These arguments may justify the lack of a positive association between <italic>H. pylori</italic> gastric colonization/gastritis and high levels of PUFA supplementation in clinical trials. As an example is a study in which <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected-patients were supplemented with capsules containing linolenic acid (n-3 PUFA), linoleic acid (n-6 PUFA) or subjected to an increased margarine intake in the diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Kelley1">[30]</xref>. Although PUFA overall levels were significantly increased in individuals supplemented with PUFAs in comparison with the control group, no <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth inhibition or lower inflammation status were observed.</p>
      <p>The mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of lipids on <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth is unknown. However, it has been shown that fatty acids, in concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mM, affect the lipid constitution of the bacterial plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Sands1">[18]</xref>. A possible explanation for the bactericidal effect of PUFA relies on the formation of toxic lipid peroxides generated from an oxidative process involving H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and iron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Bergsson1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Knapp1">[12]</xref>. Another potential mechanism suggested for the killing of bacteria after exposure to fatty acids is by cell membrane alteration, leaving the bacterial cell wall intact. According to this mechanism, fatty acids would be incorporated into the cell membrane resulting in an increased membrane fluidity and permeability; this effect would be further exacerbated by the presence of unsaturated double bounds, as they seem to exert a toxic effect towards the bacterial cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Bergsson1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Thompson1">[15]</xref>. Supporting this cell membrane disruption hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that radiolabeled PUFAs added to <italic>H. pylori</italic> liquid cultures are incorporated into the <italic>H. pylori</italic> plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Thompson1">[15]</xref>. In agreement, our electron microscopy observations revealed <italic>H. pylori</italic> morphological changes upon n-3 PUFA DHA (C22:6) treatment. A proportion of <italic>H. pylori</italic> -DHA treated bacteria displayed coccoid forms, known to be associated with a bacterial decreased viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Sorberg1">[27]</xref>. The morphological transition of <italic>H. pylori</italic> from a bacillary to a coccoid shape has been previously reported to be related to modification of the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Chaput1">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results show that DHA inhibits <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although the mechanisms underlying this inhibitory effect are still unclear, our results demonstrate that DHA impairs <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth and gastric colonization and attenuates the host inflammatory response. More importantly, the combination of DHA and ST strongly decreased the recurrence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in the mouse model. Although not evaluated in this study, the effectiveness of ST/DHA combined treatment in inhibiting <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced gastric inflammation is another important aspect of the benefit of DHA therapy that deserves to be further addressed. It should be emphasized that DHA raises low toxicological constraints and it is also well tolerated. In agreement, it is widely and commonly used both at a clinical trial and at a diet level for long time periods. Additionally, DHA has cytoprotective properties and enhances the formation of prostaglandins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Lee1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although the established therapeutical regimens for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication have been proven effective, treatment failure still occurs and is increasingly common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035072-Malfertheiner1">[3]</xref>. Altogether the data obtained in the current work may pave the way to propose the use of DHA in preventive and curative strategies for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication, as a co-adjuvant agent in combination with standard therapy. Consequently, DHA supplementation within the range of concentrations we have tested should be considered as a safe prophylactic/preventive strategy against <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.</p>
