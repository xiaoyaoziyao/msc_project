<p>Vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF<sub>165</sub> is a critical element for development of the vascular system in physiological and pathological angiogenesis. VEGF isoforms have different affinities for heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) as well as for VEGF receptors; HSPGs are important regulators in vascular development. Therefore, inhibition of interactions between VEGF and HSPGs may prevent angiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that an HSPG-binding synthetic peptide, corresponding to exon 6a-encoded domain of VEGF gene, has anti-angiogenic property. This 20 amino acids synthetic peptide prevents VEGF<sub>165</sub> binding to several different cell types, mouse embryonic sections and inhibits endothelial cell migration, despite its absence in VEGF<sub>165</sub> sequence. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumor studies show that the peptide inhibits tumor growth in both mouse Lewis-Lung Carcinoma and human Liposarcoma tumor-bearing animal models. This is the first evidence that a synthetic VEGF fragment corresponding to exon 6a has functional antagonism both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We conclude that the above HPSG binding peptide (6a-P) is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis-dependent diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature is defined as angiogenesis. The relevance of angiogenesis is not limited to cancer, but also extends to a number of non-neoplastic diseases, including macular degeneration, psoriasis, endometriosis and arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Folkman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Carmeliet1">[2]</xref>. Remodeling of blood vessels occurs through a number of steps. Following destabilization of existing vessels, it is followed by migration of endothelial cells, and proliferation and formation of new vessels tubes. Inhibition of this process can be achieved by blocking any of these stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Tournaire1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Pericytes and lymphocytes release a number of factors which play important roles in establishing angiogenesis. They include acidic and basic FGF, tumor necrosis factor TNF-α, transforming growth factor TGF-β, and most importantly, vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF. This growth factor exists under several isoforms, i.e. VEGF<sub>121</sub>, VEGF<sub>165</sub>, VEGF<sub>189</sub> and VEGF<sub>206</sub>, which are generated by alternative mRNA splicing. VEGF isoforms have different affinities for heparan sulphate as well as for VEGF receptors, and play distinct roles in vascular development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Robinson1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Hcker1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mast cells secrete heparin which is a linear polysaccharide with a high sulfate content. It demonstrates pro-coagulant activity. Heparan sulfate, a closely related molecule, contains much lower sulfate and is associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) on the cell surface of all mammalian cells. It is a component of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) which are attached to the cell membrane. The composition of polysaccharides and their sulfation content confers structures on the cell surface which determine the binding of a number of ligands to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Robinson1">[4]</xref>. The linear HSPGs binding domain of VEGF is located on exon 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Stringer1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Cohen1">[9]</xref>. However, the interaction of this domain for VEGF binding to its receptors is poorly understood.</p>
<p>In this study, we used a synthetic peptide, corresponding to exon 6a, to compete VEGF<sub>165</sub> binding to cell surface and prevent the VEGF function both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that this fragment could inhibit VEGF binding to different cell types and block VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration. Moreover, this peptide suppressed tumor growth by antiangiogenesis without causing toxicity. These findings indicate that the 6a-P is a potent angiogenic inhibitor with potential for clinical investigation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In order to test the specificity of antiangiogenesis efficacy of HSPG binding site of VEGF, we used a 20-amino acid synthetic peptide, called 6a-P which is encoded on exon-6a domain of the human VEGF gene (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The mouse version of this peptide shows a single amino acid substitution at tyrosine by phenylalanine.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>6a-P peptide binds strongly to heparin and prevents VEGF<sub>165</sub> binding to different cell types by FACS</title>
<p>VEGF is an important angiogenesis factor, not only for endothelial cells but also tumor cells. The binding of VEGF to endothelial cell surface is mediated by HSPG. To test binding of the peptide 6a-P to proteoglycans, we employed a small heparin-sepharose column for binding studies. Most of the peptide was eluted at concentration of 1 molar NaCl as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009945-t001">Table 1</xref>. In order to investigate the interactions between VEGF and HSPG, several cell lines such as HUVECs, liposarcoma cells, pancreatic cancer cells (ASPC-1) and mouse LLC were used for human recombinant VEGF<sub>165</sub> (rhVEGF) binding by flow cytometry analysis (FACS). 0.1 or 1 µg/ml rhVEGF was used for incubation of the cells in the presence and absence of the peptide. The HSPG binding peptide blocked VEGF binding to human liposarcoma cells, ASPC-1 cells to more than 99% and VEGF binding of HUVECs to 96% at high concentration (10 µg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). VEGF-Trap is a reagent which contains the neutralizing binding domains of the two VEGF receptors FLT-1 and KDR, and it is employed as an antiangiogenic therapy in ongoing clinical trials. It functions by competing with VEGF receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Holash1">[10]</xref>. It inhibits VEGF binding to HUVECs by approximately 70%. The synergic experiment showed that the VEGF binding was inhibited completely when 6a-P plus VEGF-Trap were present in binding media of HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and human liposarcoma cells (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009945.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We also used two synthetic linear peptides corresponding to exons 7 and 8 (cysteines were substituted by alanines), which comprise the heparin binding region of VEGF<sub>165</sub> (designated HP165-A and HP165-B). The results showed that these two linear peptides were not capable of blocking VEGF binding to cells even at high concentration, pointing to requirement for maintaining three dimensional structure of VEGF165 heparin binding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>. HUVECs, fibroblasts, AsPC-1 and liposarcoma cells were subjected to FACS analysis. Cells were digested and resuspensed with 2% BSA in PBS for blocking, 0.1 µg/ml rhVEGF was incubated and present or absent with 1 (low dose) or 10 (high dose) µg/ml of the peptide for 1 h in 4°C. After cold PBS washing, the samples were incubated with VEGF antibody and secondary FITC-labeled antibody. The results show that rhVEGF binding activity is inhibited when the peptide is present (A). VEGF-Trap has been used for a positive control, inhibiting VEGF binding about 70%. The synergic result shows that the rhVEGF binding is inhibited completely when 1 µg/ml of the peptide plus 0.1 µg/ml of VEGF-Trap are present with HUVECs (B). HP165A, HP165B peptides do not inhibit binding of VEGF to HUVECs (C).</p>

<title>Immunocytochemistry data demonstrate that the 6a-P decreases VEGF<sub>165</sub> binding to the cell surface</title>
<p>Immunocytochemistry experiments confirmed that VEGF binding was also inhibited by the 6a-P peptide. The VEGF binding intensity on endothelial cells (HUVECS) was decreased when the 6a-P peptide or VEGF-Trap were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

<p>Endothelial cell migration is an important step in new blood vessel formation and tumor angiogenesis. To evaluate the effective of HSPG binding peptide in endothelial cell migration, we used rhVEGF<sub>165</sub> to induce HUVECs migration in a transwell assay (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We monitored and quantified the migration of cells. Cells migrating across the membrane were stained with blue-purple stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) and counted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).

<p>Our animal experiments enable us to evaluate the efficacy of 6a-P peptide by inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. For these studies, we used two different tumor-bearing animal models. Mice were treated with peptide or PBS twice a day.

Less hemorrhage (shown in red on tumor surface) was observed at the high dose of peptide treatment, even though tumor masses were in some cases similar in size to those of the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). The tumor weights on average were reduced 2-fold following treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>).

<title>Tumor vessel activity and tumor cells apoptosis are affected by 6a-P peptide</title>
<p>Vessel activity is another important factor for angiogenesis in tumor.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A single gene is responsible for generation of alternative splice forms of VEGF. Exons 1-5 of VEGF contain sequences which determine the protein sequences required for the recognition of its tyrosine kinase receptors, FLT-1 and KDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Tischer1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Keyt1">[21]</xref>. Exons 6 and 7 encode peptide domains which are responsible for two separate different heparin-binding regions on the cell surface. In general, different VEGF isoforms are distinguished by the presence of heparin- binding sequences belonging to one of the targeted HSPGs. VEGF<sub>121</sub> does not bind to ECM due to its lack of heparin binding sequences. Exon 7 peptide is a component of VEGF<sub>165</sub>, whereas VEGF<sub>189</sub> contains both exon 6a and exon 7. Finally, VEGF<sub>206</sub> contains both exons 6a and 6b of the VEGF gene. VEGF <sub>121</sub> and VEGF<sub>165</sub> are secreted into the medium by producing cells, whereas VEGF<sub>189</sub> and VEGF<sub>206</sub> are sequestered by cell surface heparan sulfates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Neufeld1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Houck2">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Neufeld2">[24]</xref>. However, the contribution of exon 6a to the biological properties of VEGF has not been studied in detail.</p>
<p>In this report, we investigated a synthetic peptide corresponding to the exon 6a-encoded domain of VEGF gene, which is known as an ECM or heparin-binding region. We found that the VEGF<sub>165</sub> binding to cell surface was blocked by this peptide in a competitive binding study by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) and immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g002">Fig.2</xref>). The functional analysis showed that it inhibited endothelial cell migration in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). For comparison purposes, we employed two synthetic peptides corresponding to exons 7 and 8, which comprise the heparin binding region of VEGF<sub>165</sub> (designated HP165-A and HP165-B). This region contains several disulfides which are probably important for the heparin binding properties of VEGF<sub>165</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Robinson2">[25]</xref>. In order to confer solubility to the peptides, we replaced the cysteins by alanines. The results showed that the two modified peptides were not capable of blocking VEGF binding to cells even at high concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), pointing to importance of secondary structure and formations of proper disulfides for such an interaction.</p>
<p>Our animal experiments demonstrated that the tumor masses had fewer blood vessels present on tumor surfaces after low or high concentrations of the peptide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). VEGF and its receptors are upregulated under hypoxic conditions that are found in most solid tumors. Up-regulation of both the ligand and its receptor, specifically in tumor sections, leads to a high concentration of VEGF:receptor complex on tumor endothelium, as compared with the endothelium in normal tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-deVries1">[11]</xref>. Our results showed that the interaction of VEGF and its receptor, KDR, was suppressed when this peptide was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>Proteoglycans are associated with the mammalian cell membrane. Their genetics have been studied in detail in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Gradient formation and signal trasnductions are to a great extent modulated by HSPGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Hcker1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Lin1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Selleck1">[28]</xref>. Several prominent signaling cascades are disrupted by mutations in these acidic glycoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Lin2">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009945-Han1">[31]</xref>. In support of this possibility, our HSPG binding peptide treated tumor section showed an increase in apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009945-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). It may explain the phenomenon of angiogenic and tumor growth suppression observed in animals treated with exogenous 6a-P peptide, resulting in competition with endogenous VEGF binding to its targets. Our peptide, although based on its sequence, appears to be of a more non-specific nature, it is capable of competing with binding between VEGF<sub>165</sub> and its heparin binding domain. We found that the 6a-P peptide could not only block VEGF binding and inhibit its function on the cells, but also suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis in animal models. These results serve as evidence that HSPG domain of exon 6a may play an important role in regulating VEGF function and its signaling transduction pathway.</p>
<p>In summary, we showed in this study that 6a-P peptide corresponding to exon 6a inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the binding of VEGF<sub>165</sub> to endothelial cells and tumor cells and VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration. It also blocked angiogenesis in the matrigel assay and suppressed tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice models. Moreover, we have demonstrated that VEGF/KDR complex formation was decreased and the apoptotic cells were increased after peptide treatment. This VEGF inhibitor may be a potential lead compound for the development of therapeutic agents against tumor angiogenesis or angiogenesis-dependent diseases.</p>

<p>The cell lines: human Liposarcoma (a gift from Dr. George Naumov), human pancreatic cancer ASPC-1 (ATCC), mouse LLC (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM or RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine, respectively, and supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. HUVECs (Lonza) were maintained in EBM endothelial growth media and EGM Bullet Kit (Lonza) with antibiotics. VEGF-Trap was a gift from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Tarrytown, NY). The 6a-P peptide “KSVRGKGKGQKRKRKKSRYK” and the two truncated VEGF<sub>165</sub> heparin-binding peptides, HP165A “RRKHLFVQDPQTAKCSAKNTD-SRAKAR” and HP165B “KARQLELNERTARADKPRR” were synthesized by Synpep Corp.

<title>Animal and tumor models</title>
<p>All animal procedures were carried out in compliance with Children's Hospital Boston guidelines. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Eight weeks old male and pregnancy female C57B/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) and SCID mice (Massachusetts General Hospital) were used. Mice were acclimated, caged in groups of five in a barrier care facility, and fed animal chow and water ad libitum and all mice were shaved and the dorsal skin was cleaned with ethanol before cells injection. Human liposarcoma or mouse LLC cells were used for anti-tumor studies. A suspension of 5×10<sup>6</sup> of liposarcoma or 1×10<sup>6</sup> of LLC cells in 0.1 ml of PBS was injected. Mice were weighed and tumors were monitored twice a week in two diameters with digital calipers. Tumor volumes were determined using a<sup>2</sup>×b×0.52 (where a is the shortest and b is the longest diameter). Tumors were allowed to grow to ∼100 mm<sup>3</sup> and mice were randomized. The treatments were by bolus s.c. injections twice a day.</p>
