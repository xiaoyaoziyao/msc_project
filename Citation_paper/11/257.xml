      <abstract>
        <p>Expansion of cropland in tropical countries is one of the principal causes of biodiversity loss, and threatens to undermine progress towards meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. To understand this threat better, we analysed data on crop distribution and expansion in 128 tropical countries, assessed changes in area of the main crops and mapped overlaps between conservation priorities and cultivation potential. Rice was the single crop grown over the largest area, especially in tropical forest biomes. Cropland in tropical countries expanded by c. 48,000 km<sup>2</sup> per year from 1999–2008. The countries which added the greatest area of new cropland were Nigeria, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Sudan and Brazil. Soybeans and maize are the crops which expanded most in absolute area. Other crops with large increases included rice, sorghum, oil palm, beans, sugar cane, cow peas, wheat and cassava. Areas of high cultivation potential—while bearing in mind that political and socio-economic conditions can be as influential as biophysical ones—may be vulnerable to conversion in the future. These include some priority areas for biodiversity conservation in tropical countries (e.g., Frontier Forests and High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas), which have previously been identified as having ‘low vulnerability’, in particular in central Africa and northern Australia. There are also many other smaller areas which are important for biodiversity and which have high cultivation potential (e.g., in the fringes of the Amazon basin, in the Paraguayan <italic>Chaco</italic>, and in the savanna woodlands of the Sahel and East Africa). We highlight the urgent need for more effective sustainability standards and policies addressing both production and consumption of tropical commodities, including robust land-use planning in agricultural frontiers, establishment of new protected areas or REDD+ projects in places agriculture has not yet reached, and reduction or elimination of incentives for land-demanding bioenergy feedstocks.</p>

        <title>Cropland expansion as a threat to biodiversity</title>
        <p>No human activity has altered the face of the planet more than agriculture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Tilman1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Ellis1">[3]</xref>. Cropland covers at least 12% of the planet's ice-free surface, and annually we now harvest more than 10% of the Earth's net primary production in the form of crops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Haberl1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Ramankutty1">[5]</xref>. Although some species can benefit from agriculture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Wright1">[6]</xref>, habitat loss resulting from its expansion is one of the greatest global threats to biodiversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Sala1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Donald1">[10]</xref> and threatens to undermine progress towards meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-UNEP1">[11]</xref>. Despite this, there have been few attempts to summarise and synthesise information on global patterns of crop expansion or cultivation potential in relation to priority areas for biodiversity conservation, or to carry out systematic assessments to identify which crops might pose the greatest threat to biodiversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Donald1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Clay1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Scharlemann1">[13]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Increases in food production in recent years owe more to intensification of crop production than to cropland expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-FAO1">[14]</xref>. Projections suggest that land expansion will account for only 20% of production increases in developing countries in coming decades, with higher yields (including through increased multiple cropping and shorter fallow periods) accounting for the rest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-FAO1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-OECDFAO1">[15]</xref>. But despite its modest contribution to global food production, meeting 20% of production increase from new cropland by 2030 would require conversion to crop production of an area equivalent to South Africa. Most of this land is likely to be in sub-Saharan Africa and South America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-McIntyre1">[16]</xref>. Although the rate of global cropland expansion is slowing, there is little room for conservationists to be complacent: new croplands have in recent decades come largely at the expense of natural habitats, particularly tropical forests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Gibbs1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-deAraujo1">[18]</xref>. New markets such as those for liquid biofuels are creating new demand for agricultural products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Koh1">[19]</xref>. The net effects on biodiversity of increased biofuel production depends on whether biofuels ameliorate climate change impacts sufficiently to offset their land-use impacts. If even a small proportion of crop-based biofuels are planted on previously carbon-rich land, or cause indirect land use change onto such land, biofuels overall will not help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, at least in the near term <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Melillo1">[20]</xref>. Proposals for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) for climate mitigation might help to slow cropland expansion into forests, but there is also a risk that they will displace expansion into non-forest biomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Miles1">[21]</xref>. As long as agricultural expansion continues, it seems likely to remain a major driver of biodiversity loss.</p>
        <p>It is necessary to identify those crops that have expanded most rapidly in recent years (both in absolute and relative terms) and to assess the spatial pattern of these changes—especially in tropical biomes where most species occur—if we are to understand the current and future threats they pose. Individual crops differ enormously in their biodiversity impacts, depending on how and where they are cultivated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Donald1">[10]</xref>. Likewise, the drivers of expansion differ among crops, depending on socioeconomic context (e.g., whether demand is for subsistence use or overseas markets) and end uses (e.g., food, animal feed or biofuels) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Geist1">[22]</xref>. The impacts of crop cultivation also depend on the extent to which croplands are integrated into mosaics with natural and semi-natural habitats, in which case they might cause fragmentation over a wide area but have higher biodiversity value at a local scale; or are concentrated on a smaller total area, in which case they might have lower biodiversity value locally but affect a smaller area overall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Green1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Phalan1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Phalan2">[24]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Aims of this study</title>
        <p>The aim of this paper is to provide a global overview of patterns of crop expansion in relation to conservation priorities in tropical countries. Specifically, we address the following questions:</p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>Which crops cover most area in tropical countries and tropical biomes?</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>In which tropical countries has most expansion occurred in recent years, and which crops were involved?</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>How are remaining areas of cultivation potential distributed across tropical countries, particularly in relation to priority areas for biodiversity conservation?</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>We focus on tropical countries because they support the highest concentrations of species richness and endemism for most well-studied taxonomic groups, have large projected increases in demand for food from human populations growing in size and wealth, are experiencing high rates of habitat loss, and are seen as providing the most scope for increasing global agricultural production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-FAO1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Chomitz1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Hansen1">[28]</xref>. An understanding of patterns of crop expansion across tropical countries in particular will therefore be essential if increasing conflicts between biodiversity conservation and human demands for agricultural products are to be addressed.</p>

          <title>Tropical countries</title>
          <p>We defined tropical countries as those with at least one-third of their land area between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. This included 128 tropical countries (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051759.s003">Table S2</xref>). We used this definition rather than a wider definition incorporating all countries with any land in the tropics because pan-tropical data on changes in the area of specific crops were only available on a whole-country level; our definition thus excludes countries such as China and the United States, which have almost all of their territory outside the tropics.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2a2">
          <title>Tropical biomes</title>
          <p>We clipped a global map of biomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Olson1">[29]</xref> to the extent of tropical countries. Biomes included in analyses were (with shortened names used on figures in parentheses): ‘tropical &amp; subtropical moist broadleaf forests’ (moist broadleaf forests), ‘tropical &amp; subtropical grasslands, savannas and shrubland’ (grasslands, savannas), ‘tropical &amp; subtropical dry broadleaf forests’ (dry broadleaf forests), ‘deserts and xeric shrublands’ (drylands), ‘tropical &amp; subtropical coniferous forests’ (coniferous forests), ‘montane grasslands and shrublands’ (montane grasslands), ‘mangroves’ (mangroves) and ‘flooded grasslands and savannas’ (flooded grasslands). We excluded from the analyses all exclusively temperate or mediterranean biomes, and also lakes, rock and ice, and tundra.</p>

        <sec id="s2a3">
          <title>Priority areas for biodiversity conservation</title>
          <p>We obtained GIS datasets of priority areas for biodiversity conservation as summarised by Brooks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Brooks1">[30]</xref> from various sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Hoekstra1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Sanderson1">[39]</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051759.s005">Table S4</xref>). We converted these, in a WGS84 geographic projection, to a 5 min×5 min (≈10 km×10 km) grid to match crop datasets, including any 5-min grid cell which overlapped the priority areas. These data were then imported into a PostgreSQL database. We used SQL queries to calculate areas of overlap using data from a matching grid on cropland extent and cultivation potential, and on the area of each grid cell calculated in an equal-area Behrmann projection.</p>

        <title>Data sources and limitations</title>
        <p>To explore the impact of different crops on priority areas for biodiversity conservation across the tropics we needed data on where they are grown and expanding, but available data vary in resolution and quality. Several land cover maps show global croplands, but they often use different definitions, with often quite different results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-KaptuTchuent1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-McCallum1">[43]</xref>. Maps which integrate satellite-derived land cover data with subnational agricultural inventory data are probably more accurate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Ramankutty1">[5]</xref>, and now include global maps of individual crops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Monfreda1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-You1">[45]</xref>. However, time-series of such maps are not yet available, so attempts to assess change are limited to using annual data at country level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-FAOSTAT1">[46]</xref>. We use two sorts of such data: crop data (harvested area) for changes in area of individual crops, and land data (not differentiated by crop) for changes in cropland area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-FAOSTAT1">[46]</xref>. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051759.s005">Table S4</xref> for further details of data sources.)</p>
        <p>Analyses based on these global data must be interpreted critically, because their quality and consistency vary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Ewers1">[47]</xref>. Three examples serve to illustrate the need for caution when interpreting such data:</p>

            <p>India does not report any harvested area for oil palm fruit in FAOSTAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-FAOSTAT1">[46]</xref>, although it has up to 1,780 km<sup>2</sup> of oil palm plantations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Thoenes1">[48]</xref>.

          <list-item>
            <p>Particularly in many African countries, crops are often intercropped on the same land <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Ramankutty2">[50]</xref>. The FAO provides advice for evaluating and reporting their area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-FAO2">[51]</xref>, but doing so consistently and accurately is inevitably difficult.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>There are several further reasons why the sum of crop data might not equal that of land data. First, land where annual crops are harvested more than once per year from a given area is double- or triple-counted in crop data, but counted only once in land data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-FAO1">[14]</xref>. Double- and triple-crop rice systems in Asia account for about 25% of global rice production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Cassman1">[52]</xref>. Second, crop data exclude areas not harvested because crops were destroyed by drought, flooding or pests, or temporarily fallow, whereas land data typically include such areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-FAO3">[53]</xref>. Third, some countries report only fruit-bearing area for perennial crops, while others report all planted area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-FAO4">[54]</xref>. The first discrepancy will cause crop data to overestimate true cropland area, while the second and third will lead to underestimates. Land data may thus give a more accurate picture of overall changes in cropland area.</p>
        <p>Maps of cultivation potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Tth1">[55]</xref> must also be interpreted with caution. First, climate data and projections are downscaled from a coarser grid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Tabor1">[56]</xref>. Second, it is difficult to predict how technologies such as crop breeding will affect agricultural potential in the future: the dramatic expansion of soybeans in the southern Brazilian Amazon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Fearnside1">[57]</xref> for example, has relied upon the development of aluminium- and low-calcium-tolerant varieties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Clay1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Spehar1">[58]</xref>. Third, social and political factors are important: the disastrous Mega Rice Project in Kalimantan is an example of politically-motivated cropland expansion in an area poorly suited to rice cultivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Aldhous1">[59]</xref>. Nevertheless, while cultivation potential is not the only factor that will affect future patterns of crop expansion, and might not be the most important factor, mapping it helps to give a broad indication of the areas that might be vulnerable to conversion in the future.</p>
        <p>To assess the possible impacts of crop expansion on biodiversity, we compared crop maps with priority areas for biodiversity conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Brooks1">[30]</xref>. Brooks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Brooks1">[30]</xref> classified nine priority templates along axes of “vulnerability” and irreplaceability, defining “vulnerable” areas as those with little remaining habitat (high levels of past habitat loss). The definition is therefore retrospective, and does not provide information on vulnerability to threats in the future. Recent analysis using global land-use change projections from the IMAGE model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-IMAGE1">[60]</xref> has suggested that some of the areas identified by Brooks et al. as being of “low vulnerability”—particularly High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas—might be highly vulnerable to agricultural expansion in the coming century <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Dobrovolski1">[61]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our analyses did not consider other forms of land use, such as livestock grazing, forestry and residential and commercial development. Conversion to cattle pasture remains the dominant driver of deforestation in Latin America, where over three-fifths of recent global humid forest conversion has occurred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Hansen2">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Barona1">[63]</xref>. We focus on cropland expansion because it changes habitat structure so profoundly, can be more accurately assessed by remote sensing (compared to many forms of grazing and forestry) and is so extensive (compared to urban areas).</p>

We tested whether this would change our rankings for the 12 most important crops in our dataset (defined as those in the top 10 crops by harvested area in tropical countries, and/or the top 10 by annual area increment) by calculating the minimum harvested area for each of them using information on the distribution of multiple cropping zones. We first calculated the area of each crop grown within each of nine ‘multiple cropping zones’, using crop maps from Monfreda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Monfreda1">[44]</xref> (which counts double-cropped areas twice) and cropping zones from plate 13 of Fischer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Fischer1">[65]</xref>.

We used regression to estimate annual change—rather than a simple comparison of area in 1999 with that in 2008—because using data points for each year (rather than just the start and end years) reduces the chance of inaccuracies in reporting having a large influence on trends, though we also looked at results based just on the difference in crop areas between 1999 and 2008.</p>

For each 5-min grid cell, we could determine the potential yield for each crop, as a percentage of the tropical maximum for that crop. We took the value for the crop with the highest percentage in a grid cell as an indicator of cultivation potential, to produce combined maps of cultivation potential for crops with similar requirements for wetter climates (cassava, rice, sugar cane and oil palm) and for drier climates (beans, cow peas, groundnut, maize, millet, sorghum and soybeans), and of cultivation potential for the top 12 crops combined.</p>

As discussed in Data Sources and Limitations, the lower of each pair of estimates (based on land data) are likely to reflect more accurately land area converted to cropland, because multiple cropping and cropland from which crops were not harvested complicate reliable aggregation of area statistics from individual crops. Less than one-third of this increase (27.5%) was attributable to expansion of perennial crops (permanent crops), with the rest (72.5%) attributable to expansion of annual crops (arable land), based on regression of land data.</p>

Based on land data, the countries which added the greatest area of annual crops (absolute increase in arable cropland) over the period 1999–2008 were Nigeria, Sudan, Ethiopia, Brazil and Indonesia. These same five countries—in a different order—also experienced the greatest increases in cropland overall.

In several countries—including India, Australia, Colombia, Mexico and Thailand—the reported area of annual crops decreased. This could have been because of cropland degradation, or a genuine contraction of annual cropland because of conversion to other uses (including perennial crops) or increases in land-use efficiency. The magnitude of changes in the area of perennial crops in tropical countries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051759-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) was generally smaller than that of changes in area of annual crops.

          <p>Most land in tropical countries, with the exception of deserts and high mountains, is suitable for crop cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051759-g005">Figure 5</xref>). There are appreciable areas believed to have cultivation potential but with little or no cropland yet (mapped in dark blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051759-g006">Figure 6</xref>), particularly in the fringes of the Amazon basin, across the Congo basin, and in northern Australia. Many other parts of the tropics that are most suitable for rainfed crop production are already heavily utilised for cropland (dark purple in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051759-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Examples include large parts of Central America, the Caribbean, south-east Brazil, large parts of the African savannas, and much of south and south-east Asia, particularly the Sundaic lowlands. In a few places, crops are grown with the aid of irrigation on land with an otherwise unsuitable climate (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051759-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Cropland extent and expansion</title>
        <p>Our analyses provide an overview of patterns of crop cultivation and expansion in tropical countries. The crops that expanded most during the period were soybeans and maize, whether or not multiple cropping is taken into account. Overall, expansion of annual crops has been more rapid and more widespread than expansion of perennial crops, and has occurred across much of South America, Africa and tropical Asia. Expansion of perennial crops—of which, oil palm has expanded most—has taken place mostly in West Africa and tropical Asia. Our analyses identified the 12 most important crops in terms of area and rate of expansion in tropical countries. Other crops which are known to be important contributors to habitat loss in specific places did not make it onto this list. Examples include cotton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Baudron1">[67]</xref>, coffee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Rappole1">[68]</xref>, tea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Yang1">[69]</xref>, cocoa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Schroth1">[70]</xref>, rubber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Li1">[71]</xref>, coca <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Dvalos1">[49]</xref> and pulp and paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Carrere1">[72]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Some of the crops which have expanded most in area in recent years are already well known drivers of biodiversity loss. Soybean expansion is recognised as a major cause of biodiversity loss in the Brazilian <italic>Cerrado</italic> savannas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Fearnside1">[57]</xref>. Oil palm has been described as ‘the greatest immediate threat to biodiversity in Southeast Asia’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Wilcove1">[73]</xref>. Sugar cane has been implicated in the extinctions of species such as the Greater ‘Amakihi <italic>Hemignathus sagittirostris</italic> in Hawai'i and the Alagoas Curassow <italic>Mitu mitu</italic> (Extinct in the Wild) in Brazil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-BirdLife1">[74]</xref>. Expanding maize cultivation threatens the dry forests of Madagascar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Scales1">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Seddon1">[76]</xref>, and rice cultivation is an important cause of wetland loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Donald1">[10]</xref>. Others, such as sorghum, cow peas and millet have received much less attention in the conservation literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Balmford1">[77]</xref>, although the combined area converted to these three crops in 1999–2008 was more than twice that converted to oil palm.</p>
        <p>There are several possible reasons why some crops have received relatively little attention from conservationists. First, area is an incomplete proxy for impact. Coffee, for example, covers a relatively small area (8% of that occupied by rice in tropical countries), but tends to replace habitats of particularly high biodiversity value. Tropical drylands support unique species, but not concentrations of endemics on the scale of tropical forests, so hectare for hectare, dryland crops might have less of an impact on biodiversity than crops of wetter climates. Second, most of the less well-known crops are traditionally grown mainly by small-scale farmers rather than on an industrial scale by large corporations. As a consequence, there is less of a clear link to Western consumers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Balmford1">[77]</xref>. Campaigns targeting the commodity supply chains of large corporations supplying European and North American retailers have been a key factor in efforts to reduce environmental impacts of commodities such as palm oil, coffee and cocoa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Butler1">[78]</xref>. However, even crops traditionally seen as the preserve of subsistence farmers are increasingly grown in large-scale commercial monocultures: sorghum in parts of the Caribbean and Latin America, and cassava in Thailand and Brazil, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Clay1">[12]</xref>. Such crops are also increasingly used for biofuels and animal feed rather than to feed people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Clay1">[12]</xref>.</p>

        <title>The future of wild lands</title>
        <p>One other, very recent study has suggested that High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas might be disproportionately affected by prospective patterns of cropland expansion in coming decades, as estimated by the IMAGE model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Dobrovolski1">[61]</xref>. Our analysis, based more directly on maps of cultivation potential, provides further evidence that not only High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas but also Frontier Forests have the biophysical attributes that could predispose them to future conversion (indeed, all nine sets of priority areas for biodiversity conservation have considerable cultivation potential, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051759-g007">Figure 7</xref>). High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas and Frontier Forests have been considered to have “low vulnerability” because of low levels of past habitat loss, but are likely to come under threat as infrastructure develops and if political circumstances change. The Last of the Wild priority areas have much lower cultivation potential on average because they include large areas of desert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Sanderson1">[39]</xref>. Bearing in mind that our maps are probably inaccurate at a fine spatial scale, and that biophysical cultivation potential is just one of several determinants of vulnerability to agricultural conversion, the most extensive blocks of natural habitat in areas of high cultivation potential (dark blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051759-g006">Figure 6</xref>) are in central Africa, the fringes of the Amazon Basin, and northern Australia.</p>
        <sec id="s4b1">
          <title>Central Africa</title>
          <p>The extent of land with cultivation potential in the Congo Basin in central Africa is particularly alarming. Most global conservation prioritisation schemes judge this area to be at low risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Brooks1">[30]</xref> because of its high forest cover and low recent rates of deforestation: 0.2% to 0.4% per year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Duveiller1">[79]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-FAO6">[81]</xref>. However the factors that may help explain the low rates of past deforestation—such as low population densities, low road density, political instability and lack of inputs to utilise poor soils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Rudel1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Wolfire1">[83]</xref>—are changing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-United1">[84]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Sanchez1">[87]</xref>. As a result, the “last of the wild” in central Africa is increasingly fragmented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Sanderson1">[39]</xref>, and there is “not much time” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Bryant1">[38]</xref> to protect these forests from logging followed by conversion to cassava, oil palm, rice and sugar cane. There have been reports of large-scale land acquisitions for oil palm cultivation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, including one of 28,000 km<sup>2</sup> in 2007, but this appears to have been exaggerated and nothing has happened on the ground <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Karsenty1">[88]</xref>. Nevertheless, the Congolian forests will continue to come under threat from expanding croplands, a threat which could be reduced by a strategic approach to road development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Wilkie1">[89]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Wunder1">[90]</xref> and incentives for forest protection under a REDD+ mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Brown1">[91]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Amazon Basin</title>
          <p>The situation in the Amazon Basin is very different to that in central Africa. Recent deforestation has been more rapid and extensive, at least in Brazil, and thus has received far more attention from researchers and policy-makers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Hansen2">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Nepstad1">[92]</xref>. Almost half (46%) of the Brazilian Amazon has been formally protected within reserves, including indigenous reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-SoaresFilho1">[93]</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051759.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and the rate of deforestation has declined in recent years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Nepstad1">[92]</xref>. However, legal protection for forests on private land is in danger of being weakened by changes to Brazilian legislation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Martinelli1">[94]</xref>. Our analysis confirms that most of the interior of the Amazon Basin is of relatively low suitability for agriculture, albeit still with similar cultivation potential to large parts of India or West Africa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051759-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Land with higher cultivation potential is concentrated around the fringes of the Amazon Basin. In unprotected areas with cultivation potential, e.g., in the Guiana Shield, creating new protected areas and setting limits on road expansion could help to reduce the threat from crop expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Nepstad2">[95]</xref>.</p>

Agriculture in that area is dominated by cattle farming rather than crop production. However, minimal or no-tillage systems can enable integration of cropping and grazing, and with declining rainfall elsewhere on the continent, interest is again shifting to northern Australia.

        <title>Reactive or proactive conservation?</title>
        <p>Brooks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Brooks1">[30]</xref> classify priority areas for biodiversity conservation as being either “reactive” or “proactive”. Reactive areas are those with “high vulnerability”, and include Biodiversity Hotspots and Crisis Ecoregions. Proactive areas are those with “low vulnerability”, and include High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas, Frontier Forests and the Last of the Wild. As Brooks et al. acknowledge, the measures of vulnerability that were used to identify these areas relied mainly on past patterns of habitat loss, and made no effort to be predictive. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that we found no consistent relationship between “vulnerability” <italic>sensu</italic> Brooks et al., and cultivation potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051759-g007">Figure 7</xref>) which is one component of vulnerability to future conversion.</p>
        <p>What are the implications of this observation for conservation priorities? It means that much of the land which has not yet been converted to farmland has not been left alone because it is uncultivable, but because political or socio-economic factors have impeded, or at least not promoted, conversion so far. With global demand for land rising <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Deininger1">[97]</xref> areas that could previously safely be considered to have “low vulnerability” may come under increasing threat from agricultural expansion. In addition to working in areas of “high vulnerability”, conservation organisations might therefore be wise to increase their proactive conservation efforts while substantial opportunities for conservation in areas of “low vulnerability” still exist.</p>

        <title>Reliability of the maps and data used</title>
        <p>The conclusions discussed above hinge on the reliability of the data used, and in particular the reliability of the maps of cultivation potential for tropical crops. As discussed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>, there are good reasons to interpret these with caution. The discrepancy between our two estimates of cropland area in tropical countries is equivalent to the area of Italy, or to six years’ worth of cropland expansion. For the reasons discussed in Data Sources and Limitations, we think the larger figure of 6.7 million km<sup>2</sup> is likely to be closer to the truth, but this cannot be independently verified.</p>
        <p>In relation to the maps, the soil, terrain and climate datasets used to produce them are themselves coarse-grained and have not been comprehensively ground-truthed. Global datasets should not be taken to provide a detailed picture of conditions at finer scales. The maps do not take into account irrigation: where aquifers or rivers exist, this can transform land without sufficient rainfall for agriculture.</p>
        <p>The maps also cannot capture new developments in agricultural technology, which allow crops to be grown where previously they could not be. A striking example is the <italic>Cerrado</italic> of Brazil. Until recent decades this savanna area was considered “unfit for farming” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Brazilian1">[98]</xref>. However, this is the new agricultural frontier of Latin America, where the annual area deforested for agriculture (pasture and cropland) is now on a par with that in the Amazon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Lapola1">[99]</xref> and which is experiencing rapid expansion of cash crops such as soybeans and cotton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Klink1">[100]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Galford1">[101]</xref>. This is a clear example of how areas which are unsuitable today may become suitable in the future through developments in technology.</p>
        <p>A key research need is therefore to reduce the uncertainties in these maps and to develop credible, fine-grained maps of cultivation potential which can be used in strategic planning, both to ensure that crops are grown where they will be most productive, and so that threats to biodiversity from agriculture can be better understood and avoided. For some crops and countries fine-grained maps have been developed (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-NEMA1">[102]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Muok1">[103]</xref>), but as they typically have not been comprehensively ground-truthed (if at all) it is difficult to know whether they are any more reliable than global datasets.</p>
        <p>Beyond the need for better maps of cultivation potential, there is also a need for better models of future land-use change. On its own, cultivation potential is a relatively poor predictor of conversion risk. As our results here show, there are parts of the world with high cultivation potential that are not farmed, and other places with low cultivation potential which are. Other factors such as accessibility, socio-economic conditions, land tenure and government policies have as much, if not more, influence on where land conversion takes place. These drivers and policies differ greatly between countries and regions, and therefore the most promising way forward for anticipating future cropland expansion is assessments at a national or regional scale, informed by local conditions and policies (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Mertens1">[104]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Mller1">[105]</xref>).</p>

        <title>Implications for policy</title>
        <p>At the tenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, parties agreed on 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-UNEP1">[11]</xref>. These include commitments to halve, or where feasible halt, loss of natural habitats by 2020 (target 5), to ensure that areas under agriculture are managed sustainably (target 7), and to eliminate harmful pollution (target 8). The first of these can only be achieved by addressing the drivers of habitat loss, which in many parts of the world include crop expansion. To avoid compromising the first commitment, the remaining two will require yields to increase in parts of the world where productivity is currently low and where potential exists to do this without negative environmental impacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Tilman2">[106]</xref>. In all cases it will be difficult to reduce threats to biodiversity without strengthening public policy, such as national-level land use policies for stabilising the agricultural frontier around the last big blocks of wilderness through appropriate strategic land-use planning, infrastructure planning, better regulation of large international land acquisitions, and protected area designation.</p>
        <p>In addition to government-led policies and incentives, there is potential for voluntary certification and other market-based initiatives to help reduce the impact of agriculture. However, this potential has been realised to only a limited extent to date. For some of the major tropical crops, including oil palm, soybeans and sugar cane, commodity roundtables have been set up to decide and implement standards for environmentally and socially responsible production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Scarlat1">[107]</xref>. These initiatives typically involve representatives from throughout the commodity chain (lenders, growers, manufacturers and retailers) as well as from governments and civil society. There is increasing attention towards the complexities and challenges of tailoring such standards to cater for small-scale farmers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Gmez1">[108]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Lee1">[109]</xref>. However, these voluntary initiatives do not apply to all producers within a single country or commodity chain, and they do not have the power to implement land-use planning on the scale needed to prevent incursions of agriculture into large blocks of natural habitat, such as those in the Congo Basin. It is difficult to see how that could be achieved without government intervention, backed up by technical and financial support from wealthier governments for which tropical countries are an important source of imports and of climate-regulating ecosystem services.</p>
        <p>All of the targets mentioned will become easier to achieve if global consumption of agricultural products can be reduced or stabilised. In the developed world, there is considerable scope to eliminate over-consumption, promote diets which are less land-demanding and reduce post-consumer waste <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Parfitt1">[110]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Wirsenius1">[111]</xref>. Reforming incentives for bioenergy to support only those feedstocks not implicated in direct or indirect land-use change could help to reduce global demand for agricultural land <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Hellmann1">[112]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Havlk1">[113]</xref>. In the developing world, the most important issues include rising meat consumption by an emerging middle class, rapid population growth and post-harvest losses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Parfitt1">[110]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Wirsenius1">[111]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Bongaarts1">[114]</xref>. Some of these issues can only be addressed by national and international policy, while others can be addressed at a local level, for example by NGOs.</p>
        <p>Irrespective of such measures to limit over-consumption and wastage, strengthened efforts to protect wild lands from conversion will be essential if the threat of agricultural expansion to tropical biodiversity is to be reduced. Other studies have suggested that habitat conversion, once initiated in an area, is contagious and difficult to stop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Boakes1">[115]</xref>, and also that conservation in remote, less-developed parts of the world is often very cost-effective compared to conservation in more-developed areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051759-Balmford2">[116]</xref>. Increasing conservation efforts in Frontier Forests and High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas may thus merit greater attention from conservationists and policy-makers.</p>
