<abstract>
<p>Connexins (C×s) are a family of transmembrane proteins that form hemichannels and gap junctions (GJs) on the cell membranes, and transfer small signaling molecules between the cytoplasm and extracellular space and between connecting cells, respectively. Among C×s, suppressing C×43 expression or function promotes skin wound closure and granulation tissue formation, and may alleviate scarring, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Oral mucosal gingiva is characterized by faster wound closure and scarless wound healing outcome as compared to skin wounds. Therefore, we hypothesized that C×43 function is down regulated during human gingival wound healing, which in fibroblasts promotes expression of genes conducive for fast and scarless wound healing. Cultured gingival fibroblasts expressed C×43 as their major connexin. Immunostaining of unwounded human gingiva showed that C×43 was abundantly present in the epithelium, and in connective tissue formed large C×43 plaques in fibroblasts. At the early stages of wound healing, C×43 was strongly down regulated in wound epithelial cells and fibroblasts, returning to the level of normal tissue by day 60 post-wounding. Blocking of C×43 function by C×43 mimetic peptide Gap27 suppressed GJ-mediated dye transfer, promoted migration, and caused significant changes in the expression of wound healing-associated genes in gingival fibroblasts. In particular, out of 54 genes analyzed, several MMPs and TGF-β1, involved in regulation of inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, and VEGF-A, involved in angiogenesis, were significantly upregulated while pro-fibrotic ECM molecules, including Collagen type I, and cell contractility-related molecules were significantly down regulated. These responses involved MAPK, GSK3α/β and TGF-β signaling pathways, and AP1 and SP1 transcription factors. Thus, suppressed function of C×43 in fibroblasts promotes their migration, and regulates expression of wound healing-associated genes via AP1, SP1, MAPK, GSK3α/β and TGF-β signaling pathways, and may promote fast and scarless wound healing in human gingiva.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Connexins (C×s) are a family of transmembrane proteins that assemble to form connexons (hemichannels) or gap junctions (GJs). Each connexin protein is composed of four transmembrane-spanning domains, two extracellular loops, and the cytoplasmic domains including N-terminus, C-terminal domain and the cytoplasmic loop. Assembly of six connexin subunits generates one connexon or hemichannel, which functions in autocrine and paracrine signaling by providing a pathway for transfer of signaling molecules, including ATP, NAD<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and glutamate, between cells and extracellular environment. Two connexons from neighboring cells can also dock to form GJs, which provide conduits for direct exchange of small (&lt;1 kDa) signaling molecules between communicating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref003">3</xref>]. In addition to the channel functions, connexins participate in intracellular signaling cascades, and regulate gene expression and cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Connexins are expressed virtually by all cells in the body, and play crucial role during development and normal tissue function, and contribute to development of various pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref006">6</xref>]. In addition, they may play a role in skin wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref009">9</xref>]. In skin, expression and localization of connexins has been best described in epithelium of normal tissue and in epithelium of experimental wounds in various murine and human models. For instance, in normal skin in mice, epithelial cells at various layers, and cultured human skin keratinocytes, express several connexins, including C×26, C×30, C×30.3, C×31, C×31.1, C×37, C×40 and C×43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref013">13</xref>]. Likewise, based on immunostaining, human epidermis contains at least C×26, C×30 and C×43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref014">14</xref>]. Interestingly, wound healing induces rapid but transient changes in epithelial cell connexins. For instance, in mouse skin, C×26, C×30, C×31, C×31.1 and C×43 are strongly down regulated in the migrating wound epithelium, while C×26 and C×30 are upregulated at the wound margins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref013">13</xref>]. Until re-epithelialization is complete, expression of connexins is further spatiotemporally regulated at different epithelial layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref011">11</xref>]. Similar findings have also been reported for C×26, C×30 and C×43 in human skin wound epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref015">15</xref>]. During early stages of murine skin wound healing, decreased expression of C×26 and C×43 in hair follicles at the wound site, and upregulation of C×43 in blood vessels close to wound area has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref011">11</xref>], but very little is known about expression of connexins in wound fibroblasts.</p>
<p>In general, fibroblasts in normal skin express connexins, and appear connected to each other by GJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref019">19</xref>]. The major GJ protein in cultured murine skin fibroblasts is C×43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref020">20</xref>]. Similarly, cultured human skin fibroblasts express C×43 as their major connexin, but they also express lower levels of C×40 and C×45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref021">21</xref>]. Electron microscopy analysis has suggested that wound myofibroblast-like cells are connected to each other by GJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref022">22</xref>], but the identity of the connexins involved and their spatiotemporal regulation during wound healing is unclear.</p>
<p>Based on the above studies, C×43 appears a key connexin expressed by skin cells, and it is strongly down regulated in the wound epithelium at the early stages of wound healing. To study its role in more detail, different strategies to further suppress its function or expression in experimental murine skin wounds have been used. For instance, transient blocking of C×43 function at the early stage of wound healing by ACT1, a peptide that binds to the cytoplasmic carboxy-tail of C×43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref023">23</xref>], or transient suppressing its expression by topical C×43-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODN), promotes re-epithelialization and wound closure via increased keratinocyte migration and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref011">11</xref>]. Studies from conditional C×43 knockout mice have also shown an earlier onset of keratinocyte migration and increased proliferation, resulting in faster skin wound closure as compared to control mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition to the epithelial effects, transient treatment of murine skin wounds with ACT1, C×43 AS-ODN or siRNA suppresses inflammation, and promotes certain aspects of connective tissue healing. For instance, connective tissue cell proliferation, angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and earlier myofibroblast recruitment and wound contraction are stimulated, resulting to reduced wound connective tissue size at the early remodeling stage as compared to control wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref030">30</xref>]. Thus, down regulation of C×43 appears to accelerate wound granulation tissue formation and remodeling. Interestingly, transient down-regulation of C×43 expression by AS-ODN or modulation of its function by ACT1 at the very early stage of wound healing also improves the clinical appearance of the wounds and increases wound breaking strength in long term in mouse and pig models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref031">31</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether the above effects of early and transient C×43 inhibition in wounds are secondary to the reduced inflammation and/or due to altered C×43 function in fibroblasts. In any case, down regulation of C×43 by AS-ODN, or blocking of its function by ACT1, or by Gap26 and Gap27, two C×43 mimetic peptides that block its hemichannel and GJ functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref003">3</xref>], promotes fibroblast, and also keratinocyte, proliferation and migration <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref033">33</xref>]. Thus, connexin inhibition may also have direct wound healing promoting effects on these cells, but the mechanisms remain largely undefined.</p>
<p>Interestingly, wound healing in human and pig oral mucosal attached gingiva is faster and results in significantly reduced scar formation as compared to similar skin wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref037">37</xref>]. Therefore, gingival wound healing provides a model to study molecular and cellular pathways that regulate fast and scarless wound healing. Given that connexins play a role in wound healing, it is possible that they have a key role determining the wound healing outcome also in human gingiva. Previously, connexins have been localized in oral mucosal wounds in a mouse buccal (cheek) mucosal wound model. In the unwounded buccal mucosal epithelium, a non-keratinized epithelium distinct from keratinized gingival epithelium, keratinocytes expressed C×26, C×40 and C×43, and their levels were significantly elevated as compared to epidermis in the same animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref038">38</xref>]. Similar to skin wounds, these connexins were down regulated in migrating keratinocytes in the mucosal wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref038">38</xref>]. Connexin expression has also been studied in normal human gingival epithelium, where keratinocytes express C×26 and C×43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref041">41</xref>]. However, nothing is known about connexin expression and function in gingival connective tissue cells and during gingival wound healing. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to characterize in detail the localization and function of C×43, a key connexin associated with skin wound healing, in the fast and scarless human gingival wound healing. We hypothesized that C×43 function is down regulated during human gingival wound healing, which in fibroblasts promotes expression of genes conducive for fast and scarless wound healing.</p>

<sec id="sec002a">
<title>Tissue Samples</title>
<p>Tissue sections from experimental wounds created in palatal attached gingival mucosa in three healthy males (mean age 38 years) that have been previously extensively characterized were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref046">46</xref>]. Briefly, identical, standardized, full-thickness excisional wounds (about 12 mm long, 2 mm wide and at least 10 mm away from each other) were prepared under local anesthesia in the palatal mucosa in an area between the canine and the third molar using a double-bladed scalpel. The tissue obtained from the initial wounds served as the control samples (day 0 sample). After the surgery, subjects were instructed to use standard dosages of acetaminophen or ibuprofen for postoperative pain control. Wound biopsies were collected at days 3, 7, 14, 28, and 60 after wounding. Immediately after collection, the samples were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound (Sakura Finetek Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue sections (6 μm) were cut using a 2800 Frigocut Cryostat Microtome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany), placed on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slides and stored at −86°C until use. For the study, minimum of three tissue/mid-wound sections from two to three subjects at each time point were used.</p>

<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>Four gingival fibroblast lines (GFBLs) were isolated from clinically healthy attached gingiva from healthy human donors, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref047">47</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s010">S1 Table</xref>). Cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), supplemented with 1% antibiotic/antimycotic and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were routinely seeded for experiments when they reached about 95% confluence. Experiments were performed at passages 5 to 10.</p>

<title>Blocking of C×43 Function by Mimetic Peptides or MFA</title>
<p>To block the C×43 function, GFBLs were seeded on 6-well plates (42,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) in their normal growth medium. At day 2 when cultures became confluent, culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium. At day 3, cells were treated with 150 μM of Gap27 (SRPTEKTIFII; Biomatik, Cambridge, ON, Canada) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref049">49</xref>], equal molar amount of Gap26 (VCYDKSFPISHVR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref050">50</xref>], or corresponding scrambled Gap27 (TFEPDRISITK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref033">33</xref>] or Gap26 (YSIVCKPHVFDRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref050">50</xref>] control peptides, respectively, for up to 24 h before total RNA isolation or collection of cell lysates/conditioned medium for Western blotting. In a set of experiments, cells were treated with increasing concentrations (25, 50, 75, 100 μM) of meclofenamic acid (MFA; M4531, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), a pharmacological connexin inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref051">51</xref>], or corresponding amount of MFA diluent (dH<sub>2</sub>O) for 24 h before RNA isolation.</p>

<title>Blocking C×43 Expression by siRNA Technique</title>
<p>To block the expression of C×43, GFBLs were seeded in 6-well plates as described above. After 24 h, siRNA transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). To this end, 22 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMax and 150 picomoles of C×43 siRNAs (siRNA-1; UUUUGCAAGUGUAAACAGC or siRNA-2; AAUGAAAAGUACUGACAGC; Invitrogen) or control siRNAs (control siRNA-1 ACUUCGACACAUCGACUGC or control siRNA-2 ATCGCAAATCCGGACCTAT; Invitrogen) were mixed with 2.4 ml of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen), and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The mixtures of transfection reagent and individual siRNAs were combined and incubated at room temperature for 20 min for complex formation. Then the reagent was diluted with Opti-MEM to yield final siRNA concentration of 30 nM, and added to the cells. After 5 h in cell culture incubator, the transfection reagent was removed, and cells fed with their normal growth medium overnight. Medium was then replaced with serum-free growth medium, and RNA isolation and sample collection for Western blotting was performed after 48 h.</p>

<title>Real-Time PCR</title>
<p>Real-time PCR analysis was performed according to MIQE guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref052">52</xref>] as we have described in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref053">53</xref>]. Briefly, total RNA from cultured GFBLs was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA II kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Macherey-Nagel). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and random oligodeoxynucleotide primers according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as described previously. The primers used for real-time PCR are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s011">S2 Table</xref>. Real-time PCR amplification was performed on the CF×96 System (Bio-Rad) using the following program: 1 cycle at 94°C for 3 min 35 cycles at 94°C for 10 s, 60°C for 20 s, and reaction completion with reading plate and a melt curve analysis from 65°C to 95°C, 5 s for each 0.5°C. Amplification reactions were conducted for target genes with ubiquitin C (UBC), glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase I (Hprt1), TATAA-box binding protein (TBP), and Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) as reference genes. For a given experiment, at least two reference genes were chosen using the integrative RefFinder tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leonxie.com/referencegene.php" xlink:type="simple">http://www.leonxie.com/referencegene.php</ext-link>). Non-transcribed RNA samples were used as a negative control. The PCR reactions were performed in triplicate for each sample. The data was analyzed and is presented based on the comparative Ct method (CFX Manager Software Version 2.1, Bio-Rad).</p>

<title>Preparation of Cell Lysates/Conditioned Medium Samples for Western Blotting</title>
<p>Confluent GFBL cultures were treated as described above. The conditioned medium was then collected and immediately treated with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany). The samples were concentrated (30–40 times) by centrifugation (5,000g) using Centrifugal Filter Units (Amicon Ultra-4 3K, 3000 MWCO; Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) for 3 h, and stored at −80°C until use. To collect cell lysates, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed with a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.6), 100 mM Octyl β̃D-glucopyranoside, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics), dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O.

Equal amount of protein of each sample was solubilized in SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (5%) and separated by 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL membrane, GE Healthcare Bioscience, Buckinghamshire, UK). The nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the membranes in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences; Lincoln, NE, USA) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with the primary antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s012">S3 Table</xref>) at 4°C overnight. After washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T), the membranes were incubated with an appropriate IRdye-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000; LI-COR Biosciences). Dried membranes were then detected using the LI-COR Odyssey infrared reader (LI-COR Bioscience, Nebraska, USA). Intensity of the protein bands was quantitated using ImageJ software (NIH).</p>
<p>The activation of signaling pathways by Gap27 treatment was studied in cell lysates obtained as described above. For the experiments, GFBLs were seeded on 6-well plates, treated with Gap27 (150 μM) or equal amount of control peptide for 1, 2, 6, and 24 h, and cell lysates collected, as above. Western blotting was performed with antibodies against total or phosphorylated forms of β-Catenin and GSK3α/β (β-Catenin pathway), SMAD3 (TGF-β pathway), ERK1/2 and p38 (MAPK pathway) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s012">S3 Table</xref>). β-Tubulin was used as a loading control.</p>
<p>To identify latent and active MMPs, a set of cell/conditioned medium samples was treated with or without p-aminophenylmercury acetate (APMA; 1.0 mM, pH = 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 4 h to activate latent enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref054">54</xref>] prior to gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (data not shown).</p>

Experiments were performed in triplicate per treatment group, and images were captured from three to four different areas of the wound on each coverslip. Wound closure rate was determined measuring the area of the open wound at each time point relative to the area of the wound at the time of wounding using the Adobe Photoshop for Mac software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.adobe.com" xlink:type="simple">https://www.adobe.com</ext-link>).</p>

<title>C×43 Is the Major Connexin Expressed by Gingival Fibroblasts</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that C×43 is present in human skin, periodontal ligament and gingival fibroblasts, but that skin and periodontal ligament fibroblasts also express C×32, C×40 and C×45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref057">57</xref>]. Therefore, we assessed the expression of C×32, C×40, C×43 and C×45 in four parallel human gingival fibroblast (GFBL) lines from different donors in confluent monolayer cultures that allowed abundant cell-cell contacts to form. Real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) analysis showed that GFBLs expressed C×43 as their major connexin protein, with moderate levels of C×45, very low levels of C×32, and no expression of C×40. Immunolocalization of C×43 and C×45 showed a punctate staining, likely representing connexin plaques. Some of these connexin plaques localized to long cellular processes contacting nearby cells likely representing GJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). In addition, they localized to areas with no apparent cell-cell contacts, possibly representing intracellular and/or cell surface non-junctional hemichannel plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

<title>C×43 Is Strongly Down Regulated in Gingival Epithelium and Fibroblasts During Wound Healing</title>
<p>In order to assess expression of C×43 during gingival wound healing, we compared localization of C×43 in unwounded human gingiva, and in experimental excisional gingival wounds 3, 7, 14, 28 and 60 days after wounding by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>). Fibroblasts were identified based on their elongated, spindle-shaped morphology, and positive immunostaining for vimentin, a mesenchymal cell marker highly expressed in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref058">58</xref>]. C×43 was present in unwounded gingival epithelium where it showed strong, punctate staining in the cell-cell contacts at the spinous layer. In addition, a weaker and sparse staining was noted between some basal and granular layer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>). A punctate, positive staining for C×43, likely representing C×43 plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref023">23</xref>], was also noted throughout connective tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>), where it associated with vimentin-positive fibroblast-like cells. Many of the C×43-positive plaques were fairly large in size (&gt;1 μm in diameter), and some localized to long processes extending from these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). At day 3 after wounding, abundance of C×43 was strongly reduced in the migrating wound epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>), and in the fibroblasts residing at the wound edge and migrating into the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g002">Fig. 2C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>). At day 7 when wound epithelium had completely covered the wound, and granulation tissue formation was underway, C×43 was abundantly present in 2–3 most basal cell layers of the wound epithelium, while the spinous layer showed some weak positive staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>). In general, in the connective tissue cells at the wound edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g002">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>), and in the wound granulation tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g002">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>), only very few C×43-positive plaques were noted. At day 14, C×43 was still most abundant in 2–3 most basal wound epithelial cell layers, but its staining was now increased also in more suprabasal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>). Our previous analysis of these same wounds has shown that at this stage, the granulation tissue had started contraction, contained abundantly α-SMA-positive fibroblasts, and was being remodeled to wound connective tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref045">45</xref>]. At this stage, vimentin-stained fibroblast-like cells at the wound edge showed some C×43-positive plaques (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>). In general, the highly cellular wound connective tissue showed only very few such structures in vimentin-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g002">Fig. 2G and H</xref>), or in M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s002">S2 Fig.</xref>), also abundantly present in these same wounds at this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref037">37</xref>], or in α-SMA-positive myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s003">S3 Fig.</xref>). At day 28, while the typical gingival epithelial long rete pegs were not yet formed, abundance and localization of C×43 in the epithelium at the wound site was almost similar to normal unwounded tissue, being weakly present in the basal cells, and most strongly stained in the spinous layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>). At this stage, wound contraction was still underway, but cellularity and the number of myofibroblasts and M2 macrophages had dramatically decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref045">45</xref>]. Vimentin-stained fibroblast-like cells at the wound edge and within the newly formed wound connective tissue displayed increased number of C×43-positive plaques as compared with earlier time points, but the number and size of the plaques was clearly reduced as compared to unwounded tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g002">Fig. 2I and J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>).

At day 60 when the epithelium had reformed long rete pegs and connective tissue structure was normalized, the localization and abundance of C×43 was similar to unwounded tissue both at the epithelium and connective tissue at the wound site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g002">Fig. 2K and L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>).</p>

<title>Blocking of C×43 Function Regulates Significantly Expression of a Distinct Set of Wound Healing-Associated Genes in Gingival Fibroblasts</title>
<p>Having established that C×43 is the major connexin expressed by GFBLs, and that abundance of C×43 plaques is strongly reduced during gingival wound healing, we wanted to find out the functional significance of this down regulation. Down regulation of the number of C×43-positive plaques in wound fibroblasts can result in reduced hemichannel and GJ function. Treatment of cells with C×43 mimetic peptides can be used to specifically block these channel functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref059">59</xref>], which promotes connective tissue wound healing <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref060">60</xref>]. Therefore, we treated GFBLs with Gap27, a mimetic peptide corresponding to the 11-amino acid sequence in the second C×43 extracellular loop, that blocks C×43 channel functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref061">61</xref>]. Treatment with Gap27 (150 μM) did not markedly affect cell morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s004">S4 Fig.</xref>). However, it reduced GJ- mediated dye transfer, similar to meclofenamic acid (MFA), a pharmacological connexin inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref051">51</xref>], also in this model as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Gap27 treatment also significantly promoted GFBL migration in the scratch wound healing model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s005">S5 Fig.</xref>), as previously described for skin fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref002">2</xref>]. Thus, reduced C×43 abundance/function may promote fibroblast recruitment at the early stages of human gingival wound healing. In addition to being absent from migrating fibroblasts in early wounds, C×43 abundance was also strongly suppressed in fibroblasts abundantly present inside gingival granulation and wound connective tissue at day 7–28 post-wounding. This coincides with resolution of inflammation, angiogenesis, ECM deposition, myofibroblast differentiation, contraction and remodeling stages of wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref037">37</xref>]. Therefore, we next assessed the effect of suppressing C×43 function by Gap27 in confluent cell cultures on expression of genes important specifically for these stages of wound healing. Real-time PCR results showed that Gap27 treatment significantly upregulated expression of 15, and down regulated 7, of the 54 genes analyzed (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t004">4</xref>). The selected genes encoded proteases (MMPs and their inhibitors), important in regulation of inflammation, angiogenesis and ECM remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref063">63</xref>], molecules involved in intracellular ECM degradation (Endo180 and Cathepsin K) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t001">Table 1</xref>), ECM proteins (fibrillar and matricellular proteins, and small leucine-rich proteoglycans), cell contractility and myofibroblast-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t002">Table 2</xref>), TGF-β signaling associated molecules and cytokines involved in inflammation, angiogenesis and re-epithelialization (CXCL12, FGF-2, VEGF-A, IL1β, IL10 and TNF-α) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref037">37</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t003">Table 3</xref>), and cell-cell junction proteins (connexins and cadherins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref064">64</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t004">Table 4</xref>). To rule out significant but potentially biologically irrelevant minor changes, we used minimum of +/− 1.5-fold change threshold for the significantly regulated genes. This yielded 17 significantly regulated genes of which 11 were upregulated (MMP-1, -3, -10 and -14, TIMP-1 and -3, Tenascin-C, TGF-β1, VEGF-A, C×43 and Cadherin-2), and 6 down regulated (Collagen type I, Decorin, Fibromodulin, α-SMA, NMMIIB and CXCL12) (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t004">4</xref>).

<title>Effect of Gap27-mediated blocking of C×43 function on gene expression in parallel gingival fibroblast lines.</title>
<p>Confluent cultures of gingival fibroblasts from three different individuals (GFBL-HN, GFBL-CM and GFBL-DC) were treated with Gap27 or control peptide (150 μM) for 24 h, and expression of a set of genes involved in wound healing was analyzed by real-time PCR.

<p>To confirm specificity of the Gap27 treatment, we also blocked C×43 function by Gap26, another connexin mimetic peptide corresponding to a 13 amino acid sequence in the first C×43 extracellular loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref061">61</xref>], and by MFA, and assessed expression of a set of genes as above. Gap27 and Gap26 treatments caused in general similar gene expression changes in GFBLs, although the magnitude of change slightly varied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s006">S6 Fig.</xref>). MFA treatment induced a concentration-dependent increase in MMP-1 and -10, Tenascin-C and VEGF-A expression, and down regulated CXCL12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s007">S7 Fig.</xref>), similar to Gap27 (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t003">3</xref>) and Gap26 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s006">S6 Fig.</xref>). Interestingly, Gap27 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t004">Table 4</xref>), Gap26 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s006">S6 Fig.</xref>) and MFA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s007">S7 Fig.</xref>) induced up to about 2-fold increase in expression of C×43 mRNA. Likewise, Gap27 and Gap26 caused about 2-fold increase in C×43 protein level, while MFA had no effect (data not shown).</p>
<p>In a set of experiments, we also suppressed C×43 expression in three parallel GFBL lines using two different C×43 siRNAs (C×43 siRNA-1 and -2), and studied the expression of the above wound healing-associated genes. Treatment of GFBLs with both C×43 siRNAs consistently resulted in about 80% down regulation of C×43 at both mRNA and protein levels, while expression of the two other connexins expressed by these cells, C×32 and C×45, were not affected (data not shown). C×43 siRNA treatment with both C×43 siRNA-1 and -2 effectively suppressed GJ-mediated dye transfer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s008">S8 Fig.</xref>), but did not have a significant effect on fibroblast migration in the scrape-wound assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s005">S5 Fig.</xref>). Similar to Gap27 treated cells, C×43 siRNA treatments significantly increased expression of Tenascin-C (1.46 +/− 0.15-fold change; p&lt;0.05) and reduced expression of Collagen type I (0.89 +/− 0.03-fold change; p&lt;0.001) as compared to control treatment. However, possibly due to incomplete C×43 down regulation, the gene expression responses to C×43 siRNA treatment were small with none of the studied genes reaching the +/− 1.5-fold change threshold (data not shown).</p>

<title>Characterization of Proteins Regulated by Gap27 Treatment in Gingival Fibroblasts</title>
<p>As gene expression analysis showed that blocking of C×43 function by Gap27 strongly regulated expression of several genes (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t004">4</xref>), we further assessed the protein levels of a set of genes that showed significant, minimum of +/− 1.5-fold change relative to control treatment in the real-time PCR analysis. Western blotting analysis showed that treatment of GFBLs with Gap27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g005">Fig. 5</xref>) resulted in markedly increased secretion of active and/or total MMP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g005">Fig. 5A and B</xref>) and −10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g005">Fig. 5H and J</xref>) compared to control treatments. In addition, Gap27-treated cells produced significantly elevated levels of pro-MMP-3 in the cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g005">Fig. 5F and G</xref>).

Accordingly, Western blotting showed robust down regulation of Decorin and upregulation of VEGF-A levels in the cell culture medium of Gap27-treated GFBL cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Gap27 treatment also significantly increased C×43 expression at mRNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t004">Table 4</xref>) and total protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g007">Fig. 7</xref>).

<title>Blocking of C×43 Function by Gap27 Modulates Key Signaling Pathways in Gingival Fibroblasts</title>
<p>Having established that during gingival wound healing, C×43 abundance and/or GJ and hemichannel functions maybe strongly reduced, and that suppressing C×43 function in cultured fibroblasts distinctly regulates expression of a set of wound healing-associated genes, we wanted to find out which intracellular signaling pathways are involved. To this end, we treated GFBLs with Gap27 and assessed phosphorylation changes in TGF-β (SMAD3), MAPK (ERK1/2 and p38), GSK3α/β and β-Catenin pathways that have been previously associated with C×43-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref073">73</xref>], and wound healing and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref074">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref078">78</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Gap27 induced robust phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 already after 1 h after treatment. These responses lasted at least for 6 h, before returning to the levels of untreated cells by 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g008">Fig. 8C–F</xref>). Gap27 treatment also markedly increased GSK3α/β phosphorylation at 1–6 h, returning to the normal level by 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g008">Fig. 8G and H</xref>), while phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated β-Catenin levels, downstream targets of GSK3α/β, did not show marked changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g008">Fig. 8I and J</xref>). Gap27 treatment did not noticeably affect SMAD3 phosphorylation until 24 h, when the steady-state p-SMAD3 levels were markedly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115524.g008">Fig. 8A and B</xref>). Thus, in gingival fibroblasts, blocking of C×43 by Gap27 treatment induced fast activation of MAPK and GSK3α/β signaling pathways, while TGF-β pathway was activated via a slower, possibly indirect, mechanism.</p>

<title>Distinct Involvement of Gap27-Regulated Signaling Pathways in Modulation of Wound Healing-Associated Genes in Gingival Fibroblasts</title>
<p>In order to further assess the role of the above pathways in Gap27-induced gene expression changes, we blocked TGF-β signaling by SB431542, MEK1/2 by PD184352, p38 by SB203580, and GSK3α/β by SB415286 in Gap27-treated cells, and assessed gene expression changes relative to untreated cells by real-time PCR. In addition, we assessed involvement of AP1 and SP1, transcription factors previously linked to C×43 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref080">80</xref>], by treating cells with curcumin and WP631, respectively. We specifically focused on assessing expression of the genes that were significantly modulated (with a minimum by +/− 1.5-fold change threshold) by Gap27 in the above experiments. Results showed that MEK1/2 signaling was most widely involved in Gap27-induced change in gene expression, as its inhibition totally blocked Gap27-induced expression change of 10 genes. These genes included proteases and their inhibitors (MMP-1, -3 and -10, TIMP-1 and -3), ECM molecules (Collagen type I and Tenascin-C), cell contractility-associated genes (α-SMA and NMMIIB), and Cadherin-2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0115524.t005">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s009">S9 Fig.</xref>). In addition, this pathway partially regulated (inhibited Gap27-induced expression change by at least 50%) expression of growth factors (TGF-β1 and VEGF-A) and C×43. The only genes that were not affected by blocking of MEK1/2 were MMP-14, two leucine-rich proteoglycans (Decorin and Fibromodulin), and CXCL12. The other examined pathways also totally or partially regulated Gap27-modulated expression of several genes. For instance, inhibition of GSK3α/β resulted to total inhibition of Gap27-induced upregulation of TIMP-1 and -3 expression, while it partially blocked MMP-1 and TGF-β1 upregulation. Findings also showed variable and complex interplay between the studied pathways in regulation of Gap27-induced gene expression. For instance, Gap27-induced MMP-10 upregulation and Collagen type I down regulation was only blocked by the MEK1/2 inhibitor. In contrast, Gap27-induced TIMP-1 expression was totally blocked by SP1, TGF-β, MEK1/2 and GSK3α/β inhibitors, and partially by p38 inhibitor. On the other hand, Gap27-induced Tenascin-C expression was totally inhibited by AP1 and MEK1/2 inhibitors, and partially by SP1, TGF-β and p38 inhibitors. Transcription factors AP1 or SP1 were distinctly involved in regulating 7 of the Gap27-modulated genes. Interestingly, inhibition of SP1 totally blocked Gap27 induced upregulation of C×43 expression, while blocking of AP1, p38 and MEK1/2 had a partial effect. Gap27-induced upregulation of VEGF-A and down regulation of CXCL12 were only partially blocked by MEK1/2 and SP1 inhibitors, respectively, suggesting that also other unidentified pathways are involved. In addition to the above effects, interestingly, blocking of GSK3α/β strongly potentiated Gap27-induced upregulation of MMP-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s009">S9 Fig.</xref>) and Tenascin-C expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s009">S9 Fig.</xref>). Moreover, Gap27 treatment with simultaneous inhibition of MEK1/2 resulted to strongly induced α-SMA expression (by more than 7-fold), while treatment with Gap27 alone reduced its expression by about 50% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115524.s009">S9 Fig.</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gingival fibroblasts that participate in scarless oral wound healing expressed C×43 as the major connexin, which is similar to skin fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref021">21</xref>]. In oral wounds, C×43 expression was strongly down regulated in gingival wound epithelium during epithelial migration stage. This is in agreement with studies assessing C×43 localization in the epithelium of murine skin and buccal mucosal, and in human skin wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref038">38</xref>]. Thus far, very little was known about C×43 expression and localization in connective tissue cells during wound healing. Interestingly, in gingival fibroblasts, which were identified based on morphological criteria and positive immunostaining for the mesenchymal cell marker vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref058">58</xref>], strong C×43 immunoreactivity localized to large plaque-like structures in unwounded tissue. In order to form functional GJs, connexins cluster on the cell membrane to form plaques. Cell culture findings suggest that connexins are first transported to the cell membrane as hemichannels where they then join GJ plaques directly or by moving laterally towards them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref081">81</xref>]. The size of the plaques can reach few micrometers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref081">81</xref>], and can be therefore detected by immunostaining. In contrast, individual connexins or hemichannels are undetectable by this method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref082">82</xref>]. Atomic force microscopy of cardiac GJs has also suggested existence of large (up to 2 μm<sup>2</sup>) hemichannel plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref083">83</xref>]. Connexins can also be present intracellularly during synthesis and transport to the cell membrane, and when being endocytosed or assembled to the mitochondrial membrane. However, these intracellular connexins have not been reported to organize into large plaque-like structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref005">5</xref>]. Thus, the C×43-positive structures observed in gingival fibroblasts <italic>in vivo</italic> likely represent C×43 hemichannel and/or GJ plaques on the cell membrane.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the C×43-positive plaques found in fibroblasts in unwounded tissue were missing from fibroblasts at the wound edge and those migrating into the wound at days 3 and 7 post-wounding. This could be explained by reduced recruitment of C×43 to hemichannel and GJ plaques, or their redistribution, resulting to smaller plaques undetectable by immunostaining, or from down regulation of C×43 expression and/or its increased turnover. The factors that modulate these processes during wound healing <italic>in vivo</italic> are not clear, but are likely cell type-specific and could include effects of wound healing-related cytokines, growth factors and mechanosignaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref084">84</xref>]. In any case, similar to cultured skin fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref002">2</xref>], blocking of C×43 function by Gap27 promoted gingival fibroblast migration, suggesting that C×43 may regulate fibroblast recruitment into the wound provisional matrix. Interestingly, C×43 was also still largely absent from the vimentin-positive cell population established in the wound at day 14 and 28 post-wounding. These cells could include fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and macrophages that all express vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref085">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref086">86</xref>]. Reparative M2 macrophages are abundant and the predominant macrophages in these same gingival wounds at day 14 and 28 post-wounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref037">37</xref>]. However, our double immunostaining showed that very few C×43 plaques were detected in M2 macrophages at this stage. Previous studies have not explored C×43 in wound macrophages. However, contrary to our findings, M2 macrophages in thyroid tumor stroma show abundant C×43-positive plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref087">87</xref>]. Our previous analysis has also shown that the number of α-SMA-rich myofibroblasts is strongly increased, and wound contraction is underway, already at day 14 in these same wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref045">45</xref>]. However, only few C×43-positive plaques were noted in areas where myofibroblasts were abundant at this stage. Therefore, it is possible that in human gingival wounds absence of C×43 plaques promotes myofibroblast differentiation and wound contraction. In support of this, suppressing C×43 expression or function in murine models of wound healing results to earlier recruitment and disappearance of myofibroblasts from the wounds, and reduced wound connective tissue size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref020">20</xref>], suggesting that in these wounds myofibroblast differentiation and contraction occurred earlier and/or was accelerated. Curiously though, in cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts, C×43 positively regulates α-SMA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref088">88</xref>], and in mouse fibroblasts, C×43 deficiency associates with a reduced ability of the cells to contract a collagen gel, a model for wound contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref089">89</xref>]. In addition, our findings showed that blocking of C×43 function by Gap27 significantly reduced expression of α-SMA and non-muscle myosin IIB (NMMIIB), another cytoskeletal protein involved in tissue contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref090">90</xref>]. Thus, role of C×43 function in α-SMA expression, myofibroblast differentiation and contraction appears cell- and context-dependent, and requires further investigation. Nevertheless, it is possible that the early reduction of C×43 plaques, and their slow reformation in gingival fibroblasts at the late stages of wound healing has functional significance for the scarless gingival wound-healing outcome. In particular, reduced abundance of C×43 plaques at days 14 and 28 post-wounding in wound fibroblasts coincides not only with myofibroblast differentiation and contraction, but also with resolution of inflammation, angiogenesis, ECM deposition and remodeling stages of wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref046">46</xref>], suggesting a role for C×43 in modulating also these events.</p>
<p>To study the significance of reduced C×43 function for these later stages of wound healing, we blocked its function in human gingival fibroblasts by C×43 mimetic peptide Gap27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref003">3</xref>]. Our findings showed that Gap27 reduced GJ-mediated dye transfer as expected, confirming its inhibitory effect also in human gingival fibroblasts. Furthermore, Gap27 treatment significantly regulated a number of genes that maybe beneficial for scarless gingival wound healing. These effects were not limited to Gap27, as similar results were also obtained by using Gap26, another C×43 mimetic peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref003">3</xref>]. It is interesting that the mimetic peptides significantly upregulated several genes. This suggests that for those genes that were upregulated by the treatment, normal C×43 function is inhibitory, <italic>i.e.</italic> it is needed to suppress expression of these genes. Therefore, during gingival wound healing reduced expression/function of C×43 in fibroblasts may allow increased expression of these molecules. This group of molecules includes several MMPs, TIMP-1 and -3, Tenascin-C, TGF-β1 and VEGF-A, which are important modulators of inflammation, cell migration, angiogenesis and ECM deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref091">91</xref>], and may contribute to reduced inflammation and efficient angiogenesis found in gingival wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref037">37</xref>]. Of note, Tenascin-C accumulation is strongly induced in early granulation tissue of human gingival wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref042">42</xref>], suggesting that down regulation of C×43 expression or function may drive this process <italic>in vivo</italic>. The hallmark of scar formation and fibrosis is increased accumulation of ECM and increased cell contractility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref092">92</xref>]. Therefore, it is also interesting to note that blocking of C×43 function in gingival fibroblasts caused a robust down regulation of several ECM (Collagen type I, Decorin and Fibromodulin) and cell contractility-associated genes (α-SMA and NMMIIB). Interestingly similar to our findings, comparable treatment of human skin fibroblasts with Gap27 was also recently shown to significantly increase expression of MMP-1 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref033">33</xref>], while unlike in gingival fibroblasts, Collagen type I and CTGF, two genes strongly associated with scar formation and fibrosis <italic>in viv</italic>o [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref092">92</xref>], were significantly upregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref033">33</xref>]. There is increasing evidence that human skin and gingival fibroblasts are phenotypically distinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref093">93</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that different function of C×43 in skin and gingival fibroblasts may in part contribute to the different wound healing outcomes in these two tissues, but this needs further experimental verification.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of the mimetic peptide-induced gene expression change in gingival fibroblasts may include blocking of transfer of signaling molecules via hemichannels and/or GJs, peptide-induced changes in C×43 levels, conformation and/or phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic tail that interacts with the signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref094">94</xref>]. The latter channel-independent effects maybe mediated via C×43 cytoplasmic tail that recruits and interacts with intracellular signaling effectors, including MAPK (ERK1/2 and p38), GSK3/β-Catenin and PI3K-Akt-GSK3 pathway mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref073">73</xref>] also involved in wound healing and scar formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref075">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref076">76</xref>]. In addition, C×43 competes with SMAD2/3 for binding to tubulin releasing SMAD2/3 from the microtubules and promoting TGF-β signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref068">68</xref>]. Our findings showed that MFA, a pharmacological connexin channel inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref051">51</xref>], also blocked GJ-mediated dye transfer in gingival fibroblasts, and induced similar changes in the expression of a set of genes as the C×43 mimetic peptides, suggesting that the noted Gap27-induced gene expression changes depended on the channel functions of C×43. However, Gap27 also caused a robust activation of the above C×43 cytoplasmic tail-mediated signaling pathways. Thus, regulation of both channel-dependent and -independent functions maybe involved in Gap27-regulated gene expression in gingival fibroblasts.</p>
<p>In order to study the role of the above signaling pathways in regulation of Gap27-induced fibroblast gene expression in more detail, we used pathway-specific pharmacological inhibitors. In addition, we blocked two transcriptional regulators (AP1 and SP1) that associate with C×43 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref080">80</xref>]. Blocking of these pathways distinctly, and co-operatively regulated Gap27-modulated gene expression, and most notably, as Gap27 caused a robust early activation (phosphorylation) of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs, pharmacological blocking of these pathways totally or partially blocked Gap27-modulated expression of 14 out of the 17 genes analyzed. Inhibition of MEK1/2 alone, an upstream regulator of ERK1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref095">95</xref>], totally blocked Gap27-induced change of 10 genes. These included MMP-10 and Collagen type I that were not affected by the other pathways studied. Thus, MEK-ERK1/2 pathway is a major target of Gap27-induced signaling in gingival fibroblasts. Whether this depends on the reported ability of MAPKs to regulate C×43 channel functions and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref072">72</xref>] remains to be shown.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, C×43 can also promote TGF-β-induced signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref068">68</xref>]. Interestingly, Gap27 treatment did not affect phosphorylation of SMAD3 during the first 6 h after treatment. However, an increased level of p-SMAD3 was noted after 24 h. Therefore, Gap27 induces activation of TGF-β pathway in gingival fibroblasts, but this may occur via a distinct, indirect mechanism. The inhibitory effect of Gap27 is time dependent, as it blocks hemichannels within minutes to few hours, while GJ inhibition may require up to 24 hours to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref003">3</xref>]. Thus, the late activation of SMAD3 after Gap27 treatment may also depend on its distinct effects on GJs rather than hemichannels. In any case, pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β signaling totally or partially suppressed Gap27-induced change in expression of 9 of the studied genes, indicating that this C×43-mediated pathway has a role in modulating cell functions relevant to wound healing.</p>
<p>Treatment of gingival fibroblasts with Gap27 also induced fast phosphorylation of GSK3α/β, but this did not associate with marked changes in the phosphorylation or levels of its downstream target β-Catenin. Phosphorylation of GSK3α/β renders it inactive removing its inhibitory effect on its targets, which include more than 40 proteins and transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref096">96</xref>]. Therefore, C×43-mediated phosphorylation of GSK3α/β likely affects other downstream targets than the β-Catenin pathway. Involvement of this pathway is supported by the finding that pharmacological blocking of phosphorylation of GSK3α/β totally blocked TIMP-1 and -3, and partially MMP-1 and TGF-β1 upregulation induced by Gap27 treatment. Furthermore, blocking of GSK3α/β potentiated Gap27-induced expression of MMP-3 and Tenascin-C. Thus, in gingival fibroblasts GSK3α/β controls C×43 regulated expression of molecules involved in proteolytic processing of the wound ECM, cytokines and growth factors (MMP-1, TIMP-1 and -3), and ECM deposition (TGF-β1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref063">63</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, Gap27 treatment also significantly increased expression of C×43 at both mRNA and total protein levels, although it did not affect relative proportions of the differently phosphorylated forms of the protein in the Western blots. Increased C×43 mRNA expression was also noted after MFA treatment. These findings are different from previous observations where treatment of human skin fibroblasts with Gap27 in a scratch wound model did not upregulate C×43 levels, but promoted its phosphorylation at S368 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref097">97</xref>]. It is possible that Gap27 treatment of confluent cell layers (as in the present study) or in the scratch wounding protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref097">97</xref>] may result to a different cell response to the peptide. Another possibility is that the responses depend on the previously described distinct phenotype of human gingival and skin fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref093">93</xref>]. In any case, in the present study, the dye transfer assays, which showed reduced GJ-mediated dye transfer by Gap27 treatment, were performed after 24 h pre-incubation with Gap27 to allow Gap27-induced C×43 upregulation to occur. Thus, despite of the elevated levels of C×43 in gingival fibroblasts, Gap27 was still able to block C×43 GJ channel functions as expected. Therefore, whether Gap27-induced gene expression changes in cultured human gingival fibroblasts depend on Gap27-induced upregulation of C×43 expression and/or reduced GJ function, and how this relates to reduced C×43 immunostaining and potential function in gingival wounds, remains to be shown.</p>
<p>In order to assess the mechanisms of Gap27-induced C×43 upregulation in gingival fibroblasts we used pharmacological inhibitors to key signaling pathways that associate with C×43. Previous findings have indicated that transcriptional modulator AP1 regulates C×43 expression by various signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref005">5</xref>]. Accordingly, its inhibition also partially suppressed Gap27-induced C×43 expression. In addition, Gap27-induced C×43 expression was partially regulated by MEK1/2 and p38 inhibitors, two upstream modulators of AP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref098">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref099">99</xref>]. Interestingly, though, Gap27-induced C×43 induction was totally blocked by the SP1 inhibitor, suggesting that this transcription factor is another important regulator of Gap27-induced C×43 expression in gingival fibroblasts. A recent molecular study has also linked SP1 to regulation of C×43 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref100">100</xref>]. SP1 also modulates C×43-induced expression of a set of genes in various cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115524.ref073">73</xref>]. Accordingly, blocking of SP1 totally or partially inhibited Gap27-induced expression of 7 genes in the present study.</p>
<p>To summarize, our findings demonstrate that C×43 shows similar spatiotemporal regulation in gingival wound epithelium over time as previously describe for skin. In addition, we showed for the first time that the abundance of C×43-positive plaques is strongly reduced in fibroblasts at the early stages of human gingival wound healing, returning to the level of normal tissue by day 60 post-wounding. Thus, wounding-induced suppression of C×43 in wound fibroblasts leads to disruption of the connexin-mediated intercellular communication network in the connective tissue, resulting to a gene expression change that maybe important for the fast and scarless wound healing outcome in gingiva. Interestingly, blocking of C×43 function by mimetic peptides strongly regulated expression of a number of wound healing and scar formation-associated genes in human gingival fibroblasts. These changes involved p38, MEK1/2-ERK1/2, TGF-β-SMAD3 and GSK3α/β mediated signaling pathways, and AP1 and SP1 transcription factors. Among these pathways, ERK1/2-MEK1/2 appeared to be a key regulator of C×43 mimetic peptide-modulated gene expression. Thus, C×43 mimetic peptides may provide an efficient tool to modulate fibroblast gene expression during wound healing. The exact mechanisms by which the C×43 mimetic peptides cause these effects, and the mechanisms and importance of C×43 down regulation for fast and scarless wound healing outcome in human gingiva <italic>in vivo</italic> warrant further investigation.</p>

<title>C×43 is down regulated in gingiva during wound healing.</title>
<p>Representative immunostainings of C×43 (red) and vimentin (green; a mesenchymal cell marker) in unwounded human oral mucosal tissue (attached gingiva) (A–C), and in gingival wounds 3- (D-F), 7- (G-I), 14- (J-L), 28- (M-O) and 60-days (P-Q) post-wounding. (A–C) In unwounded gingiva, abundant C×43 staining was localized in suprabasal epithelial cells. Most intensely stained cells were located in the stratum spinosum, but weak staining was also noted in basal epithelial cells. Inserts in (B) and (C) show higher magnification images of C×43 localization in basal cells at the connective tissue papilla and rete peg areas, respectively. (D–F) At day 3 post-wounding, C×43 was down regulated in migrating epithelial cells (D and E) and fibroblasts at wound edge (F; arrowheads indicate wound edge). (G–I) At day 7 post-wounding, when the wound was completely covered with a new epithelium, 2–3 most basal epithelial cell layers showed C×43 staining in the wound epithelium, while there was only a very weak immunoreactivity for C×43 in the spinous layer (G and H). Very little C×43 immunoreactivity was noted in fibroblasts at the wound edge (I). (J–L) At day 14 post-wounding, C×43 was confined to the 2–3 most basal layers of wound epithelium (J and K). At this stage, immunoreactivity for C×43 was slightly increased at the wound edge connective tissue (L) as compared to 7-day wounds (I). (M–O) At day 28 after wounding, C×43 immunoreactivity was normalized in the epithelium at the wound site, being present mainly in suprabasal cells of the stratum spinosum (M and N). Abundance of C×43-positive plaques in connective tissue cells at the wound edge (O) was increased as compared to earlier time points (I and L). (P–Q) At day 60 after wounding, structure of the epithelium and connective tissue formed at the wound area was closely similar to unwounded tissue. C×43 immunoreactivity was also similar to unwounded tissue in the epithelium at the wound site (P and Q). (R) Negative control staining of C×43 in unwounded epithelium. Data shown represents minimum of three sections stained in parallel samples from two to three individual donors at each time point. Arrowheads (D, E, F, G, I, J and M) indicate wound edge. E: epithelium; CT: connective tissue; FC: fibrin clot; W Edge: wound edge; WE: wound epithelium; GT: granulation tissue; WCT: wound connective tissue. Nuclear staining (blue) was performed using DAPI. Magnification bars in the inserts in B, C and Q: 50 μm.</p>
