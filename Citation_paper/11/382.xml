        <p>Vascular calcification results from osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular events. Ghrelin is a newly discovered bioactive peptide that acts as a natural endogenous ligand of the growth hormone secretagog receptor (GHSR). Several studies have identified the protective effects of ghrelin on the cardiovascular system, however research on the effects and mechanisms of ghrelin on vascular calcification is still quite rare. In this study, we determined the effect of ghrelin on osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs and investigated the mechanism involved using the two universally accepted calcifying models of calcifying vascular smooth muscle cells (CVSMCs) and beta-glycerophosphate (beta-GP)-induced VSMCs. Our data demonstrated that ghrelin inhibits osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization of VSMCs due to decreased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, Runx2 expression, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression and calcium content. Further study demonstrated that ghrelin exerted this suppression effect via an extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway and that the suppression effect of ghrelin was time dependent and dose dependent. Furthermore, inhibition of the growth hormone secretagog receptor (GHSR), the ghrelin receptor, by siRNA significantly reversed the activation of ERK by ghrelin. In conclusion, our study suggests that ghrelin may inhibit osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs through the GHSR/ERK pathway.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Vascular calcification, previously viewed as a passive consequence of aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Johnson1">[1]</xref>, is often found in patients with atherosclerosis, diabetes, renal failure and heart failure. It is also associated with many clinical complications such as myocardial infarction, impaired vascular tone, angioplasty dissection and poor surgical outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Bostrom1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Abedin1">[3]</xref>. There is now a growing awareness that vascular calcification is an active biologically regulated phenomenon that is similar to bone formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Liao1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Liao2">[5]</xref>. This process includes the expression of several osteoblast phenotype genes such as alkaline phosphatase (<italic>ALP</italic>), core binding factor Î±1 (<italic>cbfÎ±1</italic>, <italic>Runx2</italic>), osteocalcin and osteopontin, and requires the presence of the bone mineral hydroxyl apatite and matrix vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Steitz1">[6]</xref>. Previous studies have demonstrated the significant role of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the active regulation of vascular calcification by their acquisition of the phenotype of osteoblast-like cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Shao1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Doherty1">[8]</xref>. However, the mechanisms of this active process have not been fully explained.</p>
      <p>Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid acyl peptide that is esterified with octanoic acid on Ser 3 and that belongs to the brainâ€“gut peptide family; it has been isolated from both human and rat stomach and was first reported by Kojima in 1999 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Kojima1">[9]</xref>. Subsequent studies have identified that the stomach is the major source of circulating ghrelin, but small amounts of ghrelin are also produced by other organs such as the heart, lung or kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Date1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Zhang1">[11]</xref>. Ghrelin has multiple important physiological effects such as promotion of growth hormone (GH) release from the pituitary, increase of food intake, and regulation of energy homeostasis. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that ghrelin participates in many other physiological processes that include circulation, inflammation, glucose metabolism, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Granata1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Yang1">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been shown that the endocrine activities of ghrelin are mediated by the GH secretagog (GHS) receptor (GHS-R). GHS-R is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is mainly expressed in the pituitary gland and in the hypothalamus and that has two subtypes: the fully functional GHSR-1a and the biologically inactive GHSR-1b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Howard1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-McKee1">[15]</xref>. As stated earlier, ghrelin is expressed by many organs and tissues especially those of cardiovascular system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Papotti1">[16]</xref>. In addition, it has been shown to play a role in various cardiovascular activities such as increase in myocardial contractility, decrease in mean arterial pressure, vasodilatation, protection against myocardial infarction-induced heart failure, improvement of ventricular remodeling, as well as attenuation of injury in the heart from ischemia/reperfusion. Recent studies have demonstrated that ghrelin also plays an important role in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Kim1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Kim2">[18]</xref>; these results suggest that ghrelin may exert paracrine/autocrine effects in cardiovascular calcification. Recently, Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Li1">[19]</xref> reported that ghrelin could attenuate vascular calcification through inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs; however the mechanism of this inhibition is still not clear. Calcifying VSMCs (CVSMCs) are a specific subpopulation of VSMCs that can spontaneously express the osteoblast phenotype gene and form calcification nodules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Liu1">[20]</xref>. Additionally, normal primary VSMCs cultured with beta-glycerophosphate (beta-GP) can be induced into the process of osteoblastic differentiation. In the present study, both of these cell models were used to explore the effect of ghrelin on osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs. Our data suggest that ghrelin may attenuate vascular calcification through an extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway.</p>

        <title>Ghrelin inhibited the osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization of VSMCs</title>
        <p>It is acknowledged that the process of vascular calcification is similar that of bone mineralization, in which both ALP (the phenotypic marker for osteoblastic differentiation) and Runx2 (the transcription factor for osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation) are up-regulated significantly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Yang2">[21]</xref>. The bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are important regulators of orthotopic bone formation and two members of this group, BMP-2, and -4, are associated frequently with vascular calcification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Hruska1">[22]</xref>. In this study ALP activity, and expression of BMP-2 and Runx2 were determined to identify the inhibitory effects of ghrelin on osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs. Our data demonstrated that treatment with ghrelin significantly inhibited ALP activity and that the suppression was time dependent. In CVSMCs, significant inhibition by ghrelin was first observed at 24 h and inhibition peaked at 48 h. Details of the effects of ghrelin on ALP activity in CVSMCs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033126-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. In contrast, in VSMCs cultured with beta-GP, significant inhibition by ghrelin was observed on days 3 to 9 and inhibition peaked on day 6. Details of ALP activity in VSMCs cultured with beta-GP are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033126-g002">Figure 2A</xref>.</p>

        <title>Intracellular signaling mechanisms under stimulus of ghrelin</title>
        <p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play an essential role in the control of cell differentiation and the MAPK signaling pathway is known to be involved in osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Liao1">[4]</xref>. To confirm the involvement of MAPK signaling molecules and explore the effects of ghrelin on osteoblastic differentiation, the expression of three MAPK molecules, ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 MAPK (p38), were determined in a calcification model and by ghrelin treatment. Our data demonstrated that ERK was phosphorylated significantly by ghrelin, but both JNK and p38 did not respond to ghrelin stimulus but did respond to the positive control hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Specifically for CVSMCs, ERK activation occurred at 5 min after the start of incubation and peaked at 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033126-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>), which suggested that the effects of ghrelin on osteoblastic differentiation of CVSMCs may be mediated by ERK. A range of concentrations of ghrelin (10âˆ’9 mol/L, 10<sup>âˆ’8</sup> mol/L, 10<sup>âˆ’7</sup> mol/L, and 10<sup>âˆ’6</sup> mol/L) were added to the CVSMCs culture for 30 min to determine their effect on ERK activation.

      <p>Vascular calcification, which includes coronary and aortic calcification, is an important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Bostrom1">[2]</xref>. Clarification of the definite mechanisms for vascular calcification and development of effective therapeutic strategies are both challenging areas of research.</p>
      <p>Previous studies by our group have shown that the administration of apelin, taurine, omentin and adiponectin attenuated the calcification of CVSMCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Shan1">[23]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Luo1">[25]</xref>. At present, two universally accepted cell models are used to study osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the first model, VSMCs are induced by beta-GP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Li1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Shi1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Ding1">[27]</xref>. In the second, around 20â€“30% VSMCs undergo and form calcified matrix spontaneously <italic>in vitro</italic> without a phosphate donor in the medium, which is called CVSMCs and have been used to investigate osteoblastic differentiation mechanism in our and other's previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Hruska1">[22]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Luo1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Radcliff1">[28]</xref>. This cell model produces cells that have a more typical osteoblast phenotype, as cells can express ALP, osteocalcin, Runx2, and automatically form calcified matrix nodules. In addition, these cells express osteoblast-related genes (<italic>ALP</italic>, <italic>Runx2</italic>) more quickly than do beta-GP-induced VSMCs as demonstrated in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Radcliff1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Byon1">[29]</xref> and in the present work. Therefore, we decided to use a maximum 72 h period for CVSMCs and up to 9 days for beta-GP-induced VSMCs to examine the osteoblastic differentiation of these cells.</p>
      <p>In the present study, VSMCs were cultured with ghrelin for different lengths of time and important phenotypic markers of osteoblastic differentiation were detected. A previous study observed that 10âˆ’8â€“10âˆ’6 mol/L ghrelin treatment for 10 days decreased the ALP activity of calcified VSMCs in a dose-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Li1">[19]</xref>; here we demonstrated that the decrease of ALP activity by ghrelin also may be time dependent. Our data showed that treatment of CVSMCs with 10âˆ’6 mol/L of ghrelin inhibited ALP activity from 24 h up to 72 h, the most significant inhibition of ALP activity occurred at 48 h. Furthermore, incubation with 10âˆ’6 mol/L of ghrelin for 3 days inhibited the ALP activity of VSMCs induced by beta-GP. It has been shown previously that Runx2 suppresses myocardin-induced smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype genes and concomitantly promotes osteogenic conversion of SMCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Tanaka1">[30]</xref>. Nakahara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Nakahara1">[31]</xref> demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) induction of osteoblast-marker gene expression was mediated by an increase in DNA-binding activity of Runx2. Recently, Byon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Byon1">[29]</xref> have reported that Runx2 promoted the osteoblastic differentiation of macrophages by up-regulating the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), which mediates the crosstalk between CVSMCs and migration and differentiation of macrophages into osteoclast-like cells in the atherosclerotic lesions. Taken together, these results support the proposal that Runx2 may be a key regulatory factor in vascular calcification. It has been reported that treatment with 10âˆ’7 mol/L ghrelin for 7 days significantly suppressed the expression of Runx2 in preosteoblast C3H10T1/2 cells, while another independent experiment showed that ghrelin did not affect the expression of Runx2 in the differentiation of rat osteoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Kim2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Fukushima1">[32]</xref>. Our results demonstrated that the expression of Runx2, an important transcription factor for osteoblastic differentiation, and calcium deposition are both down-regulated significantly by ghrelin. The effects of ghrelin may be tissue or cell specific. BMP-2 is expressed in VSMCs and can induce the expression of Runx2 in the process of osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Hruska1">[22]</xref>. Our quantitative real-time PCR data showed that BMP-2 mRNA expression is significantly down-regulated by ghrelin in CVSMCs and VSMCs induced by beta-GP. Furthermore, the effect was time dependent. Taking together the previous studies and the present results, we think that ghrelin may affect osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. It has been demonstrated by our group that treatment with apelin for 48 h decreased the ALP activity of CVSMCs significantly and inhibited osteoblastic differentiation of CVSMCs, accompanied by suppression of Runx2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Shan1">[23]</xref>. Our present experiment demonstrated that ghrelin, which might act in a similar manner to apelin, inhibited osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs.</p>
      <p>To gain further insight into the mechanism by which ghrelin inhibits osteoblastic differentiation of CVSMCs, we evaluated signaling pathway events. The MAPKs, including ERK, JNK and p38, are serine/threonine kinases that are involved mainly in the activation of nuclear transcription factors that control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Shan1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Seger1">[33]</xref>. Several previous studies have shown that ERK is involved in osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization of VSMCs, but this involvement is still controversial. Radcliff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Radcliff1">[28]</xref> suggested that IGF-I inhibited osteoblastic differentiation and vascular-cell mineralization via both the ERK and PI3K pathways. Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Liu1">[20]</xref> reported that selenite suppressed H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-enhanced osteoblastic differentiation and calcification of VSMCs through the ERK pathway. Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Shi1">[26]</xref> found that LaCl<sub>3</sub> suppressed the beta-GP-induced osteoblastic differentiation and calcification of rat VSMCs by the activation of both ERK and JNK MAPK pathways. However, Ding et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Ding1">[27]</xref> demonstrated that fibronectin enhanced osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs via the ERK signaling pathway. Our present study suggested that ghrelin inhibited osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization of CVSMCs via the ERK signaling pathway, a finding that is in accordance with Radcliff's, Liu's, and Shi's work and our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Liao1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Liao2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033126-Shan1">[23]</xref>. However, we found no activation of the other kinases JNK and p38 in this experiment. Our data showed that 10âˆ’9 mol/L of ghrelin had no stimulus effect on ERK activation, but that a dose of 10âˆ’8 to 10âˆ’6 mol/L of ghrelin stimulated the expression of p-ERK, and therefore that the stimulus is dose dependent. Furthermore, both silencing of GHSR and blockade of ERK suppressed the inhibition of ghrelin on ALP activity, Runx2 mRNA expression and calcium content. Overall, our study suggested that the ghrelin/GHSR signaling pathway may attenuate osteoblastic differentiation of CVSMCs through an ERK-dependent pathway.</p>
      <p>In summary, our study identified the effects of ghrelin on osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs and demonstrated that ghrelin exerted this suppression by promotion of the phosphorylation of ERK. Our findings suggested that ghrelin may be a prospective target for vascular calcification therapy. However, further study is necessary before any clinical application is considered.</p>
