          <title>Rationale</title>
          <p>Recently it has been shown that long-term intensive exercise practice is able to induce myocardial fibrosis in an animal model. Angiotensin II is a profibrotic hormone that could be involved in the cardiac remodeling resulting from endurance exercise.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Objective</title>
          <p>This study examined the antifibrotic effect of losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, in an animal model of heart fibrosis induced by long-term intense exercise.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods and Results</title>
          <p>Male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into 4 experimental groups: Exercise, Exercise plus losartan, Sedentary and Sedentary plus losartan. Exercise groups were conditioned to run vigorously for 16 weeks. Losartan was orally administered daily before each training session (50 mg/kg/day). Time-matched sedentary rats served as controls. After euthanasia, heart hypertrophy was evaluated by histological studies; ventricular collagen deposition was quantified by histological and biochemical studies; and messenger RNA and protein expression of transforming growth factor-β1, fibronectin-1, matrix metalloproteinase-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, procollagen-I and procollagen-III was evaluated in all 4 cardiac chambers. Daily intensive exercise caused hypertrophy in the left ventricular heart wall and originated collagen deposition in the right ventricle. Additionally long-term intensive exercise induced a significant increase in messenger RNA expression and protein synthesis of the major fibrotic markers in both atria and in the right ventricle. Losartan treatment was able to reduce all increases in messenger RNA expression and protein levels caused by exercise, although it could not completely reverse the heart hypertrophy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In recent years, a growing concern has arisen from numerous observational studies reporting that long-term intense sport activity could be associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-LaGerche1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Biffi1">[5]</xref>. In a previous study by our group we have demonstrated a profibrotic cardiac remodeling following long-term intensive exercise training in experimental animals, this could be the basis for an increased arrythmogenicity in athletes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Benito1">[6]</xref>. In this respect, a well designed recently published study, relates the presence of myocardial fibrosis in veteran endurance athletes in the absence of any other cause <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Wilson1">[7]</xref>. The etiology and clinical significance of these findings have yet to be fully elucidated. Theres is therefore a need for better understanding of the biological process involved and of any upper limit above which intense exercise can be harmful to health as well as the possibility of taking action to avoid this damage.</p>
      <p>Long-term exercise is associated with hemodynamic changes and alters the loading conditions of the heart, these changes have classically characterized the physiology of “athlete's heart”. It is known that hemodynamic overload activates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Dahlof1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Julius1">[9]</xref>. Although RAS plays an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis by influencing vascular tone, fluid and electrolyte balance, experimental evidence suggests that RAS activation induces fibroblast proliferation and myocyte hypertrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Goette1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-DAmore1">[11]</xref>. Angiotensin II (ANGII) is produced by proteolytic cleavage of its precursor angiotensin I by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). ANGII plays an important role in cardiac fibrogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Sun1">[12]</xref> by acting as a potent grown factor and cytokine for vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, via activation of the angiotensin type I receptor (AT1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Bernstein1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Fleming1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Losartan is a selective AT1 receptor antagonist. It has been demonstrated that inhibition of cardiac RAS with ACE inhibitors and/or ANGII receptor blockers improves left ventricle function, prevents geometric remodeling, and prolongs survival in several heart diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Schieffer1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Liu1">[16]</xref>. The antifibrotic effect of losartan has also been described in other fibrotic processes such as pulmonary fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Marshall1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The main objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-fibrotic effect of losartan in an animal model of heart fibrosis induced by chronic endurance exercise. Our results showed that losartan was able to prevent the development of myocardial fibrosis caused by intense exercise.</p>

        <title>The experimental design</title>
        <p>This study conformed to European Community (Directive 86/609/EEC) and Spanish guidelines for the use of experimental animals and it was approved by the institutional committees of animal care and research. 24 pathogen-free, 4 week old, male Wistar rats, weighing 100–125 g at the beginning of experiments (Charles River Laboratories, France), were housed in a controlled environment (12 ∶ 12-h light-dark cycle), and fed rodent chow (A04; Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) and tap water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p>

Briefly, exercise rats underwent a daily running session on a treadmill (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) five days a week for 16 weeks. Losartan (50 mg/kg/day) was administered orally, every day at the same hour, starting in the first exercise session and continuing up to the end of the experiment. The drug was dissolved in a final volume of 1,5 ml of distilled water. Oral administration was selected as this is the usual method in a clinical setting. The first exercise session lasted for 10 min at 25 cm/s, and the duration and intensity were gradually increased reaching 60 min at 60 cm/s on the 10<sup>th</sup> day these levels were then maintained until the end of training. The animals were euthanized three days after the end of the training program to avoid any immediate responses. The hearts were quickly removed, weighed, dissected into left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA); they were then frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80°C until analyzed (n = 6, for each group), or fixed for histological studies (n = 6, for each group).</p>

        <title>Cardiac hypertrophy</title>
        <p>Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by determining the heart-weight to body-weight ratio and by measuring the ventricular wall thickness at papillary muscle levels. To measure the wall thickness from RV free wall (RV FW), interventricular septum (IV), and LV free wall (LV FW), 12 measurements from each wall were taken per animal in heart paraffin sections using analySIS Image Processing software (Soft Imaging System GMBH, Germany) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055427-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Differences in ventricular size were controlled by indexing wall-thickness to body-weight.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have shown that losartan, a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, ameliorates experimental exercise-induced myocardial fibrosis. Our findings provide further evidence for the anti-fibrotic effect of losartan.</p>
      <p>Chronic exercise induces hemodynamic changes and alters the loading conditions of the heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Benito1">[6]</xref>, thus generating structural cardiac adaptations that are considered physiological, (and commonly known as athlete's heart) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Fagard1">[18]</xref>. Long-term volume and pressure overloads, caused by intense exercise, can induce cardiac maladaptative responses including remodeling and fibrosis, which ultimately lead to heart tissue dysfunction similar to that found in pathological conditions of chronic overload such as heart failure and hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Querejeta1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Querejeta2">[20]</xref>. Several studies with animal models of acute exercise have shown histological evidence of reactive scar tissue formation and elevation of necrosis and fibrosis markers immediately following intense exercise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Chen1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Verzola1">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, Lindsay et al have found biochemical evidence of myocardial fibrosis in veteran endurance athletes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Lindsay1">[23]</xref>. Also, in a previous animal model we have demonstrated the direct relationship between a long-term endurance exercise schedule and the development of myocardial fibrosis and increased arrhythmia inducibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Benito1">[6]</xref>. In this study, the progressive alteration in ECM composition induced by exercise increased myocardial stiffness, promoted the development of diastolic dysfunction and became a potential substrate for the development of arrhythmias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Benito1">[6]</xref>. It is particularly noteworthy that our findings in an animal model were similar to those observed in a study on veteran endurance athletes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Wilson1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The present results confirm that 16 weeks of endurance exercise training in rats promotes left ventricular hypertrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Benito1">[6]</xref>. Furthermore, exercised animals developed myocardial fibrosis and showed alterations in ECM protein synthesis in both atria and in the right ventricle, indicating that these changes could promote alterations in heart functionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Benito1">[6]</xref>. Therefore, ameliorating and preventing myocardial fibrosis would be very important in the management of future cardiovascular events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Ganau1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Jiang1">[25]</xref>. ANGII is a powerful stimulus for progressive cardiac remodeling and plays a significant role in promoting myocardial fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Weber1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Weber2">[27]</xref>. AT1 receptor antagonists have antifibrotic and anti-growth effects on the myocardium in experimental settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Wu1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-MolinaMolina1">[29]</xref>. It has been reported that circulating ANG II plays a central role in the progression of myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy in hypertensive patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Sadoshima1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Zhou1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As described in with previous works <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Benito1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Taniike1">[32]</xref>, our results also showed an increased cardiac mass and left ventricular hypertrophy, reflecting the enlargement of the left ventricular cavity that following long-term endurance training and that is considered typical of the athlete's heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Fagard1">[18]</xref>. Left ventricular hypertrophy as detected by echocardiogram is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in subjects with high blood pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Casale1">[33]</xref> and in the population at large <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Levy1">[34]</xref>. In the literature, there are several studies evaluating the therapeutic benefits of ACE inhibitors or the intervention of AT1 antagonists in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Avanza1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Dahlof2">[36]</xref>. In agreement with these studies, our findings show that losartan treatment was able to partially prevent left ventricular hypertrophy in exercised animals. One interesting observation is the fact that the development of hypertrophy is observed in the LV, but the increases in both the expression and the synthesis of fibrotic markers are observed in the RA, LA and RV. This could be explained by the intrinsic features of these cavities, including their thinner walls, which could make them more susceptible to damage from heart volume and pressure overload induced by exercise. In contrast, the LV structure is thicker and responds to pressure and volume overload by increasing its thickness even further, thus demonstrating greater resistance to changes in the composition of the ECM. Cardiac remodeling in response to hemodynamic stress and/or injury includes changes in the cardiomyocyte compartment as well as the nonmyocyte compartment (endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and cardiac fibroblasts). Pathological changes in cardiac remodeling include myocyte hypertrophy, myocyte death, and dynamic changes in the interstitium. Interstitial changes involve qualitative and quantitative alterations in the fibrillar collagen network (composed mainly of types I and III fibrillar collagen), including changes in collagen cross-linking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Chen2">[37]</xref>. Collagen-I determines the stiffness of cardiac muscle, whereas collagen-III is more distensible. Thus, the ratio of collagen-I to collagen-III can be a marker of the ECM determinants of cardiac stiffness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Norton1">[38]</xref>. We observed a significant increase in collagen-I and III protein expression in the RV in the exercise group, where collagen-I expression was more prominent, indicating that long-term, intensive exercise could increase cardiac stiffness. Losartan treatment was able to avoirevent all the increases in fibrotic markers caused by endurance exercise, thereby preventing myocardial ECM remodeling. The antifibrotic effect of AT1 receptor blockade has been reported in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-MolinaMolina1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Yoshiji1">[39]</xref>. Our findings agree with those of Chen et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Chen2">[37]</xref>, who showed that an AT1 receptor antagonist prevented the early induction of TGF-β1 and the subsequent development of cardiac fibrosis, indicating that ANG II acts indirectly through the expression of TGF-β1 to induce cardiac fibrosis. It has been proposed that a phenotypic change from the cardiac fibroblast to the more synthetic myofibroblast phenotype takes place under the influence of cytokines such as TGF-β1, promoting the deposition of collagen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Petrov1">[40]</xref>. Myocardial collagen content is tightly regulated by a balance between collagen production and degradation. Extracellular degradation of collagen is the most important brake on collagen metabolism and it is effected by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Woessner1">[41]</xref>. The intramyocardial coronary arterioles also undergo changes in cardiac remodeling resulting in medial thickening and perivascular fibrosis. Collectively these changes lead to progressive impairment of the cardiac function. Our results showed a significant increase in mRNA expression for TGF-β1, MMP-2, TIMP-1, fibronectin-1, collagen type I and collagen type III as a consequence of intense and long-lasting exercise. Losartan treatment was able to bring all these increases down to control levels in this animal model, indicating the beneficial effect of blocking the RAS system in preventing on myocardial remodeling resulting from intense exercise.</p>
      <p>In summary, this study demonstrates that losartan treatment in exercised animals prevents the heart fibrosis induced by endurance exercise and strengthens the recent theory that intense exercise could be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and interstitial myocardial fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Benito1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Wilson1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Lindsay1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055427-Whyte1">[42]</xref>. This finding opens up the possibility of using losartan as a treatment for preventing of the heart's maladaptative responses to long-term intense exercise.</p>
