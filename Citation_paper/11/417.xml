<abstract>
<p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is a useful model to study the neuronal or molecular basis for behavioral choice, a specific form of decision-making. Although it has been implied that both D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors may contribute to the control of decision-making in mammals, the genetic interactions between D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors in regulating decision-making are still largely unclear. In the present study, we investigated the molecular control of behavioral choice between conflicting alternatives (diacetyl and Cu<sup>2+</sup>) by D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors and their possible genetic interactions with <italic>C. elegans</italic> as the assay system. In the behavioral choice assay system, mutation of <italic>dop-1</italic> gene encoding D1-like dopamine receptor resulted in the enhanced tendency to cross the Cu<sup>2+</sup> barrier compared with wild-type. In contrast, mutations of <italic>dop-2</italic> or <italic>dop-3</italic> gene encoding D2-like dopamine receptor caused the weak tendency to cross the Cu<sup>2+</sup> barrier compared with wild-type. During the control of behavioral choice, DOP-3 antagonistically regulated the function of DOP-1. The behavioral choice phenotype of <italic>dop-2; dop-1dop-3</italic> triple mutant further confirmed the possible antagonistic function of D2-like dopamine receptor on D1-like dopamine receptor in regulating behavioral choice. The genetic assays further demonstrate that DOP-3 might act through Gα<sub>o</sub> signaling pathway encoded by GOA-1 and EGL-10, and DOP-1 might act through Gα<sub>q</sub> signaling pathway encoded by EGL-30 and EAT-16 to regulate the behavioral choice. DOP-1 might function in cholinergic neurons to regulate the behavioral choice, whereas DOP-3 might function in GABAergic neurons, RIC, and SIA neurons to regulate the behavioral choice. In this study, we provide the genetic evidence to indicate the antagonistic relationship between D1-like dopamine receptor and D2-like dopamine receptor in regulating the decision-making of animals. Our data will be useful for understanding the complex functions of dopamine receptors in regulating decision-making in animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dopamine regulates a variety of behavioral activities in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In mammals, dopamine can act through five receptors that are grouped into several classes. D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors usually have antagonistic effects on behaviors in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Gong1">[1]</xref>. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, there are four dopamine receptors: DOP-1, DOP-2, DOP-3, and DOP-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Chase1">[2]</xref>. DOP-1 and DOP-4 are D1-like dopamine receptors. DOP-2 and DOP-3 are D2-like dopamine receptors. DOP-4 is unique in invertebrate and distinct from mammalian D1-like dopamine receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Sugiura1">[3]</xref>. Previous study has demonstrated that DOP-1 and DOP-3 had antagonistic effects on basal slowing response in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Chase1">[2]</xref>. DOP-1 and DOP-3 could further activate antagonistic Gα<sub>q</sub> and Gα<sub>o</sub> signaling pathways to regulate the basal slowing response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Chase1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is a useful model system to study the neuronal or molecular basis for behaviors including decision-making <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Bendesky1">[4]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Faumont1">[6]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, among the several forms of decision-making, behavioral choice between conflicting alternatives (diacetyl and Cu<sup>2+</sup>) can reflect the effects of multiple stimuli (attractant versus aversive stimuli) on behavioral plasticity in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Ishihara1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Shinkai1">[9]</xref>. Nematodes normally show being attracted to attractants such as diacetyl which is sensed by AWA sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Bargmann1">[10]</xref>, but will avoid aversive cues such as Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion which is sensed by ADL/ASH sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Sambongi1">[11]</xref>. For the molecular mechanism of behavioral choice between conflicting alternatives, some signaling pathways have been raised to have important roles. HEN-1 (<underline>he</underline>sitatio<underline>n</underline> behavior) was first identified to play an important role in behavioral choice control in AIY interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Ishihara1">[7]</xref>. HEN-1 and SCD-2 (<underline>s</underline>uppressor of <underline>c</underline>onstitutive <underline>d</underline>auer formation), a target of FSN-1 (<underline>F</underline>-box <underline>s</underline>y<underline>n</underline>aptic protein), may function in the same genetic pathway to regulate behavioral choice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Shinkai1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Li2">[12]</xref>. GCY-28 (<underline>g</underline>uanylyl <underline>cy</underline>lase)/CNG-1 (<underline>c</underline>yclic <underline>n</underline>ucleotide <underline>g</underline>ated channel) functioned in a parallel pathway in AIA interneurons with HEN-1/SCD-2 to regulate behavioral choice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Shinkai1">[9]</xref>. The insulin signaling pathway including <italic>daf-16</italic>, <italic>daf-2</italic>, and <italic>daf-18</italic> was also shown to participate in the control of behavioral choice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Jiu1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Decision-making is a complex cognitive process that is found to be impaired in a number of psychiatric diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated that both D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors may contribute to the decision-making impairments in human and animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Simon1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Reuter1">[18]</xref>. However, the genetic interactions between D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors in regulating decision-making are still largely unclear. In the present study, we investigated the molecular control of behavioral choice by D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors and their possible genetic interactions with <italic>C. elegans</italic> as the <italic>in vivo</italic> assay system. Our data suggest the antagonistic functions between D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors in regulating the behavioral choice in nematodes. Our study will be useful for understanding the important function of dopamine signaling in regulating the decision-making in animals.</p>

<title>Effects of mutations of genes encoding D1-like dopamine receptors on behavioral choice</title>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, D1-like dopamine receptors contain DOP-1 and DOP-4. In the behavioral choice assay system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115985-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), the <italic>dop-4</italic> loss-of-function mutant (<italic>dop-4(ok1321)</italic>) showed the similar tendency to cross the Cu<sup>2+</sup> barrier to that of wild-type under both the well-fed and the starved conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115985-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>dop-1</italic> loss-of-function mutant (<italic>dop-1(vs100)</italic>) exhibited the enhanced tendency to cross the Cu<sup>2+</sup> barrier compared with wild-type under the well-fed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115985-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In the assay system, when either diacetyl or Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion was presented, index of <italic>dop-1(vs100)</italic> mutant was similar to that of wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115985-g001">Fig. 1C and 1D</xref>), implying that the observed deficit in behavioral choice in <italic>dop-1</italic> mutant is not due to the abnormality of chemotaxis to diacetyl or avoidance of Cu<sup>2+</sup>. However, when both Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion and diacetyl were presented in the assay system, index of <italic>dop-1(vs100)</italic> mutant was higher than that of wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115985-g001">Fig. 1C and 1D</xref>). Thus, the inhibition of Cu<sup>2+</sup> avoidance by diacetyl may be stronger than the inhibition of diacetyl chemotaxis by Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion in <italic>dop-1</italic> mutants.</p>

<p>Due to the sensation of starvation, starved wild-type nematodes show the higher index of behavioral choice than well-fed wild-type nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Ishihara1">[7]</xref>. Like wild-type animals, <italic>dop-1(vs100)</italic> mutant changed their behavioral choice after starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115985-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), demonstrating that the <italic>dop-1</italic> mutant can sense the starvation like wild-type nematodes. In the behavioral choice assay system, if the examined nematodes are abnormal in locomotion behavior, the obtained index of behavioral choice may not be able to reflect the real ability of behavioral choice for the nematodes. In this study, we used the body bend to reflect the state of locomotion behavior of nematodes. Both the well-fed and the starved <italic>dop-1(vs100)</italic> mutants showed the similar body bends to those of wild-type in the NGM plates without food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115985-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), suggesting the normal locomotion behavior of <italic>dop-1</italic> mutant in the behavioral choice assay system. These data suggest that <italic>dop-1</italic> mutant does have deficits in behavioral choice between conflicting alternatives.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that dopamine receptors can regulate several behaviors including the locomotion, food response, enhancement of odor avoidance, mating behavior, and plasticity of mechanosensory response in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Sanyal1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Omura1">[26]</xref>. In the present study, we provide the evidence to further prove the crucial role of both D1-like dopamine receptor (DOP-1) and D2-like dopamine receptors (DOP-2 and DOP-3) in the control of behavioral choice between conflicting alternatives (diacetyl and Cu<sup>2+</sup>). DOP-2 and DOP-3 may function in the same genetic pathway to regulate behavioral choice. The observed deficits in behavioral choice between conflicting alternatives in <italic>dop-1</italic>, <italic>dop-2</italic>, and <italic>dop-3</italic> loss-of-function mutants were not due to the abnormality in sensation of starvation, and locomotion behavior. Our results are consistent to a certain degree with the observed functions of D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors in regulating decision-making of mammalian animals. In mammals, D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors may play the prominent roles in regulating decision-making. In contrast, D3-like or D4-like dopamine receptors might only participate in the control of specific forms of decision-making in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-St2">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Ha1">[29]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, previous studies have further suggested that dopamine receptors can regulate the behavioral plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Sanyal1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Kindt1">[23]</xref>. Therefore, D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors can regulate the two steps of informational processing including both the learning and the integration of sensory signals of nematodes.</p>
<p>In the assay system for behavioral choice, we used two stimuli, diacetyl and Cu<sup>2+</sup>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, AWA sensory neurons are involved in the sensation of diacetyl, and the ASH and ADL sensory neurons are involved in the sensation of Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Bargmann1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Sambongi1">[11]</xref>. Moreover, some neurotransmitters, including neuropeptide, serotonin, tyramine and octopamine, have been suggested to modulate the ASH-mediated aversive behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Flavell1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Wragg1">[33]</xref>. However, our data suggest that mutations of the examined dopamine receptors had the normal chemotaxis to diacetyl and avoidance of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting that the examined dopamine receptors may be not involved in the control of the chemotaxis to diacetyl or the avoidance of Cu<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<p>Our data further demonstrate that D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors antagonistically regulate the behavioral choice. The D2-like dopamine receptor DOP-3 could antagonistically regulate the function of D1-like dopamine receptor DOP-1 in regulating the behavioral choice. The behavioral choice phenotype of <italic>dop-2(vs105); dop-1(vs100)dop-3(vs106)</italic> triple mutant further confirmed the important antagonistic function of D2-like dopamine receptor on D1-like dopamine receptor in regulating the behavioral choice in nematodes. It has been implied that both D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors may have antagonistic effects on decision-making in mammals. In rats, based on pharmacological manipulations, blockage of D1-like receptors in prefrontal cortex decreased preference for the risky decision-making; whereas blockage of D2-like receptors in prefrontal cortex increased the risky decision-making <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-St1">[15]</xref>. In the present study, we provide the direct genetic evidence to indicate the antagonistic relationship between D1-like dopamine receptor and D2-like dopamine receptor in regulating the decision-making of animals. Previous study has also demonstrated that mutation of <italic>dop-1</italic> gene reversed the deficit in basal slowing response of the <italic>dop-3</italic> mutant nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Chase1">[2]</xref>. Therefore, the relationship between D1-like dopamine receptor and D2-like dopamine receptor in regulating the functions of nervous system of nematodes may be very complex.</p>
<p>Our data in the present study suggest that the dopamine signaling is involved in the control of behavioral choice in nematodes. However, the behavioral choice in <italic>C. elegans</italic> may be not solely dependent on the dopamine signaling. Other specific neurotransmitter signaling pathways may be also involved in the control of behavioral choice in nematodes. For example, it has been shown that mutations of <italic>glc-3</italic> gene encoding a <sub>L</sub>-glutamate-gated chloride channel caused more nematodes to cross the Cu<sup>2+</sup> barrier in the behavioral choice assay system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Shinkai1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that D1-like dopamine receptors can activate the Gα<sub>q</sub> signaling pathway, and D2-like dopamine receptors can activate the Gα<sub>o</sub> signaling pathway in cells of nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Chase1">[2]</xref>, we examined the roles of genes encoding Gα<sub>q</sub> signaling pathway or Gα<sub>o</sub> signaling pathway in regulating the behavioral choice. Our data suggest that, in the Gα<sub>q</sub> signaling pathway, EGL-30 and EAT-16 regulated the behavioral choice of nematodes. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>egl-30</italic> encodes the Gα<sub>q</sub>, and <italic>eat-16</italic> encodes the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) protein, a GTPase activating protein. In the Gα<sub>o</sub> signaling pathway, GOA-1 and EGL-10 regulated the behavioral choice of nematodes. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>goa-1</italic> encodes the Gα<sub>o</sub>, and <italic>egl-10</italic> also encodes an RGS protein. These results suggest that both the Gα<sub>q</sub> signaling pathway and the Gα<sub>o</sub> signaling pathway are involved in the control of behavioral choice in nematodes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the genetic assay indicate that DOP-1 could function in the same genetic pathway with EGL-30 and EAT-16 in regulating the behavioral choice, and DOP-3 could function in the same genetic pathway with GOA-1 and EGL-10 in regulating the behavioral choice. In this study, we hypothesize that D2-like dopamine receptor/DOP-3 acting through the Gα<sub>o</sub> signaling pathway encoded by GOA-1 and EGL-10 may antagonize the function of D1-like dopamine receptor/DOP-1 acting through the Gα<sub>q</sub> signaling pathway encoded by EGL-30 and EAT-16 to regulate the behavioral choice in nematodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115985-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is very suitable for understanding the neural signaling because of its simple and well-described nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-White1">[34]</xref>. Previous study has suggested that dopamine can counteract octopamine signaling in a neural circuit to regulate the food response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Suo1">[21]</xref>. Our work further revealed the neural circuit for D1-like dopamine receptor/DOP-1 or D2-like dopamine receptor/DOP-3 in regulating the behavioral choice in nematodes. Our data suggest that DOP-1 may function in cholinergic neurons to regulate the behavioral choice, and DOP-3 may function in GABAergic neurons to regulate the behavioral choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115985-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Nevertheless, the exact cholinergic or GABAergic neuron(s) in which DOP-1 or DOP-3 may function to regulate the behavioral choice is still unclear. Moreover, DOP-3 could further function in RIC or SIA neurons to regulate the behavioral choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115985-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). That is, DOP-1 and DOP-3 may function in different neurons to exert antagonistic effects on behavioral choice of nematodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115985-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Previous study has suggested that EGL-10, EAT-16, GOA-1, and EGL-30 can modulate the response of ASH sensory neurons to repellents in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Esposito1">[35]</xref>. Our results imply that DOP-1 and DOP-3 may only indirectly influence the function of ASH sensory neurons in regulating the response to repellents in nematodes. Previous study has also demonstrated that although DOP-3 is not expressed in ASH sensory neurons, <italic>dop-3</italic> RNAi knockdown in ASH casued the octanol hypersensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Ezak1">[36]</xref>. Besides these, previous study has demonstrated that adenosine A2A receptor antagonism can attenuate the effects from dopamine D2 antagonism on decision-making in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Pardo1">[16]</xref>. The possible interactions of dopamine signaling with other signaling pathways in regulating the behavioral choice are also needed to be further investigated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in the present study, our data suggest that both D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors can modulate the behavioral choice between conflicting alternatives (diacetyl and Cu<sup>2+</sup>). During the behavioral choice control, D2-like dopamine receptor DOP-3 could antagonistically regulate the function of D1-like dopamine receptor DOP-1 in nematodes. The behavioral choice phenotype of <italic>dop-2; dop-1dop-3</italic> triple mutant was similar to that in the single mutant of <italic>dop-2</italic> or <italic>dop-3</italic>. In nematodes, DOP-3 might act through the Gα<sub>o</sub> signaling pathway encoded by GOA-1 and EGL-10, and DOP-1 might act through the Gα<sub>q</sub> signaling pathway encoded by EGL-30 and EAT-16 to regulate the behavioral choice. Therefore, we here provide the direct genetic evidence to indicate the antagonistic relationship between D1-like dopamine receptor and D2-like dopamine receptor in regulating the decision-making of animals. In human beings, defects in dopamine signaling may underlie the neuronal development related diseases such as schizophrenia and autism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Comings1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-DeKrom1">[39]</xref>.

<p>To generate entry vectors carrying promoter sequences, the promoter regions were amplified by PCR from <italic>C. elegans</italic> genomic DNA (2.0 kb for <italic>hlh-17</italic> promoter used for glia-specific expression, 0.9 kb for <italic>unc-47</italic> promoter used for GABAergic neurons-specific expression, 3.2 kb for <italic>acr-2</italic> promoter used for cholinergic neuron-specific expression, 2.8 kb for <italic>gcy-28.d</italic> promoter used for AIA-specific expression, 0.9 kb for <italic>ttx-3</italic> promoter used for AIY-specific expression, 3.0 kb for <italic>tbh-1</italic> promoter used for RIC-specific expression, 1.4 kb for <italic>gcy-7</italic> promoter used for ASE-specific expression, 2.3 kb for <italic>sro-1</italic> promoter used for expression in SIA neurons, and 1.2 for <italic>lim-6</italic> promoter used for expression in RIS neurons. The designed promoter primers were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115985.s001">S1 Table</xref>. And then these promoters were inserted into the pPD95_77 vector in the sense orientation. <italic>dop-1</italic> (the isoform of <italic>F15A8.5a</italic>), or <italic>dop-3</italic> (the isoform of <italic>T14E8.3b</italic>) cDNA was amplified by PCR. The sequences of the amplified cDNA were verified by sequencing, and then the cDNA was inserted into corresponding entry vectors carrying the appropriate promoter sequence. Germline transformation was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115985-Mello1">[41]</xref> by coinjecting the testing DNA at a concentration of 10–40 µg/mL and the marker DNA of P<italic>dop-1::rfp</italic> at a concentration of 60 µg/mL into the gonad of nematodes.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All data in this article were expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.). Graphs were generated using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Differences between groups were determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA). If not specifically indicated, the differences between groups were determined using one-way ANOVA. The probability levels of 0.05 and 0.01 were considered statistically significant.</p>
