<abstract>
<p>Smooth muscle α actin (<italic>Acta2</italic>) expression is largely restricted to smooth muscle cells, pericytes and specialized fibroblasts, known as myofibroblasts. Liver injury, associated with cirrhosis, induces transformation of resident hepatic stellate cells into liver specific myofibroblasts, also known as activated cells. Here, we have used <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> wound healing models to explore the functional role of <italic>Acta2</italic> in this transformation. <italic>Acta2</italic> was abundant in activated cells isolated from injured livers but was undetectable in quiescent cells isolated from normal livers. Both cellular motility and contraction were dramatically increased in injured liver cells, paralleled by an increase in <italic>Acta2</italic> expression, when compared with quiescent cells. Inhibition of <italic>Acta2</italic> using several different techniques had no effect on cytoplasmic actin isoform expression, but led to reduced cellular motility and contraction. Additionally, <italic>Acta2</italic> knockdown was associated with a significant reduction in Erk1/2 phosphorylation compared to control cells. The data indicate that <italic>Acta2</italic> is important specifically in myofibroblast cell motility and contraction and raise the possibility that the <italic>Acta2</italic> cytoskeleton, beyond its structural importance in the cell, could be important in regulating signaling processes during wound healing <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Actin plays an important role in many cellular processes, including cell division, cell motility and the generation of contractile force. Eukaryotic cells contain at least six unique actin isoforms, encoded by a multigene family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Garrels1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Vandekerckhove1">[2]</xref>. Two nonmuscle or cytoplasmic actins, β and γ, are found in all cells while the muscle actins include γ smooth muscle actin, and 3 α actin variants (smooth, cardiac and skeletal), each of which is restricted to specialized muscle or muscle-like cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-McHugh1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Herman1">[4]</xref>. The smooth muscle α actin (<italic>Acta2</italic>) isoform is found predominantly in smooth muscle, but is also expressed in other specialized cells such as pericytes and myofibroblasts, the latter of which are typical of wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Gabbiani1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Schurch1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>From a structural standpoint, actins are among the most highly conserved proteins known (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077166.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). Despite the fact that the 6 known eukaryotic actin isoforms are coded for by 6 different genes, the actins exhibit remarkable amino acid similarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Miwa1">[8]</xref>. The group of muscle specific actins (smooth muscle γ and α actin, cardiac α actin, and skeletal α actin) differ from nonmuscle cytoplasmic actins at less than 10% of amino acid locations, while the muscle specific isoforms differ from each other only at several residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Garrels1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Vandekerckhove2">[9]</xref>, primarily at the amino-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Garrels1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Vandekerckhove1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Miwa1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Vandekerckhove2">[9]</xref>. Considerable controversy exists regarding the degree that the minor variations in actin structure confer functional specificity among the isoactins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Herman1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Rubenstein1">[10]</xref>. A weak interaction between actin and myosin which appears to be dependent on the negatively charged amino-terminal region of actin and the positively charged flexible loop on the myosin head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Rayment1">[11]</xref> raises the possibility that differences in actin structure in the amino-terminal region could lead to divergent functional characteristics of the actins.</p>
<p>Persistent injury leads to a wounding response, common to many tissues and typified by fibrogenesis as well as wound contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Grinnell1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Gabbiani2">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-McClain1">[16]</xref>. A key feature of the cellular response to injury, regardless of tissue type, is the appearance of a population of specialized cells known as myofibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Gabbiani3">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Tomasek1">[18]</xref>. In the liver, injury and the subsequent wounding response leads to activation of resident mesenchymal cells known as hepatic stellate cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Davis1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Friedman1">[21]</xref> which undergo a programmed cascade of events, including enhanced matrix synthesis, cellular proliferation, and striking de novo production of <italic>Acta2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Maher1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Friedman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Rockey1">[22]</xref>. The stellate cell to myofibroblast transformation process, also known as “activation” - in which <italic>Acta2</italic> is an integral component - appears to be analogous to that occurring in fibroblasts after injury and wound healing in other pathological settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Schurch1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Mitchell1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Kapanci1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we hypothesized that <italic>Acta2</italic>, which is upregulated during stellate cell activation, has a critical functional role in stellate cell phenotypic behavior during the wound healing response. In particular, cell motility and contractility appear to be stellate cell phenotypes important during the wounding response. Thus, we have utilized <italic>in vivo</italic> models of liver injury with primary stellate cells, including those isolated directly from injured livers. This activation response resulting from injury causes stellate cells to transform into myofibroblast-like cells and allows us to more accurately explore the functional role of <italic>Acta2</italic> in cell motility and contractility. This model in particular yields a more accurate assessment of <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular behavior than systems utilizing passaged or transformed cells.</p>

<title>Actin isoform regulation in hepatic stellate cells during hepatic wounding</title>
<p>Our model system exploits our ability to isolate in high purity and to examine primary rat stellate cells after induction of liver injury; by all accounts, their study immediately after their isolation provides a very close approximation of their <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Rockey1">[22]</xref>. We first evaluated actin, including <italic>Acta2</italic> expression in two models of hepatic injury and wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Repeated administration of carbon tetrachloride (10 doses over 70 days) and bile duct ligation led to prominent stellate cell activation, expression of <italic>Acta2</italic>, and fibrosis as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Rockey1">[22]</xref>.</p>

<title>Actin isoform expression after liver injury.</title>
<p>In (A–C), stellate cells were isolated after carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) induced liver injury as in Methods and plated on glass coverslips. Twenty-four hours later, smooth muscle α actin (<italic>Acta2</italic>) (A, Texas red) and nonmuscle β-actin (B, FITC) were detected by immunocytochemistry as in Methods. In (C and D) are shown overlays, revealing co-localization of actins (C: bar = 10 microns; D: bar = 5 microns). Identical results were obtained with cells after either form of liver injury, and images are representative of over 20 others. In (E), stellate cells were isolated from normal livers or 8 days after bile duct ligation or 10 doses of carbon tetrachloride and immediately subjected to immunoblotting as in Methods. Representative immunoblots shown depict duplicate, identical, samples probed for each <italic>Acta2</italic> and anti-cytoplasmic β actin (7.5 µg total protein). In (F), specific bands were scanned, quantitated and expressed graphically (n = 4 for each model of injury, *p&lt;0.001 compared to normal). In (G), stellate cells from normal or injured livers were immediately lysed and equal amounts (40 µg) of cellular proteins were subjected to 2-D gel electrophoresis as in Methods. Notably, we also made a theoretical estimation of isoactin PIs by in silico analysis of each actin isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Bjellqvist1">[67]</xref>(<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077166.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>)). Representative examples (of greater than 20 separate experiments) reveal specific actin isoforms, and after injury (bile duct ligation), new expression of an α isoform (two-D gels are shown in the standard international format with pI ranging from acidic to basic, left to right). In (H), a representative immunoblot of similarly prepared protein samples after 2-D gel electrophoresis is shown (200 µg total protein each). As described in Methods, nitrocellulose membranes were probed sequentially with anti-cytoplasmic β-actin then anti-<italic>Acta2</italic> (using the same ECL detection method each time, thus accounting for repeat detection of the β-actin band).

<p>Given previous reports of the dramatic upregulation of <italic>Acta2</italic> after liver injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Rockey1">[22]</xref>, we examined regulation of this and other actin isoforms in this process. In individual stellate cells isolated immediately after liver injury, actin isoforms localized predominantly to stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g001"><bold>Figure 1A–D</bold></xref>), although small amounts of both <italic>Acta2</italic> and cytoplasmic β-actin isoforms were found at leading edges of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g001"><bold>Figure 1C, D</bold></xref>). We further investigated isoactins in stellate cells by immunoblotting and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g001"><bold>Figure 1E–H</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077166.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). Levels of cytoplasmic β-actin did not appear to change after activation while levels of <italic>Acta2</italic> increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g001"><bold>Figure 1E, F</bold></xref>). By 2-D gel electrophoresis, signals for cytoplasmic β and γ actin remained essentially unchanged after liver injury, while the signal corresponding to α actin appeared <italic>de novo</italic> after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g001"><bold>Figure 1E–H</bold></xref>). Immunoblotting of isoactins after 2-D gel electrophoresis with actin isoform specific antibodies verified that the signal corresponding to β actin was nonmuscle cytoplasmic β-actin and that corresponding to α actin was <italic>Acta2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g001"><bold>Figure 1H</bold></xref>). In aggregate, the data demonstrate that injury and wounding did not induce changes in cytoplasmic isoactins, but led to a significant increase in <italic>Acta2</italic> expression.</p>

<title>Myofibroblast motility and contraction are enhanced during hepatic wounding</title>
<p>Stellate cells were isolated and subjected to linear scratch wounding assays as in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Cells isolated from normal animals remained relatively compact and had typical prominent retinoid inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>); note that the abundant retinoid droplets remain in a highly compact fashion after early isolation, and cause the cells to take on a refractile appearance when viewed by phase contrast microscopy. Cells from normal livers rarely entered the scratched area - even 48 hours later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). In contrast, cells from injured livers appeared activated, and myofibroblastic - containing less retinoid, and being markedly spread, were highly motile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g002"><bold>Figure 2B–D</bold></xref>). Not only did activated cells move into the scratch in a more rapidly than those from normal livers, but migration of cells &gt;50 µm was identified only in cells isolated from injured livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>); quantitation of cell movement by image analysis further established the enhanced motility of cells from injured livers compared to normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g002"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>). Time-lapse video microscopy demonstrated that stellate cells from injured livers at the leading edge of the scratched area migrated at a rate of 4–7 µm per hour, while those from normal livers were essentially immobile over the initial 24 hours.</p>

<title>Enhanced stellate cell motility after liver wounding.</title>
<p>Stellate cells isolated from normal and injured livers were isolated, plated at equal density and allowed to adhere in culture overnight. A linear scratch was applied to the monolayer and cell motility was assessed by phase contrast microscopy (A–B) and by quantitative analysis of cell movement into the scratch-wounded area (C–D). Photomicrographs shown in (A) and (B) depict examples of cells from normal liver (A) and after carbon tetrachloride injury (B) as in Methods; photomicrographs were taken after 24 hours and are representative of 15 different experiments (bar = 60 microns). In (C), cells entering the wounded area of the monolayer over 24 hours were counted (i.e., the number of cells moving the specified distances into the wounded area per high powered field were quantitated as in Methods, n = 6 for each model of injury). In (D), the area in the scratch remaining unoccupied by cells was quantitated (in each experiment, 10 random fields were assessed; the area remaining free of cells was measured by image analysis as in Methods, single data points were created for each experiment and were used to generate quantitative data; n = 6 for each model of injury). For (C) and (D), *p&lt;0.001 compared to normal. Abbreviations: CCl<sub>4</sub> - carbon tetrachloride.</p>

<p>To further test cell motility, migration of stellate cells was assessed using track etched polyethylene terphthalate membranes containing 8 µm pores. Again, cells isolated from normal livers largely remained compact, evidenced by the darkly stained nuclei and sparse cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>); these cells exhibited almost no trans-membrane motility over 12 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g003"><bold>Figure 3A, B, E</bold></xref>), while cells from injured livers spread rapidly and readily migrated across membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g003"><bold>Figure 3C–E</bold></xref>). Twenty-four hours after isolation, 30.3% and 20.1% of cells from livers wounded with carbon tetrachloride and by bile duct ligation, respectively, migrated through membrane pores, while we could identify almost no cells isolated from normal livers migrating through membrane pores.</p>

<title>Enhanced migration and contraction of stellate cells after liver injury.</title>
<p>Cells from normal and injured livers were isolated as in Methods and allowed to adhere on top of polyethylene terphthalate membranes containing 8 µm pores. Cells were plated in serum free medium; serum containing medium was placed in the bottom of transwell chambers. After 12 hours, membranes were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for 30 minutes with 0.4% hematoxylin. In (A) and (B) are shown representative examples of cells from normal liver and in (C) and (D) are shown cells from injured liver (carbon tetrachloride). Panel (A) shows an exposure focused on the top of the membrane, (B) depicts the same field, but focused on the bottom of the membrane. In (A), many cells remain compact and therefore are darkly stained, the small arrows point to cells that have begun to spread on the top of the membrane. In (B), no cells have passed through the membrane and therefore none are in focus. In (C) and (D) virtually all cells have spread markedly, the small arrows in (C) point to cells that have spread on the top of the membrane. In (D), the larger arrows point to cells that have migrated through the membrane (bar = 50 microns). In (E), the number of cells migrating to the bottom of the membrane were quantitated and expressed as a proportion of all cells plated (n = 4 for each model of injury, *p&lt;0.001 vs. control (normal cells)). In (F), stellate cells from normal and injured livers were isolated and allowed to adhere on top of collagen lattices. After adherence for 18 hours, serum free conditions were introduced and medium containing endothelin-1 (2 nM) was added. Lattices were dislodged and contraction after 4 hours is shown (n = 4 for each injury model, *p&lt;0.001 vs. control (normal cells)).

<p>We next examined cellular contractility after hepatic wounding. Again, cells early after isolation were studied, prior to culture-induced changes or potential artifact, so as to allow a direct analysis of their <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype. Stellate cells from normal livers did not contract in response to serum (not shown) or endothelin-1 while those after injury and activation were highly contractile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g003"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Inhibition of Acta2 expression impairs cell motility and contractility</title>
<p>The parallel upregulation of <italic>Acta2</italic> and increase in stellate cell motility and contractility during activation suggested a specific functional role for <italic>Acta2</italic> in these processes. Thus, to specifically address the role of <italic>Acta2</italic> in motility and contractility, we used 2 different approaches. First, we utilized a well characterized primary cell culture model system in which stellate cells isolated from normal livers are placed on plastic or glass substratum and in the presence of serum, subsequently undergo spontaneous activation, transforming into myofibroblasts. Secondly, we examined cell motility of mouse embryo fibroblasts and stellate cells that did not express <italic>Acta2</italic>.</p>

In this model system, we continuously exposed stellate cells to <italic>Acta2</italic> antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos). Multiple antisense oligos coding for sequences in different portions of the <italic>Acta2</italic> gene were examined, but we focused on the 3′ untranslated (UT) region for 2 reasons. First, this portion of the gene is the least well conserved among the actins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-McHugh1">[3]</xref> and targeting it would in theory be most specific. Secondly, previous reports have pointed to this region as selective for the actins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-RonnovJessen1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Kislauskis1">[29]</xref>. Sequences in the 3′ UT region had the most potent inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>); other sequences tested did not have significant inhibitory effects. Further, <italic>Acta2</italic> 3′UT #1 antisense oligos exhibited a dose-response effect on <italic>Acta2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>). Because the actin family is highly conserved, we examined whether 3′UT #1 antisense oligos had effects on cytoplasmic β-actin in stellate cells; immunoblot analysis revealed no effects of this antisense oligo on cytoplasmic β-actin. Further, immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that <italic>Acta2</italic> sense oligos had no effect on <italic>Acta2</italic> or cytoplasmic β-actin. Additionally, we found no effect of the <italic>Acta2</italic> antisense oligos on cytoplasmic β or γ actin mRNA or protein expression.</p>

<title><italic>Acta2</italic> antisense oligodeoxynucleotides inhibit <italic>Acta2</italic> expression, stellate cell contractility, and stellate cell motility.</title>
<p>Stellate cells were isolated from normal rat livers; after 24 hours, oligonucleotides were transfected as in Methods (the transfection mix containing oligonucleotides was replaced every 48 hours). Five days later, cells were harvested and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting to detect <italic>Acta2</italic>. In (A), different oligonucleotides (10 µM) were tested; specific <italic>Acta2</italic> bands were scanned, quantitated and expressed graphically (n = 3, * p&lt;0.01). In (B), the effect of different concentrations of sense and antisense oligonucleotides (the <italic>Acta2</italic> 3′UT #1 sequence) was examined. The upper portion of the figure depicts a representative immunoblot, and the graph below depicts scanned and quantitated data (n = 3, * p&lt;0.01). Immunoblots with anti-cytoplasmic β-actin revealed no change in <italic>Acta2</italic> expression (not shown). In (C), cells as above were placed on collagen lattices; oligonucleotides were added 24 hours later (all at 10 µM) and replaced at day 3 and 5 in culture. Serum free conditions were introduced and medium containing serum (10% horse/10% calf) was added to induce contraction. Lattices were dislodged from their plastic substrata and gel contraction was measured (contraction after 4 hours is shown, n = 4, *p&lt;0.01 compared to lattices exposed to sense oligonucleotides). Cells exposed to only serum free or serum containing medium served as negative and positive controls, respectively. In (D–H), stellate cells from normal livers were isolated and allowed to undergo culture induced activation. Twenty-four hours after isolation, cells were transfected with oligodeoxynucleotides as in Methods. Seventy-two hours later, a linear scratch was applied to the cell monolayer. In (D), cells exposed to 3′UT #1 sense oligonucleotides (10 µM) are shown; in (E) cells exposed to 3′UT #1 antisense oligonucleotides (10 µM) are shown (representative images 24 hours after scratch wounding are shown) (bar = 50 microns). In (F), the number of cells per high-powered field entering the wounded area of the monolayer were counted and quantitated as in Methods (n = 6, *p&lt;0.01 vs. cells exposed to sense oligonucleotides). In (G), the area in the wound remaining unoccupied by cells was quantitated by image analysis as in Methods (n = 6, *p&lt;0.01 vs. cells exposed to sense oligonucleotides). In (H), the effect of <italic>Acta2</italic> antisense oligodeoxynucleotides on stellate cell motility was assessed by measuring migration of stellate cells through polyethylene terphthalate membranes containing 8 µm pores as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g002">Figure 2</xref> (n = 3, *p&lt;0.01 vs. to sense).

<p>We next examined the effect of 3′UT #1 antisense oligos on stellate cell contractility and motility. Antisense oligos directed at the 3′ UT areas significantly reduced stellate cell contraction, while controls had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>). In the <italic>in vitro</italic> scratch wounding assay system, 3′UT #1 sense oligodeoxynucleotides had no effect on cell motility compared to controls in which no oligodeoxynucleotides were added while antisense oligodeoxynucleotides significantly reduced stellate cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g005"><bold>Figure 5D–G</bold></xref>). Inhibition of <italic>Acta2</italic> also reduced the proportion of cells migrating through polyethylene terphthalate membranes by 43% compared to sense oligos, while migration of cells exposed to sense oligos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g005"><bold>Figure 5H</bold></xref>), and all appropriate controls was not affected. Importantly, all cells migrating through the polyethylene terphthalate membrane expressed <italic>Acta2</italic>, whether exposed to sense or antisense oligos (n = 4 for each), further supporting a link between <italic>Acta2</italic> and cell motility.</p>
<p>Immunocytochemical studies further revealed that <italic>Acta2</italic> 3′UT #1 antisense oligos inhibited both <italic>Acta2</italic> expression and motility while sense oligos had no effect (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077166.s002">Figure S2A</xref>–F</bold>). Interestingly, cells migrating into the scratch wound exhibited the highest relative levels of <italic>Acta2</italic> expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077166.s002">Figure S2F</xref></bold>). To help quantitate the relative abundance of each specific isoform after exposure to oligos, we measured β-actin and <italic>Acta2</italic> fluorescence intensity. Although β-actin intensity did not change after exposure to antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, that for <italic>Acta2</italic> decreased several-fold.</p>
<p>To further explore the role of <italic>Acta2</italic> in cell motility, we also examined cells from <italic>Acta2</italic> deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Schildmeyer1">[30]</xref>. Actin isoform expression in these cells was studied extensively. We did not identify significant changes in the heterologous actins – cytoplasmic β-actin, cytoplasmic γ-actin, smooth muscle γ and α actin, cardiac α actin, or skeletal α actin - in <italic>Acta2</italic> deficient cells at the mRNA or protein level compared to wild type cells. We evaluated cell motility in <italic>Acta2</italic> deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and in stellate cells isolated from these mice. Functional assays of <italic>Acta2</italic> deficient MEFs revealed that they exhibited reduced motility compared to wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g006"><bold>Figure 6A–C</bold></xref>); we also performed studies of mouse stellate cell motility and found that their motility phenotype was identical to MEFs; thus, due to the technical difficultly in obtaining large numbers of stellate cells and since the profiles of activated stellate cells and MEFs were identical, we performed multiple replicate functional studies in the latter only. Additionally, MEFs lacking <italic>Acta2</italic> also exhibited a reduced contraction phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g006"><bold>Figure 6D</bold></xref>). Of note, <italic>Acta2</italic> +/+ MEFs grown in the presence of 10% FBS expressed <italic>Acta2</italic> in stress fibers, while as expected, −/− MEFs did not, and both cell types expressed cytoplasmic β-actin, again in stress fibers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We show here that <italic>in vivo</italic> stellate cell activation after liver wounding is associated with a striking increase in cellular motility and contractility; this functional transition parallels an increase in expression of <italic>Acta2</italic>, typical of myofibroblasts. Additionally, inhibition of <italic>Acta2</italic> expression (with many different methods) reduced both stellate cell motility and contractility.</p>
<p>Our data raise important issues regarding actin isoform structure and function. On one hand, we have shown that <italic>Acta2</italic> is important in cellular contractility as well as motility, functions that have often been attributed to nonmuscle isoforms. Despite the normal expression of non-muscle actins, we have shown that a lack of <italic>Acta2</italic> significantly impairs cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g002"><bold>Figures 2</bold></xref><bold>–</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g004"><bold>4</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g006"><bold>6</bold></xref>), raising the possibility of functional specificity. Further, contraction in <italic>Acta2</italic> null cells is compromised, consistent with previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-KatoMinoura1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Weymouth1">[41]</xref>. On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>Acta2</italic> supports motility and contractility by contributing to the total actin pool. Additionally, the finding that <italic>Acta2</italic> null cells retained some measure of contractility and motility suggests functional redundancy for actin, which is not surprising given the remarkable sequence conservation among the actin isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Herman1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Rubenstein1">[10]</xref>. An abundance of cell-based and whole organism-based literature support the existence of each isoactin functional specificity and redundancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-KatoMinoura1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Weymouth1">[41]</xref>. Therefore, based on these previous data, and our own work, we conclude that a complex interplay of isoactin expression and dynamics at the cellular level is likely to determine the functional fate of each actin.</p>
<p>Previous reports examining <italic>Acta2</italic> and general cellular contractility are in agreement with our findings while one studying cellular motility is not. It was shown that inhibition of <italic>Acta2</italic> expression reduced cell force generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Hinz1">[42]</xref> and gingival fibroblast mediated collagen gel contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Arora1">[43]</xref>, consistent with our findings and also supporting the position that <italic>Acta2</italic> functions as a contractile protein. In another report, it was suggested that <italic>Acta2</italic> functions as a “brake” for motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-RonnovJessen1">[28]</xref>. In this study, fibroblasts derived from clonal expansion of cell lines expressing <italic>Acta2</italic> were less motile than lines lacking <italic>Acta2</italic>. However, we found upregulation of <italic>Acta2</italic> to be associated with enhanced motility and that deletion of <italic>Acta2</italic> null fibroblasts led to reduced motility compared to wild type cells expressing increased amounts of <italic>Acta2</italic>. Although the previous study and our own would appear to be paradoxical, several points merit emphasis. First, our study characterized <italic>Acta2</italic> in cells isolated directly from a normal or injured organ; their behavior is more likely to mimic that occurring <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, in the previous study, cloned and highly selected fibroblast cell lines were examined. Although changes in <italic>Acta2</italic> expression were well characterized, it is unknown whether changes in expression of other proteins that could affect cell motility were introduced during clonal expansion.</p>
<p>Our data are consistent with other data in stellate cells that have emphasized a prominent motility phenotype specifically in this cell type. In one study, migration of stellate cells increased after injury, but deletion of moesin significantly reduced cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Okayama1">[44]</xref>. In another study, it was likewise shown that activated stellate cells were motile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Liu1">[45]</xref>, and additionally that inhibition of the myosin II ATPase with blebbistatin, stimulated stellate cell migration. Finally, it was demonstrated that a microtubule-destabilizing protein found in neurons, SCG10, was upregulated in stellate cells after injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Paradis1">[46]</xref>, highlighting a potential mechanism for enhanced stellate cell migration after liver injury.</p>
<p>Understanding the function of specific cytoskeletal proteins is inherently difficult because collective cytoskeletal behavior depends on the complex arrangement and interaction of many components, all of which ultimately play a role. This is particularly relevant in our system since stellate cells undergo activation after injury, and the activation process almost certainly modifies multiple elements of the cytoskeleton. Thus, while we believe that <italic>Acta2</italic> is important in stellate cell contraction and motility, other factors are also likely to be critical. For example, we have found that α-actinin, an actin linking protein, is highly expressed in stellate cells during activation; further, it has been shown that myosin heavy chains, which serve as motors for motility, are also present in activated stellate cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Mayer1">[47]</xref>. In addition, cell motility and contractility are linked with multiple molecular pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Paradis1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Pollard1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Amin1">[51]</xref>. We have previously demonstrated increases in Rho associated kinase (ROCK) and ROCK activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Shafiei1">[52]</xref> and other signaling cascades after activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Shafiei1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Khimji1">[53]</xref>, which are involved in organizing the actin cytoskeleton needed for cell contraction and motility. Here, we have further demonstrated that <italic>Acta2</italic>, and presumably the actin cytoskeleton, is important in regulation of Erk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g007"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>). It is commonly accepted that Erk plays a critical role in cell motility and contraction through phosphorylation of FAK, calpain-2, paxillin, MLCK, and other signaling partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Klemke1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Huang1">[54]</xref>. Thus, our data suggest that reduced motility and contractility in <italic>Acta2</italic> deficient stellate cells appears at least in part to be due to reduced Erk activity. Interestingly, <italic>Acta2</italic> did not appear to be a prominent regulator of stellate cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077166-g007"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>). We speculate that these complex systems, including interaction of signaling partners, extracellular matrix binding proteins (i.e. integrins), turnover of focal adhesions, as well as the actin cytoskeleton are all likely to be important in mediating stellate cell migration and motility during wound healing.</p>
<p>In summary, wound healing is a dynamic process in which cell migration and contraction are important components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Gates1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Santos1">[56]</xref>. Myofibroblasts, which share the unique property that they express <italic>Acta2</italic> during the wounding response, appear to be central to the process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Mitchell1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Johnson1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Darby1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077166-Kuhn1">[60]</xref>. Further, our findings suggest that <italic>Acta2</italic> is critical for both cell motility and contractility, and thus plays an important role in myofibroblast function.</p>

A mixture of 8 parts Vitrogen (Celltrix Corp.), 1 part 10x MEM (Gibco BRL) and 1 part 0.2 M HEPES was added to each culture well, and allowed to gel. Cells isolated from normal or injured livers were layered on top of the collagen lattice and cultured for a specified time, after which mediators were added to induce contraction and lattices were detached by gentle circumferential dislodgment using a 200 µL micro-pipet tip. Contraction was monitored electronically as the change in lattice area over time.</p>

<title>Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, transfection</title>
<p>Hepatic stellate cells were isolated and cultured as above. Transfection of antisense or sense phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides (oligos, Operon Technologies, Inc.,) was performed after cell attachment with lipofectin (Gibco BRL) or FuGENE/mL (Roche Diagnostics Co.) as per the manufacturers specifications. The oligo and transfection mix was replaced every 48 hours. Oligos were used at concentrations of 100 nM, 1 µM, or 10 µM. Antisense phosphorothioate oligos were directed at the translation start region (+16 to +30; <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CAG-AGC-TGT-GCT-GTC-3′</named-content>), the mid portion of the gene in the coding region (+685 to +699, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-AGG-AGC-AGT-GGC-CAT-3′</named-content>), and the 3′ untranslated region (+1204 to +1218; <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TCC-ACA-AAA-CAT-TCA-3′</named-content>, termed 3′UT #1, and +1186 to 1205; <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CAC-AGT-TGT-GTG-CTA-GAG-AC-3′</named-content>, termed 3′UT #2).

In brief, embryos from heterozygote crosses were isolated at day 12–13 gestation, and each embryo was minced in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco BRL). Cells were dispersed by shaking at 4°C for 2 hours, and then plated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Both from Gibco BRL). Cells were trypsinized and passed after 24 hours, and all experiments performed at passage 2–6.</p>
