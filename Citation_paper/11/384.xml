        <p>Phosphorylation of actin-binding proteins plays a pivotal role in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton to regulate cell migration. Palladin is an actin-binding protein that is phosphorylated by growth factor stimulation; however, the identity of the involved protein kinases remains elusive. In this study, we report that palladin is a novel substrate of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Suppression of ERK activation by a chemical inhibitor reduced palladin phosphorylation, and expression of active MEK alone was sufficient for phosphorylation. In addition, an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay demonstrated direct palladin phosphorylation by ERK. We found that Ser77 and Ser197 are essential residues for phosphorylation. Although the phosphorylation of these residues was not required for actin cytoskeletal organization, we found that expression of non-phosphorylated palladin enhanced cell migration. Finally, we show that phosphorylation inhibits the palladin association with Abl tyrosine kinase. Taken together, our results indicate that palladin phosphorylation by ERK has an anti-migratory function, possibly by modulating interactions with molecules that regulate cell migration.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The actin cytoskeleton plays pivotal roles for many fundamental processes, such as cell migration and cell division. These processes are accompanied with dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, which is regulated by various actin-binding proteins. Extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and integrin engagement activate protein kinases, including MAPK, Src and AKT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Porter1">[1]</xref>. These kinases phosphorylate actin-binding proteins to control rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Otey1">[2]</xref>. Identification of the actin-binding proteins that are phosphorylated by these kinases is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which extracellular stimuli regulate cell migration and shape changes.</p>
      <p>Palladin, myotilin and myopalladin are a family of closely related actin-binding proteins that are expressed in a variety of muscle and non-muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Otey1">[2]</xref>. Among these proteins, palladin is the most abundantly expressed molecule in diverse tissues and cell lines. There are three major isoforms of palladin with apparent molecular masses of 90, 140 and 200 kDa that have proline-rich sequences and multiple IgC2 (immunoglobulin C2- type) domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Goicoechea1">[3]</xref>. Palladin is localized on actin-based subcellular structures, e.g., stress fibers, focal adhesions and podosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Mykkanen1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Goicoechea3">[7]</xref>. Palladin has a number of associating proteins, including alpha-actinin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Ronty1">[8]</xref>, CLP36 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Maeda1">[9]</xref> and other molecules that might affect actin organization. This implies palladin may function as a scaffolding molecule to recruit proteins to the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Goicoechea2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Ronty2">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Ronty3">[14]</xref>. In addition, palladin directly associates with F-actin to induce the bundling of actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Dixon1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Accumulating evidence has shown that palladin is essential for remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton to control cell migration and invasion. Suppression of palladin expression in fibroblasts by antisense transfections results in a disruption of actin cytoskeletal organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Parast1">[5]</xref>. In addition, fibroblasts derived from palladin-deficient mice show disruptions in cell motility, adhesion, and actin organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Liu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Luo1">[17]</xref>. Conversely, palladin overexpression in Cos7 cells and astrocytes increases the number and size of actin bundles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Rachlin1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Boukhelifa3">[18]</xref>. Palladin is also required for the invasion of breast cancer cells. Palladin is highly expressed in invasive breast cancer cells, and suppression of palladin expression reduces cell invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Goicoechea3">[7]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that AKT1, which is a protein kinase essential for cell survival and cancer progression, phosphorylates palladin to regulate actin bundling and cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Chin1">[19]</xref>. Although these studies indicate an essential role for palladin in cell migration and invasion, the precise mechanisms still remain unclear.</p>
      <p>Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is one of the essential molecules for the regulation of diverse cellular events including proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Huang1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Johnson1">[21]</xref>. ERK is activated in response to various extracellular stimuli through the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway and then translocates into the nucleus to phosphorylate transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Seger1">[22]</xref>. Activated ERK also translocates to focal adhesions to regulate the formation of actin filaments and focal adhesions required for cell morphogenesis and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Fincham1">[23]</xref>. Previous studies have demonstrated that ERK phosphorylates proteins, e.g., myosin light chain kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Nguyen1">[24]</xref>, vinexin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Mitsushima1">[25]</xref>, paxillin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Liu2">[26]</xref>, focal adhesion kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-HungerGlaser1">[27]</xref>, Eplin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Han1">[28]</xref> and actopaxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Clarke1">[29]</xref>, to regulate cell migration.</p>
      <p>Palladin is a known phosphoprotein, but the identities of the protein kinases that are responsible for its phosphorylation remain uncertain. In this study, we show evidence that palladin is a novel ERK substrate. In addition, we show that palladin phosphorylation by ERK is involved in cell migration and an association with Abl tyrosine kinase.</p>

To produce 293T/HA-wt cells, we cloned full-length palladin (amino acids 1–772) cDNA into a pQCXIP retrovirus vector with an N-terminal 4× HA-tag (Clontech). HEK 293T cells were infected with the recombinant virus and selected with 1 µg/ml puromycin.</p>

        <title>Palladin is phosphorylated by growth factor stimulation</title>
        <p>Western blot analysis with a polyclonal palladin antibody revealed a mobility shift of palladin in cells stimulated with EGF and PDGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), which is consistent with a previous report by Goicoechea <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Goicoechea2">[6]</xref>. We also examined the mobility shift of exogenously expressed palladin. Full-length palladin was amplified by PCR using cDNA clone KIAA0992 and cloned into an N-terminally 4× HA-tagged pQCXIP retrovirus vector. We established 293T cells that constitutively expressed HA-tagged palladin (293T/HA-wt) by retrovirus infection and observed the clear appearance of a slower migrating form of HA-palladin by EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). To determine if the mobility shift was due to phosphorylation, we used alkaline phosphatase. Palladin was immunoprecipitated from the lysates of EGF-treated MCF10A or 293T/HA-wt cells and then treated with alkaline phosphatase. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, alkaline phosphatase treatment eliminated the mobility shift of both endogenous and exogenous palladin. This mobility shift is often observed after the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues followed by proline. To confirm the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues of palladin, we used an anti-MPM2 antibody that recognizes a phosphorylated epitope (Ser/Thr)-Pro. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, only a mobility-shifted form of palladin was detected by the anti-MPM2 antibody. Anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody did not react with palladin in EGF-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). These results indicate that palladin is phosphorylated at serine or threonine in response to growth factor stimulation.</p>

        <title>MEK/ERK is responsible for palladin phosphorylation</title>
        <p>To determine which protein kinases are essential for phosphorylation, we used a MEK inhibitor (U0126) and a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002). Serum-starved cells were incubated with U0126 (5 µM) or LY294002 (10 µM) for 1 h and stimulated with EGF (20 ng/ml) for 5 min. Addition of U0126 or LY294002 clearly suppressed activation of ERK or AKT, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Although the mobility shift was clearly visible in the presence of LY294002, the addition of U0126 significantly diminished the palladin gel shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We also used HeLa cells that mainly expressed 140 kDa form of palladin. Mobility shift of 140 kDa form of palladin was inhibited by U0126 treatment as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

        <title>N-terminal palladin serine residues are phosphorylated</title>
        <p>To determine which residues were phosphorylated by the EGF treatment, we deleted the N-terminus of palladin and examined its gel shift. This palladin sequence has two proline-rich regions between amino acids 65–100 and 180–220. The Δ102 and Δ219 deletions are missing the first or both proline rich regions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). We transiently expressed Myc-tagged full-length, Δ102 or Δ219 palladin in Vero cells and examined mobility shifts by EGF stimulation. Although a slower migrating form of Δ102 appeared due to EGF stimulation, Δ219 did not show any mobility shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). To narrow down the phosphorylated region, we created Δ197 and Δ190, i.e., amino acids 1–197 and 1–190 were deleted, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, a mobility shift was only observed for Δ190 and not for Δ197. There is only one serine residue (Ser197) in this region. Therefore, we mutated this residue to glycine (S197G) in Δ190 and examined the gel shift. EGF treatment did not induce a Δ190-S197G mobility shift, which suggested that Ser197 is phosphorylated in response to EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

        <p>To investigate whether there are other residues that are phosphorylated after EGF stimulation, we substituted Ser197 in full-length and Δ102 palladin to glycine (FL-S197G and Δ102-S197G). FL-S197G, but not Δ102-S197G, showed a mobility shift due to EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), which suggested there are other phosphorylated residues in the N-terminal region. Deletion of 44 amino acids in the N-terminus did not eliminate the palladin gel shift in the S197G mutant (Δ44-S197G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). We used ScanSite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Obenauer1">[34]</xref> to search for candidate residues for phosphorylation between residues 45–102 and found that Ser77 was most likely to be phosphorylated by ERK. Substitution of both Ser77 and Ser197 in Δ44-palladin (Δ44-S77.197G) clearly reduced the mobility shift compared to Δ44-S197G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

        <title>Palladin phosphorylation by ERK regulates cell migration</title>
        <p>ERK activation regulates various physiological functions, including cell migration. To investigate whether palladin phosphorylation by ERK regulates cell migration, we established cell lines that expressed wild-type or mutant palladin. We first established MDA-MB-231 cells that constitutively expressed GFP, GFP-wt (GFP-tagged full-length palladin) and GFP-S77.197G (GFP-tagged full-length S77.197G palladin) using retroviruses. We then infected a retrovirus that encoded an shRNA for luciferase into GFP-expressing cells, and an shRNA for palladin into GFP, GFP-palladin and GFP-S77.197G-expressing cells. These four cell lines were designated shLuc/GFP, shPal/GFP, shPal/GFP-wt and shPal/GFP-S77.197G, respectively. Expression of endogenous palladin was significantly suppressed in shPal/GFP, shPal/GFP-wt and shPal/GFP-S77.197G cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029338.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Both shPal/GFP-wt and shPal/GFP-S77.197G cells expressed levels of exogenous palladin comparatively higher than endogenous palladin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029338.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, silencing of palladin expression suppressed actin stress fiber formation. Expression of either wild-type or mutant palladin recovered stress fiber formation similar to shLuc/GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Previous studies have shown that palladin overexpression induced formation of thick actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Rachlin1">[11]</xref>. To address whether ERK phosphorylation is required for this process, we transiently overexpressed wild-type or mutant palladin in Cos7 cells and observed stress fiber formation. Expression of both wild type and mutant palladin resulted in the production of thick actin stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), suggesting that ERK-mediated palladin phosphorylation is not essential for the organization of stress fibers.</p>

We stimulated shPal/GFP-wt and shPal/GFP-S77.197G cells with EGF and fixed 5 min later to immunostain for actin cytoskeleton. Production of lamellipodia and disruption of stress fiber upon EGF stimulation was observed in these cells. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029338.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).

Consistent with the MDA-MB-231 cells, MCF10A cells that expressed non-phosphorylated palladin showed enhanced migration compared to wild-type palladin expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). These results suggest that palladin phosphorylation by ERK has an anti-migratory function in these cell lines.</p>
        <p>Small GTPases are central players for the regulation of cell migration. We examined whether activation of Rac and Cdc42 is related to the phosphorylation status of palladin. ShPal/GFP-wt and shPal/GFP-S77.197G cells were serum-starved and stimulated with EGF, and then active Rac and Cdc42 was affinity precipitated by GST-fused PAK-PBD. We found that both Rac and Cdc42 were similarly activated in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>), indicating that activation of Rac and Cdc42 in response to EGF is independent of the phosphorylation of palladin by ERK. The result suggests that ERK-mediated phosphorylation of palladin utilizes different pathways other than Rac and Cdc42 to control cell migration.</p>

        <title>Palladin phosphorylation affects association with Abl</title>
        <p>To determine the molecular mechanism by which palladin phosphorylation regulates cell migration, we tested if phosphorylation affects palladin interactions with other molecules. Association of the proline rich region and the SH3 domain is essential for the signal transduction in response to extracellular stimuli. Since the phosphorylated serines are localized in the proline-rich regions, we speculated that the phosphorylation may affect association of palladin with SH3 domain. We created GST-fused SH3 for Abl and ArgBP2 and performed pull-down assays. Both proteins are known to regulate cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-SosseyAlaoui1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Taieb1">[36]</xref>, and a previous study has shown the association of palladin with the ArgBP2 SH3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Ronty3">[14]</xref>. 293T/HA-wt cells were treated with or without EGF, and cell lysates were mixed with GST-fused proteins bound to glutathione beads. Interacting proteins were affinity precipitated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, the palladin interaction with the Abl SH3, but not the ArgBP2 SH3, was significantly reduced by phosphorylation. We also examined the association of palladin with other known interacting proteins, e.g. profilin, alpha-actinin and CLP36, but phosphorylation did not affect these interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029338.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). If the phosphorylations of Ser77 and Ser197 were responsible for the inhibition of this interaction, the Abl SH3 would bind to S77.197G-palladin derived from EGF-treated cells. We first examined whether the substitution of Ser77 and Ser197 would affect the interaction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, the Abl GST-SH3 affinity precipitated HA-Ser77.197G-palladin to a level similar to wild-type palladin. We then examined the interaction of the Abl SH3 and mutant palladin in EGF-treated or non-treated cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, HA-Ser77.197G-palladin in either EGF-treated or non-treated cells similarly associated with the Abl SH3.</p>

            <p>(A) Serum-starved 293T/HA-wt cells were either stimulated or non-stimulated with EGF for 5 min, and cell lysates were affinity precipitated with the indicated recombinant proteins (SH3-Abl; aa66–118, SH-ArgBP2; aa432–666). Lower panels show the Coomassie blue staining of recombinant proteins. (B) HEK 293T cells were transfected with either HA-tagged palladin (HA-wt) or HA-tagged S77.197G palladin (HA-S77.197G). Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed and affinity precipitated with GST-SH3-Abl protein bound to glutathione agarose. Immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-HA antibody. Lower panel shows the Coomassie blue staining of the GST-SH3 Abl protein. (C) Serum-starved 293T/HA-S77.197G cells were either stimulated or non-stimulated with EGF for 5 min, and cell lysates were affinity precipitated with GST-SH3-Abl protein bound to glutathione agarose.

The lysates were blotted with anti-Abl or anti-palladin antibody. The arrow indicates Abl and the arrowheads indicate palladin. The band around 140 kDa is an alternative form of palladin. (E) MDA-MB-231 cells were serum-starved and stimulated with or without EGF and lysed for immunopreciptation. The lyates were blotted with anti-Abl and anti-palladin antibodies. The graph shows the relative band intensity of immunoprecipitated Abl from three independent experiments. (F) Migration of shPal/GFP-wt and shPal/GFP-S77.197G cells (MDA-MB-231) was examined in the presence of indicated concentrations of STI571.

(G) shPal/GFP-wt and shPal/GFP-S77.197G cells (MDA-MB-231) were transfected with either luciferase (Luc) or Abl siRNA and 48 h later, cell migration was examined. Relative ratio of migrated cells was normalized by the number of migrating shPal/GFP-wt cells transfected with Luc siRNA. Three independent experiments were performed and the data are shown mean ±SD (*P&lt;0.01). Expression of Abl after siRNA transfection was examined by immunoblot.

        <p>We next tested if Abl was associated with palladin in cells. Palladin was immunopreciptiated from lysates of MDA-MB-231 cells and the immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-Abl antibody by immunoblotting. Abl was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-palladin antibody, but not by control antibody, indicating the interaction of both proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). We then examined the interaction after EGF stimulation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g007">figure 7E</xref>, association of Abl with palladin was reduced by EGF stimulation. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Ser77 and Ser197 by ERK regulates the palladin interaction with the Abl SH3.</p>
        <p>Finally, we examined whether Abl was essential for cell migration. Both shPal/GFP-wt and shPal/GFP-S77.197G were treated with an Abl kinase inhibitor, STI571, and the migration was examined. We found that addition of STI571 suppressed migration of both cells in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g007">Fig. 7F</xref>). Furthermore, silencing of Abl by siRNA transfection similarly suppressed cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g007">Fig. 7G</xref>). These results indicate a possible involvement of palladin-Abl association for EGF-mediated cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029338-g007">Fig. 7H</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Since its discovery in 2000, palladin has been known as a phosphoprotein because its slower migrating form was often observed by western blotting. However, the identities of the protein kinases that phosphorylate palladin have remained elusive. A recent study has shown that AKT1 phosphorylates palladin to modulate its activity in bundling actin stress fibers and to inhibit cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Chin1">[19]</xref>. In this report, we showed evidence that palladin is also phosphorylated by ERK in response to growth factor stimulation. Addition of MEK inhibitor clearly suppressed palladin phosphorylation upon EGF treatment. In addition, expression of active MEK alone was sufficient to phosphorylate palladin. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays demonstrated direct palladin phosphorylation by active ERK. These results clearly show that palladin is a novel substrate of ERK. By making deletion constructs and point mutations, we identified Ser77 and Ser197 as residues phosphorylated by ERK. Both serine residues are conserved in the previously identified mouse palladin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Parast1">[5]</xref>. Mobility shifts due to EGF treatment were clearly suppressed by the substitution of both serine residues. <italic>In vitro</italic> kinase assays also demonstrated a significant reduction of palladin phosphorylation after the substitution of both residues. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that there are other residues that could be phosphorylated by ERK because minor phosphorylation was observed by an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay, our results clearly show that Ser77 and Ser197 are phosphorylated by ERK.</p>
      <p>Palladin is known as a critical factor in regulating actin cytoskeletal organization and cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Otey1">[2]</xref>. Consistent with previous findings, palladin silencing disrupted stress fiber formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Parast1">[5]</xref>, which was restored by the re-expression of palladin. There have been two distinct reports regarding the role of palladin in cell migration. One report showed cell migration inhibition due to palladin knockdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Goicoechea3">[7]</xref>. The other demonstrated an anti-migratory palladin function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Chin1">[19]</xref>. We produced MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells that constitutively reduced palladin expression using shRNA and observed enhanced cell migration. Moreover, palladin re-expression reduced cell migration to levels similar to control cells, which confirmed the inhibitory palladin function in migration. Disruption of actin cytoskeleton can sometimes accelerate cell migration. For example, addition of Rho kinase inhibitor, which inhibits actin cytoskeletal organization, promotes migration of certain cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Zhang1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Magdalena1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, disruption of actin cytoskeleton may have promoted migration of palladin-knockdown cells. Although further studies are required to determine the exact function of palladin in cell migration, our results show a clear anti-migratory role for palladin in these cell lines.</p>
      <p>A number of studies have demonstrated that ERK activation is essential for migration of numerous cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Huang1">[20]</xref>. We speculated that palladin phosphorylation is required for ERK-mediated promotion of cell migration. Contrary to our speculation, S77.197G-palladin expression in MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cells enhanced migration compared to wild-type palladin. Suppression of ERK activation by a chemical inhibitor reduced cell migration of both the MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cell lines (data not shown). Therefore, ERK activation is essential for the migration of these cell lines. ERK phosphorylates a variety of proteins that are involved in actin cytoskeletal remodeling to enhance migration. Most of these phosphorylations promote cell migration, but our results indicate that some ERK phosphorylations may have anti-migratory roles. ERK stimulates both activating and inhibitory signals for migration simultaneously, and ERK-mediated promotion of cell migration may be accomplished by the dominant effects of promoting signals.</p>
      <p>To examine the molecular mechanism of palladin phosphorylation by ERK in regards to how it inhibits cell migration, we checked activation of small GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42, which are critically involved in cell migration. We did not observe any difference in activation of both GTPases between shPal/GFP-wt and shPal/GFP-S77.197G cells. Previous studies have shown that palladin phosphorylation by AKT1 can suppress cell migration and induce bundling of actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Chin1">[19]</xref>. However, our results showed that palladin phosphorylation by ERK was not required for maintenance of the organized actin cytoskeleton and actin bundling. These results suggest that ERK-mediated palladin phosphorylation utilizes different molecular mechanisms to control cell migration. We speculated that phosphorylation may affect palladin associations with other molecules because phosphorylated residues are localized in proline-rich regions. We found that the association of palladin and the Abl SH3 domain was significantly reduced by phosphorylation. The association of palladin with the ArgBP2 SH3 was not affected by phosphorylation, which indicated that phosphorylation regulates interactions with specific proteins. Abl is known to promote lamellipodia formation and cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-SosseyAlaoui1">[35]</xref>. Therefore, Abl dissociation from palladin may inhibit Abl-mediated cell migration. However, since palladin has multiple interacting proteins, there may be other interactions regulated by phosphorylation to control cell migration.</p>
      <p>Interactions of proline-rich regions and SH3 domains are essential for various signal transductions that regulate proliferation, differentiation, migration and transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029338-Pawson1">[39]</xref>. Although a large number of SH3-mediated interactions have been reported, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of these interactions. SH3 and proline-rich regions form stable complexes, but our results imply that this interaction can be regulated by phosphorylation of proline-rich regions. Additional studies may reveal that SH3-mediated interactions are not stable, but reversibly regulated by phosphorylation by various protein kinases.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have shown that palladin is a novel substrate of ERK and identified serine residues that are phosphorylated by ERK. Furthermore, we have shown that phosphorylation has anti-migratory functions and can inhibit the association of palladin with Abl. In addition to ERK and AKT1, there may be other kinases that phosphorylate palladin to regulate the actin cytoskeletal organization. Further studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which palladin regulates the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration.</p>
