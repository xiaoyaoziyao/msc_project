<title>Background</title>
<p>Peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is caused by atherosclerosis, results in progressive narrowing and occlusion of the peripheral arteries and inhibits blood flow to the lower extremities. Therapeutic angiogenesis is a promising strategy for treating ischemia caused by PAD. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to be a key mediator of angiogenesis. It has been demonstrated that β-cyclodextrincan stimulate vessel growth in rabbit corneas. In this study, we assessed the mechanism of action and therapeutic potential of a new angiogenic molecule, (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (2HP-β-CD).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods and Results</title>
<p>2HP-β-CD significantly increased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) peptides in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and also increased basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) peptide in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). 2HP-β-CD stimulated both proliferation and migration of HUVECs in an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/NO-dependent manner, whereas NO was found to be involved in proliferation, but not migration, of HASMCs. In a unilateral hindlimb ischemia model in mice, 2HP-β-CD injections not only promoted blood flow recovery and increased microvessel densities in ischemic muscle, but also promoted coverage of the vessels with smooth muscle cells, thus stabilizing the vessels. Administration of 2HP-β-CD increased the expression of several angiogenic factors, including VEGF-A, PDGF-BB and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) in ischemic muscle. Injections of 2HP-β-CD also stimulated protein kinase B and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), leading to an increase in phosphorylation of eNOS in ischemic muscle. Treatment with the NOS inhibitor, Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), showed that stimulation of blood flow induced by 2HP-β-CD was partially dependent on NO.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is caused by atherosclerosis, results in progressive narrowing and occlusion of the peripheral arteries and inhibits blood flow to the lower extremities [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. PAD is a highly prevalent syndrome that affects 8–12 million individuals in the United States and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Global prevalence of PAD is 3%–10%, increasing to 15%–20% in individuals over the age of 70 [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe form of PAD characterized by ischemic rest pain with ischemic ulcers and/or gangrene [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The primary therapeutic goals in treating CLI are to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, relieve ischemic pain, heal ulcers, prevent major amputation, and improve quality of life and survival. These goals may be achieved by medical therapy, endovascular intervention, open surgery, or amputation and require a multidisciplinary approach including pain management, wound care, reduction of risk factors, and treatment of co-morbidities [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Approximately 20%–30% of patients with CLI are not, however, considered to be suitable candidates for vascular or endovascular procedures and amputation is often the only option [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This corresponds to about 100,000 major leg amputations in the European Union, and to 120,000 in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These no-option patients are potential candidates for novel angiogenic therapies.</p>
<p>Many pharmacological approaches, based mainly on the knowledge gained from studying therapeutic angiogenesis, have been used to stimulate the growth of collateral arteries [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Approaches for therapeutic angiogenesis can be divided into three categories: (1) protein-based, (2) gene-based, and (3) cell-based therapies [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. All of these approaches have been used to achieve therapeutic angiogenesis in cardiac and skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. But each approach has disadvantages. The disadvantages of using recombinant proteins include the considerable costs involved in producing significant quantities of pyrogen-free material as well as the requirement for repeated or prolonged administration of protein because of its short half-life [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Disadvantages of gene therapy include relatively low transfection rates (especially in skeletal muscle), potential for uptake of vector and gene expression at distant sites with unwanted effects in non-target tissues and the inability to withdraw treatment quickly [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Most recently, cell-based therapies have emerged as exciting avenues for therapeutic angiogenesis. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been found to participate in postnatal neovascularization after mobilization from bone marrow [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although treatment of vascular occlusive disease with peripheral blood-derived cultured EPCs might be a potential therapeutic option, estimates based on animal experiments suggest that 12L of autologous blood may be necessary to harvest sufficient EPCs to induce angiogenesis in patients if the EPCs are delivered <italic>via</italic> an intravenous infusion [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because such an approach is impractical in a clinical setting, approaches to render EPC therapy more feasible are currently being developed. It is therefore crucial that new angiogenic molecules are identified and tested for treating PAD.</p>
<p>Recently, NO produced by eNOS has been shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of vascular tone, vascular remodeling, and angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of six, seven, or eight glucopyranose units, usually referred to as α-, β-, or γ-cyclodextrins, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Glycosaminoglycans play a role in vascular endothelial cell function as they are able to modulate the activities of angiogenic growth factors by facilitating interactions with their receptors and promoting receptor activation [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that β-cyclodextrin, administered alone, stimulated vessel growth to 164% of the growth in untreated controls and vessel density to 303% above the control level in rabbit corneas [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, it has also been reported that sulfated β-cyclodextrin acted as an angiogenesis inhibitor when administered at high concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The role of NO in cell migration and proliferation induced by 2HP-β-CD and the effect of 2HP-β-CD in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model are, however, unknown.</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the functions and mechanisms of action of 2HP-β-CD in angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We showed that 2HP-β-CD significantly increased VEGF-A and PDGF-BB peptides in HUVECs and bFGF peptide in HASMCs. 2HP-β-CD stimulated proliferation and migration of HUVECs in an eNOS/NO-dependent manner, whereas NO was found to be involved in proliferation, but not migration, of HASMCs. Local injections of 2HP-β-CD into ischemic limb muscle promoted recovery of blood flow, with stimulation of microvessel formation and vascular maturation. These therapeutic effects of 2HP-β-CD were dependent on Akt/ERK-eNOS. Treatment with NOS inhibitor, L-NAME, showed that stimulation of blood flow induced by 2HP-β-CD was partially dependent on NO. These observations provide the basis for proposing 2HP-β-CD as a novel treatment for post-ischemic angiogenesis.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>2HP-β-CD, pentobarbital, L-NAME and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Crystal violet was purchased from Biotime (Jiangsu, P.R.China).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6 mice, aged 8–12 weeks, were obtained from the Animal Facility at the China Medical University. Mice were housed in a conventional temperature-controlled facility (24°C) under a 12:12 h light–dark cycle with free access to regular chow and water. Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the China Medical University.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>HUVECs were obtained from KeyGEN BioTECH (Nanjing, P.R. China). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Scientific), 100 IU/ml penicillinand 100 mg/ml streptomycin (KeyGEN BioTECH).</p>
<p>HASMCs were obtained from Chinese academy of sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Cell Resource Center (Shanghai, P.R. China). The HASMCs were then grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Scientific), 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin (KeyGEN BioTECH).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Transwell Migration Assay</title>
<p>Transwell migration of HUVECs and HASMCs was determined using a 24-well transwell chamber with a pore size of 8 μm (Millipore, Massachusetts, USA). Cells (1x10<sup>5</sup>) in 200 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 or DMEM containing 0.25% fatty acid-free BSA were loaded into the upper wells; the lower wells were filled with the same medium with or without 10<sup>-8</sup>M 2HP-β-CD and/or 1mM L-NAME. The cells were allowed to migrate across the porous filter for 5 h at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator. After staining with 1% crystal violet and scraping the upper membrane surface with a cotton tip, the number of cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter was counted under a microscope in ten randomly selected high power fields. This experiment was performed in triplicate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Cell Proliferation Test</title>
<p>A cell proliferation assay was performed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) solution (Dojindo, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, HUVECs were seeded at a concentration of 1x10<sup>3</sup> cells/100 μl/well and HASMCs were seeded at a concentration of 1.5x10<sup>3</sup> cells/100 μl/well in 96-well culture plates. The cells were incubated with or without 10<sup>-8</sup>M 2HP-β-CD and/or 1 mM L-NAME for 72 h. The wells were treated with 10 μl/well of CCK-8 solution during the last 4 h of culture. Optical density (OD) of the wells was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific). This experiment was performed in triplicate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>Unilateral Hindlimb Ischemia Model in Mice</title>
<p>Following intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (60 mg/kg), mice were subjected to surgical procedures to achieve unilateral hindlimb ischemia according to the method described previously [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In brief, following a skin incision at the left paracenter of the lower abdomen, the femoral artery, which originates from the external iliac artery and terminates to bifurcate into the saphenous and the popliteal arteries, was exposed. The femoral artery was ligated with 8–0 silk, and the whole length of the femoral artery was excised and the skin incision sutured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Blood Flow Analysis</title>
<p>Blood flow in the ischemic hindlimb was measured using a laser Doppler blood flow (LDBF) imager (Moor Instruments, Devon, UK) before and after the operation. Recovery of perfusion in the ischemic hindlimb of each mouse was estimated by the percentage of limb blood flow, calculated as the average perfusion of the left hindlimb compared to that of the normal right hindlimb.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec013">
<title>Drug Administration</title>
<p>2HP-β-CD (10<sup>–7</sup> M, 10<sup>–8</sup> M and 10<sup>–9</sup> M) was suspended in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The suspensions of 2HP-β-CD (10 μl for each site) or PBS alone (10 μl for each site) were injected intramuscularly into four sites in the medial portion of the thigh muscle and two sites in the calf muscle of ischemic limbs daily for 28 days.</p>
<p>L-NAME (0.5 mg/ml) was dissolved in drinking water containing 1% glucose and administered to mice for 4 weeks before and after the operation; control animals received drinking water containing 1% glucose. This dose of L-NAME was chosen because it was previously shown to induce hypertension through inhibition of NO production [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. All animals were fed a regular chow diet. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured in conscious mice by the tail–cuff method using an indirect blood pressure meter (BP-98A, Softron Co, Tokyo, Japan) according to manufacturer's protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Mice were perfused with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde through a cannula inserted into the left ventricle. The calf muscle was excised, embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Fine Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), frozen on dry ice, and sectioned (8 μm). For immunofluorescence measurements, acetone-fixed frozen sections were incubated with rat monoclonal anti-CD31/PECAM-1 antibody (1:100, clone MEC13.3, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and mouse monoclonal anti-αsmooth muscle actin (αSMA) (1:100, clone 1A4, Sigma). Bound antibodies were detected using TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Proteintech, Chicago, USA) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Proteintech) secondary antibodies. For immunohistochemistry, tissue sections probed with primary antibodies were incubated with StreptAvidin-Biotin Complex (SABC) kit, (Boster, Wuhan, P.R. China), followed by visualization with 3,3’–diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Maxim, Fuzhou, P.R. China).</p>
<p>CD31-positive capillary densities were counted in ten randomly chosen high power fields per mouse and expressed as the number of capillaries per mm<sup>2</sup>. Quantification of the extent of αSMA-positive microvasculatures was carried out using an Image J (NIH) system.</p>

<title>Isolation of mRNA and Quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>Cells were incubated with or without 10<sup>-8</sup>M 2HP-β-CD for 8 h. Total RNA from cells and calf muscle was isolated using RNAiso Plus (TAKARA Biotechnology, Dalian, P.R. China). The concentration of RNA was determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using a PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Perfect Real Time) (Takara) in a total volume of 20 μl. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on cDNA samples using a LightCycler480 II instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) with the SYBR Green Premix Ex Taq II (Takara) in a total volume of 20 μl. The primer sequences for cells were as follows: Vegfa-F, 5′- GACTCGCCCTCATCCTCTTC-3′; Vegfa-R, 5′- TCAACCACTCACACACACACAAC-3′; Fgf2-F, 5′- GTGTGCTAACCGTTACCTGGCTATG-3′; Fgf2-R, 5′- CCAGTTCGTTTCAGTGCCACA-3′; Pdgfb-F, 5′- GAAATTCAAGCACACGCATGAC-3′; Pdgfb-R, 5′- TCCGAATCAGGCATCGAGAC-3′; Tgfb1-F, 5′- CGCATCCTAGACCCTTTCTCCTC-3′; Tgfb1-R, 5′- GGTGTCTCAGTATCCCACGGAAAT-3′; Angpt1-F, 5′- TCAACATCTGGAACATGTGATGGA-3′; Angpt1-R, 5′- CATGGTAGCCGTGTGGTTCTG-3′; GAPDH-F, 5′-GATCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATG-3′; and GAPDH-R, 5′-CAATGGCCCCTTCATTGACC-3′. The primer sequences for tissues were as follows: Vegfa-F, 5′-AGGCAGACTATTCAGCGGATCC-3′; Vegfa-R, 5′-CTCAAACCGTTGGCACGA-3′; Fgf2-F, 5′-GGCTGCTGGCTTCTAAGTG-3′; Fgf2-R, 5′-CTGTCCAGGTCCCGTTTT-3′; Pdgfb-F, 5′-CACCAACGCCAACTTCCT-3′; Pdgfb-R, 5′-GCTTCTTTCGCACAATCTCA-3′; Tgfb1-F, 5′-AACTAAGGCTCGCCAGTCC-3′; Tgfb1-R, 5′-GCGGTCCACCATTAGCAC-3′; Angpt1-F, 5′-ATTCTTCGCTGCCATTCT-3′; Angpt1-R, 5′-CAGTTCCCGTCGTGTTCT-3′; GAPDH-F, 5′-CTCTGCTCCTCCCTGTTC-3′; and GAPDH-R, 5′-CAATCTCCACTTTGCCACT-3′. The expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was measured and used as an internal control. The data were analyzed using 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> relative expression quantity as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

VEGF-A, PDGF-BB and TGF-β1 in the tissue lysates were determined using a mouse VEGF-A Platinum ELISA kit (eBioscience, Vienna, Austria), a mouse platelet-derived growth factor-BB ELISA kit (Cusabio, Wuhan, P.R. China) and a mouse TGF-β1 Platinum ELISA kit (eBioscience), respectively.

<p>Our preliminary experiments showed that 10<sup>–8</sup> M 2HP-β-CD significantly increased cell migration and proliferation in both HUVECs and HASMCs. To study the mechanisms of 2HP-β-CD-induced cell migration and proliferation, the effects of 2HP-β-CD on expression level of mRNA for various angiogenic factors were examined by real time-PCR analysis.

<title>eNOS Phosphorylation is Induced by 2HP-β-CD</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that cholesterol-free methyl-β-cyclodextrin stimulates eNOS [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

<title>Local Administration of 2HP-β-CD Stimulates Blood Flow Recovery and Angiogenesis in Ischemic Hindlimbs</title>
<p>The effects of different concentrations of 2HP-β-CD on blood flow in ischemic hindlimbs after surgical femoral arteriectomy in C57BL/6 mice were compared. Concentrations of 10<sup>–8</sup> M and 10<sup>–7</sup> M 2HP-β-CD stimulated blood flow at post-operative day 28, and at other time points. Optimal effects were observed at a concentration of 10<sup>–8</sup> M. On post-operative day 1, the ratio of blood flow in the ischemic limb to that in the non-ischemic limb decreased sharply to 5% of the pre-surgery level in mice injected with 2HP-β-CD and control animals. Blood flow recovery was significantly higher in mice treated with 10<sup>–8</sup> M 2HP-β-CD than in control mice from post-operative day 14 to post-operative day 28.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have investigated the functions and mechanisms of action of 2HP-β-CD in promoting angiogenesis both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data indicate that 2HP-β-CD stimulated cell migration in both HUVECs and HASMCs. Treatment of cells with L-NAME significantly blocked migration of HUVECs, but not HASMCs. 2HP-β-CD stimulated proliferation of HUVECs and HASMCs, and the effect of 2HP-β-CD was inhibited by L-NAME in both cell lines (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Local administration of 2HP-β-CD promoted blood flow and improved hindlimb muscle microcirculation in a mouse model of PAD induced by ligation of the femoral artery (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Further studies showed that local injections of 2HP-β-CD induced neovascularization in at least two ways: by angiogenesis and by recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Angiogenesis, the process in which new vessels arise by branching from existing microvessels, involves the dissolution of the basement membrane berneath the endothelium together with endothelial cell (EC) migration and proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Several molecules, including VEGF [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]<sub>,</sub> TGF-β [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], bFGF [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], angiopoietin (Ang-1) [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and PDGF-B [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], have been shown to have angiogenic activity. Our data suggest that 2HP-β-CD stimulates angiogenesis through multiple mechanisms. Firstly, 2HP-β-CD is capable of acting on ECs to stimulate endothelial proliferation and migration both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Secondly, 2HP-β-CD increased the expression of several angiogenic factors including VEGF-A and PDGF-BB, in HUVECs. VEGF-A, PDGF-B antibodies can block 2HP-β-CD-induced proliferation and migration of HUVECs (<xref rid="pone.0125323.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> left panels).Injections of 2HP-β-CD also increased the expression of several angiogenic factors, including VEGF-A, PDGF-BB and TGF-β1, in ischemic muscle (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). VEGF-A is a specific EC mitogen, and it is also a heparin-binding glycoprotein [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], that can induce proliferation of ECs and <italic>in vivo</italic> angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. TGF-β1 alone can induce EC survival and tubular network formation [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. PDGF-BB modulates endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> via PDGF β-receptors [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
<p>bFGF can stimulate smooth muscle (SMC) proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], TGF-β1 can regulate SMC differentiation, PDGF is a potent chemoattractant for SMCs [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and, during vessel formation, PDGF-BB is required for the recruitment and differentiation of smooth muscle-like cells [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this study, 2HP-β-CD was shown to stimulate SMC proliferation and migration <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) by increasing the expression of bFGF (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), and the bFGF antibody can block 2HP-β-CD-induced proliferation and migration of HASMCs (<xref rid="pone.0125323.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> right panels). Injections of 2HP-β-CD also increased the number of -smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive blood vessels in ischemic muscle (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, center). These results indicate that 2HP-β-CD promotes the formation of smooth muscle-covered blood vessels, i.e. arteriogenesis. Arteriogenesis generally involves growth and remodeling of preexisting collateral vessels or reflects <italic>de novo</italic> formation of mature vessels [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The maturation of blood vessels into multilayer structures is essential for their persistence.</p>
<p>These observations collectively indicate that administration of 2HP-β-CD stimulates neovascularization by promoting angiogenesis and vascular smooth muscle cell recruitment through both EC-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms.</p>
<p>It has been reported that VEGF-A can cause vasodilation through the NOS pathway in endothelial cells and activate cell migration [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that VEGF enhances the expression of eNOS in native and cultured ECs, an effect that may be important in the process of VEGF-induced angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. TGF-β1-mediated angiogenic activity has been shown to depend on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. PDGF-B stimulation also produced an acute induction of TGF-β expression in SMCs through the MAPK/ERK pathway [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. When human cultured airway SMCs were incubated with bFGF, there was an increase in ERK phosphorylation [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We have shown that 2HP-β-CD stimulates Akt and ERK both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125323.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), 2HP-β-CD increased phosphorylation of Akt (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and eNOS (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) in HUVECs, and the increase in phosphorylation of eNOS was effectively blocked by pharmacological inhibition with L-NAME (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Akt and ERK are key signaling molecules in cell proliferation, survival, migration and eNOS activation, and thereby angiogenesis. Injections of 2HP-β-CD also increased the extent of phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser<sup>1177</sup>, which is the Akt and ERK phosphorylation site critical for activation. Available evidence suggests that the eNOS/NO pathway contributes to angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The NOS inhibitor, L-NAME, significantly blocked 2HP-β-CD-induced HUVEC migration and proliferation (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Administration of L-NAME reduced blood flow in both 2HP-β-CD-treated and PBS-treated (control) mice. 2HP-β-CD still stimulated blood flow in mice treated with L-NAME (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>), suggesting that mechanisms distinct from NO production could also participate in 2HP-β-CD-induced blood flow stimulation in ischemic limbs. L-NAME consistently inhibited 2HP-β-CD-induced angiogenesis (<xref rid="pone.0125323.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>), suggesting that 2HP-β-CD-induced neovascularization is dependent on eNOS/NO. These observations also suggest that NO may increase blood flow by mechanisms other than stimulating neovascularization; NO-induced vasodilation may also be involved in stimulating blood flow in ischemic limbs [<xref rid="pone.0125323.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The eNOS/NO-independent angiogenic actions of 2HP-β-CD likely involve Akt/ERK-mediated stimulation of EC proliferation and migration.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the data genarated in this study suggest that 2HP-β-CD significantly increases angiogenesis through mechanisms involving Akt/ERK-eNOS. Therapeutic angiogenesis with 2HP-β-CD may therefore be beneficial to patients with PAD.</p>
