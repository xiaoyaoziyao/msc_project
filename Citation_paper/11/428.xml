<abstract>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> primary cultures of dissociated invertebrate neurons from locust ganglia are used to experimentally investigate the morphological evolution of assemblies of living neurons, as they self-organize from collections of separated cells into elaborated, clustered, networks. At all the different stages of the culture's development, identification of neurons' and neurites' location by means of a dedicated software allows to ultimately extract an adjacency matrix from each image of the culture. In turn, a systematic statistical analysis of a group of topological observables grants us the possibility of quantifying and tracking the progression of the main network's characteristics during the self-organization process of the culture. Our results point to the existence of a particular state corresponding to a <italic>small-world</italic> network configuration, in which several relevant graph's micro- and meso-scale properties emerge. Finally, we identify the main physical processes ruling the culture's morphological transformations, and embed them into a simplified growth model qualitatively reproducing the overall set of experimental observations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The issue of why and how an assembly of isolated (cultured) neurons self-organizes to form a complex neural network is a fundamental problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Marom1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Eckman1">[3]</xref>. Despite their more limited, and yet laboratory-controllable, repertoire of responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Marom1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Ayali1">[4]</xref>, the understanding of such cultures' organization is, indeed, a basis for the comprehension of the mechanisms involved in their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts, and provide a useful framework for the investigation of neuronal network development in real biological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Eckman1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Some previous studies highlighted the fact that the structuring of a neuronal cultured network before the attainment of its mature state is not random, being instead governed and characterized by processes eventually leading to configurations which are comparable to many other real complex networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Boccaletti1">[5]</xref>. In particular, networking neurons simultaneously feature a high overall clustering and a relatively short path-length between any pair of them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Shefi1">[6]</xref>. Such configurations, which in graph theory are termed <italic>small-world</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Watts1">[7]</xref>, are ubiquitously found in real-world networking systems. Small-world structures have been shown to enhance the system's overall efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Latora1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Achard1">[9]</xref>, while concurrently warranting a good balance between two apparently antagonistic tendencies for segregation and integration in structuring processes, needed for the network's parallel, and yet synthetic performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Rad1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this paper, we experimentally investigate the self-organization into a network of an <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of neurons during the course of development, and explore the changes of the main topological features characterizing the anatomical connectivity between neurons during the associated network's growth. To that purpose, dissociated and randomly seeded neurons are initially prepared, and the spontaneous and self-organized formation of connections is tracked up to their assembling into a two dimensional clustered network.</p>
<p>Most existing studies in neuronal cultures restricted their attention to functional networks (statistical dependence between nodes activities) and not to the physical connections supporting the functionality of the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Feldt1">[11]</xref>. The reason behind this drawback is that the majority of investigations focused on excessively dense cultures, hindering the observation of their fine scale structural connectivity. Although there are studies striving to indirectly infer the underlying anatomical connectivity from the functional network, it has been shown that strong functional correlations may exist with no direct physical connection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Honey1">[12]</xref>. Only few studies dealt with the physical wiring circuitry. However, on the one hand, only small networks were considered; on the other hand, how the network state evolves during the course of the maturation process has not been investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Shefi1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, instead, we focus on intermediate neurons' densities, and provide a full tracking of the most relevant topological features emerging during the culture's evolution. In particular, we show experimentally that <italic>in vitro</italic> neuronal networks tend to develop from a random network state toward a particular networking state, corresponding to a <italic>small-world</italic> configuration, in which several relevant graph's micro- and meso-scale properties emerge. Our approach also unveils the main physical processes underlying the culture's morphological transformation, and allows using such information for devising a proper growth model, qualitatively reproducing the set of our experimental evidence.</p>
<p>Together with confirming several results of previous works on functional connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Downes1">[13]</xref>, or on morphological structuring at a specific stage of the cultures' evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Shefi1">[6]</xref>, we offer a systematic characterization of several topological network's measures from the very initial until the final state of the culture. Such a <italic>longitudinal</italic> study of the network structure highlights as yet unknown self-organization properties of cultured neural networks, such as <italic>i</italic>) a large increase in both local and global network's efficiency associated to the emergence of the small-world configuration, and <italic>ii</italic>) the setting of assortative degree-degree correlation features.</p>

<title>Neuronal cultures and network growth</title>
<p>In this paper, we report on six cultured networks, which were grown from independent initial sets of dissociated neurons extracted from the frontal ganglion of adult locusts of the <italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic> species. In all cases, a same protocol was used, involving animals that were daily fed with organic wheat grass and maintained under a 12∶12 h light∶dark cycle from their fifth nymph growth to their early adult stage of development. At this latter stage, we followed the dissection and culturing protocol thoroughly described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Anava1">[14]</xref>. In brief, the frontal ganglia were dissected from anesthetized animals, and enzymatically treated to soften the sheath. Ganglia were then forced to pass through the tip of a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>l pipette to mechanically dissociate the neurons. The resulting suspension of neuronal somata was plated on Concanavalin A pre-coated circular area (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mm) of a Petri dish where it was left for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> h to allow adhesion of neurons at random positions of the substrate. After plating, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ml culture medium (Leibovitz L-15) enriched with 5% locust hemolymph was added. Cultures were then maintained in darkness under controlled temperature (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>C) and humidity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>
<p>The density at which cultures are seeded determines the maturation rate and the spatial organization at the mature state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Shefi2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Segev1">[16]</xref>. For the purpose of this work, aimed at studying the network evolution into a clustered network, 6 dense cultures of 12 ganglia each (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> neurons) were used and monitored during 18 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV). During the entire experiment, the culture medium was not changed.</p>
<p>High-resolution and large scale images of the whole culture were acquired daily using a charge coupled device camera (DS-Fi1, Nikon) mounted on a phase contrast microscope (Eclipse Ti-S, Nikon), with automated control of a motorized XYZ stage (H117 ProScan, Prior Scientific).</p>
<p>A typically observed growth evolution is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g001">Fig. 1</xref> (restricted to just a small part of the whole culture) between 3 and 12 DIV. Neurons ranging from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>m in size are initially randomly anchored to a two dimensional substrate, while after 3 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>) many cells already start growing neuronal processes (neurites) trying to target neighboring cells. During this growth process, neurites also split and reach other processes forming loops of neurites up to 6 DIV, when the maximum stage of network development takes place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). At this point, the growth rate decreases and a different mechanism starts shaping the network: tension is generated along the neurites as they stretch between neurons or bifurcation points to form straight segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Anava2">[17]</xref>.</p>

<title>Culture development of locust frontal ganglion neurons into clustered networks.</title>
<p>(A) After 3 DIV, completely dissociated neurons had already started growing neuronal processes with continuous branching. The area outlined in (b) is enlarged in B. (C) Same area as in (B) but at 6 DIV. At this stage, neurons and small clusters of neurons are already densely connected and form a complex network. At the same stage, branched neurites (pointed by the black arrow) that failed to contact neighboring neurons start to retract. (D) Migration of neurons due to the tension along neurites leads to the formation of large neuronal clusters and of thicker bundles of neurites. For a better visualization, the area outlined in (e) is enlarged in E.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.g001" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>The latter process favors neuron migration, giving rise to clusters of neurons, and the fusion of parallel neurites into thicker bundles together with the retraction of those branches which did not target any neuron (see black arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The resulting network topology shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g001">Fig. 1D</xref> after 12 DIV (and in the enlarged area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>) is characterized by a random distribution of few clusters of aggregated neurons linked by thick nerve-like bundles.</p>

<title>Anatomical graph extraction and complex network statistics</title>
<p>Our experiments consistently show that cultures self-organize from random scattered distributions of bare neurons into spatial networks of interconnected clusters of neurons (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to properly quantify the topological and spatial changes of the anatomical neuronal network as cultures approach their mature state, we developed a custom image analysis software in MATLAB to detect the location of neurons, clusters of neurons and neurite paths. The used imaging software has been fully customized for the purpose of the analysis of the present data. The general details of the developed imaging software will be reported elsewhere. The performance of the algorithm is sketched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g002">Fig. 2</xref>. The algorithm takes as an input a gray color image of the culture at a particular day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), upon which it superimposes a layer of new information comprising the contours of the clusters of neurons (red shadows), the traces of the neurites (green lines), and connection points between neurites, as well as those between neurites and clusters (blue dots) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>The information contained in the produced layer is then used to map the neuronal network into a graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) whose nodes (in blue) are either cluster centroids or connection points, and the links (in green) are straight lines connecting them. Therefore, our graph is made of two types of nodes: neurons or clusters of neurons (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and neurite connection points (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Treating all links as identical, i.e. ignoring edge length and edge directionality, this graph can be described in terms of a symmetric adjacency matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> whose elements <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> if nodes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are linked, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> otherwise.</p>
<p>We focus on the network statistical properties at the level of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nodes, ignoring the dynamics of both neurite connections and branching points. Therefore, we extract from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the subgraph defining the connectivity among nodes of class <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in such a way that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are linked either directly or through a connected path of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nodes.</p>
<p>The analysis of the networks' evolution requires accounting for the birth and death of links (and, in some cases, nodes) over time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the mean values for the number of nodes and the of links at each DIV, calculated for the 6 cultures. During the growth phase, spanning from 0 to 6 DIV, the number of nodes with at least one connection slowly increases with age, while the number of links rises exponentially, reaching a maximum at DIV 6. After this time point, the convergence of parallel neurites and neuronal clusterization induces a more gentle decrease in the number of links, accompanied by a slight reduction in the number of nodes. In order to properly compare networks of different size, we need to refer to a measure which is independent of the network size: the link density, defined as the ratio between the total number of measured links and the number of links characterizing the arrangement of the same number of identified nodes in a complete clique configuration. As illustrated in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, at any stage of development, the cultured networks are far from being fully connected (only about 2% of all possible connections exist between nodes), and thus operate in a low-cost regime of sparse anatomical connections.</p>

<p>In such a sparse connectivity regime, we quantify how our networks constrained in 2D space percolate. To do so, we measure the size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the giant connected component (GCC) and the size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the second largest component (GCC2) as a function of the age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Bollobs1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Li1">[19]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g003">Figure 3B</xref> shows that the number of nodes forming such connected components smoothly increases at the same rate along the first days of the network development, up to the DIV 6 when the difference in size between them suddenly and consistently starts to grow. From that point on, the GCC2 starts collapsing and progressively merging into the GCC, and the establishment of an almost fully connected network of clusters characterizes the rest of the culture's life. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g003">Figure 3B</xref> reports the evolution of the number of nodes belonging to both GCC and GCC2.</p>
<p>A deeper information on the culture evolution can be gathered by monitoring the behavior of a subset of local and network-wide quantities. For that purpose, we calculated several topological properties of the extracted adjacency matrices (using the Matlab Boost Graph Library package and the Brain Connectivity Toolbox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Rubinov1">[20]</xref>), whose definitions are provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Boccaletti1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Rubinov1">[20]</xref>. In particular, we analyzed the clustering coefficient (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the average shortest path length (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the local (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and global (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Latora1">[8]</xref>, the network assortativity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the cumulative degree distribution (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), obtained from the degree distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> being <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the degree (or number of links) of a node.</p>
<p>In all cases, the calculation of such statistics was restricted to the set of nodes having at least one link, and for the calculation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to those pairs of nodes belonging to the GCC. Moreover, the experimental values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were also compared with those expected in equivalent random null hypothesis networks, i.e. random networks artificially constructed to have the same number of nodes and links and to display the same degree distribution. Specifically, for each experimental network at a particular age, we generated 20 independent realizations of equivalent random networks, and calculated the corresponding expected network statistics.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to quantify the degree-degree correlation properties, the network assortativity was defined by considering for each node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the average degree of its neighbors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and by computing the linear regression of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> vs. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The assortativity coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was then calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient corresponding to the best fit of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the network is set to be assortative (disassortative), while depending upon the obtained value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the degree correlation properties are said to be of a linear (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), sub-linear (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), or super-linear (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) nature.</p>

<title>Emergence of small-world structure</title>
<p>The first days of the cultures' development (from DIV 0 to DIV 3) were characterized by networks with very few nodes and links (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). After DIV 3, the networks showed a very pronounced increase in the number of links and nodes (from DIV 3 to DIV 6) preceding a spatial network reorganization eventually driving the graph into its clustered, mature state.</p>
<p>The associated networks statistics sheds light on the transition from random to non-random properties with a progression of both the clustering coefficient and the average path length (normalized by the GCC size) as a function of age (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The first significant result is the simultaneous increase in the clustering coefficient and decrease in the mean path length, a clear fingerprint of the emergence of a small-world network configuration. This configuration becomes prominent at DIV 6 and stays relatively stable through the last two weeks <italic>in vitro</italic>. To properly asses the significance of this finding and isolate the influence of the variable network size and density, we calculated the values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> normalized to the corresponding expected values for equivalent random (and lattice) null model networks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In doing so, we follow the approach that was recently used in similar circumstances for the obtainment of null models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Woiterski1">[21]</xref>. According to Watts and Strogatz's model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Watts1">[7]</xref>, a small-world network simultaneously exhibits short characteristic path length, like random graphs, and high clustering, like regular lattices. Here, we found a clear change in the trend at DIV 6 where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where the average path length of the cultured network starts to be close to that of a random graph and much smaller than that of a regular graph (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is calculated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>)). At the same time, the clustering coefficient was much higher (between 30–50 times) than that of the corresponding random graphs.</p>

<p>These results are in agreement with previous morphological characterizations of <italic>in vitro</italic> neuronal networks at a single developmental stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Shefi1">[6]</xref>, where a similar small-world arrangement of connections was evidenced at DIV 6. However, to reinforce the evidence of the emergence of a small-world configuration <italic>during</italic> the graph development (as well as the fact that here the small-world metrics are not influenced by network disconnectedness), we also measured the global and local efficiency, as introduced by Latora and Marchiori in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Latora1">[8]</xref>. These latter quantities, indeed, are seen as alternative markers of the small-world phenomenon, in that small-world networks are those propagating information efficiently both at a global and at a local scale. The efficiency curves of the cultured networks are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g004">Fig. 4C</xref> as a function of age, and compared to the efficiency of the equivalent random graphs. Our results indicate that the connectivity structure of the neuronal networks evolve towards maximizing global efficiency (making it similar to the value of random graphs), while promoting fault tolerance by maximization of local efficiency (which is, instead, larger than the local efficiency of a random graph), and both properties are realized at a relatively low cost in terms of number of links (see again <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

<title>Node degree distribution evolution</title>
<p>Turning now our attention to network statistics at the micro-scale, we investigated how the node degree distributions evolved during maturation process. At all ages, cultures appeared to belong to the class of single-scale networks, displaying a well defined characteristic mean node degree. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows that the cumulative degree distributions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for DIVs 3, 6, 7, and 12 had a fast decay with a non monotonous increase in the average connectivity, with most of the nodes having a similar number of connections and only a few ones with degrees deviating significantly from such a number.</p>

<p>The data were fitted to an exponential scaling law <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with a level of confidence larger than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The values of the scaling parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were close, within error, to the mean degree <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the networks at each culture age. It has to be remarked that the distribution of node connections, although always homogeneous, shifted during culture maturation toward much broader distributions, with few highly connected nodes appearing at DIVs 6 and 7. These “hubs” at the peak days of the culture evolution result from a branching process, allowing each single neuron to reach a larger neighborhood. Thus, at variance with scale-free networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Albert1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Barabsi1">[23]</xref>, our cultured and clustered networks are identified as a single-scale homogeneous population of nodes. This is in agreement with reports on many other biological systems like the neuronal network of the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-White1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Watts2">[25]</xref>, and suggests the existence of physical costs for the creation of new connections and/or nodes limited capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Amaral1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>While the number of neighbors (the degree) is a quantity retaining information at the level of a single node, one can go further to inspect degree-degree correlations, i.e. to quantify whether the degrees of two connected nodes are correlated. It is known, indeed, that biological networks feature generally disassortative network structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Newman1">[27]</xref>, that is connections are more likely to be established between high-degree and low-degree nodes. In our system, we used the assortativity coefficient described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Experimental set-up</xref> section. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g005">Figure 5B</xref> shows the age evolution of the Pearson coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and of the exponent <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that characterizes the scaling behavior of the degree correlation properties (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). At one hand, as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> stays positive during the whole development we can generally conclude that our networks are assortative and, on the other hand, the trend of the exponent <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indicates that there is a transition from an almost linear (from DIV 0 to DIV 2) to a sub-linear (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) degree-degree correlation regime during the small-world stage.</p>
<p>It is important to remark here that, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of assortativity in an <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured neuronal network, and such an evidence actually links to other studies where assortativity was found in simple <italic>in vivo</italic> neuronal systems, like the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neural network structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Chatterjee1">[28]</xref>.</p>

<p>Our model is schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g006">Fig. 6</xref>. We start by considering a set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cells. Each cell is a small disk of radius <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> randomly distributed in a 2-dimensional circular substrate of area <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

As a result, a new equilibrium state is produced with new tension forces <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, being the central cluster pulled in the direction of the net force approaching the largest cluster.</p>

<p>As for the process of cell migration and clusterization, cells or clusters whose distance is less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are then merged into the same new cluster. Furthermore, whenever two cells are connected, an initial tension <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is created between them, and it is incremented in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> force units at each time step, being <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the unit vector along the direction connecting the two cells. The total force acting on a cell or cluster <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> running over the cell indexes connected to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and not belonging to the same cluster. Furthermore, each cell is “anchored” to the substrate by a force <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> force units, and the i<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cell can only be detached if there is a net force <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> acting on it larger than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the case of a cluster of cells, the adhesion force to the substrate is considered to be the sum of the individual adhesions of the cells composing the cluster. Therefore, cells and clusters move in a certain direction in all circumstances in which the net force acting on them overcomes the adhesion force, and an equilibrium point is reached at a new position in which the new net force balances (or is smaller) than the adhesion to the substrate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to validate our model, we ran a large number of simulations for different values of the model parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Remarkably, when comparing the statistical topological features of the simulated networks to those measured from the set of 6 cultures, we found high correlation values exist only in a very narrow window of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>Despite its relative simplicity, it is remarkable that the model offers a rather good qualitative verification of the trends of all the structural network characteristics measured in the experiments. In particular, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085828-g008">Fig. 8</xref> reports a synoptic comparison of the mean number of nodes and links, of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, of the mean degree and degree correlation, and of the sizes of the GCC and GCC2, measured in the experiments and those obtained from the simulations of the model with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The main observed difference is found in the mean degree, the reason behind such a slight discrepancy being that the model does not include any neurite branching process, limiting the size of the neighborhood encompassed by the nodes.</p>

<p>Though it would have been unrealistic to expect a perfect quantitative agreement between model and observations, the fact that the model reproduces the main qualitative scenarios of the experiments indicates that it captures the main processes underlying the observed morphological evolution and self-organization of the cultures.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, we provided a large scale experimental investigation of the morphological evolution of <italic>in vitro</italic> primary cultures of dissociated invertebrate neurons from locust ganglia. At all stages of the culture's development, we were able to identify neurons' and neurites' location in automated way, and extract the adjacency matrix that fully characterizes the connectivity structure of the networking neurons. A systematic statistical analysis of a group of topological observables has later allowed tracking of the main network characteristics during the self-organization process of the culture, and drawing important conclusions on the nature of the processes involved in the culture' structuring. At early stages of development (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085828.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>DIV 3) characterized by a high neurite growth rate, homogeneous node degree distribution and low clustering resulted in a random topology as expected given the fact that neurons were randomly seeded. Following this immature period, neurite growth rate diminished and tension along neurites started to shift the network to a small-world one with path lengths similar to random configurations but presenting high clustering of connections. This transition from random to small-world concurred with the percolation of the culture and the onset of the giant connected network component.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the identification of the main physical processes taking place during the culture's morphological transformations, allowed us to embed them into a simple growth model, qualitatively reproducing the overall scenario observed in the experiments.</p>
<p>Our results extend previous studies where network properties of cultures were investigated at a particular developmental stage and for a lesser number of nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Shefi1">[6]</xref>. These results also systematically characterize several topological network measures along the entire culture's evolution, and unveil many yet unknown self-organization properties, such as <italic>i</italic>) the fact that a small-world configuration spontaneously emerges in connection to a large increase in both local and global network's efficiency, and <italic>ii</italic>) the evidence that cultures tend to organize in a regime of non trivial degree mixing which, in turn, is characterized by assortative degree-degree correlation features. The evolution from an initial random to a small-world topology has also been reported recently in the context of a functional network of a cortical culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Downes1">[13]</xref>. However, although functional connectivity correlates well with anatomical connectivity, there are studies showing that strong functional connections may exist between nodes with no direct physical connection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085828-Honey1">[12]</xref>. This suggests that future studies are needed in which both anatomical and functional networks are accessible in order to understand their complex entanglement.</p>
<p>Given the absence of external chemical or electrical stimulations, we conclude that such complex network evolution and morphological structuring is indeed an intrinsic property of neuronal maturation. Our study therefore contributes to the understanding of the complex processes ruling the morphological structuring of cultured neuronal networks as they self-organize from collections of separated cells into clustered graphs, and may help identifying culture development stages in new, specific and targeted, experiments.</p>
