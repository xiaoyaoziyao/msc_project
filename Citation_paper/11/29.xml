      <abstract>
        <p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic mitogen involved in promoting tumor angiogenesis inside the body. VEGF is a key protein required for progression of tumor from benign to malignant phenotype. In this study, we investigated the binding affinity of a previously selected 26-mer DNA aptamer sequence (SL<sub>2</sub>-B) against heparin binding domain (HBD) of VEGF<sub>165</sub> protein. The SL<sub>2</sub>-B was first chemically modified by introduction of phosphorothioate linkages (PS-linkages). Subsequently, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD) were used to determine the binding affinity, specificity and to deduce the conformation of PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B sequence. Finally, antiproliferative activity of the modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B sequence on Hep G2 cancer cells was investigated. Our results demonstrate a marked enhancement in the biostability of the SL<sub>2</sub>-B sequence after PS modification. The modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B sequence also exhibits enhanced antiproliferative activity against Hep G2 cancer cells in hypoxia conditions. In addition, modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B sequence inhibits the expression of Jagged-1 protein, which is one of the ligands to VEGF linked delta/jagged-notch signaling pathway.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and accounted for 7.6 million deaths in 2008 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Ferlay1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Jemal1">[2]</xref>. In the United States alone, approximately 1 in 4 people die due to cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Jemal2">[3]</xref>. Currently, monoclonal antibodies are one of the most advanced therapeutic agents for cancer treatment in the market. Several FDA approved monoclonal antibody drugs, such as bevacizumab (trade name: Avastin) against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in colorectal, lung, and kidney cancer treatment, trastuzumab (trade name: Herceptin) against HER2/neu receptor in breast cancer treatment, and cetuximab (trade name: Erbitux) against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in metastatic colorectal, head and neck cancers, have been developed and are used either as a single agent or in combination with other drugs and radiation for cancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Ferrara1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Frampton1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In 1990, an <italic>in vitro</italic> selection process called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) was developed to screen single stranded nucleic acid molecules from random pool of library against the target ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Ellington1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Tuerk1">[14]</xref>. These classes of single stranded molecules are referred as “aptamers”. They possess high binding affinity and specificity that are comparable to monoclonal antibodies. In addition, the small size, non-immunogenicity and ease of modification compared to conventional monoclonal antibody makes aptamers attractive for therapeutic application <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Jayasena1">[15]</xref>. Based on the promising results in preclinical studies, two cancer targeting aptamers, ACT-GRO-777 (or AS1411) - a G-rich DNA aptamer targeting nucleolin for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and NOX-A12 L-RNA aptamer targeting CXCL12 for treatment of multiple myeloma and lymphoma are already in clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Bates1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Sayyed1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One chief problem that arises in the therapeutic application of aptamers is their instability under <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Agrawal1">[18]</xref>. They are susceptible to enzymatic nuclease attack in the cellular and serum fluids. To circumvent this problem, several chemical modification strategies have been employed to enhance their resistance against nucleases and to prolong their circulation half-life in the biological fluids. Such chemical modifications include incorporation of phosphorothioate linkages (PS-linkages) or locked nucleic acids (LNAs), addition of functional groups such as amino (-NH<sub>2</sub>), fluoro (-F), <italic>O</italic>-methyl (-OCH<sub>3</sub>) in 2′-position of ribose sugar, and conjugation to high molecular mass polyethylene glycol (PEG) or cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Kawasaki1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-deSmidt1">[25]</xref>. Studies have demonstrated that, compared to the unmodified version, the chemically modified aptamers exhibit not only longer lifetime in the biological milieu but sometimes also better binding affinity and specificity to their targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Lin1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Kang1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>VEGF is a crucial angiogenic mitogen overexpressed in the tumor cells and induces their migration, excessive proliferation, invasion and metabolism inside the body. VEGF is considered to be the hallmark protein for tumor angiogenesis and has been associated with neoplastic transformation of cells inside the body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Neufeld1">[27]</xref>. It is generally thought to be secreted by endothelial cells to stimulate their proliferation and migration. Previous reports, however, indicate that different carcinoma and malignant mesothelioma cell lines also secrete this protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Itakura1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Strizzi1">[31]</xref>. VEGF<sub>165</sub> is the pre-dominant isoform of VEGF-A protein, one of the members of VEGF family, and primarily binds to its two tyrosine-kinase receptors VEGFR-1/Flt-1 and VEGFR-2/KDR/Flk-1 with very high affinity and to specific co-receptor neuropilins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Neufeld1">[27]</xref>. The mitogenic signaling and cell proliferation in tumor cells is induced by expression of VEGFR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Millauer1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Waltenberger1">[33]</xref>. In contrast, activation of VEGFR-1 results in cell invasion and cell migration but not cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Barleon1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Wey1">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our previous study, a 26-mer DNA aptamer against heparin binding domain (HBD) of VEGF<sub>165</sub> protein (referred to as SL<sub>2</sub>-B) was obtained using stem-loop truncation strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Kaur1">[37]</xref>. Compared to the original untruncated aptamer, the SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer exhibited more than 200-fold increase in the binding affinity to VEGF<sub>165</sub> protein. Herein, we modified the SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer by incorporating phosphorothioate (PS) linkages, tested its binding affinity, specificity, biostability, secondary structure and the potential feasibility of the PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer as antagonist on the proliferation activity of cancer cells. We demonstrated that, compared to unmodified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer, the PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer is an improved sequence in terms of serum stability and antiproliferative activity without sacrificing the binding affinity and specificity for VEGF<sub>165</sub> protein.</p>

        <title>Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Spectroscopy</title>
        <p>The binding affinity and specificity of modified aptamer sequence was investigated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, where VEGF<sub>165</sub> and VEGF<sub>121</sub> acted as ligands and were directly immobilized on the sensor chip. Briefly, the carboxylic group on the sensor chip was activated by standard amine coupling procedure using freshly prepared EDC/NHS. VEGF<sub>165</sub> or VEGF<sub>121</sub> (25 µg/ml) in acetate buffer (pH 6.0) were then injected into the sensor chip at flow rate 8 µl/min to reach ∼200 RU immobilization level. The deactivation was done by ethanolamine-HCl to block unreacted carboxyl groups. The binding analysis was carried out with modified aptamers at different concentrations (0.2 to 100 nM) using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (GE Healthcare). The running condition was set at 30 µl/min flow rate, 25°C, 3 min association time and 5 min dissociation time. PBS and tween-20 solution mixture was used as the running buffer, and 50 mM NaOH as the regeneration buffer. All the buffers were filtered and degassed prior to each experiment. Blank surfaces were used for background subtraction. Upon injection of the aptamers, sensorgrams recording the association/dissociation behavior of the VEGF-aptamer complex were collected. By varying the aptamer concentration, a series of sensorgrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050964-g001">Figure 1</xref>) were obtained and subsequently analyzed using the 1∶1 Langmuir model provided in the BIAevaluation software (version 4.1) to calculate the equilibrium dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub>. All SPR measurements were performed in triplicates.</p>

        <title>Binding Analysis of PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B Aptamer and VEGF Complex by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)</title>
        <p>As reported previously in our study, the unmodified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer displayed a K<sub>d</sub> = 0.5 nM to heparin binding domain (HBD) of VEGF<sub>165</sub> protein determined via SPR technique (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050964-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Kaur1">[37]</xref>. The unmodified aptamer, however, exhibited low structural stability in the cellular conditions. This is due to the presence of exonucleases and endonucleases in biological fluids which degrade the aptamers by hydrolyzing the phosphate ester bond in the backbone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Kawasaki1">[19]</xref>. To alleviate this problem, in this study, the SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer was chemically modified with phosphorothioate (PS) linkages at 5′ and 3′- terminus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050964-t001">Table 1</xref>) to protect the SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer from exonucleolytic digestion. The PS-modification involves the substitution of unbridged phosphoryl oxygen in phosphodiester linkage by sulfur atom. Since the excess incorporation of PS-linkages leads to non-specific binding and can perturb the aptamer conformation and its interaction with the target, the modification was introduced only at aptamer termini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Thiviyanathan1">[38]</xref>.</p>

        <p>VEGF<sub>165</sub> as well as other VEGF isoforms, such as VEGF<sub>189</sub> and VEGF<sub>206</sub>, are generated from splicing of a single VEGF gene that shares a carboxyl-terminal heparin-binding domain (HBD) of 50-residues and binds to heparin with different binding affinities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Neufeld1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Houck1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Robinson1">[40]</xref>. HBD is responsible for enhancing the interaction of VEGF with its receptors (VEGFR-1/Flt-1 and VEGFR-2/KDR/Flk-1) and the specific co-receptor neuropilins to trigger the angiogenic response in malignant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Keyt1">[41]</xref>.</p>
        <p>VEGF<sub>121</sub>, however, does not share the HBD as other VEGF isoforms and can be used as a control for HBD binding specificity study. The SPR sensorgram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050964-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows that compared to VEGF<sub>165</sub> protein at same aptamer concentration (80 nM), the response signal of PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B binding to VEGF<sub>121</sub> protein was weak and displayed a high K<sub>d</sub> value of 17 µM. This indicates that PS modification does not reduce the binding specificity of SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer towards HBD significantly (K<sub>d</sub> = 17 µM for PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B towards VEGF<sub>121</sub>, K<sub>d</sub> = 10 µM for unmodified SL<sub>2</sub>-B towards VEGF<sub>121</sub>). Compared to the “bevacizumab” monoclonal antibody that binds to all isoforms of VEGF, the PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B is specific to HBD of VEGF<sub>165</sub> protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Ferrara1">[4]</xref>. Since VEGF-A is involved in normal physiological processes, such as formation of new blood vessels and wound healing process, the complete inhibition of VEGF protein can affect the maintenance of the normal vascular system inside the body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-SaintGeniez1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Brown1">[43]</xref>.

Thus, the secondary conformation of the PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer was investigated. Positive maxima peaks were observed at 260 nm and 220 nm as well as a negative minima peak at 240 nm and additional small shoulder peak at 290 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050964-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

Since no change in the spectra was observed between 25°C and 37°C, this confirms the preservation of the secondary conformation at the SPR conditions (25°C) where the K<sub>d</sub> of the aptamer was determined and at physiological conditions (37°C). However, the CD spectroscopy does not provide the complete and validated information on the structure. Advanced techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography are required for further in-depth structural analysis.</p>

        <title>Antiproliferative Activity Assay</title>
        <p>The antiproliferative property of SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer was studied using Hep G2 cancer cells in hypoxia conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of VEGF protein is potentiated in Hep G2 cells under hypoxia conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Suzuki1">[46]</xref>. Since no significant effect on cell proliferation was observed at 24 and 48 hours, both the unmodified and PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamers were tested for 72 hours duration. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050964-g005">Figure 5</xref>, lower cell proliferation was observed at 15 µM modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B concentration after 72 hours of aptamer treatment (52±2.1%). However, no decrease in the cell proliferation was observed on further increasing aptamer concentration to 20 µM. A possible explanation for decrease in the cell proliferation could be that either the excess binding of modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B sequence to VEGF<sub>165</sub> protein ultimately prevents the interaction of the protein to the VEGFR-2 (or KDR/Flk-1) receptor, which affects the cellular proliferation. Or aptamer after binding with VEGF protein binds with VEGFR-2, undergoes cellular internalization and interferes with the downstream VEGF linked intracellular signaling pathways. The result also indicates that VEGF protein may be involved in the proliferation of investigated Hep G2 cancer cells under hypoxia conditions. On the contrary, the unmodified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer sequence did not exhibit significant inhibitory activity on the cellular proliferation. This could be due to the degradation of the unmodified sequence by nuclease enzymes in the media before pronouncing its effect on the cancer cells.</p>

The results showed minimal decrease on the cell proliferation with the scrambled sequence, confirming that the inhibitory effect on VEGF<sub>165</sub> protein activity by PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B was sequence specific in Hep G2 cells. The sequence specific inhibition was also confirmed by the cell count and morphological differences presented in photomicrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050964-g006">Figure 6</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050964-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>, the cells treated with modified sequence have noticeably fewer cells as compared with the scrambled sequence where there appears to be more cells per view and packed closely to one another.

A 15 µM modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B concentration was used in this study but our results showed that both MCF-7 and HCT-116 cancer cells displayed only 23±3.2% and 9±1.8% decrease in cell proliferation was observed respectively. Based on these cell proliferation results, the effect of PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B sequence on cell proliferation is believed to be cell type specific. Since antiproliferative effect on MCF-7 and HCT-116 cancer cells were not very substantial, they were not used for further studies below. Additional antiproliferative studies on various cancer cell types should be conducted to uncover the potential therapeutic targets and to identify the factors responsible for cell specific antiproliferative activity of this aptamer.</p>

        <p>Notch signaling is an evolutionary conserved signaling pathway affecting many cellular processes such as cell-fate determination, differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Five Notch ligands (Jagged-1, Jagged-2, Delta-1, Delta-3, and Delta-4) and four Notch receptors have been well established in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Radtke1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Wang1">[50]</xref>. Evidence indicates the biochemical linkage between VEGF and delta/jagged-notch pathways activation, and together both are involved in promoting tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Jiang1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Thurston1">[52]</xref>. In this linkage, VEGF pathway is essential for the initiation of tumor angiogenesis and acts as the upstream activating stimulus, whereas notch signaling which acts on downstream of the VEGF pathway, helps to respond to activating stimulus and shape the activation by making cell fate decisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Radtke1">[49]</xref>. Due to the crosstalk between VEGF and notch signaling pathways, the effect of PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer was tested on Jagged-1, which is one of the notch ligands. Jagged-1 is overexpressed in various malignant tumors and has been associated with cancer recurrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Santagata1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050964-Wang2">[55]</xref>. Here, we examined the effect of PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer on the expression of Jagged-1 protein in Hep G2 cells via flow cytometry technique. Compared to the untreated sample (only cells), modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B treatment exhibited decrease in the fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050964-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This shift in the peak indicates the downregulation of the Jagged-1 expression due to the addition of PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer in Hep G2 cells (p-value &lt;0.05).</p>

        <p>Besides flow cytometry, the effect of PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub> aptamer on Jagged-1 protein expression in Hep G2 cells was analyzed using western blotting. The scrambled sequence of the modified aptamer was used as control. The modified aptamer appears to induce a lower expression of the Jagged-1 protein in Hep G2 cells as compared to the scrambled sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050964-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This confirms the sequence specific inhibition of the aptamer on Jagged-1 protein expression in Hep G2 cells. Based on both flow cytometry and western blotting results, it can be concluded that the binding of PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer to VEGF protein exhibits its antiproliferative activity in Hep G2 cells not only by inhibiting VEGF pathway but also the interconnected delta/jagged-notch signaling pathway in Hep G2 cells. Further studies are warranted to determine the effect of the modified aptamer on different notch ligands and other VEGF linked signaling pathways.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>To summarize, this work attempted to study the antiproliferative potential of SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer in cancer cells. From the data, we conclude that post-modification, the PS-modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer retained its binding affinity and specificity for the heparin-binding domain (HBD) of VEGF<sub>165</sub> protein. Furthermore, compared to the unmodified aptamer, the modified SL<sub>2</sub>-B demonstrated good biostability and exhibited its sequence specific antiproliferative activity on Hep G2 cancer cells in hypoxia conditions. Thus, based on the results of this work, it appears that chemical modification can be a useful approach in prolonging the half-life of the SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer in the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. This newly obtained SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer sequence can potentially be useful in oligomer-based cancer therapeutic applications, though further preclinical studies are required for better understanding of the SL<sub>2</sub>-B aptamer sequence and to evaluate its potential therapeutic value for cancer treatment.</p>
