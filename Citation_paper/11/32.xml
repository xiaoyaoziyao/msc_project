      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Attenuated recombinant <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium has emerged as a promising delivery system for foreign vaccine antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Medina1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Kotton1">[2]</xref>. Upon close contact with the eukaryotic cell, a type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by the “<italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 1” mediates <italic>Salmonella</italic> invasion of the host cell, where the bacterium resides within <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuoles. The T3SS is designed to translocate <italic>Salmonella</italic> type III effector proteins directly into the cytosol of target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Galan1">[3]</xref>. Our laboratory has focused its research on the genetic manipulation of attenuated <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains to endow them with the ability for efficient induction of MHC class I-restricted immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Rssmann1">[4]</xref>. We have developed a new vaccination strategy by using the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-T3SS to translocate microbial antigens directly into the cytosol of antigen-presenting cells. The immunodominant p60 antigen from <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> was fused to the defined N-terminal translocation domain of the type III effector molecule <italic>Yersinia</italic> outer protein E (YopE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Rssmann2">[5]</xref>. Translocation and cytosolic delivery of the chimeric YopE/p60 protein into macrophages led to efficient MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation of the p60 nonamer peptide p60<sub>217–225</sub>. As determined by enzyme-linked immunospot assay, mice orally vaccinated with a single dose of attenuated <italic>Salmonella</italic> expressing translocated YopE/p60 protein revealed high numbers of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-producing CD8 T cells reactive with p60<sub>217–225</sub>. In more recent studies, we demonstrated that the use of <italic>Salmonella</italic>'s T3SS to induce antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells is also an attractive strategy to develop vaccines for the immunoprophylaxis of tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Panthel1">[6]</xref> and is also suitable as a therapeutic intervention against cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Roider1">[7]</xref>. For these experiments, we have established an experimental tumor model in BALB/c mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Panthel1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Roider1">[7]</xref>. The murine fibrosarcoma cell line WEHI 164 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Guttinger1">[8]</xref> was stably transfected with DNA encoding the immunodominant listerial MHC class I-restricted nonamer epitope p60<sub>217–225</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Panthel1">[6]</xref>. In naïve mice, subcutaneous inoculation of these WEHI-p60 tumor cells resulted in progressive growth of a solid fibrosarcoma for approximately 14 days without inducing a measurable frequency of p60<sub>217–225</sub>-tetramer-positive CD8 T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Panthel1">[6]</xref>. BALB/c mice received a single orogastric immunization with <italic>Salmonella</italic> that translocates YopE/p60 via its T3SS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Panthel1">[6]</xref>. Four weeks later, mice were challenged subcutaneously with WEHI-p60 tumor cells. <italic>In vivo</italic> protection studies revealed that 80% of these mice remained tumor-free, whereas all animals of the non-vaccinated control group developed tumor growth. Furthermore, the potential of this vaccination strategy was evaluated with regard to a therapeutic intervention against cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Roider1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, we used the above described model and applied the YopE/p60 expressing <italic>Salmonella</italic> vaccine strain either simultaneously or 4 days after subcutaneous tumor injection. Interestingly, 71–80% of the intravenously and 50–52% of the orogastrically immunized mice showed a complete tumor regression after 14 days. In addition, the distribution of tetramer-positive p60<sub>217–225</sub>-specific CD8 T cell subpopulations in blood and tumor tissue was analyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Roider1">[7]</xref>. Co-staining with CD62L and CD127 revealed that the frequencies of p60<sub>217–225</sub>-specific effector and effector memory CD8 T cells in blood and in fibrosarcoma tissue were related to the kinetics of tumor regression.</p>
      <p>Tumors have evolved multiple mechanisms to evade the immune response, including antigen loss, down regulation of the MHC, and the production of immuno-suppressive factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Garrido1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Seliger1">[10]</xref>. In addition, many tumors lack expression of co-stimulatory molecules critical for the activation of naïve T cells. Finally, tolerance mechanisms are operative <italic>in vivo</italic> to prevent T cell activation in response to tumor antigens that are expressed in many cases also in normal tissue. A new approach to circumvent some of these problems, is the idea to suppress tumor angiogenesis by using various types of anti-angiogenic agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Folkman1">[11]</xref>. Angiogenesis is a critical mechanism for tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Folkman2">[12]</xref>. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins is one of the most potent and specific positive regulators of angiogenesis. These proteins bind to three tyrosine kinase receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1/Flt-1), VEGFR2 (KDR/fetal liver kinase 1, Flk-1), and VEGFR3 (Flt-4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Neufeld1">[13]</xref>. VEGFR2 is the major mediator of mitogenic, angiogenic, and permeability-enhancing effects of VEGF in endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Ferrara1">[14]</xref>. VEGFR2-null mice die in utero between days 8.5 and 9.5 with no signs of vasculogenesis or organized blood vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Shalaby1">[15]</xref>. Thus, VEGFR2 plays a crucial role in the processes of vascularization and angiogenesis. Recent studies in mice have shown that tumor angiogenesis can also be inhibited when cellular immune responses are induced against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Li1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Niethammer1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we present a novel vaccination strategy to induce VEGFR2-specific CD8 T cells in mice orally vaccinated with attenuated recombinant <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium. Induction of cytotoxic T cells targeting VEGFR2-positive endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature was achieved by cytosolic delivery of the H-2D<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8 T-cell epitope VILTNPISM ( = KDR2) from the murine VEGFR2 using <italic>Salmonella</italic>'s T3SS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Dong1">[18]</xref>. The efficacy of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> T3SS-based vaccination against VEGFR2 was evaluated in a prophylactic setting in mice that received B16F10 melanoma cells in their right flank. In additional experiments, the same immunization strategy was used to reduce dissemination of melanoma pulmonary metastases. In both tumor models, we could show that vaccination against VEGFR2 reduced angiogenesis and tumor growth significantly, highlighting the potential of this novel vaccination protocol for cancer immunotherapy.</p>

        <p>To obtain a <italic>Salmonella</italic> vaccine strain for anti-angiogenic immunotherapy, a protein fragment containing the immunodominant KDR2 (VILTNPISM) epitope of the murine VEGFR2 was fused to YopE.

        <p>Tetrameric H2-K<sup>d</sup>/KDR2<sub>400–408</sub> complexes were used to characterize the development of KDR2-specific effector (T<sub>EC</sub>), effector memory (T<sub>EMC</sub>) and central memory (T<sub>CMC</sub>) CD8 T cells in spleens of immunized mice by co-staining with CD62L and CD127.

On day 30, 3×10<sup>5</sup> B16F10 melanoma cells were applied subcutaneously into the flank of mice and tumor growth was monitored for two weeks. At the end of the experiment, on day 44, tumors from mice of all three groups were prepared for histological analysis. Haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining revealed the typical structure of melanoma tumor tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034214-g004">Fig. 4a, i–iii</xref>). Endothelial cells are an essential part of blood vessels and express CD31 (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule, PECAM-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-DeLisser1">[31]</xref>. Thus, CD31 staining reveals the amount of blood vessels in tumor sections.

        <title>Vaccination with <italic>Salmonella</italic> SB824 (pHR584) reduces dissemination of melanoma pulmonary metastases</title>
        <p>Tumor vaccination using <italic>Salmonella</italic> SB824 (pHR584) was also tested in a B16 melanoma metastasis model. Therefore, C57Bl/6 mice were orogastrically vaccinated with SB824 (pHR584) followed by a tumor challenge with an intravenous injection of B16 melanoma cells on day 30. Mice of the control group remained non-immunized. Two weeks after the challenge (day 44), lungs were prepared from sacrificed mice and analyzed for metastatic growth. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034214-g006">Fig. 6a and b</xref> show macroscopic views of the lungs and magnified single lobes from ten mice of both experimental groups. Remarkable differences in the appearance of the lungs were obvious. Lungs of non-immunized mice seemed to be almost totally covered with melanoma metastases, whereas lungs of vaccinated mice revealed only single metastatic spots on their surfaces. Using Photoshop software, the amount of metastases and the surface area of the lungs covered with metastases could be determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034214-g006">Fig. 6c and d</xref>). In lungs of mice immunized with SB824 (pHR584), the average metastatic burden (48 spots) was reduced by approximately 60% as compared to non-immunized mice (118 spots) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034214-g006">Fig. 6c</xref>). About 35% of the lung surface areas from mice of the former group were covered with metastases, whereas the lungs from mice of the latter group revealed almost 90% coverage with metastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034214-g006">Fig. 6d</xref>). Interestingly, the health condition of mice vaccinated with SB824 (pHR584) appeared to be unaltered. In contrast, non-immunized mice showed signs of sickness like anorexia and malnutrition during the time of metastatic dissemination. Mice vaccinated with plasmid-less SB824 revealed a comparable metastatic burden and similar signs of sickness as non-immunized mice (data not shown). Thus, a <italic>Salmonella</italic>-mediated unspecific “bystander-effect” responsible for reduced dissemination of pulmonary metastases is unlikely.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Live attenuated bacteria (e. g. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>Mycobacteria</italic>) have been widely used as vaccine carriers for foreign antigen display to induce cell-mediated immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Medina1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Kotton1">[2]</xref>. In the past, the T3SS of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium became an attractive tool for heterologous protein delivery directly into the cytosol of macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in vigorous antigen-specific CD8 T cell priming and the induction of protective immunity against viruses, bacteria and tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Rssmann1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Roider1">[7]</xref>. Unquestionable, CD8 T cells play a pivotal role in the host defence against viruses, intracellular bacteria and tumors. However, the induction of potent CD8 T cell responses to fight microbes or cancer remains a major challenge in vaccine development. Here we show that T3SS-mediated antigen delivery by <italic>Salmonella</italic> can be used for vaccination against VEGFR2 to block tumor angiogenesis.</p>
      <p>Tumor angiogenesis is a very attractive target for cancer therapy for several obvious reasons. In general, angiogenesis is required for tumor growth implicating that an anti-angiogenic vaccination approach can be theoretically used to fight a number of different tumor types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Li1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Niethammer1">[17]</xref>. Targeting endothelial cells instead of cancer cells benefits from the genetic stability of benign cells in contrast to malign tumor cells. Endothelial cells are not associated with mutations or downregulation of MHC molecules for antigen presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Li1">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature are readily and better accessible for therapeutics (effector T cells, antibodies) via the bloodstream than tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Nair1">[32]</xref>. Eventually, targeting endothelial cells for tumor therapy bears a multiplicity effect because each tumor vessel supplies hundreds of tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Okaji1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>VEGFR2, which is upregulated on proliferating endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature, plays an essential role in tumor neoangiogenesis and is therefore an ideal target for anti-angiogenic therapy approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Li1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Niethammer1">[17]</xref>. The importance of VEGFR2 in antitumor therapy was demonstrated in several studies using different strategies. Besides approved drugs like the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab targeting VEGF-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Salgaller1">[34]</xref>, diverse studies in preclinical and clinical trials efficiently showed the antitumor effect of fixed xenogeneic endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Wei1">[35]</xref>, VEGFR2-conjugated proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Liu1">[36]</xref>, VEGFR2-pulsed dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Li1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Nair1">[32]</xref>, liposomal peptides of the fibroblast growth factor-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Plum1">[37]</xref>, several DNA-vaccines against survivin, integrin β<sub>3</sub>, VEGFR and VEGFR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Okaji1">[33]</xref> and viral vectors for DNA-vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Lyons1">[38]</xref>. Niethammer <italic>et al.</italic> could show that DNA-vaccination can block tumor angiogenesis by induction of a T cellular immune response against VEGFR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Niethammer1">[17]</xref>. This DNA-vaccine efficiently protected mice from the growth of melanoma, colon carcinoma and small lung cell carcinoma cells and reduced metastasis.</p>
      <p>Our novel vaccination strategy to induce VEGFR2-specific CD8 T cells in mice is based on a recombinant <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain that delivers the H-2D<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8 T-cell epitope VILTNPISM ( = KDR2) from the murine VEGFR2 directly into the cytosol of antigen-presenting cells via the bacterium's T3SS. In mice orally immunized with the <italic>Salmonella</italic> vaccine strain SB824 (pHR584), KDR2-specific CD8 T cells aimed to target endothelial cells were directly monitored by KDR2-MHC class I-tetramer staining. The latter technique was further used to characterize the development of KDR2-specific effector, effector memory and central memory CD8 T cells in murine spleens by co-staining with CD62L and CD127 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Huster1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Kaech1">[39]</xref>. Effector and memory T cells display diversity with respect to their effector functions, homing potential, and proliferative capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Sallusto1">[40]</xref>. T<sub>EC</sub> dominate the expansion phase, migrate to peripheral organs, and display immediate effector function. T<sub>EMC</sub> preferentially home to peripheral tissues and respond to antigen encounter with immediate effector function but poor numeric expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Huster2">[41]</xref>. In contrast, T<sub>CMC</sub> home to lymphoid organs, can vigorously expand upon antigen reencounter and are therefore potentially assigned to the crucial T cell population that confers long-lasting protective immunity against microbial pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Huster3">[42]</xref>. However, proliferative capacity does not necessarily correlate with protection against infection, since T<sub>CMC</sub>-like CD8 T cells induced by vaccination with heat-killed <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> reveal vigorous proliferation and expansion after challenge with live <italic>Listeria</italic>, but do not protect against listeriosis as determined by clearance of the bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Lauvau1">[43]</xref>. These findings were supported by a recent study demonstrating that T<sub>EMC</sub> are more effective than T<sub>CMC</sub> in conferring protection in the murine <italic>Listeria</italic> infection model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Huster2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Berchtold1">[44]</xref>. As mentioned above, the analysis of the kinetics of KDR2-specific CD8 T cell subpopulation formation after SB824 (pHR584) vaccination revealed a clear trend towards the induction of both memory T cell subsets. Proliferation of tumor cells appears less fast as bacterial cell division. It is tempting to speculate that KDR2-specific T<sub>CMC</sub> and T<sub>EMC</sub> constitute an ideal pair of CD8 T cell subsets to tackle cancer cells. However, further experiments such as functional <italic>ex vivo</italic> assays analyzing the killing activity and cytokine production are needed to characterize KDR2-specific CD8 T cells and their impact on the observed anti-tumor effects.</p>
      <p>In further experiments, the efficacy of <italic>Salmonella</italic> T3SS-based vaccination was evaluated in a prophylactic setting to protect mice from lethal challenges with B16F10 melanoma cells in a xenograft flank tumor model, and to reduce dissemination of spontaneous pulmonary metastases in a B16 melanoma model. As compared to non-immunized mice, immunofluorescence staining of flank tumor sections with an antibody against CD31 revealed a reduction of angiogenesis in the solid melanoma by 62% in mice vaccinated with SB824 (pHR584). Most likely, this effect was mediated by KDR2-specific CD8 T cells that specifically recognized and destroyed VEGFR2-positive endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature. As a consequence, tumor growth was significantly reduced in vaccinated mice by approximately 50%. Niethammer and colleagues have previously demonstrated a comparable anti-angiogenic effect using a DNA-vaccination strategy against VEGFR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Niethammer1">[17]</xref>. They observed a reduction of angiogenesis by 70% in a colon carcinoma model. Dong <italic>et al.</italic> used a vaccination approach with KDR peptides and reported a reduction of angiogenesis by 70%, too <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Dong1">[18]</xref>. Similarly to our <italic>Salmonella</italic>-based vaccination strategy, this peptide-mediated immunization decreased tumor growth by 50%.</p>
      <p>In the artificial lung metastasis model, immunization with SB824 (pHR584) resulted in a reduction of the metastatic melanoma burden by approximately 60%. An even higher rate of reduction (∼85%) was demonstrated by Li and colleagues using dendritic cells pulsed with VEGFR2-peptid for vaccination purposes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Li1">[16]</xref>. In our experimental set-up, about 35% of the lung surface areas from mice vaccinated with SB824 (pHR584) were covered with metastases, whereas the lungs from non-immunized mice showed 90% coverage with metastases. DNA vaccination against VEGFR2 by Niethammer <italic>et al.</italic> also counteracted the process of metastasis. Less than 20% of the surface area of murine lungs was covered with metastases as compared to more than 50% in non-vaccinated mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Niethammer1">[17]</xref>. Thus, interference of specific CD8 T cells with angiogenesis impedes the efficient formation of metastases.</p>
      <p>Since VEGFR2 is also expressed at lower levels in normal vascular endothelium, vaccination against this receptor could theoretically cause side effects or an autoimmune response. In the DNA vaccination approach of Niethammer <italic>et al.</italic> the wound healing was delayed following vaccination but the fertility of mice was not affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Niethammer1">[17]</xref>. Controversially, Li <italic>et al.</italic> did not observe a delay in wound healing by dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination against VEGFR2. However, the authors found an inhibitory effect of DC-VEGFR2 immunization on fetal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Li1">[16]</xref>. Finally, Dong <italic>et al.</italic> did not detect any obvious side effects following vaccination with antigenic peptides against VEGFR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Dong1">[18]</xref>. In our study, we did not detect any obvious side effects either.</p>
      <p>An interesting question arises from the observation that the vaccine strain SB824 (pHR584) was recovered from the gut, lymph nodes and even the spleen as early as two days after orogastric application. What is the site of KDR2-specific CD8 T-cell priming? Further experiments are needed to determine whether these antigen-specific T cells are derived from the gut, and then disseminate to the spleen or to the site of tumor growth, or, alternatively, are stimulated in lymph nodes.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Nishikawa <italic>et al.</italic> observed the phenomenon of epitope spreading using the <italic>Salmonella</italic> T3SS as an antigen delivery system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Nishikawa1">[45]</xref>. The authors engineered a serovar Typhimurium strain expressing the human germ cell antigen NY-ESO-1 via the T3SS. NY-ESO-1 is often expressed by tumor cells but not by normal somatic cells. Oral administration of serovar Typhimurium NY-ESO-1 to mice led to the regression of established NY-ESO-1-expressing tumors. However, intratumoral inoculation of this <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain into NY-ESO-1-negative tumors resulted in the delivery of the antigen <italic>in vivo</italic> and led to tumor regression in the presence of preexisting NY-ESO-1-specific CD8 T cells. In addition, specific T-cell responses against at least two unrelated tumor antigens not contained in the vaccine strain were observed, demonstrating epitope spreading. In future experiments we will investigate whether the phenomenon of epitope spreading also influences <italic>Salmonella</italic> T3SS-mediated vaccination against VEGFR2.</p>
      <p>This is the first report demonstrating that <italic>Salmonella</italic> T3SS-mediated antigen delivery can be used for efficient VEGFR2-specific CD8 T cell induction. This novel method of cancer immunotherapy might complement or even boost other anti-angiogenesis immunization strategies such as DNA or peptide vaccination. To confirm the general potential of our <italic>Salmonella</italic>-based vaccination strategy to elicit an anti-tumor effect, we plan to use several tumor lines in future experiments. Interestingly, is has recently been demonstrated for the first time that a VEGFR2-expressing subset of T regulatory T cells (Tregs) exists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Suzuki1">[46]</xref>. It is conceivable that VEGFR2 might become a new therapeutic target for controlling Tregs with highly suppressive function in tumor immunotherapy. Furthermore, two recently published studies have identified blood vessels grown directly from cancer cells suggesting that tumor cells build-up their own vasculature using a mechanism related to cancer-stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-RicciVitiani1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034214-Wang1">[48]</xref>. These new findings reinforce the need for alternative anti-angiogenic vaccination strategies.</p>
