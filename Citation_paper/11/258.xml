      <abstract>
        <p>Methods derived from ecological niche modeling allow to define species distribution based on presence-only data. This is particularly useful to develop models from literature records such as available for the <italic>Anopheles dirus</italic> complex, a major group of malaria mosquito vectors in Asia. This research defines an innovative modeling design based on presence-only model and hierarchical framework to define the distribution of the complex and attempt to delineate sibling species distribution and environmental preferences. At coarse resolution, the potential distribution was defined using slow changing abiotic factors such as topography and climate representative for the timescale covered by literature records of the species. The distribution area was then refined in a second step using a mask of current suitable land cover. Distribution area and ecological niche were compared between species and environmental factors tested for relevance. Alternatively, extreme values at occurrence points were used to delimit environmental envelopes. The spatial distribution for the complex was broadly consistent with its known distribution and influencing factors included temperature and rainfall. If maps developed from environmental envelopes gave similar results to modeling when the number of sites was high, the results were less similar for species with low number of recorded presences. Using presence-only models and hierarchical framework this study not only predicts the distribution of a major malaria vector, but also improved ecological modeling analysis design and proposed final products better adapted to malaria control decision makers. The resulting maps can help prioritizing areas which need further investigation and help simulate distribution under changing conditions such as climate change or reforestation. The hierarchical framework results in two products one abiotic based model describes the potential maximal distribution and remains valid for decades and the other including a biotic mask easy to update with frequently available information gives current species distribution.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The <italic>Anopheles dirus</italic> complex (Peyton &amp; Ramalingam, 1988) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Sallum1">[1]</xref> includes the most efficient malaria vectors of Asia and species transmitting Artemisin-resistant malaria parasites which could compromise control efforts globally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Dondorp1">[2]</xref>. If the complex is typically associated with forests, specimens have been recorded in other landscapes reshaped by human activities such as orchards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Rosenberg1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Kengluecha1">[6]</xref>. In countries where vast areas have not yet been surveyed, overall mapping is needed to allow targeting priority areas for additional surveys and surveillance. A geographical review gathering current ecological knowledge and environmental preferences for the seven species of the complex, and 200 geo-referenced collection sites including literature records proposes a general distribution map of known occurrences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Obsomer1">[7]</xref>. Similar geo-referenced sites have been used to predict the distribution of <italic>An. dirus sensu lato</italic> using presence-absence model where artificial absences are based on expert knowledge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Sinka1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Various methods derived from the ecological niche concept <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Hutchinson1">[9]</xref> offer successful techniques to map species literature records <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Elith1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Stockwell1">[14]</xref>. Particularities of such datasets include low geographical precision and presence-only records. Indeed, site location is often not accurate and success in capture depends on sampling technique, seasonality and short-term changing meteorological conditions impeding the record of reliable absences. Additionally, remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technologies increase the availability of environmental digital datasets and geo-referenced species occurrence data which can be combined to estimate species distribution over a large region at coarse scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Foley1">[15]</xref>. Amongst those new modeling techniques, the Maxent method selected for this study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Phillips1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Phillips2">[16]</xref> performs particularly well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Elith1">[10]</xref>, does not require absence data and can be transferred to large areas with sparse or no species sampling records.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the above method is adapted to integrate the hierarchical framework suggested by Soberon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Soberon1">[17]</xref>. Indeed, explanatory factors used in models should be relevant for the timeframe and scale of the data. The distribution area is here defined in two steps. First slow changing abiotic factors are adapted for models based on historical records at coarse scale identify distribution areas according to physiological limits of the species (Grinnellian niche) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Grinnell1">[18]</xref> or what is considered here to be the potential niche. These factors include for <italic>An. dirus s.l.</italic> rain abundance and pattern, temperature, topography, soil type and relative humidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Obsomer1">[7]</xref>. The second step help evaluate the realized niche (Eltonian niche) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Elton1">[19]</xref> defined by reducing the potential niche according to relevant biotic factors available at finer scale. Biotic factors, accounting for interactions with other organisms (including vegetation), change fast and must be studied using recent data. Current forest coverage is the most relevant biotic factor driving <italic>An. dirus s.l</italic>. distribution.</p>

      <p>This study further tried to delineate distribution per species using the same methodology and to identify bionomics differences. Indeed, if the low number of sibling species records challenges potential analysis, clarifying bionomics differences and distribution per species is seen as a prerequisite for efficient control because of behaviour differences influencing efficiency of particular control measures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Sinka1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The objectives of this study are to (1) Delimit the potential range of distribution for the Dirus complex (<italic>An. dirus sensu lato</italic>) and siblings species in Asia, (2) Assess the influence of environmental factors, (3) Identify potential differences between sibling species.</p>

        <p>Long term climatic datasets of monthly temperature and rainfall came from Worldclim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Hijmans1">[23]</xref> which provided also bioclimatic variables at 1 km, and CRU CL2.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-New1">[24]</xref> which provided also number of monthly rainy days, rainfall monthly variation and relative humidity at 15 km resolution. The datasets are based on meteorological stations data from 1950 to 2000. The mean, median, maximum, minimum and standard deviation of the monthly values were calculated, as well as the number of months with mean temperature under 20 degrees and with less than 5 rainy days.</p>

          <title>Data reduction and groups of variables</title>
          <p>To choose between the hundred abiotic variables at 1 km and 15 km, the variables were classified according to their possible contribution to very basic ecological questions: is there enough or too much rain? Is the rain and temperature pattern adequate? Is the temperature too high or too low? Are soils and topography adapted to breeding sites? Following Buermann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Buermann1">[30]</xref>, the covariance between pairs of variables was estimated. Single variable Maxent models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Phillips1">[13]</xref> assessed importance of each variable to the distribution of <italic>An. dirus s.l.</italic> and trends of observed frequency and predicted suitability curves were compared and check for coherence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Buermann1">[30]</xref> in order to select which layers from correlated pairs (with Pearson’ correlations coefficient equal or higher than 0.8) to retain for further analysis. While Maxent deals elegantly with highly correlated variables without influence on the output, the selection of non correlated variables make biological interpretation easier. Based on those preliminary results, one or two variables were selected per ecological questions for the 15 km and the 1 km dataset.</p>
          <p>Three groups of abiotic variables were evaluated (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050475.s006">Table S1</xref>): (1) the most important climate datasets regarding species biology (CLIM) (2) datasets corresponding to ecological questions (ECO) and (3) the 10 variables performing the best (ECOOPT). The models were built for the <italic>An. dirus</italic> complex, then for the sibling species <italic>An. dirus s.s</italic>., <italic>An. baimaii</italic>, <italic>An. scanloni</italic>, <italic>An. nemophilous</italic> and <italic>An. crascens</italic>.

          <title>Modeling techniques</title>
          <p>Following the ecological niche modeling concept, the model was determined from a set of gridded variables with information available for all grid cells in a study area. The methods first defined the suitable niche for a species from the environmental values in the cells of occurrence and then, identified other cells in the study area corresponding to similar environmental conditions. The selected method in this study is Maxent (version 2.1.28; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/</ext-link>) which assessed the probability distribution of a species by estimating the probability distribution of the maximum entropy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Phillips1">[13]</xref>. The algorithm performed iterations in which the weights associated with the environmental variables, were adjusted to maximize the average probability of the sampled point locations (or average sample likelihood), expressed as the training gain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Phillips1">[13]</xref>. For all models run in this study, we used the Maxent default settings. The default output map interpreted as a relative suitability or probability for species occurrence is further transformed in percent of suitability. Transformation to a binary presence/absence map required selection of a threshold value. Four potential threshold were calculated to maximize different criterion: (1) equal test sensitivity and specificity, (2) maximum test sensitivity plus specificity, (3) balance training omission, predicted area and threshold value, (4) equate entropy of threshold and non-threshold distribution. The best performing threshold was selected as explained below <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Phillips1">[13]</xref>.</p>

          <p>To challenge the models, the recommended 50% of the samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Liu1">[31]</xref> were set aside for validation. The models were run 100 times with test samples chosen randomly at each repetition.

          <p>Threshold-dependent evaluation based on presence/absence map relies on test statistics to evaluate if the model performs better than random <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Phillips1">[13]</xref>. In particular, the extrinsic omission rate, defined as the fraction of test localities that fall into pixels outside the predicted area, was assessed and a one-tailed binomial test determine whether the model predicts better than random. The lowest extrinsic omission rate also characterized the best model. Threshold independent evaluation was performed using value of the Area Under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve (AUC) frequently used in species distribution modeling literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Hanley1">[32]</xref>. In this case, the AUC was typically used as a measure of model performance between models of the same species, which avoid the drawback recently highlighted in the use of this index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Lobo1">[33]</xref>.

In our case, the metric was based on the difference between probability of occurrence for two species in a given grid cell integrated over the whole study area and transformed to get values ranging from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (identical niche).

      <p>According to threshold dependent and independent evaluation methods (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050475.s007">Table S2</xref>), ECOOPT at a resolution of 1 km (ECOOPT1) was the best performing abiotic model. Performances were generally stable with highly performance for AUC values test (90%) and highly significant extrinsic omission rates of 50% test samples regardless of the criteria used to cut off suitability value between absence and presence. According to the threshold criteria (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050475.s008">Table S3</xref>), the suitability value selected as cut off between presence and absence varied according to the species. For all species, the threshold values selected following the criteria of maximizing the specificity and sensitivity offered the best discrimination with the highest cut off value for a low omission rate (1% or less) and was used for delineating subsequent potential distribution maps. The models developed for species with a low number of samples, <italic>An. crascens</italic>, <italic>An. scanloni</italic> and <italic>An. nemophilous</italic>, are less reliable due to the low number of samples compared to the number of variables.</p>

        <title>Step 1: Potential Distribution Area: the “Potential Niche”</title>
        <p>The suitability maps based on the mean of the 100 replicates of model ECOOPT1 depict the potential distribution areas for the complex and the species with reasonable sample size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050475-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The model based only on abiotic factors depicted properly the northern limit of the distribution of <italic>An. dirus s.l</italic>., absence in most parts of India, presence in the island of Hainan and absence in the north of Vietnam as observed in the field. The binary map of presence/absence was also consistent with known distribution. The potential distribution in Sri Lanka and Indonesia fitted with the occurrence of species belonging to other species of the Leucospyrus group. For species such as <italic>An. dirus</italic> s.s and <italic>An. baimaii</italic> with reasonable number of samples, distribution area was restricted compared to <italic>An. dirus</italic> complex and might be smaller than its actual distribution. This is particularly the case when looking at the binary presence/absence maps in the case of <italic>An. baimaii</italic> and there might be an artifact link to the choice of the threshold. When looking at the suitability maps instead of binary maps (Inset map <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050475-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), <italic>An. baimaii</italic> was predicted more southwards than its known distribution but was absent from the coast of Vietnam.</p>

The environmental variables which show good performance for at least one species are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050475-t001">Table 1</xref> with their limit values. Temperature related factors had the highest influence on the distribution of the species.

        <p>The annual rainfall (A: &gt;1500 mm) and the rainfall distribution pattern with frequent rains in the rainy season (B: &gt;20 days/month) and sporadic rains in the dry season (C) characterized the occurrence area for the complex, but the influence of rainfall was not very strong (gain &lt;0.5) compared to temperature. <italic>An. baimaii</italic> occurred in areas presenting a lower amount of rainfall (A) but more frequent rain (B) while the distribution area of <italic>An. crascens</italic> was correlated with higher amount of rainfall (A). Regarding rainfall patterns, <italic>An. dirus s.s.</italic> distribution area was characterized by a shorter dry season (C) and a less regular annual pattern (D) than observed for <italic>An. crascens</italic>.</p>
        <p>A mean temperature (F) of at least 20°C throughout the year seemed to characterize the distribution area of the complex with a mean annual temperature (J) ranging from 23–27.5°C and a variation of 1–5°C(I). Low temperatures seemed to limit the distribution to the north and high temperatures in west India, central Vietnam and central Thailand. Daily extreme temperature showed similar trends with maximum temperature never being too high and above 24°C during the coldest month (E). Minimum temperature was between 11–22.5°C during the coldest month and between 19–25°C during the warmest month (H). If studying interaction between rainfall and temperature, distribution areas presented a mean temperature of 24–28°C during the rainy season (L) and 18–27°C during the dry season (K). Species specific thresholds were overall similar with lower tolerance for temperature variation in general. <italic>An. crascens</italic> was found in areas with the smallest mean temperature variation (I &lt;1°C) and the highest minimum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050475.s005">Figure S4</xref>) and maximum temperature (E).</p>
        <p>The other variables were more difficult to interpret. The complex occurred mostly in area of low soil water storage capacity in Southeast Asia but also in high water storage capacity in India thus no clear trend could be derived from this variable.

        <p>While limit values can characterize the behavior of outliers and thus not be representative of the general species distribution, the environmental envelope approach predicts the extremes in the distribution of species, which is useful to explain the incapability of species to colonize some areas (e.g. <italic>An. dirus</italic> in northern Vietnam). The map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050475-g006">Figure 6</xref> showed in white the areas of suitable abiotic environment. Fourteen sites were selected on the map in regions predicted as unfavorable to the vector in order to investigate which variables presented values above or below the limit for those areas. For example when searching for a limit to the west (star 12) the annual rainfall as well as rainfall during the wettest quarter was low with a number of rainy day always low and too many months with less than 5 days rain. Temperature was high during the wettest quarter and minimum temperature was also high with high temperature variations. In eastern India (star 8), the situation was similar to the red river delta on the coast of Vietnam (star 1) with high mean temperature during the wettest quarter.</p>

      <p>Lack of information on vectors distribution and environmental preferences are major drawbacks in malaria elimination effort <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-The1">[41]</xref>.

In addition to maps plotting occurrences, distribution models predict areas where the presence or absence is unknown such as South Nepal where few investigations have been carried out. In countries where vast areas have not yet been surveyed, it helps prioritize highest occurrence risk areas. Predictions based on environmental variables help simulate distribution under changing conditions such as climate change or reforestation. But moreover, the hierarchical framework improved the potential use of the results in several ways by (1) providing a potential distribution map based on abiotic factors and valid for several decades (2) providing a current distribution map based on vegetation coverage whose validity date can be identified, here the acquisition time of satellite images used to derive the biotic factors (year 2005) (3) providing easy update by non specialist. Indeed, regular update of mask of the fast changing biotic factors does not require rerunning the abiotic model and take advantages of increasingly available update of these products (4) avoiding the use of expert knowledge which make modeling a lengthy and costly process (5) providing GIS maps at 1 km for zooming in areas of interest and overlaying other layers (See Zip File Archive SGISFILE01) (6) providing suitability map ranging from 0–100% giving an estimated risk when decision makers decided to carry or not surveillance in a given area (7) providing two products for decision tool. Indeed, the potential distribution map of areas with favourable abiotic factors represents the maximal extent of the complex in case of reforestation. Thus favourable areas with forest delineate the current distribution area while favourable areas without forest are potential extension zones in case of reforestation. Such large scale reforestation is current in China and other countries of Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Fang1">[42]</xref> but newly available habitat might not be as suitable as natural forest. There the species might adapt to new biotic factors such as orchards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Overgaard1">[43]</xref>. Outside of this area, the abiotic factors are not favorable.</p>
      <p>The method deals with two recurrent problems in ecology: unreliable absences and mapping old species data with fast changing biotic variables. Accurate distribution model were processed without requiring expert knowledge to correct or train the model. Expert knowledge can create bias in the analysis and quality of the information is difficult to assess or may vary regionally. The hierarchical framework improved the analysis design by modelling literature records based on variables relevant from the same time frame, while still integrating relevant biotic data. The separation of abiotic and biotic factors is not new <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Hutchinson2">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Guisan1">[46]</xref>. If biotic factors such as forest cover are dependent of abiotic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Srivastava1">[47]</xref>, current forest distribution is also the reflection of land use and thus a fast changing biotic factor. The use of biotic factor in a mask and not in the model avoided correlation issues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Chase1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>An. dirus s.l</italic>. predicted distribution is consistent with its known distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Obsomer1">[7]</xref>. The models predict however presence of the complex in region where it has never been recorded such as in the Andaman Islands, the Philippines and Indonesia which are inhabited by related species of the Leucosphyrus group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Harbach1">[49]</xref>. Those islands might not be accessible to the specie or alternatively, the genetic variation between the members of the Leucosphyrus group might not be linked to environmental preference but depends on evolution history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-OLoughlin1">[50]</xref>. The distribution maps for the sibling species reflect only partly the known distribution. Our study managed to highlight differences between species. It is however unknown if those are environmental preferences or species are developing at the margin of the complex distribution range in a less favorable environment. <italic>An. crascens</italic> and <italic>An. takasagoensis</italic> which live in the wettest areas are also the less efficient vectors. One could suggest that a given species is a vector in a source population and non vector if in a sink population. This is anyway not the case for <italic>An. dirus s.s.</italic> which transmits systematically the disease when present even if in areas favorable only in the rainy season. Rascalou (2012) also indicates that sink vector populations can represent serious threats to human health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Rascalou1">[51]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The distribution of <italic>An. dirus s.l.</italic> has been previously predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Sinka1">[8]</xref> using Boosted Regression Tree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Elith1">[10]</xref>. While this method produced valuable map for <italic>An. dirus s.l</italic>., it relies on absence data artificially created based on expert knowledge thus adding a bias unnecessary in our modeling technique. In this context we used a method proposed by Phillips <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Warren1">[34]</xref> for selection of background data by including in pseudo absences a spatial bias similar to the potential bias of presence data. Species with few sampling sites were mostly discovered while searching for other more widely distributed species and probably present stronger sampling bias. Additional improvements are illustrated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050475-g007">Figure 7</xref>. (1) The use of higher resolution dataset allowed better delineation of favourable areas and reduced the superficies of the region requiring surveillance. While the resolution of the abiotic dataset used for modeling the potential distribution cannot be easily improved because of necessary adequacy with the precision of the site sampling location, the fact that the biotic factors are added as a mask allow to keep this dataset in full resolution and thus provide a more detailed resulting map (2) Strong deforestation occurs in Cambodia and a model integrating biotic factors averaged on 20 year period lose the pertinence of up-to-date information. The use of up to date biotic information for our model managed to capture this fast changes in the forest cover leading to a far more accurate map (3) The use of averaged biotic data in the model do not allow to give a precise date at which the model could predict valid distribution. Such model is thus difficult to use in the field. Our model is valid for year 2005. (4) Additionally, the output format in pdf does not allow zooming in area of interest and do not allow overlaying other layers. A GIS format allows better interaction with potential user and will lead to improved quality.</p>
      <p>The models result is limited by the quality of the variables which present two main drawbacks. Ecological model should be based on source populations. Those are sustainable populations living in suitable habitat while sink populations are surviving in habitat not suitable for population persistence thanks to immigration from nearby source population. Typical museum records include both sink and source populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Soberon1">[17]</xref>. Entomological data are also mostly available from the nineties with the development of sibling species identification methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Sallum1">[1]</xref> while the climatic variables range from 1950 to 2000. Predictive mapping of species with low number of recorded occurrence could be improved by selection of a fixed threshold which was shown to improve model performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Pearson1">[52]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This study is a first step in delineating potential and current distribution of the <italic>An. dirus</italic> complex. It shows that using wide scale abiotic variables based mostly on climate, it is already possible to refine the potential distribution area. Fine scale mapping of other biotic factors relevant for the mosquito survival such as presence of host, breeding sites, state of the forest cover is needed to further reduce the predicted area. Those maps could thus be integrated into more functional models such as agent-based models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Linard1">[53]</xref>. Such models can be very useful for decision makers by providing a risk assessment to their mosquito control surveillance program and strategy. More detailed analysis using concomitant entomological data and biotic information could help to refine the distribution and favorable vegetation types. <italic>An. dirus s.l.</italic> is believed to recede during the dry season in forest areas where the moisture remains high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Obsomer1">[7]</xref>. Studies at highest resolution could localize the restricted area of distribution in the dry season to help in focus vector control activities.</p>
      <p>In the context of climate changes, the land cover has been identified as one of the key variables influencing the climate (Essential Climate Variables) and will thus probably soon beneficiate of regular, standardized and faster updating of detailed information. Recently, major mapping effort for malaria vectors led to the gathering of large databases of record sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050475-Sinka1">[8]</xref> which will offer more opportunity to test the methodology and refine the distribution.</p>
