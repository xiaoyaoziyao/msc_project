        <p>It is known that βig-h3 is involved in the invasive process of many types of tumors, but its mechanism in glioma cells has not been fully clarified. Using immunofluorescent double-staining and confocal imaging analysis, and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that βig-h3 co-localized with integrin α5β1 in U87 cells. We sought to elucidate the function of this interaction by performing cell invasion assays and gelatin zymography experiments. We found that siRNA knockdowns of βig-h3 and calpain-2 impaired cell invasion and MMP secretion. Moreover, βig-h3, integrins and calpain-2 are known to be regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and they are also involved in tumor cell invasion. Therefore, we further investigated if calpain-2 was relevant to βig-h3-integrin α5β1 interaction to affect U87 cell invasion. Our data showed that βig-h3 co-localized with integrin α5β1 to enhance the invasion of U87 cells, and that calpain-2, is involved in this process, acting as a downstream molecule.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Gliomas have a high incidence rate, and represent the most common form of primary intracranial tumors. They are generally malignant and highly invasive to surrounding structures, and prognosis is largely correlated with tumor stage. Because of these fatal characteristics, it is hard to perform complete resection by surgery. Although much work has been done to find clues as to invasive biomarkers and effective treatment methods, the molecular mechanisms need to be further investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-VanMeir1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-inducible gene-h3 (βig-h3) is widely expressed in various types of tumor cells. Though it is not normally expressed in tissues of the central nervous system, it was demonstrated to be expressed in U87 human astrocytoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Yun1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Kim1">[3]</xref>. According to its molecular structure and functions, different names have been assigned to the protein, such as TGFBI, RGD-CAP, and MP78/70. Previous studies have demonstrated that by interacting with integrin α3β1 or regulating store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, βig-h3 promotes the migration and invasive ability of tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Guo1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Tang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Bae1">[6]</xref>. However, the role of βig-h3 in affecting glioma cell invasion in the transduction pathway remains to be investigated.</p>
      <p>Integrins are transmembrane heterodimers composed of α and β chains that provide physical and functional links between cell-cell and cell-ECM (extracellular matrix) interactions to mediate many cellular activities in tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Zeng1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Delamarre1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Barczyk1">[9]</xref>. As we know, the interaction of integrins with ECM is related to cell viability and invasion. Proteins such as EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) can interact with integrins to enhance the progression of hepatoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Tang2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Dai1">[11]</xref>. In the present study, we found that βig-h3 co-localized with integrin α5β1 in U87 cells. However, very little information is available regarding the potential roles of this phenomenon. Given that βig-h3 and integrin can be involved in tumor invasion, the interaction of βig-h3 with integrin α5β1 may also affect the invasion of U87 cells.</p>
      <p>Cell invasion is a characteristic of most malignant tumors, and in glioma cells this process is often mediated by calpain-2, a calcium-dependent thiol proteinase, which consists of a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Jang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Huang1">[13]</xref>. It can be activated by millimolar levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enhance tumor invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Goll1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Carragher1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Roumes1">[16]</xref>. We presume that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the “key point” among βig-h3, integrin α5β1 and calpain-2, and therefore attempted to elucidate this relationship.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we showed that βig-h3 and integrin α5β1 form a complex, and that they activate MMP secretion and enhance invasive potential via its downstream molecule calpain-2 in U87 cells.</p>

        <title>siRNA knockdowns can inhibit the expression of βig-h3 and calpain-2 in U87 cells</title>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that βig-h3 and calpain-2 are expressed in U87 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Yun1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Kim1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Jang1">[12]</xref>. To obtain further information about their roles, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were transfected into U87 cells for 36 hours to knockdown βig-h3 and calpain-2 RNA and protein expression. Silencer negative control siRNAs (Snc-RNAs) were also used as a negative control, according to the manufacturer's protocol. As compared with snc-RNA treated cells, the siRNA knockdowns could effectively decrease the mRNA expression of βig-h3 and calpain-2 (47.9%±4.1% and 51.1%±3.5%, respectively), and the protein expression of βig-h3 and calpain-2 was significantly reduced to 43.4%±6.5% and 34.6%±2.0% (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037297-g001">Figure 1A–1D</xref>).</p>

        <title>βig-h3 co-localizes with integrin α5β1 on U87 cell membranes</title>
        <p>The invasive ability of human hepatoma cells is enhanced by the interaction of βig-h3 with integrin α3β1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Tang1">[5]</xref>. According to the study, we hypothesized that βig-h3 might interact with integrin α5β1 to affect the invasive ability of U87 cells. So we performed immunofluorescent double-staining and confocal imaging analysis to examine cellular distribution. The results showed that staining overlapped diffusely throughout the surface of U87 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037297-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To further confirm this result, Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to detect the immunoreactivity of βig-h3 and the integrin α5 and β1 subunits. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037297-g003">Figure 3B–3E</xref> indicates, βig-h3 and integrin α5β1 interacted in their native conformations in U87 cell lysates.</p>

        <title>Interaction of βig-h3 with integrin α5β1 mediates MMP secretion and cell invasion potential</title>
        <p>To identify the function of the interaction of βig-h3 with integrin α5β1, antibodies against the integrin subunits and βig-h3 were used. Integrin α5β1, which is composed of an α5 chain and a β1 chain, is a receptor for fibronectin that is a component of ECM. It recognizes the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) in its ligands. The “function blocking” antibodies, mouse anti-human α5 mAb (P1D6) and mouse anti-human β1 mAb (3S3), neutralize binding of α5β1 to the central cell adhesion domain of fibronectin. Such reaction may result in decrease of invasion potential and MMP secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Wayner1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Meng1">[20]</xref>. We treated U87 cells with P1D6, 3S3, P1D6+3S3 and si-βig-h3 for 36 h, and then examined the invasive ability and the presence of MMPs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037297-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>, no significant cell number and MMP density changes were found between the snc-RNA transfected alone groups and the no antibody treated groups (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.01). As compared with the snc-RNA treated alone cells, invasive potential were markedly decreased after treated with P1D6, 3S3 or P1D6+3S3 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01), but no significant difference were found in the groups, including blank+P1D6, blank+3S3, blank+P1D6+3S3, snc-RNA+P1D6, snc-RNA+3S3 and snc-RNA+P1D6+3S3 groups (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.01). Similar results were observed in βig-h3 siRNA transfected alone groups compared with snc-RNA treated alone groups and the no antibody treated groups (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01), but there were no significant differences in comparison with blank+P1D6, blank+3S3, blank+P1D6+3S3, snc-RNA+P1D6, snc-RNA+3S3 and snc-RNA+P1D6+3S3 groups (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.01). The addition of antibodies against α5 and/or β1 did not further reduce invasion or MMP secretion in βig-h3 siRNA transfected cells, compared with the cells treated with βig-h3 siRNA alone (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.01). These results indicated that βig-h3 and integrin α5β1 were both required for and dependent upon the invasion of U87 cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Studies of the molecular mechanism of invasion could reveal targets for glioma treatment. βig-h3, a 68 kDa extracellular matrix protein mainly induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), was first identified in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Skonier1">[21]</xref>. It is expressed in many cells and tissues including the heart, liver, stomach, skeletal muscle and kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Bae1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Skonier1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Frber1">[22]</xref>. Although its roles are largely unknown, it has been suggested that it involves in the regulation of many aspects of tumor cell processes, including cell adhesion, spreading, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Frber1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-DAbaco1">[25]</xref>. It has also been associated with corneal dystrophy, wound healing, atherosclerosis and many other human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Yun1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Thapa2">[26]</xref>. It contains four repetitive FAS-1 domains and an integrin recognition site named RGD sequence which can serve as a ligand of integrins. In this study, we focused on the receptors for βig-h3, the roles of which still remain largely unknown and tested if they could influence the invasive ability of U87 cells. The results presented here show that βig-h3 enhances the invasive potential of U87 cells by interacting with integrin α5β1.</p>
      <p>Integrins, a large family of cell matrix adhesion receptors, have been demonstrated to play important roles in many types of tumor cells. Through the interaction with the basement membrane, integrins can mediate adhesion and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Delamarre1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-DAbaco1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Sawhney1">[27]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that integrin α6β1 can enhance the aggressiveness of U87 glioma cells, and the apoptosis of Ntera2 neuronal cells, which are being evaluated to employ in central nervous system (CNS) transplantation, was delayed by the activation of integrin α5β1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Delamarre1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Gibson1">[28]</xref>. In particular, integrin α5-laminins can highly enhance the invasion of all types of glioma cells, and the migration of U251 glioma cells is downregulated by fibronectin, an ECM ligand of integrin α5β1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Kawataki1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Kita1">[30]</xref>. Therefore, it was not surprising that integrin inhibitors serve as a potential drug to prevent tumor cell invasion. JSM6427 and SJ749, inhibitors of integrin α5β1, attenuate glioma cell proliferation and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Frber1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Martin1">[31]</xref>. In the present study, we demonstrated that βig-h3 was positively related to the expression of integrin α5β1 and there are no previous reports about the signaling mechanism of βig-h3-integrin α5β1 interaction. We further observed that antibodies to α5 and/or β1 could effectively reduce βig-h3-mediated invasion and MMP secretion, and provided no significant additional inhibitory effect in U87 cells. Hence, we proposed a hypothesis that βig-h3 interaction with integrin α5β1 can regulate invasion of U87 cells.</p>
      <p>βig-h3 plays key roles in tumor cell invasion and previous study has demonstrated that it increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to enhance secretion of MMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Guo1">[4]</xref>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is known to be involved in the motility, apoptosis, proliferation of cancer cells, as well as invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Clapham1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Kim2">[33]</xref>. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) are crucial components in the signaling pathways of some integrins, and all may influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation. Specific inhibitors of these proteins can not only affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and its signaling pathway, but significantly block integrin-induced or βig-h3-induced invasion and MMP release. Calpains are proteins that belong to the family of calcium-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases, and are ubiquitously expressed in glioma cells. These include μ- and m-isozymes, and are involved in the degradation of the main components of matrix and glycan, which are correlated with many diseases such as Alzheimer's and stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Huang1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Tsubokawa1">[34]</xref>. Downregulation of calpains after transfection with calpain-1 (μ-calpain) or calpain-2 (m-calpain) siRNA could reduce the secretion of MMPs and attenuate the adhesive and invasive potentials of some tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Fan1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Wu1">[36]</xref>. ERK and MAPK are upstream molecules of calpains, and FAK is a common substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Seger1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037297-Huang2">[38]</xref>. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> might be a “medium” to affect the invasive ability promoted by βig-h3, integrin α5β1 and calpain-2, and the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. We speculate that βig-h3 enhances the invasion potential of U87 cells via integrin α5β1-calpain-2 signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>Our data demonstrates that βig-h3 activates MMP secretion and promotes invasive potential by interacting with integrin α5β1 via its downstream molecule calpain-2 in U87 cells. These results are significant in that they suggest that mechanisms regulating βig-h3-α5β1 interactions, and their role towards calpain-2 signaling may constitute a novel anti-glioma drug target.</p>
