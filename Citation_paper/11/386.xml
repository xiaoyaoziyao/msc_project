          <title>Background</title>
          <p>β-lapachone (β-lap) is a bioreductive agent that is activated by the two-electron reductase NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Although β-lap has been reported to induce apoptosis in various cancer types in an NQO1-dependent manner, the signaling pathways by which β-lap causes apoptosis are poorly understood.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>β-lap-induced apoptosis and related molecular signaling pathways in NQO1-negative and NQO1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells were investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors or siRNAs against factors involved in β-lap-induced apoptosis were used to clarify the roles played by such factors in β-lap-activated apoptotic signaling pathways. β-lap leads to clonogenic cell death and apoptosis in an NQO1- dependent manner. Treatment of NQO1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells with β-lap causes rapid disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, nuclear translocation of AIF and Endo G from mitochondria, and subsequent caspase-independent apoptotic cell death. siRNAs targeting AIF and Endo G effectively attenuate β-lap-induced clonogenic and apoptotic cell death. Moreover, β-lap induces cleavage of Bax, which accumulates in mitochondria, coinciding with the observed changes in mitochondria membrane potential. Pretreatment with Salubrinal (Sal), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor, efficiently attenuates JNK activation caused by β-lap, and subsequent mitochondria-mediated cell death. In addition, β-lap-induced generation and mitochondrial translocation of cleaved Bax are efficiently blocked by JNK inhibition.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Our results indicate that β-lap triggers induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, thereby leading to JNK activation and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. The signaling pathways that we revealed in this study may significantly contribute to an improvement of NQO1-directed tumor therapies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>β-lapachone (3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-5,6-dione; β-lap), a naturally occurring quinone obtained from the bark of the Lapacho tree (Tabebuia vellanedae), has been reported to exert a variety of pharmacological activities, such as anti-bacterial, -fungal, -trypanocidal, and -cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Pardee1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Guiraud1">[2]</xref>. ARQ501 is a formulation of β -lapachone complexed with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin for the treatment of human tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Dong1">[3]</xref>. In order to increase the clinical efficacy of β-lap, a novel method to improve intratumoral delivery of β-lap using polymer millirods has been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Dong1">[3]</xref>. The anti-cancer activity of β-lap was known to be due to two-electron reduction of β-lap mediated by NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1, DT-diaphorase) using NADH or NAD(P)H as electron sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Pardee1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Dong1">[3]</xref>. The NQO1 is expressed abundantly in various human solid cancers, including cancers of the breast, pancreas, lung, and colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Pardee1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Dong1">[3]</xref>. Therefore, β-lap can selectively kill these human cancer cells that overexpress endogenous NQO1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Lai1">[4]</xref>. Moreover, the futile cycling between the oxidized and reduced forms of β-lap caused by NQO1 leads to progressive depletion of NADH and NAD(P)H, which in turn induces a massive release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to cytosol, causing activation of calpain known as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent proteinase and subsequent apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Pardee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Guiraud1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Wuerzberger1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death has been demonstrated to be modulated by Bcl-2 family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Huang1">[6]</xref>. Among Bcl-2 family, Bax or Bak performs positive roles in the permeabilization of mitochondrial outer membranes by participating in the formation of pores, facilitating release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and endonuclease G (Endo G), from the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion to the cytosol. Cytosolic cytochrome <italic>c</italic> binds to apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), in a ternary complex with caspase-9, leading to caspase-9 activation; caspase-9 in turn activates caspase-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Park1">[7]</xref>. Cleavage of the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) by caspase-3 results in activation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD), which fragments DNA resulting in apoptotic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Park1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Joza1">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, AIF and Endo G released from mitochondria are translocated to the nucleus, within which these molecules trigger large-scale DNA fragmentation, and condense chromatin, leading to apoptotic cell death in a caspase-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Daugas1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Diverse chemotherapeutic agents have been suggested to cause proteolytic truncation of Bax, and trigger the mitochondrial cell death pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Yanase1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Cao1">[14]</xref>. In these reports, Bax is known to be truncated at aspartate 33 by calpain, resulting in the formation of an 18 kDa cleavage product that is more potent than native Bax in terms of stimulating mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Toyota1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Ariyama1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are members of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family, have been demonstrated to be activated in response to a variety of external stimuli, and these kinases participate in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Wada1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Johnson1">[19]</xref>. MAPKs can be subdivided into 3 major classes based on sequence homology: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38 MAPK, and stress-activated/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Johnson1">[19]</xref>. ERK is commonly thought to mediate survival when apoptotic stimuli are applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Wada1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Xia1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Park2">[22]</xref>. In contrast to ERKs, JNK and p38 MAPK respond strongly to a variety of stress signals, including those mediated by cytokines, hyperosmotic stress, ionizing radiation, UV irradiation and chemotherapeutic agents, and cause apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Wada1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Xia1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Park2">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The ER is the cellular organelle responsible for biogenesis of proteins and calcium homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Ron1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Malhotra1">[25]</xref>. When unfolded or misfolded proteins are accumulated in ER lumen, cells adopt a protective strategy to overcome this ER stress, termed unfolded protein response (UPR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Ron1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Malhotra1">[25]</xref>. UPR is activated by ER transmembrane proteins, such as inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), pancreatic ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor (ATF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Ron1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Kadowaki1">[26]</xref>. These proteins play a key role in increasing the expression of various genes including GRP78 and 94 to restore ER homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Ron1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Kadowaki1">[26]</xref>. It has been demonstrated that PERK phosphorylates eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2α), which subsequently activates ATF-4. Thereafter, ATF-4 induces the expression of CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein) and UPR target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Harding1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Wang1">[28]</xref>. Importantly, CHOP and phosphorylated eIF2α have been indicated to be involved in ER stress-induced cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Harding1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Aarti1">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, when ER stress is excessive, UPR induces activation of IRE1/ASK1/JNK pathway which leads to apoptotic cell death to remove severely damaged cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Toyota1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Seger1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigated the molecular signaling mechanism leading to apoptotic cell death caused by β-lap in NQO1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. We demonstrate here that JNK activation due to ER stress significantly contributes to mitochondria-mediated cell death caused by β-lap treatment. Furthermore, our results show that JNK activity is required for generation of cleaved Bax and mitochondrial translocation of cleaved Bax in response to β-lap treatment. Insight gained in the present study on the molecular signaling pathway in β-lap-induced cell death will lead to advances in establishing the strategies for NQO1-targeted tumor treatment.</p>

        <p>To investigate the cell death induced by β-lap, we treated parental NQO1<sup>−</sup>-MDA-MB-231 cells deficient in NQO1, or NQO1<sup>+</sup>-MDA-MB-231 cells possessing abundant expression of NQO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), with different doses of β-lap, and analyzed clonogenic cell death using a clonogenic cell survival assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows that a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of clonogenic cell death after β-lap treatment was evident, suggesting that NQO1<sup>+</sup>-MDA-MB-231 cells were more sensitive to β-lap than parental NQO1<sup>−</sup>-MDA-MB-231 cells. To further evaluate whether the cytotoxic effect of β-lap was associated with induction of apoptosis, NQO1<sup>−</sup>- or NQO1<sup>+</sup>-MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 5 µM of β-lap for various lengths of time, and then analyzed with a sub-G1 DNA content. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows that a time-dependent increase in the proportion of apoptosis after β-lap treatment was apparent in NQO1<sup>+</sup>-MDA-MB-231 cells, but not in NQO1<sup>−</sup>-MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that β-lap induces apoptotic cell death in an NQO1-dependent manner.</p>

        <p>As the activation of caspase plays a key role in the induction of apoptotic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Wada1">[17]</xref>, we investigated whether caspase activities are required for β-lap-induced apoptotic cell death in NQO1<sup>+</sup>-MDA-MB-231 cells using a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk. This caspase inhibitor was able to prevent activation of caspases (data not shown) but failed to attenuate β-lap-induced apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

Interestingly, SP600125 selectively and effectively reduced β-lap-induced clonogenic and apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g004">Fig. 4B and C</xref>). Pretreatment with PD98059 or SB203580 slightly attenuated β-lap-mediated cellular responses in this regard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g004">Fig. 4B and C</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next investigated the roles of MAPKs on mitochondria-mediated cell death caused by β-lap treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g004">Figures 4D, E, F and G</xref> show that SP600125 was fairly more effective than either SB203580 or PD98059 in suppressing all of β-lap-induced disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, Bax cleavage, mitochondria translocation of cleaved Bax, and nuclear translocation of AIF and Endo G.

These results are consistent with previous data on the role played by NOQ1 in mediation of β-lap toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Pink1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Boothman1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Park3">[36]</xref>. Because NQO1 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cancer tissues, it may be surmised that cancer tissues can be damaged selectively by β-lap. However, the molecular signaling pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of β-lap on solid cancers have not yet been clearly understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that the nuclear translocation of AIF and Endo G is critical for β-lap-induced caspase-independent cell death. We also show that JNK activation triggered by ER stress is essential for mitochondria-mediated cell death caused by β-lap.</p>
      <p>Many anti-cancer drugs have been suggested to induce apoptosis of cancer cells via mitochondrial dysfunction linked to caspase-dependent/independent pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Kaufmann1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Preston1">[38]</xref>. Although β-lap has been previously reported to induce apoptotic cell death in a caspase-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Planchon1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Lee1">[40]</xref>, the apoptotic process caused by β-lap in the present work, appears to be caspase-independent, because a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor failed to suppress β-lap-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>AIF and Endo G are well known to be involved in a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Park1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Daugas1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Joza1">[11]</xref>. Death stimuli accelerate the release of AIF and Endo G from mitochondria, and then these proteins are translocated to the nucleus, where they initiate nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Park1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Daugas1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Joza1">[11]</xref>. In agreement with these reports, we observed that AIF and Endo G are translocated to the nucleus, and the activities of these proteins are also required for β-lap-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Bcl-2 family plays key roles in the regulation of mitochondria-mediated cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Huang1">[6]</xref>. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 are involved in cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Huang1">[6]</xref>. Recent reports demonstrated that STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) increases the transcription and subsequent expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Pu1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Choi1">[43]</xref>. As this pro-oncogenic transcription factor is constitutively activated in many types of cancer, it is highly likely that STAT3 also plays an important role in cell proliferation, cell survival and tumor transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Bhattacharya1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Demaria1">[44]</xref>. Moreover, STAT3 has been suggested to be involved in IL-6-induced resistance to β-lap in prostatic cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Pu1">[41]</xref>. In response to diverse stimuli, Bax is activated, translocated to the outer mitochondrial membrane, and oligomerized, resulting in the disruption of mitochondrial integrity and release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins to the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Yanase1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Cao1">[14]</xref>. In particular, N-terminal cleavage of native Bax (21 kDa) into an 18 kDa form by calpain has been reported to occur in cancer cells treated with a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Toyota1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Ariyama1">[16]</xref>. This cleaved form of Bax is more potent than the native form for disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of apoptotic cell death. In agreement with these reports, we observed that β-lap leads to Bax cleavage without alterations in the protein level of Bcl-2. We also found that the cleaved form of Bax is translocated to mitochondria upon treatment with β-lap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>It has already been suggested that β-lap activates MAPKs in human cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Lien1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Shiah1">[46]</xref>. In agreement with these reports, we observed that all MAPKs are activated soon after β-lap treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In particular, inhibition of JNK by a specific inhibitor effectively attenuates all of β-lap-induced clonogenic, apoptotic cell death, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, cleavage of Bax, mitochondrial translocation of cleaved Bax, and nuclear translocation of AIF and Endo G. However, inhibition of p38 MAPK or ERK slightly inhibits these events triggered by β-lap, indicating that the activations of both p38 MAPK and ERK are weakly associated with β-lap-induced cell death. These observations are consistent with a previous report that JNK plays a critical role during β-lap-induced apoptosis in human cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Shiah1">[46]</xref>. Although the cited report did not show the downstream targets of JNK during β-lap-induced apoptosis, our results in the present study clearly indicated that JNK activation is required for activation of the mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway in response to β-lap treatment. Additionally, since calpain participating in the proteolytic cleavage of Bax has been reported to be activated indirectly by JNK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Dadakhujaev1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Su1">[48]</xref>, and β-lap was also suggested to activate calpain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Pardee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Guiraud1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Wuerzberger1">[5]</xref>, further studies are required to clarify the role of JNK in calpain-mediated Bax cleavage occurring in response to β-lap. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of JNK2 is more effective than that of JNK1 in blocking all of β-lap-induced apoptosis, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial translocation of cleaved Bax, and nuclear translocation of AIF and Endo G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). These findings are consistent with the results of a previous study that JNK2 activity was required for mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in response to liver ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Theruvath1">[49]</xref>. Furthermore, because JNK1 plays a crucial role in controlling systemic glucose and lipid metabolism involved in energy expenditure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Belgardt1">[50]</xref>, and was proposed as a candidate protein kinase that can phosphorylate Zfra (zinc finger-like protein that regulates apoptosis) known to participate in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Dudekula1">[51]</xref>, there is a possiblity that JNK1 can partially affect β-lap-induced mitochondrial apoptosis via regulation of metabolic pathways or Zfra phosphorylation.</p>
      <p>It is noteworthy that β-lap-induced activation of JNK started to increase within 30 min, and lasted for 1 h and then subsequently decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). This reduction of JNK activity in 1 h following β-lap treatment may be due to the activation of phosphatases, such as a MAPK phosphatase 2 (MKP2) and -7 (MKP7), which have been reported to regulate the intracellular MAPK signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Paumelle1">[52]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Katagiri1">[54]</xref>. Therefore, because there is a reasonable possibility that JNK activity can be regulated by a negative feedback loop between JNK and these MAPK phosphatases in response to β-lap, additional studies are needed to define the precise role played by MKP2 or MKP7 in β-lap-treated cells.</p>
      <p>It has been clearly demonstrated that excessive ER stress can lead to apoptotic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Ron1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Kadowaki1">[26]</xref>. Consistent with these reports, we found that β-lap induces the phosphorylation of eIF2α, and raises the expression level of GRP94 in NQO1<sup>+</sup>-MDA-MB-231 cells. We also observed that inhibition of ER stress by pretreatment with Sal, an ER stress inhibitor, efficiently attenuates mitochondria-mediated cell death caused by β-lap. These results suggested that the cell death induced by β-lap treatment is mainly due to induction of ER stress. The activation of JNK by ER stress has been attributed to activation of IRE1/TRAF2/ASK1 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Ron1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021533-Kadowaki1">[26]</xref>. In response to ER stress, IRE1 is activated by autophosphorylation, and then recruits TRAF2 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2), which subsequently activates ASK1 leading to JNK activation. In agreement with previous reports, our results showed that the suppression of ER stress by Sal effectively blocked JNK activation and subsequent apoptotic cell death caused by β-lap, whereas the inhibition of JNK by pretreatment with JNK2 siRNA did not attenuate β-lap-induced ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). These results suggested that JNK activation acts on downstream of the ER stress to induce mitochondria-mediated cell death in response to β-lap treatment.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, in the present study, we demonstrate here that β-lap significantly induces apoptotic cell death in a NQO1-dependent manner, and also suggest that ER stress-induced JNK activation is a critical requirement for mitochondria-mediated cell death caused by β-lap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021533-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Better insights into the signaling pathways underlying the anti-cancer activity of β-lap will lead to advancement in treatment strategies of NQO1-directed cancer therapy using the novel drug.</p>

          <title>Schematic model of mitochondria-mediated cell death triggered by β-lap.</title>
          <p>β-lap induces mitochondrial apoptotic cell death in a NQO1-dependent manner. The induction of ER stress by β-lap is substantially required for JNK activation which triggers mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway. In detail, JNK activation induces cleavage of Bax and mitochondrial translocation of cleaved Bax, which causes disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, and subsequent nuclear translocation of AIF and Endo G. Understanding these signaling pathways that we elucidated in this study may provide useful insights into improvement in therapeutic efficacy of the design of NQO1-targeted cancer therapies.</p>
