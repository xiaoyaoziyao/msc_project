				<p>Root knot nematode, <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic>, is an obligate sedentary endoparasite that infects a large number of crop species and causes substantial yield losses. Non-chemical based control strategies for these nematodes are gaining importance. In the present study, we have demonstrated the significance of two FMRFamide like peptide genes (<italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic>) for infection and development of resistance to <italic>M. incognita</italic> through host-derived RNAi. The study demonstrated both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in planta</italic> validation of RNAi-induced silencing of the two genes cloned from J2 stage of <italic>M. incognita</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> silencing of both the genes interfered with nematode migration towards the host roots and subsequent invasion into the roots. Transgenic tobacco lines were developed with RNAi constructs of <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> and evaluated against <italic>M. incognita</italic>. The transformed plants did not show any visible phenotypic variations suggesting the absence of any off-target effects. Bioefficacy studies with deliberate challenging of <italic>M. incognita</italic> resulted in 50-80% reduction in infection and multiplication confirming the silencing effect. We have provided evidence for <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in planta</italic> silencing of the genes by expression analysis using qRT-PCR. Thus the identified genes and the strategy can be used as a potential tool for the control of <italic>M. incognita</italic>. This is the first ever report that has revealed the utility of host delivered RNAi of <italic>flps</italic> to control <italic>M. incognita</italic>. The strategy can also be extended to other crops and nematodes.</p>

			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>Plant-parasitic nematodes are responsible for global agricultural losses amounting to an estimated $157 billion annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Root knot nematodes (<italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species) are the most economically important group of plant parasitic nematodes (PPNs) worldwide, attacking nearly every food and fiber crop grown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The potential host range of these obligate, sedentary endoparasites encompasses more than 3000 plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>M. incognita</italic>, representing the most widespread species, is found in every country in which the lowest temperature is more than 3°C and is therefore possibly the most damaging crop pathogen in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Chemical nematicides have been discontinued due to their detrimental environmental effects and other alternative management approaches are not sufficient demanding an urgent need to design novel management strategies. Since transgenic technology has offered potential new avenues for crop improvement programs, it could be useful for designing nematode resistant crops.</p>
			<p>FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe) is a neuropeptide from a broad family of FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs) all sharing an -RFamide sequence at their C-terminus. FMRFamide like peptides (FLPs) belong to FaRPs comprising the largest family of neuropeptides in nematodes. Most of the structural information of FLPs has been generated from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and the functional data of FLPs comes from the nematode physiological model, <italic>Ascaris suum</italic>. The studies on FLPs in <italic>A. suum</italic> indicate that their vital responsibility for the modulation of nerve and muscle activity in a concentration dependent and reversible manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. They are responsible for modulating pharyngeal muscle activity in <italic>A. suum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Similarly, FLPs are also accountable for multiple responses in the ovijector musculature ranging from transient excitation to persistent or transient inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, these peptides and their associated processes are considered as potential control targets for parasitic helminths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As in the case of <italic>A. suum</italic>, presence of FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity has also been demonstrated in the nervous system of PPNs, <italic>Globodera pallida</italic> and <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].  Recently it has been reported that <italic>flp-32</italic> in <italic>G. pallida</italic> was responsible for the modulation of locomotory behavior and putatively interacted with at least one novel G-protein coupled receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p>
			<p>FLPs are shown to be present in different parasitic nematodes having similar structural homologues and functions. Consequently, disruption of these activities in PPNs represents an attractive novel control strategy as it would interrupt the worm’s ability to hatch, migrate through the soil to reach the host, feed on the host tissue and also to mate. So far, 19 FLPs have been identified in <italic>M. incognita</italic> based on conserved FMRFamide domain analysis of the ESTs and the whole genome sequence by comparative genomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], out of which six have transcriptional confirmation (<italic>flp</italic>-1, 7, 12, 14, 16, 18 – NCBI GenBank database). MSA (Multiple Sequence alignment) of these six confirmed <italic>flp</italic> genes showed low nucleotide sequence level conservation among them although they share a common RF-amide sequence at C-terminus. Their uniqueness could therefore be harvested at developing sequence specific knockout module by dsRNA method to avoid off target effects. Further, accurate physiological roles of only few of the FLPs are known in <italic>C.  elegans</italic> and <italic>A. suum</italic>. However, major information on these FLPs is lacking in <italic>M. incognita</italic> probably due to their small size and obligate relationship with the host which limits the use of standard physiological techniques. Nevertheless, silencing of <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> in <italic>M. incognita</italic> has been reported to interrupt the migration of worms in response to the root exudates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In view of this, we have selected these two genes with no sequence similarity between them in the present study.</p>
			<p>RNA interference (RNAi), the conserved phenomenon of gene silencing mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), represents a promising molecular tool with potential applications in both the functional genomics and control of PPNs. The ability to specifically knock down a selected mRNA transcript allows the investigation of gene function and interaction, in addition to the validation of putative control of targets through loss of function phenotype analysis. The study of gene function through RNAi is well documented for many PPNs including <italic>G. pallida</italic> and <italic>M. incognita</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition to these reverse-genetics applications, <italic>in planta</italic> RNAi has shown potential as a method of PPN control with several published accounts of such an approach in both cyst and root knot nematodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].  The present paper deals with the unequivocal utility of host delivered RNAi of the two <italic>flp</italic> genes, <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> and their effect on <italic>M. incognita.</italic></p>

				<title>In vitro RNAi of flp-14 and flp-18</title>
				<p>Freshly hatched J2s were collected and used for dsRNA uptake studies as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. About 15,000 freshly hatched J2s were soaked in 100 µl of RNAi soaking solution containing 3 µg dsRNA along with 50 mM Octopamine and incubated for 24 h in dark on a slowly rotating vertical platform at room temperature. In control samples, the J2s were incubated in the same solution without dsRNA. In order to demonstrate target specific silencing, worms were also soaked in dsRNA of GFP. After 24 h the nematodes were washed thrice in sterile spring water by gently inverting the tubes for resuspension of the worms followed by a brief centrifugation for collection of worms. The nematodes were examined under the microscope for mobility, normal behavior and used for further experimental studies. The concentration of the worms was adjusted as 20 worms per 10 µl of water. </p>
				<p>We performed an attraction and migration assay on pluronic gel for determining the effect of gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. For this, 1000 J2s were placed in the middle of a 2 inch diameter petriplates; 5 ml of 23% pluronic gel F-127 was added and the plates were rotated gently. This helped in mixing of the worms with the gel and uniform spreading of both the gel and worms all over the plate.  Following this, five day old tomato seedling (variety Pusa Ruby) was placed on the gel in a corner and the plates were incubated at room temperature for the gel to solidify. Migration of J2s was monitored at 4 and 8 h. At 24 h, infected roots were stained with acid fuchsin to observe the number of J2s that had penetrated into the roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. At this interval, nematodes around the roots were also counted. Six replicates were taken for each of the treatments.

				<title><italic>In vitro</italic> RNAi by dsRNA soaking</title>
				<p>Initially, the effect of the cloned gene fragments on <italic>M. incognita</italic> was assessed by soaking in dsRNA of both the genes. As a first proof, silencing of the target genes, <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> was confirmed by qRT-PCR using cDNA obtained from the dsRNA soaked and control J2s. The transcript level was reduced in the dsRNA soaked J2s compared to the control worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

In the present study, target specific silencing could be established using appropriate controls.   Firstly, neither of the target genes were silenced in the GFP silenced worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This was further substantiated by the absence of any adverse effect on <italic>flp-18</italic> in the <italic>flp-14</italic> silenced worms and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

				<p>Subsequently, the phenotypic effect of gene silencing in terms of attraction and migration towards the host was assessed by an <italic>in vitro</italic> bioassay on pluronic gel. Corroborating with the expression analysis, the assay indicated reduced number of J2s reaching the roots. Silencing of both the target genes had a negative impact on the attraction and migration of the J2s and it was evident as early as 2 h and continued further even at 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The number of J2s reaching the roots reduced significantly at all the three intervals and by 24 h, most of the J2s reaching the roots had penetrated in both the treated and control worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g003">Figure 3B &amp; 3C</xref>). In fact, the number of worms in the control was so high that the roots had to be dissected out to count the total number of J2s that had penetrated by 24 hrs while in treated worms, they could be counted without dissection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Though the number of J2s migrating towards the roots were less in <italic>flp-14</italic> treated worms compared to <italic>flp-18</italic>, penetration was more in case of  J2s silenced for <italic>flp-14</italic>. This indicated that silencing of <italic>flp-18</italic> was more effective than <italic>flp-14</italic> in reducing the penetration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

				<p>Based on the integration studies, 3 events harbouring <italic>flp-14</italic> (44.2, 82.3 and 92.1) and 6 events harbouring <italic>flp-18</italic> (A-6, A-30, A-36, A-38, A-39, A-45) were used for expression and efficacy analysis in the subsequent generation. The seeds of the selected plants were germinated and the T<sub>1</sub> plants were maintained in the growth chamber for studies on expression and efficacy. However, as a preliminary proof of the inheritance of the T-DNA in the progeny of the selected events, PCR analysis was carried out in randomly selected T<sub>1</sub> plants using primers for the amplification of the <italic>flp-14, flp-18</italic> gene specific region, sense and antisense regions and the selectable marker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080603.s004">Figure S4</xref>). It was observed that all the progeny plants showed the amplification of the expected fragments confirming the stable integration and inheritance of the T-DNA. </p>

				<title>Validation of the progeny of the selected events for expression and efficacy of <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic></title>
				<p>qRT-PCR analysis of the selected events was carried out to validate the expression of dsRNA transcript and its accumulation. Expression of the <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> dsRNA was confirmed in the progeny of the selected events. Six well established plants from each of the selected events were used for transcript analysis. It was observed that all the plants showed an increase in the transcript accumulation of <italic>flp-14</italic> when compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

Similarly, six well established and healthy plants belonging to each of the <italic>flp-18</italic> events evaluated were considered for expression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

				<title>Bioefficacy of T<sub>1</sub> tobacco lines against <italic>M. incognita</italic></title>
				<p>Nematode bioassays were performed in order to study the resistance offered against <italic>M. incognita</italic> by inoculating freshly hatched J2s on T<sub>1</sub> generation plants that were confirmed for the <italic>flp-14/flp-18</italic> integration and expression of dsRNA. The plants were harvested 30 days after inoculation and observations were recorded on various parameters to determine the effect of host delivered RNAi on nematode infection, development and reproduction. T<sub>1</sub> plants of the three selected independent events were screened in case of <italic>flp-14</italic> and the nematode infection was scored in terms of number of galls, females, egg masses and eggs per egg mass produced in each plant. Similarly, in case of transgenics for silencing the <italic>flp-18</italic> gene, T<sub>1</sub> plants of six independent events were evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g007">Figure 7</xref>). It was quite evident that host delivered RNAi silencing of both the target genes resulted in reduced root galling due to the nematode infection and there was an increased root growth in the transgenics compared to the wild type plants. Silencing of both the genes generally reduced the nematode infection as indicated by reduction in the number of galls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g008">Figures 8A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g009">9A</xref>). Correspondingly, there was a reduction in number of females and the percentage reduction ranged between 50 - 103 % in <italic>flp-14</italic> RNAi plants compared to the wild type plants. Interestingly, not all the females in these roots could reproduce since the percentage reduction of egg masses ranged from 28 to 57% which indicated that only 50% of the females could reproduce (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Likewise, silencing of <italic>flp-14</italic> reduced the fecundity of the nematodes as percentage reduction in number of eggs per egg mass ranged from 47 - 50 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Similarly, silencing of <italic>flp-18</italic> also exhibited such adverse effects on the nematode infection, development and reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080603-g009">Figure 9A &amp; 9B</xref>). Five out of the six events evaluated showed a reduction of 43 to 59 % in the total number of galls in the transgenic plants compared to the wild type. The reduction in number of females that developed per plant ranged from 15 to 50 %; reduction in fecundity reduced between 44-58%. While, that of eggs per egg mass was reduced between 29 and 69 percent. However, plants of one of the events (A39) expressing <italic>flp-18</italic> dsRNA were not effective in reducing the number of females and on the contrary more females were produced when compared to the wild type control plants. Surprisingly, the number of egg masses and the eggs per egg mass reduced even in this event resulting in 53% reduction in multiplication factor (MF) as compared to the wild type control roots. Finally, the nematode MF reflecting the overall ability of the nematode to be a successful parasite was reduced by about 67 to 86 % due to the silencing of <italic>flp-14</italic> while the reduction due to silencing of <italic>flp-18</italic> was 53 to 82%. </p>

			<title>Discussion</title><p>Neuropeptides, particularly FLPs, are associated with probably all physiological systems in nematodes that include sensory systems, feeding, locomotion and reproduction essential for successful parasitism. Therefore, interference of neuropeptides or FLPs can lead to disruption of multiple functions. In view of this, they could be potential targets for crop improvement against nematodes. The existing information on neurobiology of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>A.suum</italic> is very valuable to identify the suitable <italic>flp</italic> genes for the control of economically important species of root knot nematodes, <italic>M. incognita</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. To date, 19 <italic>flp</italic> genes have been reported in <italic>M. incognita</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In this direction, focus of the present study was mainly on the validation of two <italic>flp</italic> genes, <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> for <italic>M. incognita</italic> parasitism through host-delivered RNAi in tobacco. </p>
			<p>The expression pattern of the genes in three developmental stages demonstrated importance of the target genes in both eggs and infective larval stages. Further, the emphasis was to demonstrate the utility of the cloned genes as suitable targets for <italic>in vitro</italic> and host-derived RNAi.  An unrelated gene, GFP, was used as a negative control to prove the target specific gene silencing during <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation.</p>
			<p><italic>In vitro</italic> RNAi of a nematode gene could provide validation for host delivered RNAi of that gene. It has been well established in <italic>G. pallida</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], <italic>Heterodera schactii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], <italic>H. glycines</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], <italic>M. incognita</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], <italic>M. javanica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and <italic>Pratylechus</italic> spp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In the present study, <italic>in vitro</italic> RNAi of both <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> revealed silencing that was adequately supported by penetration assays and expression analysis.</p>
			<p>Silencing of <italic>flp-14</italic> reduced the migration as well as the penetration of <italic>M. incogntia</italic> J2s. This could be corroborated by transcript quantification that revealed 40% less expression in <italic>flp-14</italic> silenced J2s compared to the control worms. Localization of <italic>flp-14</italic> in <italic>M. incognita</italic> indicated its expression in the four SMB-like neurons posterior to the central nerve ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> the SMBs connect indirectly with amphid (sensory) and motor neurons suggesting their role in locomotion and sensory perception. This supports the reduced migration and penetration observed in our study as <italic>flp-14</italic> silencing could have interfered with the sensory perception which in turn affected the respective motor function in the dsRNA soaked worms. Similar effects were observed when <italic>flp-14</italic> was silenced in <italic>G. pallida</italic> by soaking in dsRNA for 24 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Correspondingly, silencing of <italic>flp-18</italic> resulted in 84 % transcript knock down in the treated J2s when compared to the control worms. No effect on <italic>flp-14</italic> was observed due to the silencing of <italic>flp-18</italic> and vice versa indicating target specific gene silencing which was also supported by the absence of any such effects in the GFP silenced worms.</p>
			<p>Knockdown of <italic>flp-18</italic> resulted in reduced migration and penetration of the treated J2s when compared to the control worms reflecting the physiological effect. Earlier reports also showed reduced migration of J2s due to the silencing of <italic>flp-18</italic> in <italic>M. incognita</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Similar effects were also observed in <italic>G. pallida</italic> when <italic>flp-18</italic> was silenced resulting in almost complete inhibition of migratory behavior after 24 hr incubation in dsRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. <italic>Flp-18</italic> is expressed in the neurons that synapse directly onto the pharyngeal muscles and thereby control their action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Localization  studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> using <italic>flp-18</italic> reporter gene constructs revealed its expression in the specific interneurons AVA, AIY and RIG, the motor neuron RIM and pharyngeal neurons M2 and M3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The AIY neurons are postsynaptic to olfactory, gustatory and thermosensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. <italic>Flp-18</italic> mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> were defective in chemosensation, foraging, dauer formation, fat accumulation and also exhibited decreased oxygen consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. AIY neurons also regulate another food related behavior called local search. When wild type animals are removed from food, they explore a local area, where food is expected, by repeatedly reversing and turning. After about 15 min of food withdrawal, animals switch to exploring larger areas, by inhibiting reversals and turns. Animals lacking the AIY interneurons continue reversing and turning even an hour after removal from food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Further release of <italic>flp-18</italic> from AIY neurons regulates odor responses, foraging ability and fat metabolism. Since M2 and M3 synapse directly onto the pharyngeal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], they are responsible for modulation of pharyngeal activity. Ablation of M3 and two other neurons in the larvae of <italic>C. elegans</italic> lead to changes in feeding behavior and a decline in growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Based on these observations and understanding about the <italic>flp-18</italic> functions, the observed reduction in migration and penetration could be attributed to the knock down effect of <italic>flp-18</italic>. The observed phenotypic effects in the plant root growth coupled with the reduction in the nematode infection could be attributed to the reduction in transcripts of <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> due to the uptake of dsRNA by the nematodes. Therefore, <italic>in vitro</italic> RNAi demonstrated the requirement and importance of <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> for normal sensory perception and mobility. </p>
			<p>On confirming the RNAi silencing of <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, additional proof for the silencing of the two target genes and subsequent effect on the nematode was undertaken by <italic>in planta</italic> validation using a highly efficient tobacco system. Several molecular analyses demonstrated the integration and inheritance of the T-DNA harboring the dsRNA hairpin construct of both the genes independently. However, more important would be to know how efficiently the highly expressing plants would resist the attack of nematodes. Therefore, the bioefficacy studies would be of prime importance. Stringent observations of the challenged plants did not show any phenotypic variations indicating the focused effect of the RNAi. The selected transgenic plants showed remarkable protection against the nematodes as there was significant reduction in number of galls, females, egg masses etc. indicating the efficacy of the RNAi silencing that interrupted the sensory perception and motor functions. These observations corroborated with the expression analysis as the plants that showed high expression could resist nematode infection better and ultimately resulted in reduced reproduction.</p>
			<p>The presence of the dsRNA and the siRNA in the transgenic plants provided the ultimate evidence for the host delivered RNAi of <italic>flp-18</italic> that resulted in reduced nematode reproduction<italic>.</italic></p>
			<p>The present findings are similar to the earlier report involving injection of FMRFamide related peptides of <italic>flp-14</italic> and 15 other <italic>flps</italic> that exhibited inhibitory actions on the ovijector in <italic>A. suum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. These effects generally include shortening of the oviduct, consistent with circular muscle relaxation, and a cessation of contractile activity that could affect the egg laying ability of the nematodes. This could be the cause for reduced reproduction in the worms infesting the transgenic tobacco lines expressing <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> dsRNA. The response in the bioeffeicacy studies clearly corroborated with the finding of <italic>in vitro</italic> RNAi emphasizing the need of the selected genes for important functions of the nematode leading to successful parasitism.</p>
			<p>However, the response to the nematode could depend on a threshold level of transgene expression leading to effective silencing. For this, one of the <italic>flp-18</italic> events, A-39.1 was chosen.  The event showed very low expression in the qRT-PCR analysis. As supporting evidence, it was observed that the event did not demonstrate bioefficacy as comparable with the other highly expressing events and the corresponding percent reduction of the galls etc was not profound. This clearly showed the requirement of a threshold level of dsRNA expression in the host for the silencing to occur effectively. Similar observation was also seen when the extent of silencing of the gene was quantified by qRT-PCR in the nematodes extracted from the transgenic tobacco plants that were used in the bioefficacy studies. This kind of varied expression levels has not been reported in other host delivered RNAi studies. </p>
			<p>The results were quite explicit in demonstrating the possibility of host delivered RNAi of the two important FLP genes independently for the management of <italic>M. incognita</italic> on tobacco. These findings have been adequately supported by the inclusion of negative controls during both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in planta</italic> RNAi experiments. Thus, the observed phenotypic effects can be unequivocally attributed to the target specific gene silencing.</p>
			<p>Though there are many reports of utility of <italic>flps</italic> for disrupting the neuromotor function, this is the first established report of host delivered RNAi of <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> for the management of <italic>M. incognita</italic>. The study effectively substantiated that the reduction in nematode multiplication factor was due to the silencing of <italic>flp-14</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic>. Therefore, it reiterates that the two genes would be of immense value to reduce the initial population densities in the field which in turn could bring down the resident population pressure in the soil for the subsequent crop. This established a proof of concept for using FLP-based RNAi transgenics for the management of <italic>M. incognita</italic>. Further, it opens options for stacking more than one <italic>flp</italic> gene to disrupt different functions more efficiently so as to achieve durable management. In addition, the genes and the strategy can also be effectively extended into improvement programs of other crops where the nematode is a serious concern. </p>
