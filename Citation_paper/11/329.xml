<abstract>
<p>The objective of this study is to provide information on metabolic changes occurring in Chinese sturgeon (an ecologically important endangered fish) subjected to repeated cycles of fatigue and recovery and the effect on swimming capability. Fatigue-recovery cycles likely occur when fish are moving through the fishways of large dams and the results of this investigation are important for fishway design and conservation of wild Chinese sturgeon populations. A series of four stepped velocity tests were carried out successively in a Steffensen-type swimming respirometer and the effects of repeated fatigue-recovery on swimming capability and metabolism were measured. Significant results include: (1) critical swimming speed decreased from 4.34 bl/s to 2.98 bl/s; (2) active oxygen consumption (i.e. the difference between total oxygen consumption and routine oxygen consumption) decreased from 1175 mgO<sub>2</sub>/kg to 341 mgO<sub>2</sub>/kg and was the primary reason for the decrease in <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub>; (3) excess post-exercise oxygen consumption decreased from 36 mgO<sub>2</sub>/kg to 22 mgO<sub>2</sub>/kg; (4) with repeated step tests, white muscle (anaerobic metabolism) began contributing to propulsion at lower swimming speeds. Therefore, Chinese sturgeon conserve energy by swimming efficiently and have high fatigue recovery capability. These results contribute to our understanding of the physiology of the Chinese sturgeon and support the conservation efforts of wild populations of this important species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Water flow is commonly believed to be of an important environmental factor to fish. Natural selection favors locomotor and respiration strategies appropriate for an existing flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Langerhans1">[1]</xref>. Chinese sturgeon (<italic>Acipenser sinensis</italic>, Gray 1834) has been listed as Class I Endangered Species by the Chinese Government <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Wei1">[2]</xref> and is also listed as Critically Endangered (CR) in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (version 2013.1). The species is anadromous and currently occurs only in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and near-shore in the Yellow and East China Seas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Wei2">[3]</xref>. Although captive breeding of Chinese sturgeon is now feasible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Guo1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Wei3">[5]</xref>, wild populations have declined significantly because of dam construction, overfishing and pollution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Xie1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Wang1">[10]</xref>. Chinese sturgeon once migrated further than any other sturgeon, over 3,200 km in the Yangtze River. Restoration of the wild sturgeon populations is difficult due to long maturation time, infrequent spawning and low productivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Pikitch1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-He1">[12]</xref>. Although the species has a life span of 50–60 years, the species breeds only three or four times and the hatchling survival rate is estimated at &lt;1%.</p>
<p>Dam construction has blocked spawning migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Barthem1">[13]</xref> and the sturgeon populations have declined dramatically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Wang1">[10]</xref>. Augmenting wild populations by release of captive breed sturgeon is a great achievement for species conservation but not sufficient. Building fishways that allow migration is another important part of the effort to maintain wild populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Cheong1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Rodriguez1">[15]</xref>. Data on swimming capability and the physiological response to exercise and fatigue provide important design criteria for fishways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Cooke1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Fu1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Publications on Chinese sturgeon have been more frequent in recent years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Jaric1">[20]</xref> but have focused on biochemistry and habitat assessment. Research on swimming capability and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, for one repetition, has been reported (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Farrell1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Tiemey1">[24]</xref>. However, fish typically undergo multiple fatigue-recovery cycles while moving through fishways of large dams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Pon1">[25]</xref> and data on the effects of repeated fatigue-recovery is necessary for the design of effective fishways. In this study, the effect of repeated fatigue-recovery cycles on swimming capability and metabolism were investigated using a stepped velocity test in a Steffensen-type swimming respirometer. The study documents the change in respiration and swimming capability of fish undergoing repeated fatigue-recovery cycles. These results contribute to our understanding of the physiology of the Chinese sturgeon and support the conservation efforts of wild populations of this important species.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Ethics Statement</title>
<p>This study was conducted in strict accordance with the laws governing animal experimentation in China. The protocol was approved by the China Three Gorges University. All efforts were made to minimize suffering.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Test fish</title>
<p>Juvenile sturgeon were obtained from the institute of Chinese sturgeon research, China Three Gorges Project Corporation, in Yichang, China (30°56′ N; 111°15′ E) and were of the second filial generation of cultured Chinese sturgeon. The sturgeon (body length: 10.89±0.11 cm and body weight 8.38±0.27 g, mean ± S.E.) were maintained in cylindrical tanks (80 cm in diameter and 90 cm deep). They were fed to satiation each morning at 8:00 am with Tubificidae. Water temperature varied from 19.3°C to 20.8°C and dissolved oxygen (<italic>DO</italic>) maintained above 7.0 mg/L. Ammonia-N and nitrite-N were lower than 0.050 mg/L and 0.007 mg/L, respectively. Forty eight hours prior to the experiment, feeding was interrupted to prevent the elevated oxygen consumption rate associated with digestion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Herrmann1">[26]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Respirometer</title>
<p>The sturgeon were tested in a sealed 14 L Steffensen-type swimming respirometer submerged in a 55.7 L tank (84.0 cm long ×39.9 cm wide ×17.0 cm deep) to maintain temperature. A schematic diagram of the respirometer was included in an earlier publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Cai1">[27]</xref>. Respirometer components include a motor with speed controller and propeller and a rectangular swimming chamber (4.5 L, 35.5 cm long ×11.0 cm wide ×11.5 cm deep) with a Lucite multi-aperture rectifier at the entrance to maintain laminar flow and a wire grid at the exit. Normal respirometer operating assumptions were made: (1) swimming speed (<italic>U</italic>) is equal to water flow speed as measured with an acoustic Doppler velocity meter (Nortek AS, Oslo, Norway), and (2) oxygen consumption can be calculated from the change in dissolved oxygen, as measured by an oxygen electrode (Hach HQ30d, Loveland, USA).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Protocol for stepped velocity test</title>
<p>Ten sturgeons were tested and the body length (bl), fork length, total length and body mass of each sturgeon were measured. Before testing, fish were acclimated overnight in the respirometer at a very low flow speed (0.3∼0.5 bl/s) and then allowed to swim at 0.5 bl/s from 7:00–8:00 am the next morning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-He1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Pang1">[28]</xref>. When testing began, flow speed was increased by 0.5 bl/s every 20 min and dissolved oxygen was measured at 5 min intervals. When the sturgeon was exhausted (swimming ceased and the fish rested against the wire grid for 20 s), flow speed was adjusted to 0.5 bl/s during the 30 min recovery period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Cai1">[27]</xref>. This comprises a single stepped velocity test and each sturgeon tested was subjected to four tests in succession to simulate a repeated cycle of fatigue and recovery.</p>

<title>Data collection and analyses</title>
<p>All experimental data was expressed as mean ± S.E. and was analyzed and fitted using Origin (Version 8.1). The level of significance was determined using ANOVA Fisher LSD. Fit to mathematical models was evaluated following the Akaike information criterion <italic>AIC</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Akaike1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Hurvich1">[30]</xref> using the model correcting for finite sample size and frequently applied in behavioral ecology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Burnham1">[31]</xref>;<disp-formula id="pone.0094345.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0094345.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>RSS</italic> is the residual sum of squares from the fitted model, <italic>n</italic> is sample size, and <italic>k</italic> is the total number of parameters.

Routine oxygen consumption rate (<italic>MO</italic><sub>2, routine</sub>) of each sturgeon is the <italic>MO</italic><sub>2</sub> at 0.5 bl/s (Cai et al., 2013b).

<title>Critical swimming speed, <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub></title>
<p>Juvenile sturgeon, such as shortnose sturgeon <italic>Acipenser brevirostrum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Deslauriers1">[39]</xref> and Amur sturgeon (<italic>Acipenser schrenckii</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Cai1">[27]</xref>, generally display <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub> levels of 2 bl/s∼3 bl/s. However, the <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub> of Chinese sturgeon was found to be above that range, indicating that Chinese sturgeon have better swimming capability. In addition, there was a linear decrease (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.975) in <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub> of the Chinese sturgeon with repeated fatigue-recovery cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094345-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). However, the difference in <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub> declined with repeated testing (<italic>Δ<sub>U</sub></italic><sub>crit</sub> 0.57, 0.50, 0.29 bl/s) and the recovery ratio increased from 86.9% to 91.1%. A better fit could have been obtained using a higher order equation but would have resulted in overfitting according to AIC analysis. The recovery ratio for Chinese sturgeon is comparable to sockeye salmon (<italic>Oncorhynchus nerka</italic>), with a recovery ratio of approximately 85% after a resting time of 1 hour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Jain2">[40]</xref>. Because exertion decreases <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub>, the slot velocities of upstream fishways should be lower than those in downstream fishways.</p>

<title><italic>MO</italic><sub>2, routine</sub> and <italic>MO</italic><sub>2, max</sub></title>
<p>Differences in <italic>MO</italic><sub>2, routine</sub> over the four test cycles were small and erratic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094345-t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating little, if any, influence of fatigue on the routine metabolic rate. While differences in <italic>MO</italic><sub>2, max</sub> were not significant, the changes were more pronounced and decreased with each test cycle. This leads to a decrease in <italic>AS</italic> and is consistent with the observed decrease in the <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub>. The relationship between <italic>AS</italic> and <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094345-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, indicating an exponential increase in <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub> with <italic>AS</italic>.</p>

In the three successive tests, the values of <italic>c</italic> did not change consistently (<italic>c</italic> = 1.70, 1.71, 1.42, respectively, for Tests 2, 3, and 4). There are numerous reports on the effect of fish morphology on swimming efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Pettersson1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Ohlberger1">[44]</xref>. In this investigation morphology was consistent among the tests and results indicate that repeated fatigue-recovery cycles affect physiological function. It has been reported that different fish use different swimming strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-CastroSantos1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-CastroSantos2">[46]</xref>, but it remains unclear as to whether the sturgeon are adjusting swimming strategy in response to repeated fatigue-recovery cycles. Swimming efficiency was highest in Test 1, lower in Tests 2 and 3, with some recovery displayed in Test 4.</p>

<title>Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, EPOC</title>
<p>During fatigue recovery the variation of oxygen consumption rate with time is usually described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0094345.e004">Equation 4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Cai1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Lee1">[37]</xref>. The data fit for Test 1 and Test 2 was good (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094345-t003">Table 3</xref>) but data for Test 3 and Test 4 could not be fit to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0094345.e004">Equation 4</xref> because the fit did not converge. After fitting the data to several other functions <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0094345.e005">Equation 5</xref> was selected, based on fit and <italic>AIC</italic> analysis, to estimate the onset of anaerobic respiration and its contribution to <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub>.</p>
<p>Information on <italic>EPOC</italic> is helpful for establishing design criteria for the resting pools of fishways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Cai1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Webber1">[47]</xref>. The <italic>EPOC</italic> is inversely related to the recovery capability from exhaustion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Lee1">[37]</xref>. The <italic>EPOC</italic> in the first test was 35.7 mgO<sub>2</sub>/kg, much lower than for salmon but similar to Amur sturgeon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Cai1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Lee1">[37]</xref>, indicating high recovery capability for Chinese sturgeon. Although <italic>EPOC</italic> decreased with repeated recovery from fatigue, it does not necessarily follow that the recovery capability increased because <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub> and <italic>AS</italic> also decreased and <italic>AOC</italic> decreased by 70% from Test 1 to Test 4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094345-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>EPOC</italic> is directly related to anaerobic respiration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094345-Lee1">[37]</xref> and the decrease in <italic>EPOC</italic> indicates that repeated recovery from fatigue lowers capacity for anaerobic metabolism. With each fatigue-recovery cycle anaerobic respiration begins at a lower swimming speed but contributes less to achieving <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub>. However, it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094345-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094345-t001">Table 1</xref> that oxygen consumption is primarily from aerobic respiration and the decrease in aerobic respiration is the primary cause for the decrease in <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub>.

<p>Repeated cycles of fatigue and recovery affect the swimming capability of Chinese sturgeon; <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub>, <italic>AOC</italic> and absolute <italic>U</italic><sub>a</sub> decrease with decreasing swimming capacity.
