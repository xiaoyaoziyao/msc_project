<abstract>
<p>Natural selection among tumor cell clones is thought to produce hallmark properties of malignancy. Efforts to understand evolution of one such hallmark—the angiogenic switch—has suggested that selection for angiogenesis can “run away” and generate a hypertumor, a form of evolutionary suicide by extreme vascular hypo- or hyperplasia. This phenomenon is predicted by models of tumor angiogenesis studied with the techniques of adaptive dynamics. These techniques also predict that selection drives tumor proliferative potential towards an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) that is also convergence-stable. However, adaptive dynamics are predicated on two key assumptions: (i) no more than two distinct clones or evolutionary strategies can exist in the tumor at any given time; and (ii) mutations cause small phenotypic changes. Here we show, using a stochastic simulation, that relaxation of these assumptions has no effect on the predictions of adaptive dynamics in this case. In particular, selection drives proliferative potential towards, and angiogenic potential away from, their respective ESSs. However, these simulations also show that tumor behavior is highly contingent on mutational history, particularly for angiogenesis. Individual tumors frequently grow to lethal size before the evolutionary endpoint is approached. In fact, most tumor dynamics are predicted to be in the evolutionarily transient regime throughout their natural history, so that clinically, the ESS is often largely irrelevant. In addition, we show that clonal diversity as measured by the Shannon Information Index correlates with the speed of approach to the evolutionary endpoint. This observation dovetails with results showing that clonal diversity in Barrett's esophagus predicts progression to malignancy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural selection has long been recognized as the ultimate driver of cancer progression and pathogenesis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Greaves1">[1]</xref> for a recent review; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Weinberg1">[2]</xref>). In early stages of tumor progression, heterogeneous populations of malignant and healthy cells compete for available resources. Tumor cell clones that have acquired, via mutation and epigenetic effects, malignant “hallmark” phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Hanahan1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Hanahan2">[4]</xref> gain proliferative and (or) survival advantages relative to other lineages in their tumor microenvironment. Eventually the hallmark-carrying mutant clones come to dominate the tumor and destroy tissue homeostasis. If this interpretation is correct, then the mechanism causing malignancy—heritable variation conferring advantages to particular clonal lineages—is precisely evolution by natural selection.</p>
<p>Explaining the adaptive significance of most cancer hallmarks is straightforward. However, angiogenesis—the ability of tumors to generate their own vascular infrastructure—presents a difficult case. Angiogenesis is coordinated directly and indirectly by cancer cells using a variety of signaling molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietins, fibroblastic growth factors (FGFs), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factors (TGF<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and -<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), among others. These factors act in a variety of ways on vascular endothelial cells and (or) their precursors. Target cell responses include proliferation, chemotaxis and differentiation into functional microvessel endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Hanahan1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Neufeld1">[6]</xref>. The balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules in the local milieu define the “angiogenic signal” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Baeriswyl1">[7]</xref>. In hypoxic tissues, this balance tips in favor of angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Holash1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Neufeld1">[6]</xref>. Cancer is often characterized by derangement of this signaling system, generating among certain tumor clones more-or-less constitutive production of pro-angiogenic signals and receptors, a condition referred to as the angiogenic switch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Hanahan1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Hanahan2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Baeriswyl1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Vajkoczy1">[12]</xref>. The intensity of this switch varies among tumors even of the same histological type and tissue of origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Hanahan2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Bergers1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Angiogenesis clearly benefits tumors. In addition to nutrient delivery and waste removal, tumor microvessels provide routes for metastasis. However, all tumor cells receive the benefits of angiogenesis whether or not they participate in producing the signal. Therefore, the signal is a public good. As is well known from decades of research into the “free-rider” problem in economics and evolutionary biology, public goods are susceptible to exploitation by free-riders. In this context, free-riders would be clones that, by mutation or epigenetic alteration, decrease or stop their own production of proangiogenic signals. Since metabolic energy is required to produce the angiogenic signal, free-riders eliminate one drain on internal energy reserves with no immediate detriment. However, they gain an immediate advantage—saved energy reserves can be committed to proliferation and maintenance metabolism. Free-rider clones would therefore be expected to expand more rapidly than angiogenic clones due to their inherited advantage. The obvious fact that the tumor, and the free-riders themselves, would suffer hypoxia once free-riding becomes dominant is irrelevant. Natural selection does not act to benefit the tumor. Selection simply favors clones with the highest growth and survival potential once the chains of kin selection and other evolutionary forces compelling cooperation have been broken. In any environment, even severely hypoxic ones, free-rider clones will always have an advantage over angiogenic clones, all else being equal, because they have less demand for energy to produce a public good. Any angiogenic clone will certainly benefit from being angiogenic. But the free-rider benefits equally. The fact that cancer cells tend to disperse from unfavorable environments does not eliminate the problem. It simply spreads it. If the hallmarks of cancer are consequences of evolution, it is not immediately clear why the angiogenic switch persists in malignant tumors.</p>
<p>Indeed, modeling studies initiated by one of us (JDN) predict that such nonangiogenic free-riders can damage or perhaps destroy all or part of a growing tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy3">[16]</xref>. This predicted “tumor-on-a-tumor” phenomenon has a conceptual sister, <italic>viz</italic>. hyperparisitism—one parasite exploiting another. Therefore, the parallel term “hypertumor” was suggested to describe it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy1">[14]</xref>, and it has since been recognized as a form of evolutionary suicide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Parvinen1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>The early hypertumor models were limited by the fact that costs associated with hallmark phenotypes could not be investigated because the models lacked a proper description of energetic trade-offs. That limitation was addressed in a recent study by Nagy and Armbruster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref> in which the original models were extended to include an energetic “opportunity cost.” This extension required the addition of a submodel describing intracellular adenylate dynamics to the existing tissue-level model of angiogenesis. The result was a multiscale system with three distinct spatial and temporal levels: intracellular energy metabolism on scales of µm and seconds to minutes; tissue-level on scales of mm and hours to days; and evolutionary, with scales of cm and months to years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In this formulation, ATP, the primary energy currency in cells, is partitioned among three major energetically demanding programs: proliferation, cell maintenance and secretion.</p>

<title>Schematic representation of the multiscale model.</title>
<p>The “energetic scale” submodel [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0091992.e012">equations (1)</xref> through <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0091992.e052">(10)</xref>] governs dynamics of adenylate (AMP, ADP and ATP). Interconversions among the three species occur via maintenance metabolism (e.g., biosynthesis, volume control), chemical energy to support proliferation and angiogenesis signal production, glycolysis and, most importantly, the adenylate kinase reaction, among others. Sources for adenylate include <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of AMP and salvage from nucleic acid catabolism. Adenylate sinks include AMP destruction by deaminases and nucleotidases and ATP loss to nucleic acid synthesis. Clonal expansion or regression at the tissue scale [model (11)] depends primarily on mean tumor microvessel density, which is controlled in part by angiogenic factor secretion by existing clones. Blood vessels grow from existing vasculature via chemotaxis and maturation of vascular endothelial cell precursors in and near the tumor. At the evolutionary scale, angiogenic and proliferative potential varies among clones (different colored cell subpopulations) as they compete for resources delivered by microvessels. Evolutionary scale dynamics are handled in the simulation (see “Simulation Methods” above).</p>

<p>This model confirms that evolution of hallmarks acting on proliferation rate differs markedly from evolution of the angiogenic switch. In particular, selection drives energy allocation for proliferation to an intermediate state that balances evolutionary benefits of reproduction with opportunity costs of shunting reducing power away from cell maintenance. This attracting state is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) <italic>sensu</italic> Maynard Smith and Price <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Smith1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Smith2">[20]</xref>; that is, it is a strategy that, when used by almost all residents of a population, cannot be invaded by any possible mutant. This ESS is also convergence stable (essentially an evolutionary attractor; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Geritz1">[21]</xref> for a review).</p>
<p>In contrast, angiogenic potential does not evolve to an intermediate state in this model. As predicted by the free-rider argument, direct selection on angiogenesis signaling is powerless to produce the angiogenic switch via the benefits of eventual increased perfusion. However, this model predicts an indirect evolutionary pathway to the angiogenic switch caused by an interesting property of the adenylate homeostasis mechanism. Both modeling and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies suggest that intracellular equilibrium ATP concentration is a unimodal function of overall cell metabolic rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Plate1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Martinov1">[23]</xref>. To the left of the mode (relatively low metabolic rates), cells respond to slight increases in ATP consumption by excessively ramping up <italic>de novo</italic> adenylate synthesis, resulting in a paradoxical increase in equilibrium ATP concentration. Therefore, under conditions favoring such overcompensation, mutants that increase production of the angiogenic signal, which requires ATP for protein synthesis and secretion, can gain more ATP for proliferation. This pleiotropic effect on both proliferation and angiogenic potential confers to the mutant a selective advantage. In the model, the evolutionary picture is complicated by an interaction between this phenomenon and the neovascularization in response to the angiogenic signal. This interaction generates an ESS that is always evolutionarily repelling (details in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref>). That is, if clones differ only in ATP allocation to angiogenesis, clones slightly more (or less) committed to angiogenesis than the ESS are vulnerable to invasion by a mutant clone with higher (respectively, lower) energy allocation to angiogenesis. Therefore, this model predicts that, given enough time, selection will run away either to vascular hyper- or hypoplasia, eventually reaching a tumor inviability region. The latter possibility is the original hypertumor prediction, while the former represents a novel form of evolutionary suicide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy3">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The open questions we address here are the following: (i) what are the likely trajectories tumors traverse through their evolutionary “strategy spaces” as angiogenic and proliferative potentials evolve? (ii) what variation in these evolutionary trajectories can be expected? and (iii) how rapidly will the traverse occur? Answers to these questions are required before practically testable predictions from the model can be distilled, but they could not be addressed in the previous modeling attempts. In these studies, the evolutionary analysis relied on the techniques of adaptive dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Geritz1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Dieckmann1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Metz1">[25]</xref>, which require the assumption that mutation dynamics are much slower than ecological dynamics. At most only two competing clones can exist in a tumor. One arises as a rare mutant within a tumor populated almost exclusively by a resident clone. Competitive exclusion is the rule in these pairwise bouts; either the mutant invades the tumor and eliminates the resident clone, or the resident eliminates the mutant. Either way, “ecological” dynamics of competition are assumed to reach their endpoint before a new mutant arises, so ecological and evolutionary timescales decouple. Also, all mutations are assumed to have a small effect; therefore, the difference between phenotypes of resident and mutant clones is always small <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Metz1">[25]</xref>. Given the genomic instability characteristic of many malignant tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Hanahan2">[4]</xref>, these assumptions are likely to be violated in real tumors. So, here we repeat the evolutionary analysis with the adaptive dynamics assumptions relaxed. To achieve this, we first define a stochastic simulation analogue of the multiscale evolutionary model in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref>. The equations governing intracellular adenylate, tumor growth and angiogenesis are unchanged. The only alteration we introduce is at the evolutionary scale. In particular, we allow an indefinite number of clones to compete at the same time, and mutant clones arise at random times independent of the current state of the system. Here we show that relaxation of the adaptive dynamics assumptions has no effect on predicted evolutionary endpoints from the original adaptive dynamics analysis. However, the simulations predict that evolutionary dynamics of both angiogenesis and proliferative capacity is dominated by mutational history. Practically, this prediction suggests that the disease is on an evolutionary transient throughout its clinical course—that is, an attracting ESS is rarely if ever approached—and the tumor's evolutionary tempo and trajectory are largely determined by phenotypes of early mutants, which in practice are likely to resist prediction. We refer to this prediction as the historical contingency effect, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Vermeij1">[26]</xref>.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The deterministic model underlying our simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref> comprise two distinct systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing dynamics at three time and spatial scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The first system, which extends the pioneering work of Martinov, Ataullakhanov, Vitvitsky and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Ataullakhanov1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Martinov1">[23]</xref>, tracks intracellular adenylate dynamics, with adenylate concentrations scaled in fmol and time scaled in mins (“Energetics Scale” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The second system, operating at tissue and evolutionary scales, describes growth dynamics of the tumor, dynamics of its vascular infrastructure and competition among clones within the tumor. The tumor is assumed to comprise some number of genetically and phenotypically distinct clones, a collection of immature vascular endothelial cell precursors (VECPs) and patent, functional microvessels. In the original formulation, the number of competing clones was limited to 2, but here we allow the tumor to house an arbitrary number, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, of distinct clones. Dynamics of a single clone (“Tissue Scale” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) is governed by two ODEs—one for clonal mass (in g) and one for mean tumor microvessel density. Time is scaled in days. Overall tumor dynamics (“Evolutionary Scale” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) is therefore determined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ODEs, one for each clone, plus equations for VECPs and microvessels, with dependencies on the energetic states of cells determined by equations at the energetics scale. This tissue-level model is derived directly from previous work of Nagy and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy3">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interactions among all three scales revolve around tumor perfusion, measured as microvessel length density. In the model, hypoxic tumor cells secrete a chemical signal composed of a variety of tumor angiogenesis factors (TAF) to which VECPs respond by proliferating, maturing and integrating themselves into functional microvessels. The interaction between intracellular and tissue levels arises as cells partition their available chemical potential energy, primarily in the form of ATP, among three energy-dependent activities: maintenance metabolism (cell volume regulation, maintenance protein production and other life-support physiology), proliferation and, potentially, secretion of TAF. In turn, these three activities feed into tissue-level phenomena of blood vessel growth and clone-specific expansion. These growth phenomena then feed back to the intracellular scale because relative growth rates of vessels and tumors determine perfusion and therefore nutrient delivery, which in turn sets the cellular energy charge and ATP regeneration rate, as detailed below. Tumor vascular dynamics depend on both the strength of the angiogenic signal and rate of tumor growth. Tumor vascular density determines rate of ATP synthesis. Since malignant tumors are often characterized by dampened oxidative metabolism (Warburg effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Cairns1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Upadhyay1">[28]</xref>), vascular feedback on ATP synthesis primarily occurs via delivery of glucose for glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Although an exhaustive derivation of the model can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy1">[14]</xref>), we provide a detailed outline below for completeness. All parameters in the model have been estimated carefully from data when possible or from biological first principles and model behavior when not.

<p>Intracellular adenylate dynamics are governed by the following system of ODEs:<disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e012"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e012" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>Total adenylate in cells is controlled primarily via synthesis and destruction of AMP.

The function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents irreversible AMP recycling by enzymes primarily in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nucleotidase and AMP deaminase families. Specifically,<disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e016"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e016" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>which is an empirical model of AMP destruction suggested by Martinov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Martinov1">[23]</xref>, who also provided empirical estimates of (positive) parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The first and second terms in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0091992.e016">equation (2)</xref> represent the actions of AMP deaminases and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nucleotideases, respectively.</p>
<p>In resting mammalian cells, adenylate dynamics are dominated by the adenylate kinase reaction,<disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e023"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e023" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>which is represented in the model by the second, first and third terms in each equation of model (1), respectively. In most cells this reaction has approximately equal forward and backward rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Hardie1">[29]</xref>, which we denote here as the positive constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Besides the adenylate kinase reaction (3), interconversion among adenylate species revolves around either ATP hydrolysis or synthesis. The former is primarily governed by positive parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which themselves are sums of constants representing metabolism supporting proliferation, TAF secretion and maintenance. In particular,<disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e028"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e028" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e029"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e029" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e030"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e030" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are basic maintenance metabolism rates. The former is the ATP→AMP conversion rate, e.g., for biosynthesis (amino acid adenylation) and to power the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase reaction, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref>. The latter (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) represents the ATP→ADP conversion rate, primarily, but not exclusively, for cell volume control. A second pathway from ATP to both ADP and AMP exists via the adenosine kinase reaction,<disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e034"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>which we assume occurs at base rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the per-ATP rate of nucleic acid synthesis (assumed to be an irreversible sink for ATP). All these parameters are assumed constant across clones.</p>
<p>The key evolutionary parameters are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, both positive constants representing mean per-molecule rates at which clone <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cells allocate ATP to proliferation and angiogenesis secretion, respectively. The dependence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> arises because clones vary the intensity of their angiogenic signal as a function of vascular density. Specifically, we assume that<disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e042"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e042" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is vascular density (defined in the Tissue Scale section below). This functional form, adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy1">[14]</xref>, assumes that TAF signaling rate is a unimodal function of vascular density, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It qualitatively mirrors observed increases in secretion of angiogenesis-promoting growth factors as cells become hypoxic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Holash1">[5]</xref> with the added assumption that cells suffering extreme hypoxia lose the ability to produce the signal. Parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is constant across clones and determines the vascular density at which angiogenesis secretion peaks. Parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> varies among clones, is constant within a clone, and measures the general intensity of the angiogenic signal.</p>
<p>Finally, ATP is “regenerated” from ADP primarily via glycolysis in cancer cells. This conversion is governed in the model by the function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the “energy charge” of a cell, which is a sort of weighted average of “high energy” phosphoryl groups in adenylate. Specifically,<disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e049"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e049" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>is the mean energy charge of cells in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>th clone. Mean glycolysis rate is assumed to vary among clones only as they vary in mean energy charge; in particular,<disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e051"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e051" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>where<disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e052"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e052" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is constant. The particular forms and parameterizations for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0091992.e051">equation (9)</xref>] and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0091992.e052">equation (10)</xref>] were chosen to fit data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Ataullakhanov1">[22]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref> for details).</p>

We assume that mean proliferation and angiogenesis signal production for cells of clone <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depend on the clone's mean intracellular ATP concentration. However, mean ATP concentration depends on vascular density, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the clone's energy commitment to proliferation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and its commitment to angiogenesis, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see previous section). Therefore, there is a continuous feedback between energetic and tissue scale dynamics. Since adenylate dynamics of model (1) equilibrate very rapidly on the time scale of the tissue model (11) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref>), we further assume that mean ATP concentration in all clones is locked in quasi-equilibrium for the adenylate model.

Overall angiogenic signal is the average signal strength of all clones weighted by clone density, and we assume that per capita proliferation of VECPs is proportional to the strength of this signal [first term, second equation in system (11)]. Mean per capita VECP mortality and maturation rates, combined into parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, are assumed to be fixed. As VECP cells mature, they integrate themselves into functional tumor microvessels at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, composed of both the rate constant and a unit conversion factor. There is evidence that tumors actively maintain their vascular infrastructure even after its initial construction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Holash1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Neufeld1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Vajkoczy1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Colombo1">[30]</xref>. Viewing this maintenance as the tumor provisioning microvessels with a resource, which may simply be space, we assume that this resource is proportional to tumor mass, say <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is constant. Resource availability per microvessel unit is therefore the ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We assume that per capita microvessel remodeling rate is inversely proportional to this ratio; that is, it is proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with proportionality constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (which includes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; second term, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> equation of system (11); see also ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy1">[14]</xref>).</p>
<p>This modeling approach implicitly assumes that the average conditions in the tumor are predictive of tumor dynamics. In particular, vascularization, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is interpreted as mean vessel density throughout the tumor at any given time (or, alternatively, the ensemble average of many similar tumors). However, since mutant clones are initially localized and vary in angiogenic efficacy, one should question the assumption that all clones are equally vascularized on average. On the other hand, cancer cells are characterized by their ability to infiltrate surrounding tissues, and many if not most exhibit positive chemotaxis up nutrient gradients and therefore tend to move towards areas of locally high vascularization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Rong1">[31]</xref>. So how violated the averaging assumption is, and the consequences of that level of violation, remain open questions to be addressed in subsequent approximations.</p>

<title>Evolutionary Scale Model</title>
<p>The tumor's vascular support, measured by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, reacts to changes in the clonal composition of angiogenic phenotypes, their prevalence and overall abundance. In turn, clonal composition is determined by selection pressures generated by a particular vascular environment. This interaction dictates dynamics at the evolutionary scale. Here we follow the prevalence of each phenotype within the tumor, where the phenotype of clone <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; that is, the phenotype is the clone's energetic commitment to angiogenesis and proliferation. We make no explicit hypotheses about how these phenotypes relate to genotypes except for the general assumptions that these traits have high heritability, that they are polygenic, and that new phenotypes may arise by mutation. However, we allow the possibility that multiple genotypes can generate the same phenotype. We also leave open the possibility that phenotype could result from a persistent epigenetic change. For simplicity, however, we refer to new phenotypes as “mutants.” In any case, phenotype is fixed for all cells in the clone, although angiogenesis signaling and proliferation rates in a single clone are not fixed since these depend on vascularization, which is dynamic.</p>
<p>Evolutionary dynamics of clonal phenotypes in this model were initially analyzed using adaptive dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref>. The technique is founded on the question, can a rare mutant strategy invade an otherwise monomorphic population using a different strategy (the “resident” strategy) in the resident's equilibrium environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Geritz1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Dieckmann1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Metz1">[25]</xref>? The set of all possible strategies is referred to as the strategy space. One analyzes the ability of any possible mutant phenotype to invade any resident strategy in an environment set by the resident. Such an analysis produces a good, if not complete, picture of the evolutionary dynamics, including the existence and location in strategy space of evolutionarily important points or sets. In particular, adaptive dynamics identifies evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS), can be used to determine whether these points are evolutionarily attracting (continuously stable strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Eshel1">[32]</xref>) or repelling and assess potential for evolutionary suicide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Parvinen1">[18]</xref> and evolutionary branching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Geritz1">[21]</xref>, among other things.</p>
<p>However, adaptive dynamics is limited by two fundamental assumptions. First, interarrival times between mutations must be long compared to population dynamics so that fate of the mutant is determined before the next mutant arises. Although this assumption improves analytical tractability, it removes mutational dynamics from the evolutionary picture, rendering transient evolutionary dynamics invisible. We can only see the potential evolutionary endpoints. Also, this assumption is almost certainly violated in most cancers, which are well-known to be genomically and genetically heterogeneous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Greaves1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Kops1">[33]</xref>. Second, most adaptive dynamics analyses rely on the assumption that mutations have small phenotypic effects. Although this assumption is not strictly required, relaxing it typically compounds analytical complexity. But again, in cancer this assumption has dubious validity because even minor mutations in both coding and control regions of genes can have massive effects on cell phenotype. A relevant example here would include a mutation in the control region of <italic>HIF1A</italic>, the gene for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor 1, which could generate an enormous alteration of a clone's angiogenic potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Kaelin1">[34]</xref>. The main goal of this paper is to assess the effects these assumptions have on the predictions of the coupled models (1) and (11). Therefore, we relax these assumptions, at the cost of sacrificing analytical tractability, which leads to the simulations described below.</p>

<title>Simulation Methods</title>
<p>In concept, our simulations operate as follows. Initial tumors are assumed to be small (10 mg) and monomorphic with vascular density equal to that of surrounding healthy tissue (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Therefore, simulation initial conditions were always the following: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> g, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> g, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the equilibrium concentrations in a tissue with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are left undefined until they arise via mutation. Mutations occur as discrete events, with one new mutant clone introduced at each event. Biologically, all mutation events except the first are assumed to be independent of time, the composition of the tumor and the number of previous mutation events. Mathematically we therefore assume that, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the set of arrival times for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mutations defining new clones (assuming that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are independent, identically distributed exponential random variables with parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; biologically, the mean interarrival times of mutations).</p>
<p>On the time intervals <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, tumors grow according to models (1) and (11) with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ignored for all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Mutant clones enter the model when they have grown to a size large enough to be buffered from stochastic extinction; therefore, a mutation event represents the arrival of an already sizable mutant clone, which is assumed to have initial mass of 0.1 mg and initial adenylate concentrations equal to the quasi-equilibrium for that clone at the current vascular density. So, at arrival times <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the mass of the new mutant clone, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is set instantly to 0.1 mg, and the three adenlylate species for the new clone instantly take on their quasi-equilibrium values for that clone given <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; that is, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the terminal time period, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the tumor grows according to models (1) and (11), with all variables strictly positive. In practice, simulations ended at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> “years.” This horizon ensures that tumors, if viable, will grow beyond the model's design, given that the model is meant to represent tumors still growing in their exponential phase. In addition, it allows vascular density to equilibrate so that the evolutionarily dominant clone can more easily be defined (see below).</p>
<p>In any given simulation, only one parameter, either <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, was allowed to evolve—all others were fixed at their default values. Values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each clone were drawn from the interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which includes essentially all biologically feasible values for these parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref>. The probability distributions for the draws were uniform over those intervals because, as mentioned earlier, single mutations may have large phenotypic effects, and a comprehensive mapping between pathological genetic and epigenetic alterations and phenotypic effects is unavailable. Given this uncertainty, a uniform probability distribution is the proper prior assumption. Further uncertainty arises in the mutation rate parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We explore the consequences of this uncertainty by fixing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in each simulation, but varying it between 10 and 50 hours among simulations. In each case, however, the number of (eventually) competing clones, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, was fixed at 50. Each simulation scenario was then repeated 1000 times with the same initial conditions.</p>
<p>We evaluated the evolutionary outcome of the simulation using two measures. The first represents what would appear be the evolutionary “winner” in a histopathology study. In this case, we defined the “evolutionarily dominant,” or just dominant, clone to be the clone with the largest mass at the end of the simulation (4 years). The second measure of evolutionary success conforms more closely to an evolutionary biologist's notion of evolutionary advantage. In this case, we define the dominant clone as that which has the highest per capita growth rate at simulation's end. These two methods frequently identified different evolutionarily favored clones. For instance, many simulated tumors had small, but very rapidly growing, clones within them at the end of the simulation. These clones were clearly outcompeting all others, but because they arose late the the natural history of the tumor, they had not had time to impact the tumor's histology. This phenomenon lead us to fix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mutants—mutants that arise beyond the 50th almost always remain pathologically irrelevant.</p>
<p>A measure of clonal diversity within a tumor provides a concise description of a tumor's evolutionary state with, potentially, clinically relevant predictive power <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Greaves1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Maley1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Merlo1">[36]</xref>. We therefore measure phenotypic diversity with the Shannon Diversity Index, or Shannon Information measure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Shannon1">[37]</xref>, which quantifies the mean relative abundance of tumor clones. Maley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Maley1">[35]</xref> used it to measure clonal diversity in Barrett's esophagus, and we adopt it here for the same reason they did—it does not overemphasize the most common clone. Given that selection acts on clones of all sizes, and that rate of evolution depends on availability of adaptive phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Hartl1">[38]</xref>, Shannon's diversity index is a better measure of evolutionary potential than are many other commonly used indexes, like Simpson's. In the model, the practical difficulties of estimation from field data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Lande1">[39]</xref> are eliminated. The index, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is defined as<disp-formula id="pone.0091992.e143"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e143" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the proportion of the tumor mass contributed by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>th clone. The Shannon index thus varies between 0 (a monomorphic tumor) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> clones contribute equally to tumor mass). If the evolutionary endpoint is a monomorphic tumor, the Shannon index may be used as a rough measure of how close the tumor is to its climax histology (in the sense of the ecologist's “climax ecosystem”).</p>

<p>Our simulations show that relaxation of restrictive adaptive dynamics assumptions do not alter the predictions of the adaptive dynamics analysis. No matter which definition one uses for “evolutionary dominance,” either the histopathologist's (most mass) or the evolutionary biologist's (largest per-capita growth rate), the mean dominant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from our simulations agrees very well with the CSS (evolutionary attracting strategy) predicted by adaptive dynamics; for example, with default parameter values, the predicted ESS for proliferation effort was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> min<sup>−1</sup> (approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> fmol or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ATP molecules per minute in a resting cell, about half the rate measured in mouse LS cell culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Kilburn1">[40]</xref>) which agrees very well with our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the evolutionarily dominant clone at the close of any given simulation varies, sometimes significantly, from the theoretical ESS from adaptive dynamics. These deviations appear to be caused by mutational contingency—although the ESS is a deterministic evolutionary endpoint, by chance, the mutational history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Vermeij1">[26]</xref> fails to direct the system towards the optimal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> before the tumor grows out of bounds.

<p>Historical contingency has a greater impact on the histopathological picture of tumor natural history than it does on the evolutionary view. If mutant clones nearest the ESS arise late, they will tend to contribute little to the tumor mass as it approaches lethality; the clone favored by selection has no time to become histologically significant. However, these favored clones' per capita expansion rates are large. Therefore, the variance in “dominant phenotype” will tend to be greater in the histopathological rather than the evolutionary view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). This effect is magnified as mutation rate decreases—longer mutation interarrival times gives early-arising, suboptimal clones more time to gain bulk before more well-adapted mutants crop up. As a result, if the number of mutations is fixed, tumors with lower mutation rates have greater variance in “dominant phenotype” at the histological level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, blue plots) and take longer to approach the ESS at the whole tumor level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, since time of arrival has little effect on per capita growth rate, mutation rate has little to no effect on the “dominant” clone as defined by per capita growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, black plots).</p>
<p>These results suggest that, in clinical applications, simple measures of clonal diversity that fail to take clonal abundance into account, like mean phenotype or the ecologist's “species diversity” measure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Lande1">[39]</xref>, will be inferior to metrics like the Shannon diversity index, which magnifies the relative contribution of rare clones to overall tumor diversity. We explore the consequences of this suggestion by evaluating the dynamics of diversity in our simulations, taking proliferation commitment, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In most simulations, transient dynamics in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are longer than are transients in mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g003">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g004">4</xref>). Interestingly, the Shannon index tends to increase with increasing mutation rate even though the total number of mutations remains the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Historical contingency is the culprit here, too. When interarrival times are relatively long, new mutant clones have a diminishing impact on this diversity measure since previously successful clones have more time to gain mass before they are challenged by new mutants. In addition, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> exhibits a large variance both among tumors in the ensemble and within a given tumor over time well after mutations have stopped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, purple curves).</p>

<p>How this variation relates to clinical prognosis is an interesting open question. Maley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Maley1">[35]</xref> addressed a similar issue in Barrett's esophagus. Their study suggested that higher Shannon diversity index in cell ploidy predicts progression from the premalignant state to adenocarcinoma. These authors suggest that this correlation is causative since higher genetic diversity generally leads to more rapid evolution. In the context of the current study, the evolutionary endpoint is the ESS. Therefore, the same reasoning suggests that higher diversity should lead to more rapid convergence to that endpoint. Since diversity increases with mutation rate even for a fixed number of mutations, we therefore expect more rapidly mutating tumors to more rapidly approach the ESS. Indeed, the simulations predict precisely this pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The significance of this is two-fold. Clonal diversity not only helps predict probability of cancer progression, it can also be used to assess the evolutionary potential of tumors that are already malignant. Therefore, we suggest that phenotypic diversity can be a clinically relevant measure that can complement genomic and genetic profiles which are at times so complicated by underlying genetic instability that they can obscure our understanding of tumor drivers.</p>

<title>Evolution of the Angiogenic switch</title>
<p>As described in the introduction, the Nagy-Armbruster model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref> predicts that any ESS for angiogenesis effort (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is an evolutionary repeller—rare mutant strategies further from the ESS are favored. Selection therefore pushes mean phenotype away from the ESS, resulting in runaway selection for either vascular hyper- or hypoplasia. This phenomenon is caused by a complex interaction between adenylate metabolism, energy charge homeostasis and vascular response to angiogenesis signaling. The angiogenesis ESS is also highly sensitive to proliferative effort. For example, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, representing proliferative effort in a healthy, homeostatic tissue, the ESS <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> min<sup>−1</sup> (about 0.08 fmol or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ATP molecules per min per cell). However, as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> changes towards its ESS of 3.67 (assuming it does so independently of selection on angiogenesis potential), the ESS for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> jumps past 90 (more than 135 fmol or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ATP molecules per minute per cell), beyond what is physiologically reasonable.</p>
<p>Here, as in the previous section, we relax the adaptive dynamics assumptions of one mutant challenger at a time and small mutational effect, although we retain the assumption that selection acts only on angiogenesis effort. Here again, simulations agree with the adaptive dynamics analysis. There exists an evolutionarily repelling ESS, so angiogenic commitment evolves to one extreme or the other, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g005">Fig. 5</xref>. If proliferation commitment is low, the angiogenesis ESS is also relatively low. In consequence, many mutants have an angiogenic commitment above the ESS. Because the ESS is repelling, those clones with the highest angiogenic commitment have the greatest advantage, and so <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> evolves to its highest possible value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, left-hand black box). However, if proliferation commitment is high, then the angiogenesis ESS is beyond what is physiologically possible but is still repelling. Therefore, mutants with the lowest angiogenic commitment are most favored, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> evolves to extremely low values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, right-hand black box).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these evolutionary forces remain clinically insignificant because historical contingency completely dominates the dynamics. By the end of the simulations, when tumors are well beyond lethal size, strategies that dominate by mass vary greatly in angiogenic phenotype, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, blue boxes). Therefore, even detailed histopathology studies would reveal no evolutionary pattern unless specific markers for angiogenesis were correlated with proliferation rate. This situation arises because the selection gradient for angiogenesis effort is extremely shallow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref>. Although extreme values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are favored, selective benefits of these extremes are tiny compared to disfavored strategies. Therefore, tumors tend to be dominated histologically by the initial clones that arise because the time required by any selectively favorable clone to overcome these early clones extends well beyond the time required for the tumor to grow to lethal size. Nevertheless, the general evolutionary trend towards “hypertumors” predicted by adaptive dynamics is still evident. All simulations show a clear trajectory towards either vascular hyper- or hypoplasia. In particular, tumors with low proliferation commitment (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1.085 min<sup>−1</sup>) always evolve towards higher angiogenic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), while tumors with high proliferation commitment (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0091992.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 3.65 min<sup>−1</sup>) always creep towards failing angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>In the former case, tumor necrosis occurs once tumor vascular density exceeds 3.2 times normal tissue vascularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, dashed curves).

<p>As tumors progress towards their evolutionary endpoint—the ESS in the case of proliferative potential and extreme hypo- or hyperplasia for angiogenic ability—clonal diversity will tend to decrease. Therefore, the diversity index provides at least a rough measure of how close the tumor system is to its evolutionary endpoint. However, the picture is muddied because selection pressures on proliferation and on angiogenic capacities interact. Weak selective pressures on proliferation allow for increasing diversity in angiogenic capacity, whereas tumors evolving rapidly to a high proliferation commitment tend to be significantly less diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Indeed, a small subset of highly proliferative tumors exhibit rapid declines in tumor diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>); no similar behavior was observed in tumors with low proliferation commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091992-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the dominant role historical contingency plays in evolution of angiogenesis capacity in these simulations, the clinical significance of hypertumors remains an open question. Evolutionary suicide may be the ultimate endpoint of angiogenic tumors, but they may also tend to kill the host before that endpoint is approached in many, perhaps most, cases. However, the simulations as formulated here cannot be used to assess this suggestion since the parameterization is focused on early tumor growing in their exponential phase.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Tumors exist not as homogeneous entities with universal properties or traits, but rather as diverse collections of heterogeneous cell lineages competing for resources with one another and surrounding healthy cells within the tumor stroma. Thus, viewing tumor progression as an evolutionary process is vital to understanding and eventually treating tumors so that resistance does not evolve. Previous adaptive dynamics modeling has shown that selection acts on cells' commitments to proliferation and TAF secretion potential based on their costs and benefits, defined primarily by their effects on metabolism and per capita growth rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0091992-Nagy4">[17]</xref>. However, the analytical techniques used in that study, based on adaptive dynamics, assumes certain biological constraints not commonly observed in cancer growing <italic>in vivo</italic>, including low phenotypic diversity and small mutational effects. Using numerical simulations, we relax these assumptions and show that diverse, complex tumors still adhere to the evolutionary pathways predicted by adaptive dynamics. In particular, (i) the ultimate evolutionary attractor for proliferative commitment is a finite ESS that is also convergence-stable, (ii) selection on angiogenic potential generates an ESS that becomes an evolutionary repeller, and therefore (iii) selection on angiogenesis potential produces vascular instability ultimately leading to evolutionary suicide (hypertumor) by inducing either vascular hypo- or hyperplasia. However, evolutionary trajectories in these simulations are so highly influenced by the tumor's specific mutational history that the predicted evolutionary endpoints may be largely irrelevant to tumor natural history <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
