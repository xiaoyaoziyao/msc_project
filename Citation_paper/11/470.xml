The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome harbors a putative agrin gene <italic>agr-1</italic>. We have cloned the corresponding cDNA to determine the primary structure of the protein and expressed its recombinant fragments to raise specific antibodies. The domain organization of AGR-1 is very similar to the vertebrate orthologues. <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin contains a signal sequence for secretion, seven follistatin domains, three EGF-like repeats and two laminin G domains. AGR-1 loss of function mutants did not exhibit any overt phenotypes and did not acquire resistance to the acetylcholine receptor agonist levamisole. Furthermore, crossing them with various mutants for components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex with impaired muscle function did not lead to an aggravation of the phenotypes. Promoter-GFP translational fusion as well as immunostaining of worms revealed expression of agrin in buccal epithelium and the protein deposition in the basal lamina of the pharynx. Furthermore, dorsal and ventral IL1 head neurons and distal tip cells of the gonad arms are sources of agrin production, but no expression was detectable in body muscles or in the motoneurons innervating them. Recombinant worm AGR-1 fragment is able to cluster vertebrate dystroglycan in cultured cells, implying a conservation of this interaction, but since neither of these proteins is expressed in muscle of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, this interaction may be required in different tissues. The connections between muscle cells and the basement membrane, as well as neuromuscular junctions, are structurally distinct between vertebrates and nematodes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Novartis Research Foundation.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Agrin is a large proteoglycan with a prominent function at the developing neuromuscular junction (NMJ) where it plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters.

All described agrin gene orthologues encode a large protein of more than 2000 amino acids with an approximate molecular weight of 225 kDa. Additional O-linked glycosylation by heparan and chondroitin sulphate glycosaminoglycan chains, together with N-linked carbohydrates, raise the molecular weight up to 400–600 kDa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Tsen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Winzen1">[15]</xref> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Bezakova1">[8]</xref>). The domain architecture of agrin is characterized by several repeated structural motifs which share homology with follistatin (Kazal-type protease inhibitors), laminin epidermal growth factor (EGF) and laminin globular (lamG) domains. In addition, the protein contains a SEA module (common between sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase and agrin) flanked by serine/threonine (S/T)-rich regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Rupp1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Tsim1">[10]</xref>.

Muscle specific kinase (MuSK) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase necessary for agrin-induced AChR clustering without direct interaction with agrin. The missing link in this signaling pathway is a hypothetical protein termed MASC (myotube-associated specificity component) able to mediate the interaction between agrin and MuSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Glass1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Gautam1">[24]</xref>.

Both mutants die at birth due to breathing failure.

Genetic studies on animal models have shown that mutations in many components of the DGC independently lead to the outcome of muscular dystrophies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Batchelor1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Durbeej1">[37]</xref>). Agrin binding to α-DG might contribute to the connection between the ECM and the cytoskeleton thus improving tissue integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Bezakova2">[38]</xref>.

In addition, most of the molecular mechanisms underlying major physiological processes are highly conserved when compared to vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Riddle1">[42]</xref>. Therefore, the experimental data obtained from the worm proved to be highly informative and applicable in elucidating many analogous mechanisms in mammals (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Jorgensen1">[44]</xref>).</p><p>NMJs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have some distinct morphological features when compared to the vertebrate counterparts. Instead of having motoneurons which grow axons towards the muscles they innervate, muscles in <italic>C. elegans</italic> make specialized cell projections called muscle arms, which extend from the muscle bundles to reach the proximal nerve cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Hobert1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Hobert2">[46]</xref>. At the sites of contact, the muscle arms make <italic>en passant</italic> synapses to the motor axons that run along the anterioposterior axis. Depending on the type of the neurotransmitter, the NMJ synapses can be excitatory (cholinergic) or inhibitory (GABAergic). Genetic screens for synaptogenesis mutants have identified key players in NMJ formation and structure. Animals carrying mutations in synaptic components often exhibit uncoordinated movements (<italic>unc</italic>), egg-laying defects (<italic>egl</italic>), defecation defects or paralysis. Pharmacological assays with nematocidal drugs, such as the cholinergic agonist levamisole or the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor aldicarb, have been extensively used in screening for mutants that are resistant to these drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Brenner1">[41]</xref>. The genes for several postsynaptic AChR subunits were identified on the basis of the resistance to levamisole, e.g. <italic>unc-29</italic>, <italic>unc-38</italic>, <italic>unc-63</italic>, <italic>lev-1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Brenner1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Lewis1">[47]</xref>. Neuromuscular junctions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are highly dynamic structures. Several proteins have been identified as crucial factors for normal NMJ development. One of them is a transmembrane protein LEV-10. The mutant was identified as weakly resistant to levamisole due to significantly reduced postsynaptic density of AChRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Gally1">[48]</xref>. Interestingly, the LEV-10 extracellular protein domain alone is sufficient to rescue the <italic>lev-10</italic> mutant phenotype, suggesting a novel AChR clustering mechanism.</p><p>In vertebrates one of the key factors involved in AChR clustering is the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK. The gene with the highest similarity to MuSK in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is an orphan receptor KIN-8 (CAM-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Koga1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Forrester1">[50]</xref>. In addition to the impairment in cell polarity and neuron migration, the <italic>kin-8</italic>/<italic>cam-1</italic> mutants are uncoordinated and have mislocalized AChR subunit ACR-16 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Francis1">[51]</xref>. Therefore, KIN-8/CAM-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> might be a protein with a role similar to MuSK in vertebrates. Several other synaptic ECM proteins have been implicated in the NMJ formation in the worm, namely collagen XVIII (CLE-1) and nidogen (NID-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Ackley1">[52]</xref>. Single mutants in each of the genes exhibit reduced numbers of the enlarged and diffuse postsynaptic receptor clusters.</p><p>Different genetic approaches have been taken to investigate the functions of the vertebrate gene homologues identified in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (reverse genetics) or to identify the previously unknown genes which, if mutated in the worm, result in interesting phenotypes (forward genetics). In reverse genetic approaches, the goal is to learn more about a particular gene of interest and address its mechanisms of action in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Zwaal1">[53]</xref>. Since in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, two closely related nematode worm species, putative agrin orthologues have been identified on the basis of genomic sequence analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Hutter1">[54]</xref>, we decided to take a reverse genetics approach to clone the <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin cDNA, characterize the protein, and describe its expression pattern. We found expression of agrin in four head neurons, in the distal tip cell of the gonad, and in epithelial cells of the pharynx. We could not detect any agrin in muscle or at NMJs and genetic analysis of agrin mutants did not provide any evidence for a major function of agrin in AChR clustering or muscle function in the worm. However, the known binding of agrin to α-DG in vertebrates seems to be conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, pointing to an ancestral role of this interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> expresses an agrin-like gene <italic>agr-1</italic></title><p>A nematode agrin gene, with sequence homology to vertebrate agrin, was identified in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. The analysis was based on queries by BLAST searches of Wormpep followed by reciprocal BLAST searches of insect or mammalian orthologs in GenBank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Hutter1">[54]</xref>. In WormBase, the online database of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, the agrin gene was mapped to the cosmid F41G3, originally as two separate open reading frames (ORFs) named F41G3.12 and F41G3.15, corresponding to the 5′ and the other to the 3′ part of vertebrate agrin, respectively. Based on the predicted gene sequences, the agrin-specific primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000731-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) were used to amplify overlapping fragments of each of the predicted ORFs and of a putative common transcript from cDNA reverse transcribed from RNA isolated from mixed stages of worms. As a result, three overlapping fragments gave rise to one unique agrin sequence instead of the two ORFs predicted by WormBase. The incorrect prediction was probably due to three sequence mistakes present in WormBase which resulted in false stop codons.

In WormBase release WS170 a single agrin transcript of 1483 aa is predicted that shares 88% identity with our experimentally determined sequence. Due to the above mentioned nucleotide omissions in the genomic sequence as well as several incorrect splice site predictions the WormBase protein differs from ours in six locations. The identified <italic>agr-1</italic> coding region is 4422 bp long, with 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of 212 and 160 bp, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g001">Fig. 1</xref>; EMBL/GeneBank Accession AM773423).

The color scheme follows the same pattern as presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. Predicted N-glycosylation sites are shown with blue circles. Vertebrate agrins have two alternative N-termini: a secreted form, with a signal sequence (SS; dark purple) and a laminin-binding N-terminal agrin domain (NtA; light purple). These are followed by follistatin domains, including one more than in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (F; blue), a sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase and agrin domain (SEA; light blue), two serine/threonine rich regions (S/T; light orange), and three laminin G domains (LamG; yellow). O-linked heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate chains are schematically shown as branches and several N-linked glycoslation sites as blue circles. Alternative splicing at the last two LamG domains of vertebrate agrin (A/y and B/z) gives rise to several agrin isoforms with different functions, but no alternative splicing was found in <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin.

Vertebrate agrin molecules exist in two different forms, one with a signal sequence followed by a laminin-binding NtA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, light purple) and another one with a non-cleaved signal sequence (TM, empty rectangle) serving as a transmembrane anchor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Denzer1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Neumann1">[18]</xref>. Using a 5′ RACE approach in <italic>C. elegans</italic> only one isoform was found, containing a signal sequence but no laminin-binding NtA domain.

However, we could not find any potential exon encoding a domain similar to the NtA domain in the genomic sequence. The N-terminal part of AGR-1 has seven repetitive follistatin domains, while vertebrate agrin contains eight of them. Further differences are present in the C-terminal part of the AGR-1 protein where the serine/theonine-rich regions (S/T, light yellow) as well as the SEA (sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, agrin) domain are missing. Vertebrate agrin is a heavily glycosylated protein carrying large O-linked heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate chains at several positions in the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Tsen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Winzen1">[15]</xref> shown as branched structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g003">Fig. 3</xref>. This is probably not the case for AGR-1 since the S/T-rich region is missing. Finally, vertebrate agrins have three laminin G domains (lam G), while AGR-1 has only two and no EGF-like domains separating them. The overall similarities of the different agrin segments to the corresponding regions of chicken agrin are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g003">Fig. 3</xref>.</p><p>When the LamG domains from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein were used as a query against Swissprot, Trembl and Refseq databases the best hits besides the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> predicted agrin homologue (Q61GM7_CAEBR) included vertebrate agrins as well as laminins themselves and perlecans, shown in the alignments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g004">Fig. 4A and 4B</xref>. In addition, a reciprocal analysis was done to see if some vertebrate agrin lamG domains produce best similarity hits with the nematode one. It turned out that the LamG domains of <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin are quite distinct from those in vertebrates, and that the most similar lamG domains in vertebrates do not produce clear reciprocal best hits. This is not surprising since the LamG domains of the different proteins revealed equal similiarites to <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin LamG domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g004">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). However, blast searches with each AGR-1 LamG separately resulted in a better match between the first <italic>C. elegans</italic> lamG and the second LamG from several vertebrate homologues, as well as between the second <italic>C. elegans</italic> LamG and the third LamG domain of vertebrate agrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g004">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). This implies that the two LamG domains of <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin rather correspond to the last two LamG domains of vertebrate agrin. This is further supported by the alignment of the region preceding the second LamG domain of AGR-1, which aligned best to the chicken B<sub>0</sub> agrin isoform, i.e. it does not contain any inserts at the conserved B/z site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Based on the overall domain architecture and the fact that <italic>agr-1</italic> is the only gene in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome to encode a protein of this unique domain composition we conclude that AGR-1 is the nematode agrin orthologue and not an orthologue of any other lamG domain-containing protein.</p><fig id="pone-0000731-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000731.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Alignment of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> lamG domains to the corresponding domains of other proteins.</title><p>A, The first LamG domain of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein (Agrin_LamG1_<italic>C.elegans</italic>) was used as a query for Swissprot, Trembl and Refseq databases.

In terms of domain structure, a high degree of similarity was found between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and vertebrate agrins, although some domains were missing. In the worm, only one N-terminal variant was detectable containing a secretion signal but no NtA domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Denzer1">[11]</xref>. Several other domains were missing, namely the Ser/Thr-rich region, the SEA module, and one of the three lamG domains at the C-terminal end of the molecule. We analyzed the two lamG domains present in the worm and compared them to the vertebrate lamG domains to determine whether they corresponded to a particular domain pair of vertebrate agrin. Blast searches revealed that the AGR-1 LamG domains aligned best to the last two LamG domains of vertebrate agrin. However, we could not detect any small inserts known to be important for the clustering function of the vertebrate neuronal agrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Ruegg2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Gesemann1">[21]</xref>. When we searched the intron sequences between the last few exons encoding the LamG domains in all three frames, we could not detect any potential alternative exons coding for amino acids resembling the conserved inserts in the A/y and B/z sites of vertebrates. Therefore, we concluded that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> there is only one major agrin isoform expressed and that the A/y and B/z alternative spice sites are specific to vertebrates.</p><p>With the goal to detect the endogenous agrin by western blot, we raised polyclonal antibodies against the fragment comprising two lamG domains. Purified antibodies detected protein bands of about 160 kDa and 75 kDa, present only in the lysates of the wild type worms and not in any of the agrin mutants. The bigger band corresponds to the protein core size and the smaller possibly to a degradation product or a shorter isoform. In the loss of function mutants <italic>agr-1(eg1770)</italic> and <italic>agr-1(eg153)</italic> we expected a complete lack of the protein, but <italic>agr-1(tm2051)</italic> carrying an in-frame deletion and was expected to express a shorter protein. However, in the <italic>agr-1(tm2051)</italic> mutant the deleted exons 26 and 27 encode the majority of the region against which the polyclonal antibodies were raised. Therefore, this truncated protein may not be recognized and no band detected even though the protein may be expressed. Another possibility is that the protein with the deletion does not fold properly and gets degraded. In any case, it is clear that the agrin mutants do not express the normal agrin protein as the wild type worms do.</p><p>The most surprising result of our study was the fact that we could not detect any agrin expression neither in body wall muscles nor in motoneurons innervating them (except for a transient expression in some embryonic motoneurons). The lack of agrin expression at the NMJs suggested that agrin may not have a conserved function in AChR clustering in the worm. Nevertheless, we investigated the possible phenotypes in <italic>C. elegans agr-1</italic> mutants related to muscle and/or NMJ function. In the case of defective muscle or NMJ formation, worms should display uncoordinated (<italic>unc</italic>) movement, defective thrashing pattern, and/or egg laying deficiency. However, we did not observe any significant impairment neither in <italic>agr-1</italic> single mutants, nor in combination with other related mutations. Pharmacological assays with levamisole, a potent nematode-specific cholinergic agonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Lewis1">[47]</xref> and aldicarb, an ACh esterase inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Nguyen1">[71]</xref>, did not reveal any resistance in <italic>agr-1</italic> mutants. Therefore, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> we could not find any evidence for a role of agrin in muscle or synaptic functions, suggesting that the ancestral function of Agrin was not in NMJ formation. In accordance with our hypothesis, no clear MuSK orthologue (the vertebrate receptor for agrin) has been found in the nematode. Up to date only two factors important for nicotinic AChR clustering have been characterized in the worm. The Ror RTK Cam-1 is necessary for the localization of the ACR-16 (nicotinic AChR α-subunit) at the NMJ, but no kinase activity is needed for this function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Francis1">[51]</xref>. Another protein, essential for clustering levamisole-sensitive AChR at the NMJ in the worm, is LEV-10. Also for LEV-10, its extracellular domain was shown to be sufficient for the clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Gally1">[48]</xref>. Interestingly, vertebrates express proteins that share high similarity to CAM-1 and LEV-10, suggesting that these novel factors discovered in the worm could have been conserved during evolution. Thus, both CAM-1 and LEV-10 may be components of distinct pathways important for AChR clustering in nematodes that may have been complemented by the agrin-MuSK pathway during evolution in vertebrates.</p><p>We then took a closer look at the sites of agrin expression visualized by reporter genes and antibody staining. Prominent expression was found in four head neurons and some pharyngeal cells. This relatively restricted expression pattern was confirmed by several reporter constructs with varying portions of the gene as well as by antibody staining.</p><p>We identified the four agrin-expressing neurons by injecting <italic>agr-1::dsRED</italic> construct into the transgenic lines expressing GFP in specific neuron subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Lee1">[58]</xref>.

There are six IL1 neurons in total (three pairs) in the head of the worm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-White1">[73]</xref>, but agrin was found to be expressed only in the dorsal and ventral pairs. Such a sub-specialization might be significant to distinguish very fine sensory inputs from the environment. It is known that IL1 neurons together with OLQ (outer labial quadrant sensilla) neurons are responsible for the sensing of a light nose touch and the regulation of spontaneous foraging movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Hart1">[72]</xref>. Therefore, we tested agrin mutants for light nose-touch-avoidance by the eyelash test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Kaplan1">[74]</xref>. Agrin mutants seemed to be as sensitive to touch as the wild type worms, suggesting that absence of agrin does not lead to a complete failure of IL1 function. Furthermore, IL1 neurons did not show any morphological abnormalities in the <italic>agr-1(eg1770); hdEx25</italic> strain.</p><p>The pharyngeal cells expressing agrin belong to the buccal epithelium which surrounds the anterior-most part of the pharyngeal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Albertson1">[75]</xref>; Wormatlas, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormatlas.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.wormatlas.org/</ext-link>). In early larvae agrin is also expressed in other pharyngeal cells, most likely the marginal cells. The epithelial tissue forms a rigid narrow cylinder restricting the food entry into the pharynx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Albertson1">[75]</xref>. Agrin expressed in this tissue might have a function in the structural support of the pharynx. The immunostaining with monoclonal and polyclonal anti-agrin antibodies detected the protein around the pharynx, resembling perlecan immunostaining in the pharynx basal lamina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Mullen1">[76]</xref>. Thus, agrin is probably secreted from the pharyngeal cells and integrated into the basal lamina. This pharyngeal staining was missing in all three agrin mutant strains. To test proper pharynx function we measured the pumping rate, which did not differ between agrin mutants and wild type worms. To challenge pharynx function more drastically we tested whether bacterial size had any influence on the feeding and ingestion capability of the worms. For that purpose we grew the worms on <italic>Bacillus megatherium</italic>, a strain of large bacteria and compared it to the <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 strain used in regular laboratory maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Avery1">[70]</xref>. Pumping defective mutant strains <italic>eat-4(ky5)</italic> and <italic>eat-5(ad464)</italic>, which grow much more slowly on large bacteria, were used as positive controls. On both food sources our agrin mutant <italic>agr-1 (eg1770)</italic> grew equally fast as wild type worms. Pharynx morphology and resistance to mechanical stress seemed normal in the <italic>agr-1 (eg1770)</italic> mutant animals, suggesting that agrin is not essential for proper development or structural support. If agrin plays a role in pharynx-related functions, it is subtle or redundant.</p><p>Some expression of agrin was present in the distal tip cells of developing gonads in young larvae. The distal tip cell is critical for germ line proliferation and guides gonad migration by sensing environmental cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Schedl1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Merz1">[78]</xref>. We have investigated a possible effect of agrin deficiency in gonad migration or brood size, but the mutants were indistinguishable from the wild type worms in these aspects.</p><p>Interaction between agrin and α-dystroglycan in vertebrates is important in different tissues and processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Bezakova1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Grewal1">[79]</xref>). At the NMJ, DG stabilizes mature synapses by connecting the basal lamina to cortical F-actin. In the muscle sarcolemma DG is a central component of a large dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) where it serves again as a linker between the ECM and intracellular cytoskeletal proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Martin1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Michele1">[34]</xref>). At the NMJ and at the muscle membrane agrin binds with its C-terminal lamG domains to α-DG and with its N-terminal part to laminin providing additional support. Interaction between agrin and α-DG is found as well in the immune system, where this binding mediates lymphocyte activation via a lipid raft-dependent mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Zhang1">[40]</xref>. Based on the established knowledge on vertebrate agrin and DG, we decided to investigate whether this interaction is conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We could demonstrate direct binding of a recombinant fragment of <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin to purified vertebrate α-DG by a membrane overlay assay. In COS cells transfected with the same recombinant fragment, endogenous DG was clustered and colocalized with agrin bound to the cell membrane.</p><p>Taken together, our experiments suggest that the interaction between agrin and dystroglycan may be conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> but this interaction does not play a role at the NMJ or in muscle in general. This view is supported by the observation that <italic>C. elegans</italic> dystroglycan, <italic>dgn-1</italic>, is not expressed in muscle either, but rather in epithelia and neurons. It is found in basement membrane surfaces and is not involved in muscle function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Johnson1">[80]</xref>. Therefore, the structural organization at the molecular level of the NMJ, as well as the DGC complex, is clearly distinct in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as compared to vertebrates. Our studies demonstrate that the existence of protein orthologs in evolutionarily distant organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Hutter1">[54]</xref> does not necessarily imply identical functions, at least not in every aspect. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> it appears that the muscle basal lamina depends rather on the presence of the perlecan orthologue <italic>unc-52</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Rogalski1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Mullen1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Rogalski2">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Francis2">[82]</xref> and on the integrin chain orthologues <italic>pat-2</italic> and <italic>pat-3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Williams1">[83]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Kramer1">[86]</xref> and not on dystroglycan and its ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Johnson1">[80]</xref>. On the other hand dystroglycan and agrin appear to function in epithelia and certain neurons but not in muscle. Our results indicate that the ancestral agrin function included dystroglycan binding but not AChR clustering activity at NMJs, a feature acquired later during evolution. Since also in vertebrates, agrin is expressed outside of muscle and NMJs, <italic>C. elegans</italic> can be a good model organism to delineate these ancestral functions of agrin that may still be functional in vertebrates as well.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>C. elegans culture conditions and preparation for RNA and protein extraction</title><p>The worm strains were grown at 20°C on NGM agar plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Brenner1">[41]</xref>.

The β-dystroglycan antibody was visualized by a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled with a red dye (Alexa Fluor<sup>®</sup> 594, Molecular Probes) and anti-agrin by green-labelled goat anti-mouse (Alexa Fluor<sup>®</sup> 488, Molecular Probes).</p></sec><sec id="s4m"><title>Immunofluorescence staining of endogenous worm agrin</title><p>Worms were immunostained following a modified Finney&amp;Ruvkun protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Finney1">[103]</xref>. Mixed stages of worms, grown on NGM plates, were extensively washed in M9 buffer. The last wash was done with deionised water and the worms were quick-frozen on dry ice/ethanol in Ruvkun fixation buffer mix diluted from a 2× stock (160 mM KCl, 40 mM NaCl, 20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EGTA, 10mM spermidine-HCl, 30mM Pipes, pH 7.4, and 50% methanol) with the addition of 1.5% formaldehyde. Following permeabilization by freeze-thaw in three cycles, worms were fixed for 1 hour on ice. The cuticle reduction and final permeabilisation was done by TTB and 1% β-mercaptoethanol overnight, slowly rotating at 37°C. Permeabilization was completed the following day by 10mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 1× BO<sub>3</sub> buffer (diluted from 20× stock: 1M H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5M NaOH), including 0.01% Triton and 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the same buffer for additional 15 minutes. The worms were blocked in AbB buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.05% Na-azide, and 1mM EDTA) and immunostained with the antibody solution in the AbA buffer (1% BSA) overnight at 4°C with gentle rocking. The mouse monoclonal anti-agrin antibody pool used at 1∶200 dilution, the rabbit polyclonal anti-agrin antibody at 1∶100, and a rabbit polyclonal anti-rim antibody 1∶6000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Koushika1">[69]</xref>. The anti-rim was kindly provided by Prof. Michael Nonet. Worms were washed with AbB during several hours and incubated with the secondary antibody at 1∶1000 dilution in AbA buffer at room temperature gently rocking in the dark during two hours. For agrin monoclonal antibodies anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with a green dye (Alexa Fluor<sup>®</sup> 488, Molecular Probes), for polyclonal anti-agrin secondary anti-rabbit labeled green (Alexa Fluor<sup>®</sup> 488, Molecular Probes) and for rim polyclonal antibody red-labeled anti-rabbit (Alexa Fluor<sup>®</sup> 546, Molecular Probes) was used. Following extensive washing in AbB during two hours, the worms were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol (Dabco) mounting medium. Images of agrin/rim co-staining were obtained by a confocal LSM510 META Axioplan2 microscope and for single agrin stainings by the polyclonal antibody a Zeiss Axioscope Bio microscope was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4n"><title>In vitro assay for agrin-β-dystroglycan binding</title><p>Purified chicken α-dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Scotton1">[104]</xref>; kind gift from Prof. Markus Rüegg) was run on 7.5% SDS PAGE (2.5 µg protein per lane) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked for two hours in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20, 1mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5% milk).

Detection of bound agrin fragments was performed as described for western blotting with minor modifications. The polyclonal anti-chick agrin antibodies were prepared by Dr. Shuo Lin and kindly provided to us by Prof. Markus Rüegg. Incubation with the primary antibodies was done during 3 hours at room temperature. Polyclonal anti-chicken agrin antibody was diluted 1∶2000 in 5% milk blocking solution.
