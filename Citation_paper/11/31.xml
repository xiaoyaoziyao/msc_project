        <p>Previously we have screened out Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 7 (IGFBP7) as a differentially expressed gene in post-implantation uterus versus pre-implantation uterus by suppressive subtractive hybridation. However its function in uterus was not clearly identified. In this research, the expression and function of IGFBP7 during post-implantation were studied. We found that IGFBP7 was mainly located in the glandular epithelium and the stroma, and was upregulated after embryo implantation. The vector pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t expressing partial IGFBP7 was constructed. Inhibition of IGFBP7 by specific DNA immunization induced significant reduction of implanted embryos and pregnancy rate. The number of implanted embryos (5.68±0.46) was significantly reduced after immunization with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t, as compared with that of the mice immunized with the control vector (12.29±0.36) or saline (14.58±0.40) (p&lt;0.01). After specific inhibition of IGFBP7, the T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine IFNγ, was significantly elevated (p&lt;0.05) and the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10, were reduced in uteri (p&lt;0.05). The increase of Tbet and the decrease of Gata3 were found in mice peripheral lymphocytes by flow cytometry. The expression of decidualization marker IGFBP1 and angiogenesis regulator VEGF were declined in uteri (p&lt;0.05). The expression of apoptosis-associated proteins, caspase3 and Bcl-2, were also declined (p&lt;0.05). These results showed that inhibition of IGFBP7 induced pregnancy failure by shifting uterine cytokines to Th1 type dominance and repressing uterine decidualization.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>IGFBP7 is a 31-kD secretory protein that is also known as IGFBP-related protein 1 (IGFBP-rP1), mac25, TAF or angiomodulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Hwa1">[1]</xref>. IGFBP7 has an N-terminal IGFBP domain, which shares a high homology with other IGFBPs (IGFBP 1–6) but exhibits a low affinity for IGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Oh1">[2]</xref>, and an immunoglobulin domain at the C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Collet1">[3]</xref>. IGFBP7 is widely known as a tumor suppressor gene and is mostly downregulated in many types of cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Yamashita1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Ye1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Heesch1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Wajapeyee1">[7]</xref>. IGFBP7 mRNA is found in uterine glandular epithelial cells and endometrial stromal cells (ESCs), and the mRNA expression is elevated from the mid to late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle in women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Dominguez1">[8]</xref>. In vitro studies have revealed that IGFBP7 functions as a decidualization modulator in endometrial stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Tamura1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Kutsukake1">[10]</xref>. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, IGFBP7 treatment suppressed extrinsic VEGF-induced tube formation, proliferation, and the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Tamura2">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Embryo implantation, which is an important restricting factor for a successful pregnancy, is a cross-talking process that consists of trophoblast invasion into the maternal endometrium and the formation of maternal uterine receptivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Dey1">[12]</xref>. Approximately 75% of pregnancy failures are due to abnormal embryo implantation and placenta formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Norwitz1">[13]</xref>. Our previous research has elucidated that IGFBP7 regulates the human trophoblast proliferation and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Liu1">[14]</xref>. Multiple biological processes are of key importance for embryo implantation. Decidual cells are differentiated from ESCs with the secretion of IGFBP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Tseng1">[15]</xref>, and they perform functions in producing growth factors and cytokines, regulating maternal immune responses and restricting trophoblast invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Dey1">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, embryo implantation relies on extensive vascular remodeling in the endometrial stroma to provide enough nutrients and oxygen for the growing embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Krussel1">[16]</xref>, and uterine decidualization and angiogenesis are crucial for the establishment and maintenance of uterine receptivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Sherer1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Lockwood1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, the expression and function of IGFBP7 in uterus was studied by a specific DNA immunization containing truncated IGFBP7 (IGFBP7-t) cDNA in mice. The post-implantation pregnancy failure was significantly higher in the mice immunized with IGFBP7-t expressing plasmid, pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t. We also found that a shift of the cytokine balance to Th1 type dominance and defective stromal decidualization were involved in the pregnancy failure induced by inhibition of IGFBP7.</p>

        <p>The healthy and sexually mature female mice were randomly divided into three groups. All of the mice were injected with 100 µl of 0.25% bupivacaine-HCl by multi-spot injections in the leg quadriceps muscle. After 24 h, the mice of the treatment group were injected with 50 ng of pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t (the construction and validation procedure of pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0045224.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) in 100 µl saline (n = 60), and the mice of the control groups were injected with 50 ng of pCR3.1 in 100 of µl saline (control 1, n = 45) or with 100 µl saline (control 2, n = 45). The immunizations were performed three times, with one-week intervals. For each group, blood and muscle samples of five mice were collected one week after the last immunization.</p>
        <p>After the last immunization, the female mice were caged with males at a ratio of 2∶1. Day 1 of pregnancy (D1) was validated by the presence of a vaginal plug the next morning. The uteri of pregnant mice sacrificed at D6 or D7 were excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. The numbers of embryos were calculated, photographed and compared with those of the control groups.</p>

After blocking with 5% skim milk for 2 h, a serial dilution of the antisera from the mice immunized with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t, pCR3.1 or saline were incubated with antigen at 37°C for 2 h, followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody (dilution 1∶10000) at 37°C for 1 h. The plate was then incubated with a Substrate Reaction Pack (R&amp;D, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured using a Bio-Rad 3550 micro-plate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).</p>
        <p>Mouse IGFBP1 ELISA kit was used to evaluate the concentration of IGFBP1 in the uteri after immunizations. The protein of mouse uteri after immunizations was incubated with HRP-conjugate reagent in a 96-well micro-titer plate coated with mouse IGFBP1 antibody at 37°C for 60 min. After five times plate washing, the chromogen solution A and B were incubated at 37°C for 15 min. The OD at 450 nm was measured using a Bio-Rad 3550 micro-plate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) after adding the stop solution and within 15 min. The concentration was calculated according to the standard concentration and corresponding OD values linear regression equation.</p>

        <title>Effect of IGFBP7 on Peripheral Lymphocyte Balance and Th-associated Cytokines Expression in the Uterus</title>
        <p>In order to identify the molecules that are involved with pregnancy failure, the key cytokines that regulate uterus receptivity were examined in the uteri of immunized mice at D5 and D7 of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045224-g004">Fig. 4C and D</xref>). At D7 of pregnancy we found that the expression of cytokines was altered: Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 were decreased; Th1 cytokine IFNγ was elevated in the mice immunized with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t. There was no notable change in the TGFβ levels among the different groups. At D5 of pregnancy, the expression of IL-10 was decreased, while other molecules were not notably altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045224-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). These results suggest an alternation of immune balance after inhibition of IGFBP7. To confirm our results, the expression of a marker of Th1 differentiation Tbet, and a marker of Th2 differentiation Gata3 at D7 of pregnancy were detected by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045224-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The increase of Tbet and the decrease of Gata3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045224-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) suggest the ratio of Th1/Th2 lymphocytes was biased to Th1 dominance after immunization with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t, which is consistent with the western blotting results.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Successful pregnancy in primates requires a well-established decidua and an adaptable immune microenvironment. In the mouse, embryos implant into the uterus at D4.5 in a normal pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Dey1">[12]</xref>. A series of cell transformation and differentiation events then takes place, and immediately after implantation, ESCs transform into decidual cells to establish uterine receptivity. In vitro studies have shown that IGFBP7 is expressed and secreted in ESCs, and the inhibition of IGFBP7 in ESCs induces the decrease of IGFBP1 and prolactin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Tamura1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Kutsukake1">[10]</xref>. However, the role of IGFBP7 in vivo has yet to be clearly elucidated. In this study, we constructed a vector, pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t, containing a truncated IGFBP7 coding sequence in order to investigate the effect of IGFBP7 on uterine receptivity and pregnancy in female mice. The immunizations were based on our previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Chang1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Xiong1">[20]</xref> and involved pre-inoculation with the muscle-damaging agent bupivacaine at the injection sites one day before the DNA immunization. Our in vitro validation of the expression and specificity showed the successful expression of pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t mRNA, and the antibody generated by the immunization with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t specifically reacted with the IGFBP7-t expressed by pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t in transfected Hela cells. Both the pregnancy rate and number of implanted embryos were significantly reduced after the immunization with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t.</p>
      <p>The immune microenvironment of the uterus is crucial for the maintenance of pregnancy, and cytokines are considered to be key regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Robertson1">[21]</xref>. Previously pregnancy was recognized as a predominant Th2 immunity event, which may protect the fetus from being attacked by Th1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Wegmann1">[22]</xref>. However, predominant Th2 type immunity was found in abortion cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Chaouat1">[23]</xref>, and the typical Th2 type cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 KO mice are fertile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Svensson1">[24]</xref>. These evidences indicate that Th2 dominance is insufficient in pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Zenclussen1">[25]</xref>. Now the Th1/Th2 paradigm has been expanded into Th1/Th2/Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells paradigm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Saito1">[26]</xref>. Th17 cells play a role in inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Peck1">[27]</xref>, while Treg cells are important in immunoregulation and immunotolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Zenclussen2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Leber1">[29]</xref>. The differentiation of both Th17 and Treg cells from naive T cells require the involvement of TGFβ. In our data there is no notable change of TGFβ among different groups, which may indicate that the differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells were not significantly influenced by inhibition of IGFBP7. The increase of Th1 differentiation marker Tbet and the decrease of Th2 differentiation marker Gata3 implicated that the Th1/Th2 ratio is biased to Th1 dominance after immunization of pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t, and also confirmed the expression profile of the Th1 and Th2 cytokines. At D7 we observed that IFNγ was elevated, whereas Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 were decreased in the uterus after the immunization with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t. IL-10 is not only a typical Th2 cytokine, but also plays an important role in Treg functioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Leber1">[29]</xref>. Moreover, IL-10 also regulates the vascular remodeling and hypertension to maintain pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Nevers1">[30]</xref>. IL-10 could rescue intrauterine growth restriction and proteinuria in IL-10<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Lai1">[31]</xref>. The uNK-derived IFNγ facilitate the gestation spiral aterial modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Zhang1">[32]</xref>. However, excessive IFNγ is deleterious to pregnancy. Therefore, the expressions of both the transcription factors and cytokines exhibited a tendency toward the diminution and exclusion of the fetus.</p>
      <p>IGFBP1 is recognized as a decidualization marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Kutsukake1">[10]</xref>. In our study, IGFBP1 was significantly reduced in mice at D7 after immunization with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t, as compared with the controls. This result implicates the insufficient formation of decidual cells as a possible factor that contributes to the partial pregnancy failure. However, apoptosis is involved in the establishment of uterine receptivity, and specific uterine cells undergo apoptosis during decidualization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Schlafke1">[33]</xref>. Caspase3, the final effector protein of apoptosis, was downregulated at D7 after immunization with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t. Bcl-2, which is well known as an apoptosis-inhibiting protein, was also downregulated at D7. The ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 partially contributes to the cell fate in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Mikhailov1">[34]</xref>; however, Bcl-2 also functions as a cell cycle inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Vairo1">[35]</xref>. These results implicated an attenuated apoptosis process in the uteri after the immunization with IGFBP7, which may also contribute to insufficient decidualization. Furthermore, a notable decrease of VEGF was also observed in the pregnant mice immunized with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t at D7. VEGF is essential for angiogenesis through the regulation of endothelial proliferation and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Neufeld1">[36]</xref>; hence, a high expression of VEGF is beneficial for the growth of the embryos and placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Wheeler1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Hefler1">[38]</xref>, whereas a low expression may contribute to inadequate embryo implantation or development.</p>
      <p>According to our previous research, the effect of DNA immunization was released gradually after immunizations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045224-Chen1">[39]</xref>. As the immunizations were prior to the mating of mice, the cumulative effect after immunization with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t may impair the implantation process. We found out that three molecules, IL-10, Bcl-2 and IGFBP1, were downregulated on D5, while the upregulation of IFNγ and the downregulation of IL-4, Caspase-3 and VEGF were also observed on D7. This gradual impact on the molecules could partially stand for it. However the further mechanism of IGFBP7 on implantation is still worth devoting in. Overall, we observed alterations in the uterine environment after the immunization with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t, which was generally disadvantageous for pregnancy maintenance. As the establishment of uterine receptivity is a complex process, it remains unclear whether the observed physiological and immunological changes are directly due to the interference of IGFBP7 or are secondary effects on decidualization induced by the loss of IGFBP7. The inhibitory effects of pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t immunization on pregnancy genes may not be restricted to the uterus despite the fact that we removed the sequence coding for the highly conserved IGFBP domain in the construction of pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t to minimize any off-target effects. Similarly, the impact of the suppression of IGFBP7 on the neonates requires further study. In conclusion, we found that IGFBP7 was mainly expressed in the glandular epithelium and stoma and was significantly upregulated during the post-implantation period. Immunization with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t could reduce the embryo implantation and pregnancy rates in mice by generating anti-IGFBP7 antibodies. After immunization with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t, the decidualization in pregnant uterus was repressed, and the balances of cytokines and lymphocytes were shifted to Th1 dominance.</p>

          <p><bold>Construction and validation of the plasmid pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t.</bold> A: Schematic diagram of pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t. A partial sequence of IGFBP7 (NM_008048.3, CDS: 253 bp-849 bp) containing the functional domains was cloned from mouse uterus using primers with HindIII/KpnI restriction sites (the forward primer with the HindIII digestion site, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CCC<underline>AAGCTT</underline>GATGGAGTGCGTGAAGAGC</named-content>; the reverse primer with the KpnI digestion site, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CGG<underline>GGTACC</underline>TTATAACTGAGCACCTTCACC</named-content>). The sequence was then cloned into the pCR3.1 vector B: Enzyme digestion. Lane 1 shows pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t before HindIII/KpnI digestion. Lane 2 shows pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t digested with HindIII/KpnI for 2 h. The band between 500 bp and 750 bp represents the inserted sequence. C: The mRNA expression of pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t in transfected Hela cells. The cDNA of Hela cells transfected with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t or pCR3.1 and non-transfected cells were used as the templates for PCR amplification. GAPDH served as the internal control. D: The mRNA expression of pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t in the muscle of immunized mice. To obtain antisera, the pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t and control vectors were injected into the muscles of the mice. After immunization, the IGFBP7 mRNA expression of the mice immunized with pCR3.1-IGFBP7-t was elevated.</p>
