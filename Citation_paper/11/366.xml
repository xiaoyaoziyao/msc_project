<abstract>
<p>In response to peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells adopt a migratory phenotype and modify the extracellular matrix to make it permissive for cell migration and axonal re-growth. Uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP) and other nucleotides are released during nerve injury and activate purinergic receptors expressed on the Schwann cell surface, but little is known about the involvement of purine signalling in wound healing. We studied the effect of UTP on Schwannoma cell migration and wound closure and the intracellular signaling pathways involved. We found that UTP treatment induced Schwannoma cell migration through activation of P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors and through the increase of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activation and expression. Knockdown P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor or MMP-2 expression greatly reduced wound closure and MMP-2 activation induced by UTP. MMP-2 activation evoked by injury or UTP was also mediated by phosphorylation of all 3 major mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): JNK, ERK1/2, and p38. Inhibition of these MAPK pathways decreased both MMP-2 activation and cell migration. Interestingly, MAPK phosphorylation evoked by UTP exhibited a biphasic pattern, with an early transient phosphorylation 5 min after treatment, and a late and sustained phosphorylation that appeared at 6 h and lasted up to 24 h. Inhibition of MMP-2 activity selectively blocked the late, but not the transient, phase of MAPK activation. These results suggest that MMP-2 activation and late MAPK phosphorylation are part of a positive feedback mechanism to maintain the migratory phenotype for wound healing. In conclusion, our findings show that treatment with UTP stimulates <italic>in vitro</italic> Schwannoma cell migration and wound repair through a MMP-2-dependent mechanism via P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors and MAPK pathway activation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Peripheral nerve injury initiates a sequence of events through which macrophages and Schwann cells clear damaged axons and potentiate axonal regeneration and nerve remyelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Griffin1">[1]</xref>. During Wallerian degeneration, de-differentiating Schwann cells secrete growth factors and neurite-promoting factors to guide the growing axon, as well as proteolytic enzymes to remodel extracellular matrix (ECM) and facilitate cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Heumann1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Jessen1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Cheng1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Li1">[5]</xref></p>
<p>One important class of proteases are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a large family of zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes that act on a wide number of extracellular and cell surface receptors, ligands, and adhesion and structural proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-PageMcCaw1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Chang1">[7]</xref>. MMP upregulation has been linked to the pathogenesis of peripheral nerve damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Leppert1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Shubayev1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Platt1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Demestre1">[11]</xref>. Specifically, MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been involved in remodeling of the ECM during nerve degeneration and regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-LaFleur1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Kherif1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Ferguson1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Krekoski1">[15]</xref>. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are highly expressed after sciatic nerve injury: MMP-9 activity increases acutely at the site of injury some hours after nerve crush, whereas MMP-2 activity is delayed but maintained during nerve regeneration proximally and distally to the injury site, suggesting that MMP-2 acts to facilitate axonal extension along the nerve matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Platt1">[10]</xref>. In spinal cord injury, the same pattern is observed: MMP-9 activity is highly increased 12 to 24 hours after injury to facilitate leukocyte infiltration while MMP-2 increases its activity 5 to 14 days after injury to facilitate nerve recovery and limit the formation of a glial scar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-HsuJY1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Lehmann1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Zhang1">[18]</xref>. In Schwann cells, MMP-9 is required for insulin-like growth factor (IGF) release and the subsequent activation of the MEK/ERK pathway via IGF-1 and ErbB receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Chattopadhyay1">[19]</xref>. MMP-9 also activates the Akt/ERK pathway and promotes migration by binding to the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Mantuano1">[20]</xref>. Taking into account these findings, the modulation of MMP activity may be a relevant target to enhance regeneration in demyelinating diseases of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Lehmann1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>There is a growing body of evidence implicating purinergic P2Y receptors in cell communication, migration, and wound repair in response to injury in many cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Klepeis1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Pintor1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Weinger1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Boucher1">[24]</xref>. After injury, nucleotides released from cells activate the purinergic receptor-signaling pathway to mediate the response to injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Yang1">[25]</xref>. Nucleotide binding to P2Y receptors, which are coupled to the protein Gα<sub>q</sub>, activates phospholipase C<sub>β</sub> (PLCβ). PLCβ cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphoinositol tri-phosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), resulting in the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> from endoplasmic reticulum stores. The increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces a myriad of alterations in the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins ranging from adhesion molecules to members of the mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Abbracchio1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Ralevic1">[27]</xref>. MAPKs such as c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulating kinase (ERK), and p38 transduce extracellular signals into various cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Davis1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Seger1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Brunet1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Johnson1">[31]</xref>. Accumulating evidence suggests that these MAPKs play a role in the migration of various cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Lakka1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Kim1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Arai1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Huang1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the activation of P2Y purinergic receptors is known to activate a MAPK signaling cascade, the role of the purinergic signaling pathway in relation with Schwann cell migration and wound repair has not yet been described. The present study aimed to determine the effect of extracellular uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP) on Schwannoma cell migration and wound repair and to establish whether MMP-2 is involved in this effect. For the first time, we report that UTP stimulates <italic>in vitro</italic> Schwannoma cell migration and wound repair through a MMP-2-dependent mechanism via P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors and MAPK pathway activation.</p>

<p>Knockdown Schwannoma cells were generated using short hairpin RNA directed against the rat MMP-2 gene (shMMP-2) constructed in the pLVTHM-GFP plasmid vector (Addgene, Cambridge, USA). Sequence targeting for MMP-2 was selected based on the rules for RNA susceptibility proposed by Tuschl's group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Elbashir1">[38]</xref> and using the siRNA prediction program from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Yuan1">[39]</xref>. Two complementary DNA oligonucleotides (Roche, Berlin, Germany) were annealed to produce a double-stranded DNA fragment encoding a 19-nucleotide sense strand, a 9-nucleotide loop, and a 19-nucleotide antisense strand that correspond to bases 2173–2191 in MMP-2 mRNA (NM_031054). The sequence of MMP-2 shRNA is as follows: sense, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CGC GTC CCC GGA GAT ACA ATG AAG TAA ATT AAG AGA TTT ACT TCA TTG TAT CTC CTT TTT GGA AAT-3′</named-content> and antisense, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CGA TTT CCA AAA AGG AGA TAC AAT GAA GTA AAT CTC TTG AAT TTA CTT CAT TGT ACT CCG GGG A-3′</named-content>.

The shRNA against P2Y<sub>2</sub> was a generous gift from Dr. Díaz-Hernández and Dr. Miras-Portugal (Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain). RT4-D6P2T cells were transfected with different shRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Efficacy of shMMP-2 and shP2Y<sub>2</sub> was tested in transiently transfected cells using immunoblotting for the protein and quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA expression (see Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098998.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

<title>UTP enhances Schwann cell migration and wound repair</title>
<p>In response to injury, Schwann cells increase their migration to cover the damaged area. Previous studies on microglial, smooth muscle, and epithelial cells have demonstrated that nucleotides trigger wound repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Pintor1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Boucher1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Ando1">[40]</xref>. To investigate the ability of the nucleotide UTP to increase Schwannoma RT4-D6P2T cell migration, dose–response and time–course studies were performed using the Transwell migration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Dose–response studies revealed that cell migration significantly increased after UTP treatment (12 h, 100–500 µM). As previously reported, the observed decrease in cell migration at 1 mM is due to UTP cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Martiez1">[41]</xref>. As extracellular concentration of UTP is greatly enhanced after injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Lazarowski1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Elliott1">[43]</xref>, a high UTP concentration (250 µM) was used in all the experiments. On the other hand, time–course analysis showed that cell migration significantly increased between 6 and 12 h after UTP treatment (250 µM).</p>

<p>The effect of UTP on wound repair was also confirmed in Schwann cell line and in primary cultured Schwann cells. Treatment of these cells with UTP (250 µM) significantly reduced the time required to close the wound completely (100%). RT4-D6P2T cells incubated with UTP filled the wound after 20 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g001">Fig. 1B, d</xref>) compared to control cells, which occupied only 56±8% of the wound area in that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g001">Fig. 1B, b</xref>). Likewise, primary cultured Schwann cells treated with UTP filled the wound after 36 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g001">Fig. 1B, h</xref>), while untreated cells occupied only 57±12% of the wound area in that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g001">Fig 1A, f</xref>). Quantitative analysis of the wound–healing assay represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g001">Figure 1C</xref> revealed that UTP treatment increases Schwann cell velocity 2.1-fold (from 1.7±0.5% to 3.6±0.2% of occupancy/h) for primary Schwann cells and a 1.6-fold increase (from 2.9±0.5% to 4.5±0.2% of occupancy/h) for the RT4-D6P2T cell line.</p>

<title>MMP-2 activation by UTP is essential for Schwann cell wound repair</title>
<p>MMPs in their active form have the potential to promote cell migration and are involved in wound repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-HsuJY1">[16]</xref>. In order to determine whether UTP is able to induce MMP activation, the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the conditioned media was studied using gelatin zymography in RT4-D6P2T cells after UTP treatment (250 µM). A time–response study revealed that MMP-2 becomes active (proteolytically cleaved) after 12 h to 24 h of UTP treatment, whereas MMP-9 was not detected at any time during the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In the case of MMP-2, the pro-form of the protein (67 kDa) showed similar levels in both controls and UTP-conditioned media after 12 h to 24 h of incubation. By contrast, the activity of the cleaved form of MMP-2 (60 kDa) appeared to be clearly enhanced in UTP-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). After assessing UTP-induced MMP-2 activation in RT4-D6P2T cells, we investigated whether MMP-2 activation was induced by wound. Interestingly, gelatin zymography experiments showed that MMP-2 was activated during wound healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), with increased activation in the presence of UTP (250 µM, 12 h). This amplified signal of the active form of MMP-2 was observed in the Schwann cell line as well as the primary Schwann cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). These results suggest that either the UTP nucleotide or the conditioned medium from wounded cultures induce the activation of MMP-2. The mRNA levels in RT4-D6P2T and primary Schwann cells were also evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. Results showed that UTP significantly increases MMP-2 expression in both cell models after 6-24 hours of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098998.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

<p>Immunocytochemistry studies corroborated that MMP-2 protein expression is increased in primary Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g002">Fig. 2C, b</xref>) treated with UTP (250 µM, 24 h) compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g002">Fig. 2C, a</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that the MMP-2 immunofluorescence intensity was significantly increased (p = 0.018) in UTP-treated cells compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, endpoint analysis of fluorescence-quenched gelatin degradation in RT4-D6P2T cells revealed a significant increase (p = 0.002) in the number of MMP-2 positive cells in UTP-treated cells compared to untreated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). These findings are in agreement with the results obtained by gelatin zymography and gene expression analysis and corroborate that UTP enhances MMP-2 activation and expression.</p>
<p>Finally, to evaluate the role of activated MMP-2 in Schwannoma cell wound repair, a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against the rat MMP-2 gene (shMMP-2) was developed. Following shMMP-2 transfection, substantial knockdown of the MMP-2 expression was observed in RT4-D6P2T cells at both mRNA (81.3±0.2% decrease) and protein (52.3±0.7% decrease) levels compared with transfected (shRandom) and nontransfected control cells (see Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098998.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Wound healing and zymography assays showed a significant decrease in the rate of migration (<italic>P</italic>≤0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) and MMP-2 activation (<italic>P</italic>≤0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098998-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) in MMP-2-silenced RT4-D6P2T cells when compared to control cells.

Equal amounts of protein were resolved in SDS-PAGE and blotted with MAPK antibodies against phospho-JNK, phospho-ERK1/2, and phospho-P38. The same membranes were also blotted with antibodies against total (active and non-active) forms of MAPKs (JNK, ERK1/2 and P38).

Extracellular nucleotides are known to function as chemotactic agents for microglial cells, smooth muscle cells, and epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Pintor1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Boucher1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Ando1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Pillois1">[53]</xref>. However, these studies did not explain the implication of the nucleotide UTP, a selective P2Y agonist, in injured Schwann cells. We hypothesize that UTP secreted to the medium during nerve injury binds P2Y receptors in the neighboring Schwann cells to induce MMP-2 activity and subsequent cell migration and wound recovery.</p>
<p>In the PNS, MMP-2 activity has been shown to increase after nerve injury and is associated with cell migration, axonal outgrowth, nerve regeneration, and remyelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Ferguson1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Lehmann1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Lehmann2">[54]</xref>. Our results demonstrate that cell migration and wound repair significantly increased after UTP treatment in Schwann cells, and that the velocity of these processes depends directly on MMP-2 activation. We have also described that UTP significantly increases MMP-2 gene expression and that knockdown of MMP-2 is enough to completely suppress UTP-induced cell migration and MMP-2 activation in the extracellular media.</p>
<p>Intracellular calcium measurements clearly indicate that UTP-recognizing P2Y<sub>2</sub> and P2Y<sub>4</sub> receptors are functional in Schwann cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Martiez1">[41]</xref>. Given that UTP is hydrolyzed by ectonucleotidases to UDP, which is an agonist at P2Y<sub>6</sub> receptor, we first identified the P2Y receptor subtype that mediates Schwann cell migration and MMP-2 activation. To that end, we used a pharmacological approach (P2Y<sub>2</sub> is suramin-sensitive) and P2Y<sub>2</sub>-knowdown of Schwannoma cells, which suggested a predominant role of P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors in this migratory effect. Although UTP and ATP are equivalent in stimulating P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor, we decided to study the effect of UTP in order to avoid possible cross-signalling pathway induced by the activation of P2X receptors by ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Wildman1">[55]</xref>. Then, our findings are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors are involved in cell migration in several cell types, providing further evidence of the functional role of P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor during injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Li2">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Braun1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-VzquezCuevas1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Ferreira1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-BenYebdri1">[60]</xref>. Indeed, P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors have been shown to be upregulated in a variety of tissues in response to injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-RodriguezZayas1">[61]</xref>. All together, our data support the hypothesis that activation of P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors by extracellular UTP might regulate a reparative mechanism in response to wound injury.</p>
<p>Our previous work, and that of other authors, showed that P2Y receptor activation by UTP increases the expression of N-cadherin, an adhesion molecule related to Schwann cell migration, and that this increase is mediated by MAPK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Martiez2">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Wanner1">[62]</xref>. In the present study, we also demonstrate that UTP-induced MMP-2 activation is dependent on MAPK signaling pathways. Indeed, after nerve injury, increased activity in multiple pathways—including the ERK/MAPK, JNK/c-Jun, Notch, and JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathways—can be detected in Schwann cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Sheu1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Woodhoo1">[64]</xref>. Furthermore, some authors suggest that ERK and JNK activity defines the state of Schwann cell differentiation. Whereas basal levels are necessary for the differentiation of precursors, elevated ERK and JNK activities drive dedifferentiation and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Kaempchen1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Yamauchi1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Zine1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Newbern1">[68]</xref>. By contrast, the role of p38 MAPK in Schwann cells is controversial; it has been associated with the regulation of myelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Hossain1">[69]</xref>, but also with a negative regulatory role in differentiation and myelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Yang2">[70]</xref>.</p>
<p>As previously described in many growth factors and cytokines, UTP treatment also results in a biphasic phosphorylation of MAPKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Gurjar1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Lien1">[72]</xref>. This kinetic profile has recently been proposed as a model to allow a common signaling system to play distinct regulatory roles depending on the temporal duration of activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Murphy1">[73]</xref>. Although P2Y activation by UTP is well known to be involved in early MAPK phosphorylation, the role of UTP in late MAPK phosphorylation has not been described until now. Our data suggests that the initial transient phase of MAPK activation in Schwannoma cells is mediated by P2Y receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Yang1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Martiez2">[47]</xref>, whereas the late sustained phosphorylation is also mediated by MMP-2 activation. One possible explanation for late MAPK phosphorylation is that active MMP-2 in the extracellular space cleaves a membrane-anchored growth factor on Schwannoma cells. Many proteins released by proteolysis of the ECM proteins are known to control cell response and may act as effectors for Schwann cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Weisman1">[74]</xref>. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that growth factors, such as neuregulin-1 (NRG1), are involved in Schwann cell migration and myelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-He1">[75]</xref>. Furthermore, NRG1 expression and its putative receptors, ErbB2 and ErbB3, are known to be induced in injured sciatic nerves in rats, promoting Schwann cell proliferation and dedifferentiation in injured nerves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Carroll1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Birchmeier1">[77]</xref>. Thus, the cleavage of a growth factor (NRG1 type III) by MMP-2 and the subsequent phosphorylation of the ErbB transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor could explain the late MAPK phosphorylation observed in Schwannoma cells after UTP treatment. This proposed hypothesis is based on previous observations demonstrating that MMP-9 regulates MAPK pathways through IGF-1 and ErbB receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0098998-Chattopadhyay1">[19]</xref>. Nevertheless, the relationship between MMP-2 activation and late MAPK phosphorylation observed in our Schwannoma cell model merits further investigation in primary Schwann cell culture.</p>
<p>In light of these findings, we conclude that extracellular UTP (which mimics nerve injury) stimulates Schwannoma cell migration and wound repair through a MMP-2-dependent mechanism via P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors and the activation of MAPK pathways. Moreover, evidence that P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors mediate the migratory response of Schwann cells evoked by PNS injury indicates that selective P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor agonists may provide new therapeutic opportunities for Schwann cell migration and peripheral nerve regeneration.</p>
