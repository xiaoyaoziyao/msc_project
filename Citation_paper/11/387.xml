        <p>The subcellular localization and physiological functions of biomolecules are closely related and thus it is crucial to precisely determine the distribution of different molecules inside the intracellular structures. This is frequently accomplished by fluorescence microscopy with well-characterized markers and posterior evaluation of the signal colocalization. Rigorous study of colocalization requires statistical analysis of the data, albeit yet no single technique has been established as a standard method. Indeed, the few methods currently available are only accurate in images with particular characteristics. Here, we introduce a new algorithm to automatically obtain the true colocalization between images that is suitable for a wide variety of biological situations. To proceed, the algorithm contemplates the individual contribution of each pixel's fluorescence intensity in a pair of images to the overall Pearsońs correlation and Manders' overlap coefficients.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The specific localization of biomolecules in the subcellular compartments is extremely important as a variety of functions may be derived. This is usually studied by fluorescence microscopy and posterior evaluation of the colocalization of the molecule of interest in a definite region in the cell. Most frequently, image processing for colocalization is visual-based and therefore highly prone to bias. In the last years, a variety of methods have been described to analyze colocalization quantitatively in different biological systems, based on statistic analysis of pixel intensity distributions and/or object recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Manders1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Ramrez1">[6]</xref> and have been integrated in different software, some of which are freely accessible. However, these methods are often applicable only in images with certain characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Costes1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Ramrez1">[6]</xref> or relay further on visual estimation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Manders2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Bolte1">[7]</xref>. Indeed, in the last year two improved methods have been developed. Fletcher and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Fletcher1">[5]</xref> established a new method based on Monte Carlo randomization that works with voxel-based, intensity-based, object-based, and nearest-neighbour metrics to measure the statistical significance of colocalization. Seemingly, Ramírez and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Ramrez1">[6]</xref> introduced a confined displacement algorithm based on image correlation spectroscopy in combination with Manders colocalization coefficients to quantify true and random colocalization of a given florescence pattern. However, these two methods assume that the image can be divided into isolated ‘dots’ or ‘blobs’ and therefore that each object can be isolated from the other, which depends on the data being punctate in nature. This is characteristic of high frequency data such as the immunofluorescence of membrane proteins, but not of low frequency data such as calcium concentration measurements, or of molecules that are widely dispersed throughout the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Fletcher1">[5]</xref>. Indeed, a major challenge in quantitative colocalization has been to specifically determine the localization of widely distributed proteins for example in mitochondria or Golgi, due to the small size of these organelles. In a different approach, Costes and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Costes1">[3]</xref> proposed an automated method for segmentation, the calculation of modified Manders coefficients and a statistical validation of colocalization by a combination of block scrambling and probability density functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Costes1">[3]</xref>. Unfortunately, this method is suitable only for scenarios with very low and symmetric signal densities, which is usually not the case in biological samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Ramrez1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Comeau1">[8]</xref>. Here, we introduce a new algorithm to automatically detect the true colocalization in a pair of images that overcomes the limitations of previous methods. The algorithm contemplates the individual fluorescence intensity contribution of every pixel in a pair of images to the Pearson's correlation and Manders' overlap coefficient. The accuracy and reliability of the algorithm was corroborated in a variety of simulated and real images that contemplated the characteristics of real biological data. The use of this algorithm together with the construction of the more informative maps derived from the colocalization coefficients allowed us to directly observe in which parts inside the cell the colocalization was particularly relevant.</p>
      <p>An additional task to overcome in the analysis of colocalization is the limit in the resolution imposed by the optical system. Image deconvolution is a useful tool to more unequivocally address the localization of a molecule in a small compartment as this procedure eliminates the contribution of optical diffraction and therefore restores the “real” image from the acquired samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Sedarat1">[9]</xref>. We combined the use of the algorithm with image restoration by deconvolution and time-lapse confocal microscopy to gain insights into the localization and trafficking of MEK into the mitochondria of different cellular models. The MEKs (ERK1/2 kinases) function within signaling cascades that regulate a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and development, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Craig1">[10]</xref>. The MEKs constitute an evolutionary conserved group of dual specificity protein kinases that includes three highly homologous mammalian isoforms: MEK1a (44 kDa), MEK1b (41 kDa) and MEK2 (45 kDa) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Seger1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Zheng1">[12]</xref>. MEKs phosphorylate with high specificity both regulatory Thr and Tyr residues of ERKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Seger2">[13]</xref>. Specificity is achieved by conserved docking domains present in both kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Pearson1">[14]</xref>. MEKs were initially reported to localize primarily in the cytosol, while subsequent evidence suggested that MEK1 was able to shuttle into the nucleus, but was rapidly exported by a nuclear export signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Fukuda1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Yao1">[17]</xref>. Recent evidence suggests the mitochondria as an intermediate regulatory station between cytosol and nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Alonso1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-AnticoArciuch1">[22]</xref>. Indeed, we observed that ERK translocation into or out of the organelle was regulated by oxidative stimuli or serum, and that the formation of MEK-ERK complexes in these organelles was regulated by the oxidation of a redox sensitive cysteine in ERK2 and the impeded binding to MEK caused ERK2 retention in the organelle in detriment of its shuttle into the nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Galli1">[19]</xref>. In a similar approach, Antico-Arciuch and co-workers confirmed the presence of Akt1 in mitochondria of NIH cells and that mitochondrial redox status regulated Akt1 progression to the nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-AnticoArciuch1">[22]</xref>. Indeed, mitochondria regulate Akt1 traffic through posttranslational modifications; phosphorylation of Akt Thr308 occurs in the organelle and mitochondrial derived H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> affects Akt-PDK interaction by the selective oxidation of Akt1 Cys<sup>310</sup> to sulfenic or cysteic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-AnticoArciuch1">[22]</xref>. Although we showed that the traffic of ERK to mitochondria is regulated, i.e., by serum or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Galli1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Galli2">[20]</xref>, little is known about the biological relevance of the localization of its activator MEK to mitochondria or the regulation of MEK translocation into and out of the organelle. Combining the use of the new colocalization algorithm with image restoration and time-lapse confocal microscopy, we demonstrate the presence of MEK in mitochondria of HeLa and MEF cells and that MEK localization in the organelle is favored in proliferative conditions.</p>
      <p>Together, the present work provides a novel statistical approach to precisely and consistently ascertain the colocalization in a series of biological images. The algorithm, written in Matlab code, was integrated in a graphical users interface for easy accessibility and is freely available as a source (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30665-villalta-et-al-s-colocalization-algorithm" xlink:type="simple">www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30665-villalta-et-al-s-colocalization-algorithm</ext-link>).</p>

Colocalization was determined with our new algorithm, described below. For the analysis of time-lapse images, either we determined a colocalization mask or, comparatively, we delimited a mitochondrial compartment when the MitoTracker fluorescence intensity was twice above the mean of the whole image. The cellular compartment was delimited when GFP (for Akt) or DsRed (for MEK) fluorescence intensity was over the mean fluorescence intensity of the whole image. Akt-GFP or DsRed-MEK kinetics were studied only in mitochondria of transfected cells, and thus a new mask was determined by the combination of both the cellular mask and the MitoTracker generated mask when we delimited the compartments manually. The change in GFP and DsRed fluorescence intensity was evaluated inside mitochondria and normalized to the whole cell fluorescence intensity to contemplate photobleaching.</p>

        <title>New colocalization algorithm</title>
        <p>Starting with the whole population of pixels of the green and red channel images, the algorithm constructs the <italic>r</italic> map and the <italic>R</italic> map, and then calculates the product of the <italic>r</italic>×<italic>R</italic> map, which we call mixed map. Subsequently, it selects pixels that contribute highly positively (colocalizing) or highly negatively (anti-colocalizing) to <italic>r</italic>×<italic>R</italic> -this is, those pixels that contribute to the product of numerators above or below certain thresholds- and classifies them into two different groups. The thresholds were arbitrarily set as the 80% of the maximum value of the mixed map for colocalizing pixels and the 80% of the minimum value of the mixed map for anti-colocalizing pixels. With the remaining population of pixels the algorithm constructs a new mixed map and again classifies and adds these pixels into one of the former groups. The algorithm continues with this procedure until more than 1% of the pixels classified in one step belong to the background –defined as zero intensity- of any of the channels. At the end of this procedure several masks are achieved –one per round of classification- with either the colocalized or anti-colocalized pixels.</p>
        <p>In the next step, the algorithm determines which of all the colocalized pixels masks is the most appropriate. With this aim, the algorithm computes the <italic>R</italic> for the pixels enclosed by every colocalizing mask, thus it achieves one <italic>R</italic> value per round of classification. The minimum <italic>R</italic> is subtracted from all the <italic>R</italic> values and then plotted vs the classification round (<italic>R</italic>-<italic>R</italic><sub>min</sub> vs. round of classification). Subsequently, the algorithm calculates the area under the former function and determines the most appropriate colocalizing mask that one attained in the round where the 86% of the area is reached. This value was empirically determined by running the algorithm on different simulated image sets (different object densities) and different colocalization extents (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019031.s007">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019031.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We chose 86% of the area as this value rendered the best approximation to the true colocalization and the minimum detection of false positives.</p>

        <title>Test of significance for the Manders Overlap coefficient (<italic>R</italic>)</title>
        <p>In the same way Costes and coworkers derived a statistical significance test to evaluate the significant correlation in a pair of images <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Costes1">[3]</xref>, we derived a statistical significance test to evaluate the probability (<italic>P</italic>) that the measured value of <italic>R</italic> from the two images is significantly greater than values of <italic>R</italic> that would be calculated if there was only random overlap. Briefly, by repeatedly scrambling the pixels in one image, and then estimating <italic>R</italic> of this image with the other (unscrambled) image we generate the empirical probability distribution of the amounts of random overlap specifically for these two images. By comparing the <italic>R</italic> measured for the original unscrambled image with this distribution we determine whether significant colocalization exists for a predefined probability for significance (Students <italic>t</italic> distribution).</p>
        <p>Since single pixel intensity is correlated with its neighboring pixels due to optical limitations, i.e., the PSF, for randomization we divided the images into independent blocks of approximately the size of the PSF, when necessary. We then scrambled the blocks instead of the individual pixels. We performed 20 randomizations and chose a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.95% to indicate significant (true) colocalization.</p>

        <p>We generated 160×160 pixels images with a determined number of pixel-sized objects with a range intensity distribution of 30–155 for both channels. Colocalized pixels had identical non-zero intensities. The density of each channel varied and ranged from 5% to 30% for each green or red objects (i.e., 5% to 30% of the area is covered by green objects; the same for red objects). Simulations covering the full range of possible colocalization were performed, from all green or red objects colocalized to no colocalization. Noise with intensities distributed uniformly between 10 and 30 was added to both channels.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, we generated 256×256 pixels images. Objects consisted of 220 pixels circles with random intensities from 40 to 160. We deliberately set 20 objects as colocalized. We added 15 objects to each image randomly, and this increased the percentage of colocalized signal, as some of the balls partially overlapped. The colocalization achieved was 7%. Finally, normally distributed noise (mean  = 10, Standard deviation  = 15) was added to the whole image.</p>

        <title>New colocalization algorithm, rationale</title>
        <p>In accord to <italic>r</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019031-t001">Table 1</xref>), two images are correlated if <italic>r</italic>&gt;0, independently distributed if <italic>r</italic>∼0 or negatively correlated if <italic>r</italic>&lt;0. It is generally assumed that there is colocalization between two images if the overall <italic>r</italic> is positive. As <italic>r</italic> is invariant to background and intensity scales, it provides a robust estimator for colocalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Manders1">[1]</xref>. However, the major drawback of this estimator is its lack of biological meaning and the fact that in a variety of cases, the ratio colocalized/total image area is so small that the overall estimator remains around 0 or slightly positive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Barlow1">[27]</xref>. Indeed, the fact that the overall <italic>r</italic> is either 0 or even negative does not imply the complete absence of colocalized signal, rather than the null or negatively contributing pixels are abundant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019031.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). Manders coefficients <italic>m1</italic> and <italic>m2</italic> are more biologically meaningful (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019031-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Manders2">[2]</xref> as they contemplate the colocalization area between the images independently of their correlation. Their major disadvantage is that they relay further on visual estimation to establish the cut-off to determine signal from noise, or more complex, random from specific localization.</p>
        <p>To develop this algorithm we assumed that in a dual-channel image, those pixels that contributed positively to <italic>r</italic> accounted for the colocalized population of pixels, while those pixels that contributed negatively to <italic>r</italic> corresponded to the mutually exclusive (anti-colocalized) population of pixels. Depending on the proportion of these populations the overall <italic>r</italic> may be positive, negative or null (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019031.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). We first studied the behavior of <italic>r</italic> and <italic>R</italic>. For this, we plotted the contribution to <italic>r</italic> and <italic>R</italic> of each potential green-red fluorescence intensity combination for a pair of images with fluorescence ranging from 0–255 with a mean of 75 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019031.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>). There are different fluorescence intensity combinations that contribute to <italic>r</italic> or <italic>R</italic> with the same value and these constitute the coefficient's level curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019031.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>, highlighted in colors). In other words, level curves indicate those green and red fluorescence intensity pixels that contribute equally to <italic>r</italic> or <italic>R</italic>. In addition, pixels can contribute negatively to <italic>r</italic> numerator, and this is achieved when either the green or red channel fluorescence is below its respective mean fluorescence intensity; <italic>R</italic> numerator cannot attain negative values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019031.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>, left panels). The same is true for images with other fluorescence intensity maxima and mean.</p>
        <p>Our algorithm proceeds by subsequently classifying pixels as colocalized or anti-colocalized in accord to the <italic>r</italic> and <italic>R</italic> level curves. A simple way of visualizing the practice of the algorithm is by combining the 2D histogram derived from the pair of images with the <italic>r</italic>×<italic>R</italic> level curves generated from the image statistic parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). In this graph, the intensity of a given pixel in the green image is used as the <italic>x</italic>-coordinate and the intensity of the corresponding pixel in the red image as the <italic>y</italic>-coordinate. Thus, pixels that display fluorescence only in the green or red channel will lie on the <italic>x</italic> or <italic>y</italic> axis, respectively, pixels that display fluorescence in both channels will be placed along a diagonal, and pixels belonging to background signal will accumulate in the origin of the histogram. The intensity of each pixel in the 2D histogram (highlighted in jet colour map) represents the frequency of pixels that display those particular red and green values. The approach starts considering the totality of the pixels in both images, and subsequently classifies them as colocalized and anticolocalized in accord to <italic>r</italic>×<italic>R</italic> level curves. Indeed, in every round of classification, the algorithm groups those pixels that contribute greater than the 0.8× the maximum value or lower than 0.8× the minimum value of the product <italic>r</italic>×<italic>R</italic>. As the algorithm proceeds, the number of pixels in the remaining population decreases, while the colocalized and anti-colocalized populations increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). It continues until the step in which more than 1% of the pixels classified belong to the background, and then it selects the most appropriate colocalization mask out of all the generated masks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g001">Fig. 1B and 1C</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>). The output of the algorithm is a colocalization mask which is highly similar to the true colocalization mask that encloses the pixels deliberately set as colocalized when we generated the images (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g001">Fig. 1B and 1A</xref>).</p>

        <p>The rationale for determining the contribution of every pixels fluorescence intensity to the <italic>r</italic>×<italic>R</italic> map instead of using any of the coefficients by itself is as follows: the individual contribution of every pixel to the <italic>r</italic> can be negative or positive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019031-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019031.s002">Fig. S2</xref>), which in general we attribute to colocalized and anti-colocalized pixels. Background pixels will contribute positively to this coefficient pushing the coefficient's numerator towards 1. However, the contribution of background pixels to the <italic>R</italic> is close (albeit positive) to 0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019031-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the product <italic>r</italic>×<italic>R</italic> map will bring all the correlated pixels of the background towards 0 while maintaining the higher values of the colocalized population of pixels, and thus it increases the dissimilar contribution of background and signal.</p>

            <title>Performance of the new colocalization algorithm in simulated images.</title>
            <p>The accuracy of the algorithm was tested in a variety of simulated images with different colocalization extent. A) 160×160 pixel sized images were generated with different number of pixel-sized objects either located at random positions or in the same position (colocalized). Intensity distribution varied between 30 and 155 for both channels. Colocalized pixels/objects had identical non-zero intensities. Noise with intensities distributed uniformly between 10 and 30 was added to both channels.

        <title>New colocalization algorithm, validation in biological samples</title>
        <p>To determine the accuracy of our algorithm in biological samples, we compared different possible subcellular colocalization patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). A complete colocalization pattern was achieved by labeling actin cytoskeleton simultaneously with Phalloidin conjugated with FITC or Rodhamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). As a model for partial colocalization we studied NGF receptors fused to fluorescent proteins (TrkA-CFP and p75-YFP) that were characterized in our lab (Iacaruso <italic>et al</italic>., in preparation) or in previous literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Bronfman1">[23]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).

        <title>Time-lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy, image deconvolution and analysis of colocalization: validation for the study of kinases intracellular redistribution</title>
        <p>We employed fluorescence confocal microscopy followed by image processing to address the intracellular redistribution of MEK, with particular interest in its traffic to mitochondria. We first validated the utilization of these techniques by evaluating the behavior of Akt1, which has been previously and extensively addressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-AnticoArciuch1">[22]</xref>. Briefly, Akt is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism and is differentially activated by growth factors and oxidative stress by sequential phosphorylation of Ser473 by mTORC2 and Thr308 by PDK1. Phosphorylation of Thr308 in mitochondria determines Akt1 passage to nuclei and triggers genomic post-translational mechanisms for cell proliferation. At high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Akt1-PDK1 association is disrupted and thus, Akt1 phosphorylated at Ser473 accumulates in mitochondria in detriment to nuclear translocation; accordingly, the mutant Akt1 T308A is retained in mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-AnticoArciuch1">[22]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Here, we repeated the experiments of Antico-Arciuch and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-AnticoArciuch1">[22]</xref>. In these experiments, NIH/3T3 cells were transfected with wt Akt1-GFP or the respective mutants that lack one of the phosphorylation sites, Akt1 T308A-GFP and Akt1 S473A-GFP, and further stained with a specific mitochondrial marker, MitoTracker Deep Red, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. We determined the colocalization mask with our colocalization algorithm and measured GFP intensity inside this mask and normalized it to GFP intensity in the whole cell. In accord to the previous results, Akt1 T308A-GFP accumulated in mitochondria whereas Akt1 S473A-GFP localization in the organelle was scarce (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019031.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>).</p>
        <p>To improve the resolution of the images and more unequivocally determine the localization of Akt in mitochondria we employed image deconvolution. For these experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with Akt1 or its mutants and DsRed-mito. Images were specifically acquired and processed for image deconvolution. Deconvolved green and red fluorescence channels are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g004">Figure 4</xref>. We determined the colocalization mask with our colozalization algorithm and constructed the <italic>m1</italic> and <italic>m2</italic> maps. Accordingly, Akt1 T308A-GFP accumulated in mitochondria as can be observed in the green fluorescence and merged images, in the <italic>m1</italic> map (yellow and red pixels) and in the fluorescence intensity profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g004">Figure 4A</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we present a new algorithm to determine the true colocalization in a pair of confocal fluorescence images without the bias of visual estimation. The algorithm is accurate and reliable for a variety of simulated and biological images and overcomes certain limitations of previous methods: i) it is functional for the whole range of object densities and percentage of colocalization in a pair of images; ii) it can proceed even when the overall <italic>r</italic> is zero or negative and, iii) it is accurate not only in ‘punctated’ images but also in situations where proteins are widely distributed throughout the cell. In a previous work, Costes and co-workers generated an algorithm that determined the colocalization based on the linear fit and the <italic>r</italic> of the pair of images <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Costes1">[3]</xref>. These authors designed and algorithm capable to detect the smallest colocalization possible in images that contained few objects, i.e., few pixels with fluorescence intensity. Thus, the images employed contained a deliberately low object density (6–9%). The authors claimed that their algorithm was capable to detect pixels that contained colocalized signal that was not significantly above the mean intensity of the full image. They argued in those cases, it was impossible to identify colocalization by eye and thus, the algorithm had a sub-visual capacity to asses for colocalization. To accomplish with this challenge the algorithm sacrificed its precision in images where the colocalization between objects is high or asymmetric, or in those images where a high proportion of pixels contains fluorescence signal, i.e., high object density images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g002">Fig 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Ramrez1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Comeau1">[8]</xref>. Thus, care should be taken when applying this method in biological samples since these images tend to contain quite extensive object densities and variable degree of colocalization. Our colocalization algorithm was designed to contemplate this variability and was precise and consistent in a variety of simulated images including those where colocalization cannot be determined by eye (i.e., our algorithm has sub-visual capacity), and in the biological samples evaluated here as well as in other models. For example, in a former experiment Antico-Arciuch and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-AnticoArciuch1">[22]</xref> prepared a mixture of isolated mitoplasts and vesicles of NIH cells labelled with MitoTracker or an anti ATPase antibody, respectively, and additionally for phospho-Thr308 or phosphor-Ser473 Akt. The algorithm was employed to detect the colocalization of MitoTracker with ATPase and measure the fluorescence intensity of Akt in those vesicles that had ‘engulfed’ mitoplasts. This fluorescence intensity was compared to that found in vesicles that did not colocalize with MitoTracker (vesicles alone). The authors observed that P-Akt1 Ser473 label was predominantly in lone vesicles, whereas the highest P-Akt1 Thr308 fluorescence was detected in those vesicles that contained mitoplasts. This finding supported the notion that the plasma and mitochondrial membranes cooperate for the complete Akt activation in NIH cells and confirmed that Ser473 phosphorylation was a prerequisite for Thr308 phosphorylation to occur in mitoplasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-AnticoArciuch1">[22]</xref>. In a different experiment, Iacaruso and co-workers followed the endocytosis kinetics of NGF receptors TrkA and p75 after NGF stimulation and confirmed by using our algorithm that TrkA endocyted rapidly while p75 remained in the cell membrane, and that there was a delayed appearance of colocalizing endosomes corresponding to the co-internalization of these receptors (Iacaruso <italic>et al</italic>., in preparation).</p>
      <p>Costes' algorithm firstly calculates a least-squares fit for the 2D scattergram based on orthogonal regression and then progressively lowers intensity thresholds for both axes of the scatterplot and calculates the <italic>r</italic> between the pixels beneath the intensity thresholds of each channel until it reaches a pair of thresholds beneath which <italic>r</italic> is no longer positive. These thresholds are used to determine the cut-off for the calculation of <italic>m1</italic> and <italic>m2</italic>. The approach of Costes <italic>et al</italic>. therefore only considers positively correlated populations of pixels to be of interest -uncorrelated and anticorrelated pixels are ignored by their approach-, but also, due to its way of proceeding, it can only be applied to those images where the overall correlation is positive. This leaves out of the analysis a variety of images where the overall distribution is uncorrelated albeit still there is some minor but specific signal colocalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019031.s002">Fig S2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Barlow1">[27]</xref>. Our colocalization algorithm overcomes this inconvenient by independizing of the overall <italic>r</italic> value to proceed. Rather it contemplates the individual contribution of every pixel to both <italic>r</italic> and <italic>R</italic>.</p>
      <p>The exhaustive image analysis performed in the present work, as well as its statistical validation, support the notion of a real localization of recombinant DsRed-MEK1 in mitochondria of HeLa and MEF <italic>erk1−/−</italic> cells. Mitochondrial size ranges from 1–10 µm. Pixel size in these images was &lt;140 nm for time-lapse microscopy images or &lt;70 nm for images acquired for deconvolution. According to the optics, the minimal lateral and axial resolution gained with the microscope settings employed was approximately 150 nm and 400 nm, respectively. Thus, although mitochondria are above the diffraction limit, we incorporated image deconvolution to the analysis to improve the resolution and more unequivocally determine the presence of MEK in the organelle. We confirmed the presence of MEK in the organelle by immunostaining of isolated organelles with an anti MEK antibody. MEK localization in mitochondria augmented in proliferative conditions. Additionally, FCS stimulation of starved cells caused a rapid entrance of MEK into the organelle. In a previous work, we demonstrated that upon FCS stimulation of starved HeLa cells, hERK1-GFP entered the organelle with a maximum accumulation at around 5–10 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Galli2">[20]</xref>. MEK accumulation in the organelle was faster, before 5 min of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). We have previously suggested that mitochondria are common sites for phosphorylation of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Galli1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Galli2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-AnticoArciuch1">[22]</xref>. Here we propose that early transit of MEK to mitochondria would favor its phosphorylation, as c-Raf has also been reported in mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Galmiche1">[28]</xref>, and in turn it would phosphorylate and activate ERK. Phosphorylated ERK would then shuttle into the nuclei and activate transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019031-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Several experiments on permeabilized heart muscle fibers suggest the existence of diffusion restrictions grouping mitochondria and surrounding ATPases. The specific causes of these restrictions are not known, but intracellular structures are speculated to act as diffusion barriers. Indeed, Ramay y Vendelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Ramay1">[29]</xref> developed a three dimensional finite-element mathematical model in which the restriction barriers were composed by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, cytoskeleton proteins close to this reticulum and cytoskeleton proteins crowding that well adjusted the existent experimental data. This data supports our hypothesis in the sense that if mitochondria are source of ATP and the diffusion of this metabolite is restricted, it is expectable that kinases would reach the mitochondrial surroundings for activation prior to their translocation into the nuclei.</p>

          <title>Intracellular redistribution of MEK and ERK.</title>
          <p>Scheme showing the new perspective of the redistribution of MEK and ERK inside the cell. As mitochondria are the source of ATP, MEK and ERK would go to the mitochondrial surroundings where phosphorylation might occur and afterwards ERK would translocate into the nuclei. There, ERK interacts with transcription factors and the transcription machinery to enhance RNA synthesis. The scheme was taken and modified from Galli <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Galli2">[20]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Both MEK and ERK have a role on mitochondrial metabolism regulation. For instance, Monick and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Monick1">[30]</xref> reported the presence of significant levels of MEK and ERK in mitochondria of alveolar macrophages and inhibition of ERK activity in these cells induced an early and profound depletion in cellular ATP, coincident with a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In concordance, Galmiche and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Galmiche1">[28]</xref> found c-Raf –which participates in MEK-ERK signalling cascade- in mitochondria of different cell lines and reported that c-Raf overexpression induced a change in mitochondrial morphology that rendered disaggregated organelles. This is consistent with our observations that overexpression of MEK or ERK induce mitochondrial fission as we did not observe the characteristic mitochondrial reticulum that we found in non-transfected cells (data not shown). Finally, we have recently shown evidence that suggests that mitochondrial ERK could induce mitochondrial genome expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Galli2">[20]</xref>. Thus, the data from the present work in combination with early data from this and other labs propose a new frame for the study of kinase signalling pathways, in particular MEK-ERK cascade, that contemplates mitochondria as an obligatory station for activation, as well as a target for modulation of these kinases. The fact that kinase mutants that cannot be activated are retained in mitochondria in detriment of their nuclear translocation supports this notion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-Galli2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019031-AnticoArciuch1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Together, we introduce a novel statistical approach to determine the colocalization in a pair of fluorescence images which is accurate in a surfeit of biological samples, ranging from small to large population of labelled molecules, lack to complete colocalization and even in those pair of images where the overall correlation is negative. This algorithm together with the construction of the more informative maps derived from the colocalization coefficients allowed us to directly observe in which parts inside the cell the colocalization was particularly relevant. Finally, all functionality of the methods here described was integrated into a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) environment for Matlab, designed for easy accessibility. This toolbox will be freely available for open source development (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30665-villalta-et-al-s-colocalization-algorithm" xlink:type="simple">www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30665-villalta-et-al-s-colocalization-algorithm</ext-link>).</p>
