<abstract>
<p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is as an ideal model system for the study of mechanisms underlying learning and memory. In the present study, we employed <italic>C. elegans</italic> assay system of thermotaxis memory to investigate the possible role of serotonin neurotransmitter in memory control. Our data showed that both mutations of <italic>tph-1</italic>, <italic>bas-1</italic>, and <italic>cat-4</italic> genes, required for serotonin synthesis, and mutations of <italic>mod-5</italic> gene, encoding a serotonin reuptake transporter, resulted in deficits in thermotaxis memory behavior. Exogenous treatment with serotonin effectively recovered the deficits in thermotaxis memory of <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>bas-1</italic> mutants to the level of wild-type N2. Neuron-specific activity assay of TPH-1 suggests that serotonin might regulate the thermotaxis memory behavior by release from the ADF sensory neurons. Ablation of ADF sensory neurons by expressing a cell-death activator gene <italic>egl-1</italic> decreased the thermotaxis memory, whereas activation of ADF neurons by expression of a constitutively active protein kinase C homologue (<italic>pkc-1</italic>(<italic>gf</italic>)) increased the thermotaxis memory and rescued the deficits in thermotaxis memory in <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants. Moreover, serotonin released from the ADF sensory neurons might act through the G-protein-coupled serotonin receptors of SER-4 and SER-7 to regulate the thermotaxis memory behavior. Genetic analysis implies that serotonin might further target the insulin signaling pathway to regulate the thermotaxis memory behavior. Thus, our results suggest the possible crucial role of serotonin and ADF sensory neurons in thermotaxis memory control in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Memory can be defined as encoding, storage and retrieval of learning inputs in human and animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Ye1">[1]</xref>. Nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is an excellent model organism to study the biological processes relevant to a wide variety of human behavior and the related disease systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Ardiel1">[2]</xref>. Early in 1990, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> was suggested as an ideal model system for study of the mechanisms underlying learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Rankin1">[3]</xref>. The worms have a simple nervous system comprising 302 neurons which are all well identified, and the connectivity between all neurons has been fully mapped <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Giles1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Hu1">[5]</xref>. Especially, many components such as neurotransmitters and their respective receptors in the nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> are similar to those in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Giles1">[4]</xref>. <italic>C. elegans</italic> displays several forms of memory, such as memory to thermotaxis, chemotaxis, and mechanotransduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Ye1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, thermotaxis memory is one of the widely used assay system to elucidate the mechanism of memory behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Ye1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Ye3">[8]</xref>. For the neuronal circuit of thermotaxis memory, it has been supposed that the worms may adjust the stored set-point of thermotactic memory to their cultivation temperature at least through AFD (a sensory neuron)-AIY (an interneuron, the major postsynaptic partner of AFD)-AIZ (an interneuron, the major postsynaptic partner of AIY) neuronal circuit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Ye1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>. AFD neuron can function as not only a temperature sensor but also a temperature memory device <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>. In this supposed neuronal circuit, DGK-3 in AFD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Biron1">[9]</xref> and NCS-1 in AIY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Gomez1">[10]</xref> regulate the thermotaxis memory in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the thermal information and food state can be integrated and processed in interneurons by monoamines such as serotonin to generate output behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Mori1">[11]</xref>. <italic>tph-1</italic>, encoding a tryptophan hydroxylase, and <italic>bas-1</italic>, encoding an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, are required for serotonin synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Sze1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Loer1">[13]</xref>, and the tryptophan hydroxylase requires a cofactor whose synthesis requires a GTP cyclohydrolase I encoded by <italic>cat-4</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Loer1">[13]</xref>. <italic>mod-5</italic> gene encodes a serotonin transporter, and <italic>ser-1</italic>, <italic>ser-4</italic>, <italic>ser-7</italic>, and <italic>mod-1</italic> encode serotonin receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Chase1">[14]</xref>. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the serotonin neurotransmitter is involved in the control of thermotaxis memory behavior in worms. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the role of serotonin neurotransmitter in regulating thermotaxis memory in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our results highlight the possible crucial role of serotonin and ADF sensory neurons in regulating thermotaxis memory in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our data here will be useful for our further understanding the neuronal mechanism of neurotransmitter control of memory behavior.</p>

<title>Genes Required for Serotonin Synthesis Regulate the Thermotaxis Memory Behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, mutations of <italic>tph-1</italic> or <italic>bas-1</italic> cause deficits in serotonin synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Sze1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Loer1">[13]</xref>. We first employed the thermotaxis memory assay model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) to investigate the memory behaviors in <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>bas-1</italic> mutants. Because nematodes tend to migrate toward their cultivation temperature after conditioning (food at 20°C) and move along this isotherm on a radical temperature gradient, the assay model is used to assess a form of memory for thermosensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). In this thermotaxis memory assay model, mutations of <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>bas-1</italic> genes shortened the extinction period of the association paradigm (food at 20°C) for different time intervals compared with wild-type N2 nematodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, mutation of <italic>cat-4</italic> gene, involved in control of TPH-1 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Loer1">[13]</xref>, also decreased memory behavior compared with wild-type N2 nematodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In the assay model, the percentages of animals performing isothermal tracking behavior (IT) at the time interval of 18-hr were significantly decreased in <italic>tph-1(mg280)</italic>, <italic>bas-1(ad446)</italic>, and <italic>cat-4(e1141)</italic> mutants compared with wild-type N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Compared with the phenotype that wild-type N2 needs 3-hr to perform the half maximal extinction, <italic>tph-1(mg280)</italic> and <italic>bas-1(ad446)</italic> mutants used approximately 1-hr and <italic>cat-4(e1141)</italic> mutants used approximately 2-hr to finish the half maximal extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). To ensure that the altered thermotaxis memory behaviors in <italic>tph-1</italic>, <italic>bas-1</italic>, and <italic>cat-4</italic> mutants were not due to the deficits in thermotaxis behavior, we examined the thermotaxis behaviors in <italic>tph-1(mg280)</italic>, <italic>bas-1(ad446)</italic>, and <italic>cat-4(e1141)</italic> mutants. Our data showed that <italic>tph-1(mg280)</italic>, <italic>bas-1(ad446)</italic>, and <italic>cat-4(e1141)</italic> mutants exhibited the similar thermotaxis phenotype to that of wild-type N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). These data demonstrate that genes required for serotonin synthesis are essential for thermotaxis memory control in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our results also imply the possible important role of neurotransmitter of serotonin in thermotaxis memory control.</p>

<title>Effects of Exogenous Serotonin Treatment on Thermotaxis Memory Behavior of <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>bas-1</italic> Mutants</title>
<p>To further investigate the role of serotonin in thermotaxis memory control, we examined the effects of exogenous treatment with 2 mM of serotonin on thermotaxis memory behavior in <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>bas-1</italic> mutants.

<p>Considering the fact that <italic>bas-1</italic> gene is also required for dopamine synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Hare1">[16]</xref>, we also examined the effects of exogenous treatment with 5 mM of dopamine on thermotaxis memory behavior in <italic>bas-1</italic> mutants. Exogenous treatment with 5 mM of dopamine only partially recovered the deficits in thermotaxis memory of <italic>bas-1(ad446)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g002">Figs. 2E–2F</xref>). Under our experimental conditions, dopamine treated <italic>bas-1(ad446)</italic> mutants still exhibited the decreased half maximal extinction and percentages of animals performing IT at the time interval of 18-hr compared with those in wild-type N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g002">Figs. 2E–2F</xref>). Under our experimental conditions, exogenous treatment with 2 mM of serotonin or 5 mM of dopamine did not significantly influence the thermotaxis memory behavior in wild-type N2 nematodes (data not shown). Therefore, although we did not exclude the important role of dopamine in thermotaxis memory control, our data suggest the possible pivotal role of serotonin in regulating the thermotaxis memory in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<title>Genetic Interaction of TPH-1 with Insulin Signaling Pathway in Regulating Thermotaxis Memory</title>
<p>To determine the genetic mechanism of serotonin in regulating thermotaxis memory, we next investigated the genetic interaction of TPH-1 with insulin signaling pathway in regulating thermotaxis memory. Previous study demonstrated that serotonin may target the neuro-endocrine pathway from the DAF-2 insulin/IGF receptor to the DAF-16 FOXO transcription factor to modulate the response to environmental and physiological stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Liang1">[17]</xref>. Mutations of <italic>daf-16</italic> caused the decrease in thermotaxis memory; however, mutations of <italic>daf-2</italic> resulted in the increase in thermotaxis memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g003">Figs. 3A and 3D</xref>). <italic>daf-16(mu86)</italic> mutants showed the decreased half maximal extinction and percentages of animals performing IT at the time interval of 18-hr, but <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutants exhibited the increased half maximal extinction and percentages of animals performing IT at the time interval of 18-hr compared with those in wild-type N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g003">Figs. 3A and 3D</xref>). Both <italic>daf-16(mu86)</italic> and <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutants had the normal thermotaxis behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077779.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). More interestingly, we found that double mutants of <italic>daf-16(mu86);tph-1(mg280)</italic> exhibited the similar thermotaxis memory to that of <italic>daf-16(mu86)</italic> mutants, and double mutants of <italic>tph-1(mg280);daf-2(e1370)</italic> showed the similar thermotaxis memory to that <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g003">Figs. 3A and 3D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Serotonin is one of the important neurotransmitters for animals and human beings, and has been linked to emotional and motivational aspects of human behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Tomioka1">[22]</xref>. Several of previous clinical studies have implied the possible important role of serotonin in learning and memory behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Meneses1">[25]</xref>. Nevertheless, whether the role of serotonin is related to memory behavior of human still remains an important question <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Meneses1">[25]</xref>. In the present study, we provide the evidence to prove the crucial role of serotonin in memory control with the aid of thermotaxis memory assay model in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Firstly, mutations of genes (<italic>tph-1</italic>, and <italic>bas-1</italic>) encoding enzymes required for serotonin synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Sze1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Loer1">[13]</xref> caused the significant decrease in thermotaxis memory behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), which suggests that serotonin not only regulates pharyngeal pumping and egg-laying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Sze1">[12]</xref> but also regulates learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Liang1">[17]</xref> and memory in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Secondly, exogenous treatment with serotonin could rescue the deficits in thermotaxis memory of <italic>tph-1(mg280)</italic> and <italic>bas-1(ad446)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Serotonin is also critical for rewarded olfactory short-term memory in Drosophila, another invertebrate model animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Sitaraman1">[26]</xref>. Besides the serotonin, our data further imply the possible involvement of dopamine in thermotaxis memory control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g002">Figs. 2E and 2F</xref>), although dopamine may have no the same contribution to thermotaxis memory as serotonin. The dopamine synthesis may help modulate default activity during working memory in younger adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Braskie1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>mod-5(n822)</italic> mutants were hypersensitive to exogenous serotonin, and hyper-responsive in the experience-dependent enhanced slowing response to food modulated by serotonin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Ranganathan1">[19]</xref>. Our data further demonstrate that mutations of <italic>mod-5</italic> gene resulted in deficits in thermotaxis memory behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Therefore, deficits in both synthesis and uptake of serotonin will noticeably influence the thermotaxis memory behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Previous studies have implied that the serotonin transporter expression seems to be a reliable neuronal marker related to memory mechanisms, its alterations and potential treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Meneses2">[28]</xref>. In addition, it was reported that human serotonin transporter polyadenylation polymorphism can modulate the retention of fear extinction memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Hartley1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data demonstrate that serotonin regulate the thermotaxis memory through its receptors of SER-4 and SER-7, because, among the examined serotonin receptor mutants, only <italic>ser-4(ok512)</italic> and <italic>ser-7(ok1944)</italic> mutants exhibited deficits in thermotaxis memory behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). SER-4 and SER-7 are G-protein-coupled serotonin receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Chase1">[14]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, both ionotropic serotonin receptor and G-protein-coupled serotonin receptors are involved in the control of stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Liang1">[17]</xref>. Ionotropic serotonin receptor MOD-1 also regulates olfactory learning behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Zhang1">[30]</xref>. These data imply that <italic>C. elegans</italic> can employ different types of serotonin receptors to regulate different behaviors during the development. Moreover, considering that fact that deficit in memory is an important phenotype of many disorders, the further study on serotonin control of memory in <italic>C. elegans</italic> may provide some useful clues for clinical assessment or analysis of contribution of serotonin to the occurrence and regulation of the related disorders.</p>
<p>For the molecular control of thermotaxis memory behavior by serotonin, we hypothesized here that serotonin may target insulin signaling pathway to modulate the thermotaxis memory behavior. Genetic analysis indicates that double mutants of <italic>daf-16(mu86);tph-1(mg280)</italic> showed the similar thermotaxis memory phenotype to that of <italic>daf-16(mu86)</italic>, and double mutants of <italic>tph-1(mg280);daf-2(e1370)</italic> showed the similar thermotaxis memory phenotype to that of <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Previous study further suggests that G-protein-coupled serotonin receptor SER-4 modulated the starvation-induced DAF-16 nuclear accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Liang1">[17]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, serotonin and insulin signaling pathway may function together to regulate the integration of thermal information and food state in interneurons such as AIY and AIZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Mori1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>The very simple neuronal structure makes <italic>C. elegans</italic> an ideal model animal to examine the neuronal circuit of a specific behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-White1">[31]</xref>. The assay of neuron-specific activity of TPH-1 indicates that TPH-1 functioned in ADF sensory neurons to regulate the thermotaxis memory behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g005">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077779.s005">Table S1</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, sensory inputs can be released from ADF sensory neurons to the AUA sensory neurons, AIZ, RIA, and RIR interneuons, and SMB motor neurons, and ADF sensory neurons can further form gap junctions with ADA sensory neurons and AIA interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). <italic>ser-4</italic> gene expresses in PVT, RIB, RIS, and other unidentified head neurons, and <italic>ser-7</italic> gene may at least express in M4 motor neuron and several pharyngeal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Chase1">[14]</xref>. Therefore, so far we still did not know in which neurons serotonin released from ADF sensory neurons may activate the corresponding serotonin receptors of SER-4 and SER-7 to modulate the thermotaxis memory behavior.</p>
<p>Previous studies imply the possible involvement of AFD sensory neurons and AIY interneurons in thermotaxis memory control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Biron1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Gomez1">[10]</xref>. In the present study, we further provide the evidence to prove the crucial role of ADF sensory neurons in thermotaxis memory control. Ablation of ADF sensory neurons decreased the thermotaxis memory behavior, whereas activation of ADF sensory neurons increased the thermotaxis memory behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g006">Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077779.s006">Table S2</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, sensory inputs can be released from AIY interneurons to the AIZ and RIA interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-White1">[31]</xref>. Thus, for the serotonin control of thermotaxis memory behavior, one possibility is that serotonin may function through SER-4 and SER-7 in unknown neurons. The another possibility is that serotonin may regulate the activity of AIY interneurons by targeting insulin signaling pathway, and then AIY interneurons may further regulate the thermotaxis memory behavior through modulating the activity of AIZ and/or RIA interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077779-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). Nevertheless, because ablation of AFD, AIY, AIZ, and RIA neurons will cause deficits in thermotaxis behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Mori2">[32]</xref>, so far the direct evidence for AFD, AIY, AIZ, and RIA neurons in regulating thermotaxis memory behavior is still largely absent.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that serotonin was required for the thermotaxis memory control in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Deficits in both synthesis and transport of serotonin influenced the thermotaxis memory behavior. Serotonin released from ADF sensory neurons acted on G-protein-coupled serotonin receptors SER-4 and SER-7 in still unknown neurons to regulate the thermotaxis memory behavior. ADF sensory neurons may function together with AFD and AIY neurons to modulate the thermotaxis memory behavior. The further identification of neuronal circuit for serotonin receptors of SER-4 and SER-7 to regulate thermotaxis memory behavior is necessary. Moreover, it is still unclear whether the serotonin control of memory is a relatively conserved mechanism for all the assay systems of memory behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Ye1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Giles1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Zhang1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077779-Wang1">[33]</xref>.</p>
