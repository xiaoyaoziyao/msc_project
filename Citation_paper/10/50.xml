<title>Background</title>
<p>Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain adaptation, a longstanding experimental model of cerebellar learning, utilizes sites of plasticity in both cerebellar cortex and brainstem. However, the mechanisms by which the activity of cortical Purkinje cells may guide synaptic plasticity in brainstem vestibular neurons are unclear. Theoretical analyses indicate that vestibular plasticity should depend upon the correlation between Purkinje cell and vestibular afferent inputs, so that, in gain-down learning for example, increased cortical activity should induce long-term depression (LTD) at vestibular synapses.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>Here we expressed this correlational learning rule in its simplest form, as an anti-Hebbian, heterosynaptic spike-timing dependent plasticity interaction between excitatory (vestibular) and inhibitory (floccular) inputs converging on medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons (input-spike-timing dependent plasticity, iSTDP). To test this rule, we stimulated vestibular afferents to evoke EPSCs in rat MVN neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. Control EPSC recordings were followed by an induction protocol where membrane hyperpolarizing pulses, mimicking IPSPs evoked by flocculus inputs, were paired with single vestibular nerve stimuli. A robust LTD developed at vestibular synapses when the afferent EPSPs coincided with membrane hyperpolarisation, while EPSPs occurring before or after the simulated IPSPs induced no lasting change. Furthermore, the iSTDP rule also successfully predicted the effects of a complex protocol using EPSP trains designed to mimic classical conditioning.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These results, in strong support of theoretical predictions, suggest that the cerebellum alters the strength of vestibular synapses on MVN neurons through hetero-synaptic, anti-Hebbian iSTDP. Since the iSTDP rule does not depend on post-synaptic firing, it suggests a possible mechanism for VOR adaptation without compromising gaze-holding and VOR performance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) has been extensively used to test theories of cerebellar function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Ito1">[1]</xref>. One such test has concerned the location of sites of plasticity, because Marr-Albus theories predict a site of plasticity (between parallel fibres and Purkinje cells) in cerebellar cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Albus1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Marr1">[3]</xref>. Initial experimental results indicated that, contrary to prediction, the site of VOR plasticity in primates lay in the vestibular nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Miles1">[4]</xref>. Subsequent work has led to the conclusion that there are in fact at least two sites of plasticity, one in the floccular region of cerebellar cortex and one in the vestibular nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Boyden1">[5]</xref>. However this conclusion, while not directly falsifying Marr-Albus theories, leaves unanswered the question of why the complex microcircuit of cerebellar cortex should need an additional site of plasticity in the external and much simpler microcircuit of the vestibular nuclei.</p>
<p>A possible answer to this question has been suggested by a recent computational analysis of VOR adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Porrill1">[6]</xref>. Although VOR performance is accurate at frequencies up to 25 Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Huterer1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Ramachandran1">[8]</xref>, the proposed error signal for VOR adaptation, namely retinal slip, is delayed by ∼100 ms on its way to the flocculus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Stone1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Raymond1">[10]</xref>. This delay implies a low frequency limit to learning, and experimental evidence shows that the VOR can only be trained at frequencies below ∼10 Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Raymond2">[11]</xref>. However, simulations using an adaptive-filter model of cerebellar cortex showed that this limitation may be overcome and high frequency accuracy can be achieved, if a learned value of VOR gain in cerebellar cortex is subsequently transferred to the brainstem, for VOR calibration at high frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Porrill1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>This theoretical analysis provides a rationale for an additional brainstem site of plasticity, and also suggests a learning rule by which the flocculus may regulate the strength of vestibular afferent inputs to brainstem neurons, to alter the gain of the VOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g001">Fig. 1</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Miles1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Masuda1">[12]</xref>). A positive correlation between excitatory vestibular inputs and inhibitory Purkinje cell inputs converging on vestibular neurons should induce long-term depression (LTD) of the vestibular synapses, while a negative correlation should induce long-term potentiation (LTP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The strength of the vestibular synapses is gradually adjusted to render the cerebellar modulation of the VOR superfluous, consistent with evidence for a minor contribution of the flocculus to well-adapted VOR gain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Boyden1">[5]</xref>. In effect, gain-changes learnt by the cortex are transferred to the brainstem.</p>

<title>Correlational learning rule for regulation of vestibular synapse strength by cerebellar inhibition: transfer of VOR gain from cerebellar cortex to brainstem.</title>
<p>A: Schematic diagram of vestibular and cerebellar inputs to MVN neuron. The input <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the vestibular periphery (V) arrives at an excitatory synapse with weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The input <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the cerebellum (C) arrives at an inhibitory synapse with nominal weight 1. The MVN output is treated as the linear combination <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of these two inputs. The input <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the cerebellum denotes the retinal-slip training signal assumed to mediate learning in cerebellar cortex. B: Illustration of situation for gain down learning. The brainstem gain <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is too high so that the vestibular input on its own would produce an over-large vestibulo-ocular response. During training the cerebellum has learnt to produce an inhibitory input modulated in phase with the vestibular input, leading to cancellation which produces a 50% gain decrease (since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> requires <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The same result could be produced without the need for cerebellar input if the vestibular afferent synaptic strength (represented by the weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) was reduced during consolidation to half its value (since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> requires <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Hence in-phase (positively correlated) inputs to the MVN should drive a long-term depression (LTD) at vestibular afferent synapses during consolidation. C: Illustration of situation for gain up learning. In this case the out-of-phase cerebellar and vestibular afferent inputs to the MVN neurons should drive a long-term potentiation (LTP) of the vestibular afferent synapses during consolidation.</p>

<p>Although there is evidence for plasticity in the intrinsic excitability of vestibular neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Him1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Nelson1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Straka1">[15]</xref> and their afferent synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Straka1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Grassi1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Guilding1">[17]</xref>, the correlational learning rule has not been directly tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Gittis1">[18]</xref>. We therefore compared the plasticity of afferent synapses on medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons with theoretical predictions. To facilitate this comparison, we first expressed the correlational learning rule, which is expressed in terms of firing-rates in an equivalent form that specifies the interaction between single excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs converging on a post-synaptic neuron. In this form of the rule synaptic plasticity depends explicitly upon the relative timing of the two inputs, and so can be regarded as a form of spike-timing dependent plasticity (termed here input-spike timing plasticity, or iSTDP, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">RESULTS</xref>). The predictions of this iSTDP rule were tested by pairing brief membrane hyperpolarisations, simulating inhibitory inputs from Purkinje cells, with excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by stimulation of vestibular afferents <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also tested the rule with the more complex induction protocol developed by Pugh and Raman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh2">[20]</xref> to induce plasticity in deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) neurons, intended to mimic the pattern of mossy fiber and Purkinje cell inputs to DCN neurons in classical eye blink conditioning.</p>
<p>Our results show that repeated coincidence of EPSCs and membrane hyperpolarisation within a narrow temporal window causes robust LTD of the afferent synapses, strongly supporting the theoretical predictions. The effects of the more complex induction protocol were also well predicted by the iSTDP rule. In contrast to proposed mechanisms for plasticity in the DCN that require the silencing of the postsynaptic cell followed by rebound depolarization, it is possible that in the vestibular nuclei vestibular synapse strength may be modulated by iSTDP interactions, independently of postsynaptic firing. Since MVN neurons are directly involved in VOR execution, this would provide a possible mechanism for VOR adaptation without compromising gaze-holding and VOR performance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Correlational Learning Rule</title>
<p>The general form of the correlational learning rule is illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g001">Fig 1</xref>, and follows from the consideration that convergent in-phase inhibitory cerebellar inputs and excitatory vestibular inputs tend to cancel at the level of the MVN neurons. Thus for gain-down adaptation the cerebellar cortex adjusts the output of the MVN neurons, and so the gain of the VOR, by the appropriate firing of cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells in phase with the vestibular afferent input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Ito2">[21]</xref>). With learning, the required output from the MVN neurons can be achieved, without a need for continuing cerebellar input, if the synaptic weight of the vestibular input is decreased in proportion to the cerebellar inhibitory modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Thus a positive correlation between the cerebellar inhibitory input and the vestibular afferent input should lead to the induction of a long-term <italic>decrease</italic> in vestibular synaptic weight. Similarly for gain-up adaptation a negative correlation should lead to a long-term <italic>increase</italic> in vestibular synaptic weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g001">Fig 1C</xref>). This correlational learning rule therefore corresponds to the anti-Hebbian covariance learning rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Sejnowski1">[22]</xref>, expressed in terms of the firing rates of the cerebellar and vestibular inputs,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e014" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>in which weight changes have opposite sign to the correlation of the two inputs (the angle brackets represent a time average over a suitable time scale <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Here <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the change in the weight of the vestibular synapse on the second-order vestibular neuron in the medial vestibular nucleus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the difference of the instantaneous firing rate of the vestibular input from its tonic firing rate, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the difference of the instantaneous firing rate of the Purkinje cell input from its tonic firing rate. The learning rate is fixed by the positive parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Provided this learning rate is sufficiently slower than the equivalent rate in cerebellar cortex, gain changes learnt in the cortex will be stably transferred to the brainstem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Porrill1">[6]</xref>. Indirect evidence for the assumption about learning rates comes from studies showing that floccular inactivation only affects VOR gain if a new value has been learnt recently: this evidence is discussed in Porrill and Dean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Porrill1">[6]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a2">
<title>Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity Form of Correlational Learning Rule</title>
<p>In order to experimentally test the above correlational learning rule, we expressed equation (1) in its simplest form as an anti-Hebbian, hetero-synaptic, input-spike-timing dependent plasticity (iSTDP, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">RESULTS</xref>) rule which defines the interaction between single excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs converging on a post-synaptic neuron. Changes in synaptic weight were assumed to be caused by such input pairs, and to depend only on the relative timing of the two input spikes, independently of post-synaptic firing. We will use the term “inter-spike interval” to refer to the interval between spikes in the two separate input streams, and the term “iSTDP profile” for the dependence of vestibular synaptic weight change on the inter-spike interval.</p>
<p>The iSTDP rule can be derived heuristically by considering the fluctuation in firing rates caused by two additional input spikes separated by an inter-spike interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and superimposed on tonic background firing of the cerebellar and vestibular afferent inputs respectively. The two additional spikes produce brief increases in the input firing rates <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at the time of occurrence of the spikes. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is small enough so that these fluctuations overlap in time, that is they are positively correlated, then by equation (1) this leads to a proportionate decrease in synaptic weight at the vestibular afferent synapse. Thus an important prediction of the iSTDP rule is that there must be a narrow window in which LTD is induced at the vestibular synapse when positively correlated spikes occur in the two input streams, i.e. there is an LTD dip in the iSTDP profile at small values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, because for tonic uncorrelated inputs equation (1) predicts no net overall weight change, the LTD caused by the spike pairs with small <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values must be balanced by LTP contributed by spike pairs with large values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; and since such pairs are much more numerous, it follows that the LTP induced by large <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values must be substantially weaker than the LTD induced by small <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values. The dependence of the change in synaptic weight on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is therefore described by an iSTDP profile<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e029" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>which is characterized by a narrow LTD dip for small values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, surrounded by weak LTP lobes for larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Relation between iSTDP profiles and VOR learning characteristics.</title>
<p>Panel A shows two iSTDP profiles, where vestibular synaptic weight change (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of equation (2) in Methods) is plotted against interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between spikes in the two separate vestibular and cerebellar input streams. Panel B shows the corresponding learning rate functions <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (given by equation (7) in the Methods) plotted against frequency <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of head motion. The green curve in panel A represents an idealized iSTDP profile with an infinitely narrow and deep LTD dip surrounded by an infinitely wide and shallow LTP plateau. This corresponds to an ‘all-pass’ filter where learning is equally efficient at all frequencies greater than zero, as shown by the corresponding green line in panel B. The blue curve in panels A and B is a filter chosen so that learning is concentrated in the region 0.3–10 Hz as suggested by data for VOR adaptation (see Methods). Its learning rate falls to 20% of maximum at 0.3 and 10 Hz (panel B). The corresponding iSTDP profile (panel A) has a half-width at 20% maximum of 49 ms. The general shape of the iSTDP profile derives in part from the requirement that synaptic weights be stable for tonic or very slowly varying, asynchronous, inputs, which implies that the total area under the profile must be zero (so that the total areas representing synaptic potentiation through LTP, and depression through LTD, must balance).</p>

Hence the form of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be constrained by learning rate data for varying head rotation frequency. The exact mathematical form of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponding to equation (1) is an infinitely narrow and deep (delta function) LTD dip surrounded by an infinitely wide and shallow LTP plateau. This has a constant Fourier transform and so corresponds to a learning rule which applies equally well at all frequencies of head movement. However experimental findings show that effective VOR learning is restricted to frequencies below ∼10Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Raymond1">[10]</xref>. As we show below (Frequency-Dependent Form of Correlational Learning Rule) this frequency limit can be incorporated by modifying the form of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, to be a bandpass filter. Nevertheless the essential prediction of the iSTDP rule, of a deep and narrow window where LTD of the vestibular synapse results from the interaction between temporally correlated inhibitory and excitatory input spikes, is not changed when this constraint is taken into account.</p>

<title>Application of iSTDP Learning Rule to Spike Trains</title>
<p>The correlational learning rule (2) given in terms of firing rates can be extended to apply to general spiking inputs by taking the sum over all spike pairs of the individual weight changes<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e045" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e046" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>The iSTDP rule can therefore be used to predict the effects of any arbitrary combination of excitatory and inhibitory input spikes. We exploited this fact to investigate two particular input sequences: (i) the pause-rebound conditioning protocol developed by Pugh and Raman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh1">[19]</xref> to induce plasticity at mossy-fiber synapses on neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei, and (ii) simulated <italic>in vivo</italic> learning in MVN neurons with stochastic inputs, to simulate the iSTDP rule superimposed on neuronal spike firing rates similar to those seen <italic>in vivo</italic>. In both cases simulations were implemented in MATLAB™ using the Fast Fourier Transform to implement the convolution in equation (6) (Frequency-Dependent Form of Correlational Learning Rule) efficiently using the convolution theorem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Papoulis1">[23]</xref>.</p>

<title>Frequency-Dependent Form of Correlational Learning Rule</title>
<p>The general form of the learning rule in equation (1) operates equally effectively over <italic>all</italic> frequencies of head movement, whereas both experimental evidence and theoretical analysis indicate that learning rates in VOR gain adaptation are very markedly affected by head-movement frequency. Indeed it has been argued that only because of these frequency effects is brainstem plasticity required at all <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Porrill1">[6]</xref>. It is therefore important to estimate how far these frequency constraints alter the iSTDP predictions to be used in the present study.</p>
<p>The underlying problem is that, while VOR performance is accurate at frequencies up to at least 20 Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Huterer1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Ramachandran1">[8]</xref>, the retinal slip error signal which drives VOR adaptation is associated with a conduction delay of ∼100 msec in reaching the flocculus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Raymond1">[10]</xref>. This imposes a theoretical frequency limit above which effective learning cannot occur in the cerebellar cortex of ∼10 Hz (given a plausible eligibility trace), consistent with experimental evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Raymond2">[11]</xref>. For frequencies higher than this limit, VOR calibration can in principle be achieved if the value of VOR gain learnt in the cerebellar cortex for frequencies below ∼10 Hz, is subsequently transferred to the shorter-latency brainstem VOR pathways in the MVN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Porrill1">[6]</xref>. This is sufficient because the frequency-response of the eye plant above ∼10 Hz is essentially flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig 3B</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Porrill1">[6]</xref>), so that the value of VOR gain for the highest frequencies which can be effectively learnt in the cortex is also applicable to the shorter-latency pathways through the MVN which mediate the VOR response at higher frequencies.

<title>Coincident membrane hyperpolarisation induces long-term depression at the vestibular afferent synapse.</title>
<p>A, B, Representation of the iST induction protocols. Single vestibular nerve stimuli were applied at various times relative to a 20 msec hyperpolarizing current pulse (A: T<sub>s</sub> = 0 msec, vestibular nerve stimulus applied at the start of the membrane hyperpolarisation; B: T<sub>s</sub> = 20 msec, vestibular stimulus applied to coincide with the maximum membrane hyperpolarisation). The peak of the evoked EPSC is indicated by the arrow in the uppermost records. C, Normalized EPSC amplitude before and after induction with the T<sub>s</sub> = 0 msec protocol (1000 presentations, every 5 sec, indicated by solid bar). Pairing the vestibular input with the start of the inhibitory input induces a small but significant long-term depression of EPSC amplitude (12.6±0.7% depression; p = 0.01 compared to control, n = 4). D, Normalized EPSC amplitude before and after induction with the T<sub>s</sub> = 20 msec protocol. Pairing the vestibular input with the peak of the inhibitory input causes a marked long-term depression of vestibular nerve-evoked EPSCs (37±4% depression; p = 0.001 compared to control; n = 9). Inset shows example averaged EPSCs (20 consecutive recordings) before and after a T<sub>s</sub> = 20 msec induction. Bars indicate 200 pA and 2 msec. The stimulus artefact is truncated. E, Pre-incubation with the NMDA antagonist D-APV (50 µM) prevented the induction of LTD in response to the T<sub>s</sub> = 20 msec protocol (control, * p = 0.001, n = 9; +D-APV, p = 0.23; n = 4). F, Effects of varying the relative time of the vestibular stimulus on mean EPSC amplitude. The vestibular nerve stimulus was applied at various times with respect to the onset of the inhibitory input (T<sub>s</sub> = −150 msec, n = 6; T<sub>s</sub> = 0 msec, n = 4; T<sub>s</sub> = 20 msec, n = 9; T<sub>s</sub> = 40 msec, n = 5; or T<sub>s</sub> = 60 msec, n = 4). Robust LTD is seen when the vestibular input coincides with the peak of the hyperpolarizing input (T<sub>s</sub> = 20; * p&lt;0.01 compared to T<sub>s</sub> = −150 msec). G, Three MVN neurons were exposed to two induction protocols in series. In the first induction T<sub>s</sub> = −150 msec (solid bar) induced a short-term depression which reversed within 15 minutes. Subsequently in the same cell, the T<sub>s</sub> = 20 msec protocol (open bar) induced a marked significant LTD (32±3% depression; p = 0.04 compared to post-induction with the T<sub>s</sub> = −150 msec protocol).

<p>Since the bandpass constraints do not fix the shape of the profile uniquely, we have used a difference of Gaussians (DoG) filter as an example of a time-symmetric filter (DoG filters have been widely used as biologically plausible bandpass filters e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Marr2">[24]</xref>). We have also investigated a difference of exponentials filter which more closely resembles the antisymmetric STDP profiles found experimentally in other systems (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Bi1">[25]</xref>). The required bandpass characteristic could be implemented using both classes of filter (results for the difference of exponentials filter not shown). The iSTDP profiles consistent with the bandpass requirements were characterized by a narrow deep LTD dip at about the time the excitatory and inhibitory inputs coincide, balanced by a wider shallower LTP region (additional LTP and LTD lobes are possible, as in the exact bandpass sync function, but biologically implausible). Furthermore, the upper frequency limit of the bandpass is fixed by the LTD dip width (the narrower and deeper the dip the higher the frequency at which gain transfer is possible) and the low frequency limit is fixed by the LTP region width (the wider and shallower the LTP region, the lower the frequency at which transfer can take place).</p>

<p>Experiments were performed on 250–300 µm coronal slices of the brainstem containing the rostral part of the MVN and the central stump of the VIIIth nerve from Lister Hooded rats aged P18–38 (young adult animals), except where the aim was to examine the effect of age when slices from animals aged P13–17 (juvenile animals, around the time of eye opening) were used. All procedures were approved by the Ethical Review Panel, University of Edinburgh, and were carried out in compliance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (project licence 6003334). Animals of either sex were decapitated under isofluorane anaesthesia, and the brains quickly removed into ice-cold modified aCSF (composition (mM): NaCl, 87; KCl, 1.2; HEPES, 10; glucose, 25; sucrose, 75; KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 7; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5, equilibrated with 100% oxygen, pH 7.3). Slices were cut using a Vibratome 3000 (Intracel, UK), transferred to aCSF (composition (mM): NaCl, 140; KCl, 2.5; HEPES, 10; glucose, 11; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4, equilibrated with 100% oxygen, pH 7.3) for 1 hour at 36°C, and then maintained at room temperature for at least a further hour before transfer to the recording chamber.</p>

A bipolar stimulating electrode was placed at the lateral border of the MVN, in the region of the root of the VIIIth nerve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Kinney1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Puyal1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Broussard1">[31]</xref> to stimulate vestibular afferent fibres. MVN neurons were visualized using infra-red differential interference contrast microscopy (Olympus BX51W1, Japan). Whole-cell patch recordings were obtained using borosilicate glass electrodes with tip resistances of 5–8 MΩ when filled with internal solution (composition (mM): potassium gluconate, 145; HEPES, 5; EGTA, 0.1; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; K<sub>2</sub>ATP, 5).</p>
<p>Data were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier, sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz (in current clamp) or 2 kHz (voltage clamp). All neurons included here had input impedances &gt;100 MOhm and spike heights of &gt;+40 mV, and showed an early fast post-spike after-hyperpolarsation (AHP) followed by a delayed slow AHP (‘type B’ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Straka1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Johnston1">[32]</xref>). EPSCs were evoked by the stimulation of the vestibular afferent axons in the dorso-lateral aspect of the slice (50–400 µA for 100–400 µsec) at 15 sec intervals, at a holding potential of −65 mV in voltage clamp, where the spontaneous spiking of these neurons was prevented. Previous studies have similarly stimulated vestibular afferents in slices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Kinney1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Puyal1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Broussard1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Grassi2">[33]</xref>, though it cannot be excluded that additional intra-nuclear inputs were also activated by the electrical stimulus. Control recordings were made for 7–10 min to ensure EPSC amplitudes were stable. The mean amplitude of control EPSCs in this study was 264±17 pA and the mean latency was 2.06±0.08 msec (n = 52). In all experimental conditions latencies were unchanged after induction (2.03±0.07 msec, n = 52). Series resistance was monitored throughout the experiment. MVN neurons in which the EPSC amplitude was smaller than 100 pA, or varied by more than 20% during the pre-induction period, were not studied further. Neurons in which series resistance changed by more than 20% over the duration of the recordings (40–60 minutes) were also rejected.</p>
<p>Each recorded cell was tested with one of two alternative induction protocols applied in current clamp mode, with the membrane potential held at −65 mV. In the input-spike timing (iST) protocol a 20 msec hyperpolarizing current injection, mimicking the time-course of an inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP) in the MVN neuron, was repeatedly paired with a single vestibular nerve stimulus which was applied at various times relative to the membrane hyperpolarisation (1000 presentations at 0.5 sec intervals; e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig 3A, B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Sekirnjak1">[34]</xref>. The hyperpolarizing pulse was of a sufficient amplitude to hyperpolarize membrane potential to −80 mV at its peak. The effects of altering the temporal relationship between the excitatory and inhibitory inputs were explored by systematically varying the timing of vestibular stimulation relative to the hyperpolarizing pulse.</p>
<p>In a number of MVN cells, the pause-rebound induction protocol devised by Pugh and Raman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh1">[19]</xref> to induce plasticity at the mossy fibre synapses on deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) neurons (“PR protocol”), was used (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). In this case the vestibular afferents were stimulated at 130 Hz for 550 msec, and a hyperpolarizing current pulse (duration 250 msec, of a sufficient amplitude to hyperpolarize membrane potential to −80 mV) was injected coincident with the start of vestibular stimulation. This sequence was repeated 30 times every 5 seconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh1">[19]</xref>. The total number of vestibular nerve stimuli presented in the iST and PR induction protocols are approximately equal. After either induction protocol, EPSCs were measured in voltage clamp mode with the membrane potential held at −65 mV for at least 30 min.

<title>Input-Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity</title>
<p>The term STDP does not by itself specify whether the relevant timing is between two sets of input spikes to a neuron, or between input spikes and postsynaptic action potentials. However, in practice it is so closely associated with the latter alternative that the term iSTDP (input-Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity) is used here for a proposed learning rule in which synaptic weight change depends on the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory input spikes (see METHODS). The term “input timing dependent plasticity” (ITDP) has been used by Dudman et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Dudman1">[35]</xref> for the particular case of inputs to distal and proximal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, but the term appears not to have been widely used subsequently.</p>
<sec id="s3a1">
<title>Derivation of iSTDP Profiles</title>
<p>Theoretical analyses of VOR gain-adaptation have suggested a correlational learning rule for plasticity in the vestibular nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, this rule is typically expressed in terms of firing rates, whereas comparison with <italic>in vitro</italic> results requires the rule to be in input-spike-time dependent plasticity form. The derivation of this iSTDP form for the linear case is described in Methods, and the outcome illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g002">Fig 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The simplest version of the iSTDP rule is that if vestibular and cerebellar spikes arrive at an MVN neuron at the same time, substantial LTD is induced at the vestibular synapse. When the spikes arrive at different times, much weaker LTP is induced. The green traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g002">Fig 2</xref> show the iSTDP profile and learning for the hypothetical case where the correlational learning rule applies uniformly for all frequencies of input (here, all frequencies of head velocity). In this case there is an infinitely narrow LTD dip at the time of coincidence of the two inputs, and an infinitely small LTP at all other times (Methods).</p>
<p>However, it is known that VOR adaptation learning is frequency dependent. At high frequencies learning-rate decreases above ∼2 Hz, reaching low levels at 10 Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Raymond2">[11]</xref>. At low frequencies (&lt;1 Hz) learning rates are confounded by the contribution of optokinetic and smooth pursuit systems: however, there are computational grounds for suggesting that learning at frequencies below ∼0.3 Hz should not be transferred to the brainstem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Porrill1">[6]</xref>. These high and low frequency constraints are embodied in the blue curve of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g002">Fig 2B</xref>, and the iSTDP profile corresponding to them shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g002">Fig 2A</xref>. Comparison of blue and green profiles indicates that the general form of the iSTDP rule is preserved, although the LTD dip becomes broader and the LTP lobes narrower. The widening of the LTD dip is related to the high-frequency restriction on learning, with poorer high-frequency learning corresponding to a broader dip (see Methods for details).</p>
<p>The blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> would predict the iSTDP profile for synaptic plasticity in the vestibular nuclei only if the frequency characteristics of VOR adaptation depended entirely on that plasticity. However, experimental evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Raymond2">[11]</xref> shows that the high-frequency restriction is imposed by processing in the cerebellar cortex, and computational analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Porrill1">[6]</xref> indicates that this cortical limit is a requirement for stable learning. In this case therefore the prediction is that the LTD dip for plasticity in the vestibular nuclei should be no wider than that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, otherwise high-frequency VOR learning would be limited by vestibular, not cortical, processes.</p>

<title>Interactions between Vestibular EPSCs and Membrane Hyperpolarisation in MVN Neurons: Comparison with Predictions from the iSTDP rule</title>
<p>To test the above correlational rule experimentally, we explored the interaction between membrane hyperpolarisation and vestibular afferent EPSCs using the iST induction protocol consisting of a 20 msec hyperpolarizing current injection, mimicking the time-course of an inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP) in the MVN neuron, paired with a single vestibular nerve stimulus that was applied at various times relative to the membrane hyperpolarisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref>; Methods). This protocol represents the simplest implementation of the above iSTDP learning rule.</p>
<p>Repeated pairing of the vestibular nerve stimulus with the onset of the hyperpolarizing current pulse (T<sub>s</sub> = 0 msec, 1000 presentations at 0.5 sec intervals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) induced a short-term depression of the vestibular afferent EPSC amplitude, which reversed within 15 minutes after the end of the induction protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). By contrast, when the vestibular stimulus was timed to coincide with the end of the hyperpolarizing pulse, at the time when the membrane hyperpolarisation was at its peak (T<sub>s</sub> = 20 msec, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), a robust long-term depression of the vestibular afferent EPSC amplitude was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>; mean normalised EPSC amplitude averaged between 25–30 minutes after induction was 63%±3% of pre-induction controls, n = 9, p&lt;0.001).</p>
<p>There was no significant change in vestibular EPSC amplitude in slices pre-incubated with 50 µM D-APV for 15 minutes before the application of the induction protocol, indicating that the LTD was dependent on the activation of NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>; n = 4). Application of the vestibular stimulus at longer delays after the hyperpolarizing pulse (T<sub>s</sub> = 40 or 60 msec), or in advance of the hyperpolarizing pulse (T<sub>s</sub> = −150 msec) induced only short-term depression of EPSC amplitude, similar to that seen with T<sub>s</sub> = 0 msec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>In three further MVN neurons, two induction protocols were applied in series: first the vestibular nerve stimulus was applied 150 msec in advance of the hyperpolarizing pulse (T<sub>s</sub> = −150 msec) and then, after a observation period of 15 minutes post-induction, the vestibular nerve stimulus was applied at T<sub>s</sub> = 20 msec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>). In these cells the first induction protocol induced a short-term depression of the EPSC amplitude which reversed within the 15 minute observation period, while the second induction protocol induced a marked and sustained LTD of the vestibular nerve EPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>; mean normalized EPSC amplitude after induction was 68%±2% of pre-induction controls, p&lt;0.001).</p>

<title>Effects of the Pause-Rebound Protocol in MVN Neurons</title>
<p>The LTD obtained here with the iST protocol differs from the LTP found in experimental studies of DCN plasticity, albeit using a more complex protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh1">[19]</xref>. It was therefore important to test this apparent difference between MVN and DCN plasticity directly, by applying the complex protocol in the MVN. To compare the hyperpolarisation-dependent plasticity at the vestibular nerve synapse with that seen at the mossy fiber synapses in deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) neurons, 13 further MVN neurons were tested using the PR induction protocol (Methods; after Pugh and Raman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh1">[19]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<p>In young adult MVN neurons (from animals aged P18–38) tested with the PR protocol (30 presentations every 5 sec), the amplitude of the vestibular nerve-evoked EPSC was significantly reduced compared to control and remained depressed for the duration of the recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>; mean normalised EPSC amplitude after induction was 76%±4% relative to pre-induction controls, p&lt;0.03). In the presence of the selective NMDA receptor antagonist D-APV (50 µM), the PR protocol induced a smaller but still significant LTD of the vestibular EPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Vestibular nerve stimulation applied alone, without the concomitant hyperpolarizing pulse, induced only a short-lasting depression of the vestibular EPSC that reversed within 15 minutes post-induction, and LTD did not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g004">Fig 4D</xref>; mean EPSC amplitude after induction was 94%±4% of pre-induction controls, p = 0.36).</p>

<title>Influence of Post-Natal Age</title>
<p>One possible explanation for the finding that the PR protocol induces depression of the vestibular synapses in MVN neurons, in contrast to the potentiation of mossy fibre synapses that occurs in DCN neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh1">[19]</xref>, is that this reflects the differences in the post-natal ages of the animals used in the two studies. In rodents the eyes open for the first time at around post-natal day 15, and this is followed by a rapid visual system dependent maturation of the properties and synaptic function of vestibular nucleus neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Straka1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Grassi2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Dutia1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we examined the role of post-natal age in two experiments. First, in juvenile MVN neurons recorded in slices from animals aged P13–17, the PR protocol did not induce LTD of the vestibular nerve EPSC but instead only a short-lasting depression of EPSC amplitude occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Secondly, we investigated whether the hyperpolarisation-dependent LTD of the vestibular afferent EPSCs evoked by the iST (T<sub>s</sub> = 20 msec) induction protocol also occurred in juvenile MVN neurons. In contrast to young adult cells, in juvenile cells this protocol induced a small potentiation of the vestibular EPSC amplitude, which did not reach significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>; mean normalised EPSC amplitude after induction was increased by 21%±4% relative to pre-induction controls, p = 0.1). Unlike the LTD of EPSC amplitude in young adult neurons, which was apparent immediately after the end of the induction and remained relatively unchanged for the following 30 minutes, the small potentiation in juvenile neurons developed gradually after a delay of some 10 minutes and increased to a plateau about 20 minutes post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

These modified protocols induced post-hyperpolarisation spiking at up to 70 Hz in the MVN neurons.

<title>Modeling the Effects of the PR Induction Protocols on Synaptic Plasticity</title>
<p>To determine whether the effects of the PR protocols on vestibular synapse strength could be fully accounted for by the iSTDP learning rule, which is independent of any particular cellular mechanism, we modeled the changes in synaptic plasticity induced by the original and modified PR protocols. Inhibitory and excitatory inputs were treated as inputs to a linear system whose behavior was determined by its iSTDP profile (METHODS). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g007">Fig 7</xref> indicates that this method successfully reproduces the marked cumulative LTD induced by the original PR protocol in vestibular neurons (PR-0, blue trace), as well as the substantial reduction in LTD when the protocols were modified as described above by addition of depolarizing pulses at the end of the membrane hyperpolarisation (PR-1 and 2, green and red traces).This pattern of results reflects the fact that during induction with the PR protocols most of the individual vestibular EPSCs are paired with membrane hyperpolarisation in the original protocol PR-0, whereas in the modified PR protocol the tendency is to produce nearly balanced LTD and LTP at each presentation since the EPSCs now coincide nearly equally either with membrane hyperpolarisation in the early part of the presentation or membrane depolarization in the later part. Since the modeling results essentially derive from the linearity of the modeled system, the implication is that this form of vestibular nucleus plasticity also behaves approximately linearly in the conditions studied here (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Bagnall1">[40]</xref>).</p>

<p>The build up of weight change in vestibular synapses over time is shown for the three PR protocols. For PR-0 (a 250 msec hyperpolarization overlapping the 550 msec vestibular pulse train, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) the main contribution at each presentation is LTD and there is a relatively large weight change. For PR-1 (250 msec hyperpolarization followed by 250 msec depolarization of equal amplitude) and PR-2 (250 msec hyperpolarization followed by 125 msec depolarization of twice the amplitude) the LTD contribution is approximately balanced by LTP leading to much smaller weight changes. For protocol PR-3 (a 250 msec depolarization overlapping the 550 msec vestibular pulse train, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>) overall LTP is predicted. In this simulation the hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current pulses were interpreted as due to proportional changes in firing rate of the appropriate input, and weight changes were calculated using the firing rate version of the learning rule (Equation 6).</p>

<p>A significant feature of this result is the dependence of the iSTDP learning rule upon the local membrane potential of the post-synaptic cell at the time of arrival of the EPSCs, not upon action potential firing of the post-synaptic cell. However, since the post-synaptic cell depolarization in the modified PR protocols is accompanied by spiking, this raises the possibility that post-synaptic spikes may also affect plasticity at the vestibular synapse. The PR protocols are ambiguous in this regard, since they necessarily confound post-synaptic depolarization with post-synaptic spiking. Resolving this confound experimentally, to determine whether post-synaptic spike firing may also have a role in regulating vestibular synapse strength, is an important issue that is difficult to address directly. This is particularly the case if the iSTDP interactions between excitatory and inhibitory inputs take place in the distal dendrites of MVN cells, some distance removed from the soma (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Discussion</xref>). In the comparatively much better studied models of homosynaptic STDP in cortical neurons the issue of postsynaptic spiking versus slower membrane potential changes remains unclear. One possibility is that dendritic action potentials are simply too brief to engage the plasticity mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Williams1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our iSTDP model features both LTP and LTD, and its success in predicting the effects of the complex PR protocols in MVN neurons depend upon both. However in these experiments the LTP for these protocols is not observed directly, but is ‘implicit’ in the model. Nevertheless the linear model predicts explicit LTP for protocol PR-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>), raising the question of why the modified PR protocols show implicit but not explicit LTP. One possibility is that synaptic weights <italic>in vitro</italic> may be close to their maximum values, which would create a nonlinearity and mean that <italic>in vitro</italic> LTP could only be elicited after prior LTD. This possibility is shown in simulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g008">Fig. 8</xref>. Such a saturation of vestibular synaptic weights in the <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental conditions is actually predicted by the iSTDP learning rule because of the absence of cerebellar inhibitory synaptic inputs to the MVN neurons in the slice preparation. Thus while <italic>in vivo</italic> the ongoing simple-spike firing of Purkinje cells would provide a continuing inhibitory synaptic input to the MVN neurons, inducing a steady level of LTD in the vestibular synapses, the lack of this inhibitory input <italic>in vitro</italic> may allow the vestibular synapse strength to drift towards the maximal value.</p>

<p>However <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g009">Fig. 9D</xref> shows a histogram of all ISIs between spikes in the two input streams for two sample 50 s segments. Although individual absolute spike timings are not well defined, it is clear that the correlated frequency modulation between the spike trains is accurately reflected in the statistical properties of the ISIs. In particular the positive correlation leads to an excess of spike pairs with small ISIs; these produce net LTD because they lie in the narrow LTD dip in the iSTDP profile (shown superimposed). Finally <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g009">Fig. 9E</xref> shows the cumulative weight changes for several 50 s samples of positively correlated sinusoidal inputs. Although the weight changes show some stochastic variation there is a consistent steady decrease in synaptic weight as predicted by theory. As with the PR protocol simulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, the findings shown here assume linearity of the modeled system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Gerstner1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>The fact that these results illustrate how the model can work well in principle points to the necessity for further experimental work, to establish whether the implicit LTP or LTD reduction observed here is in fact driven by membrane depolarization as predicted by the model, and to clarify the role of post-synaptic spiking. The assumption of linearity used here, which means that the iSTDP profile against a null background also applies at other firing rates, is widely made in spike-timing dependent plasticity models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Gerstner1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Roberts2">[44]</xref> yet is not often tested empirically. Determining the cellular mechanisms involved in implementing the iSTDP rule is therefore important for understanding vestibular neuron plasticity, and may also contribute to understanding plasticity in other systems. For example, although conventional STDP in cortical neurons has been extensively studied since its initial description <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Markram1">[45]</xref>, the underlying cellular mechanisms are still a matter for current debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Williams1">[41]</xref>.</p>

<title>Robustness of Modeling Results</title>
<p>The robustness of the modelling results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g009">Fig. 9</xref> was investigated in three ways. Firstly they were shown to be robust with respect to the shape of iSTDP profile (symmetrical <italic>versus</italic> asymmetrical, see Methods).</p>
<p>Secondly the equivalence of the spiking and firing rate formulations of the learning rule was checked. The frequency and depth of input modulation, and baseline tonic firing rate of stochastic firing rate coded signals were varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g010">Fig 10</xref>). The effects of frequency on learning rate for these spiking simulations correspond to those predicted theoretically by equation (7). Similarly in accord with theoretical predictions, peak learning rate is proportional to the product of modulation rates, the overall shape (frequency dependence) of the learning curve is unaffected by modulation level, and tonic rate has no effect on learning.</p>

<title>Robustness of iSTDP learning rule.</title>
<p>The robustness of the iSTDP learning rule for stochastic spiking inputs was checked by comparing the learning rates of spiking simulations with the theoretical predictions from equation 7. Effective learning rate is plotted as a function of frequency for the iSTDP profile constrained by the experimental data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig. 3H</xref>. Learning rate was calculated for sinusoidally modulated Poisson spike trains using the procedure described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g008">Fig. 8</xref> for in-phase sinusoidal modulation frequencies in the range 0.05 to 50 Hz. The blue curve is for spike trains with tonic rate 60 spikes/sec and a modulation depth of 40 spikes (summarised as 60±40). The theoretical (dashed) learning rate curve <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) is overlaid for comparison. The green curve (60±20) and red (30±20) learning rate curves are calculated using different values for tonic and for both tonic and peak modulation firing rates respectively. The results illustrate the theoretical predictions that (i) peak learning rate is proportional to the product of modulation rates (in this case both peak modulations are halved, reducing peak learning rate to 25% of its value) (ii) the overall shape (frequency dependence) of the learning curve is unaffected by modulation level, and (iii) the tonic rate has no effect on learning.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the effects of unbalanced iSTDP profiles were examined. An unbalanced profile is one in which the area under the LTD part of the profile is not equal to that under the LTP part. In the simplest case, where the inputs to the vestibular nucleus are unaffected by changes to its output, the main effect of an imbalance is that tonic firing rates produce a constant rate of weight change, eventually driving the synaptic weight to its upper or lower limit (results not shown: cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Kubota1">[46]</xref>). However, the vestibular nucleus is in fact part of a closed loop together with cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g011">Fig. 11</xref>), which confers some degree of internal stability. The gain errors caused by LTP/LTD imbalance produce retinal slip, which drives cerebellar learning in a direction so as to cancel the gain error. As a result the cerebellar input contains a component which is correlated with vestibular signal. This correlation drives gain transfer in a direction opposing the effect of the original LTP/LTD imbalance.</p>

When LTP exactly balances LTD the contribution to weight changes from the mean firing rates is zero. Any imbalance however produces an additional term in the learning rule, proportional to the product of the mean firing rates. In the open loop (i.e. when VOR inaccuracy has no effect on the system) this term would tend to drive the weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to saturation (for an excess of LTP) or to silence (for an excess of LTD). Hence any LTP/LTD imbalance, however small, potentially leads to learning instability. This situation is modified when the behavioural closed-loop via the cerebellum is considered. Whereas error in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is generated at the slow time-scale of brainstem learning, the retinal slip <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that the weight error entails drives cerebellar cortical learning on a much faster time scale, modifying the cerebellar input <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013182.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the MVN so as to correct the error.

<p>Simulations of this behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g012">Fig. 12</xref>) show that the effect of imbalance is to produce errors in the gain transferred to the brainstem, but not weight divergence, as long as the imbalance is relatively small. However, a relative imbalance of ±10% leads to gain transfer errors of ±30%. Thus a reasonably accurate transfer of gain to the brainstem is only possible if the LTD/LTP imbalance is small. These results therefore suggest that there may be homeostatic cellular mechanisms that balance LTP and LTD over the longer timescale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Turrigiano1">[47]</xref>, which would be appropriate to maintain stability in a system with tonic firing rates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These findings demonstrate a novel form of plasticity in vestibular neurons, in which a robust LTD develops at the vestibular synapse when afferent EPSPs occur simultaneously with membrane hyperpolarisation, intended to simulate IPSPs evoked by cerebellar inhibitory inputs. The development of LTD requires a precise coincidence of EPSPs with membrane hyperpolarisation, so that a large LTD occurs when the vestibular stimulus coincides with the peak of the simulated IPSPs while weaker or no LTD results from EPSCs occurring before or after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). This result agrees with predictions from an iSTDP implementation of the correlational learning rule for cerebellum-guided plasticity in the vestibular nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g002">Fig 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Miles1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Boyden1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Porrill1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Masuda1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Peterson1">[48]</xref>, and also with the experimental demonstration that VOR adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Miles1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Porrill1">[6]</xref> can be driven by simple-spike instructive signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Ke1">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present experiments, membrane hyperpolarizing currents were injected via the recording electrode on the MVN cell soma in order to induce LTD at the vestibular synapses. In reality, Purkinje synaptic terminals may primarily influence vestibular afferent synapses in their immediate vicinity. Convergence of vestibular afferents and Purkinje terminals onto individual dendritic compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-SolerLlavina1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Campanac1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Sjostrom1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Larkum1">[53]</xref> could enable a highly effective, localized implementation of the iSTDP mechanism. Indeed, in a realistic model of an MVN cell dendrite, EPSCs coinciding with membrane hyperpolarisation induce elevations of sub-synaptic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] broadly consistent with the LTD observed here (Graham, Menzies and Dutia, unpublished results).</p>

<title>iSDTP at the Vestibular Afferent Synapse</title>
<p>The iSTDP profiles for vestibular synaptic plasticity resemble the anti-Hebbian STDP profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Roberts1">[27]</xref> observed in Purkinje-like cells of mormyrid electrosensory lobe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Bell1">[54]</xref> and spiny stellate cells of cerebral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Egger1">[55]</xref>. Here however the learning rule is heterosynaptic, with plasticity depending upon the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, instead of homosynaptic, depending upon the timing of excitatory inputs and post-synaptic action potentials. This independence from post-synaptic firing distinguishes heterosynaptic iSTDP from proposed mechanisms for plasticity at mossy-fiber synapses on DCN neurons, that require a period of cerebellar inhibition of the DCN neurons sufficient to silence them, followed by a rebound depolarization and calcium influx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh2">[20]</xref>. For VOR gain adaptation any requirement for silencing of the post-synaptic neurons is problematic, since MVN neurons are themselves directly involved in gaze holding and VOR execution. If vestibular synaptic strength is regulated through iSTDP interactions in distal dendritic compartments, as suggested above, this may be potentially dissociated from somatic spiking. The electrophysiological properties of MVN cell dendrites, and the extent to which somatic spikes propagate antidromically, are presently unknown. While the precise cellular mechanisms remain to be investigated, the independence of the iSTDP learning rule from post-synaptic spiking offers a potential solution to this difficulty.</p>
<p>A further advantage of the iSTDP learning rule is that it successfully predicts the effects of more complex induction protocols on vestibular synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g004">Figs. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g007">7</xref>). The PR protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Pugh2">[20]</xref> designed to mimic the pattern of inputs to DCN neurons presumed to occur during eyeblink conditioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Medina1">[56]</xref>, is substantially more complex than the pairing of single EPSCs and simulated IPSCs which represents the simplest implementation of the correlational rule. Predictions from modeling of iSTDP interactions between EPSCs and membrane hyperpolarisation closely match the effects on vestibular neurons of both the PR induction protocol, and of variants with post-pulse depolarizations. This suggests that iSTDP interactions may be generally applicable and predict the modulation of vestibular synapse strength by convergent inputs under a variety of conditions.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, we did not observe LTP that was predicted to occur at conjoint stimulation delays outside the time window that produces LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g002">Fig 2</xref>). Since the predicted LTP is always much smaller than the observed LTD, it is possible that the protocols used here were not sensitive enough to detect it. However, we were also unable to demonstrate explicit LTP with a more complex protocol specifically designed to induce it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g006">Figs. 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g007">7</xref>), though this result needs confirming with a larger number of observations. It is unlikely that the vestibular synapse is incapable of expressing LTP, since even a slight imbalance between LTD and LTP would lead to either to weight saturation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Kubota1">[46]</xref>), or at best to a degraded VOR gain transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g011">Fig. 11</xref>). Moreover, the effects of protocols PR-0,1 and 2 were well predicted by an iSTDP rule that assumed balanced LTD and LTP, such that EPSPs coinciding with membrane depolarization tended to counteract the LTD induced by EPSPs coinciding with membrane hyperpolarisation. One way in which this implicit LTP could be reconciled with absence of explicit LTP is if the synaptic weights <italic>in vitro</italic> were close to their maximum values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g012">Fig. 12</xref>). This possibility requires further experimental investigation, for example by first reducing the weights with protocol PR-0 prior to testing for LTP with protocol PR-3.</p>
<p>In addition, further work is necessary to determine if the proposed iSTDP mechanism is present specifically in flocculus target neurons (FTNs). In the rodent MVN, only a proportion (∼5–20%) of neurons are FTNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Sekirnjak1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Babalian1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Beraneck1">[58]</xref>, and recent evidence indicates that different MVN cell types have importantly different properties (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Bagnall2">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Bagnall3">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Gittis2">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Gittis3">[62]</xref>). Although the protocols used here did not indicate any qualitative differences with respect to LTD induction, the issue requires more systematic investigation.</p>
<p>While specific iSTDP interactions between vestibular and Purkinje cell inputs may regulate vestibular synapse strength in the context of VOR gain adaptation, these results also raise the possibility of interactions with other, non-cerebellar inhibitory inputs that induce membrane hyperpolarisation co-incident with vestibular EPSCs. Indeed recent work has shown that inhibitory interneurons activated by vestibular afferents provide an important feed-forward inhibition to second-order vestibular neurons, particularly type B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Biesdorf1">[63]</xref>. In contrast to the cerebellar inhibitory inputs however, the feed-forward inhibition is not thought to be modulated by eye-movement signals and so is unlikely to be involved in VOR gain adaptation. Instead, it may be hypothesized that iSTDP interactions with feed-forward inhibitory inputs could induce a steady, activity dependent homeostatic LTD at the vestibular synapses. This is consistent with our suggestion that in the absence of such inputs <italic>in vitro</italic>, vestibular synapses may drift to be close to their maximal strength in slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). The role of such possible interactions between vestibular and non-cerebellar inhibitory inputs remains to be determined.</p>

Consistent with this, mRNA and protein for NR2C and NR2D NMDA receptor subunits have been demonstrated in vestibular neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Lin1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Karavanova1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Sans1">[75]</xref>. When incorporated with NR1 subunits, these subunits confer a low sensitivity to the NMDA receptor to Mg<sup>2+</sup> block and allow significant inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> current even at relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Kuner1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Anchisi1">[77]</xref>. Furthermore, NR2C subunit expression in MVN neurons appears between P7 and P10 and increases to reach adult values after P21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Sans1">[75]</xref>. This is in line with our observation that LTD of the vestibular EPSC does not occur in juvenile MVN neurons, but is only seen in young adult cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013182-g005">5</xref>). Thus iSTDP-dependent LTD requires the post-natal maturation of NMDA receptor expression after eye-opening, in a similar way to the vision-dependent effects on plasticity at the vestibular nerve synapse observed by Grassi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013182-Grassi2">[33]</xref>. In juveniles therefore the naïve system appears to favor the maintenance of vestibular synapses, while the correlative rule for experience-dependent adjustment of vestibular synapse strength develops only after eye-opening. The cellular mechanisms involved in the implementation of the iSTDP rule remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these results suggest the cerebellum alters the strength of vestibular synapses on MVN neurons through hetero-synaptic, anti-Hebbian iSTDP. The iSTDP rule predicts the LTD of vestibular synapses when excitatory and inhibitory inputs interact within a precise temporal window, and also predicts the effects of more complex trains of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Since the iSTDP rule does not depend on post-synaptic firing, it suggests a possible mechanism for VOR adaptation without compromising gaze-holding and VOR performance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
