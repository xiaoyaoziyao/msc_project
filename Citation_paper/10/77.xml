However, less effort has been devoted to investigating the evolutionary aspects of such mechanisms. In this paper we explore the issue of temporal neural computation from an evolutionary point of view, using a genetic simulation of the evolutionary development of neural systems. We evolve neural systems in an environment with selective pressure based on mate finding, and examine the temporal aspects of the evolved systems. In repeating evolutionary sessions, there was a significant increase during evolution in the mutual information between the evolved agent's temporal neural representation and the external environment. In ten different simulated evolutionary sessions, there was an increased effect of time -related neural ablations on the agents' fitness. These results suggest that in some fitness landscapes the emergence of temporal elements in neural computation is almost inevitable. Future research using similar evolutionary simulations may shed new light on various biological mechanisms.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the DIP grant for compositionality.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many current Neural Network models assume that all semantic information is contained in the spike rates of the neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-JHertz1">[1]</xref>. But there is also evidence that the fine temporal structure of the spiking activity may play a role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Eckhorn1">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Most recent research on time - dependent neural computation has focused on examining the computing power of temporal neural computation models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Maass1">[3]</xref> or on uncovering biological evidence that supports the claim of precise neural activity timing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Villa1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Abeles1">[5]</xref>. However, from an evolutionary point of view, little is known about the circumstances that may have prompted the evolution of temporally based neural computing systems. One such circumstance could have been the need for a binding mechanism, as presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Bienenstock1">[6]</xref>, which posits a compositionality model where synfire chain waves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Abeles2">[7]</xref> represent semantic atoms and synchronization of activity in different chains serves as a binding mechanism. Recently, it has been shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Abeles3">[8]</xref> through simulations that such a model is actually possible and is able to solve simple binding problems. Additional factors that might have led to a preference for temporal spiking elements over the course of evolution are related to network construction mechanisms. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Levy1">[9]</xref> it was shown that in a fully connected cell assembly, where synaptic plasticity is time-dependent, a small number of neural clusters are formed, thus splitting the cell assembly into chained pools, and producing a distributed and synchronized firing pattern. This finding and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Hertz1">[10]</xref> show that a minimal temporal structure- based spiking activity can be learned in a self – organizing process.</p><p>In this study we examine whether temporal computing elements can emerge in small networks during evolution. It is based on evolutionary simulations of neurocontrolled virtual organisms that evolve in an environment with selective pressure for successful mate-finding. The virtual organism's reproduction model is based biological, genetic and neural development principles. The evolutionary simulations are based on a chromosome pattern that translates to a gene-protein network of a cellular organism controlled by a neural system. The chromosome model permits reproduction of an offspring by combining two chromosomes. During each evolutionary session selective pressure based on mate finding is placed on a population of neurocontrolled organisms. The results are based on the analysis of temporal neural coding in the evolved organisms.</p><p>Typically, in evolutionary simulation experiments a population of virtual organisms is evolved using a genetic algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Holland1">[11]</xref> over many generations to best survive in a given environment. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Ruppin1">[12]</xref> for a full introduction), while there is full control of the environment and conditions, complete knowledge of the organisms' behavior, the network architecture, and dynamics. The present study is based on a complex, biologically plausible evolutionary model we presented elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Yerushalmi1">[13]</xref> that has been shown to evolve other unrelated biological phenomena such as gene order functionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Yerushalmi2">[14]</xref>.

In order to make the evolved neural mechanisms biologically relevant, an effort was made to keep the model and the environmental definitions as unbiased and biologically plausible as possible. Each evolutionary session was initialized by placing a random population in an environment. Each agent was randomly set to be either male or female, and could move in the environment by using its sensor, motor and hidden neurons. In order to encourage the agents to develop neural networks, the agents were given a life span period proportional to the different cellular types they developed: a sensory neuron, a motor neuron, a hidden neuron, a dendrite, an axon, a synapse. Hence, a maximal time span was given to every agent that possessed a “basic” neural network, which was defined as a neural network with at least one instance of each of the six elements mentioned above. Since the system was defined as having only dendrite-to-axon synapses, a “basic” network could also be seen as a network that included at least a motor, a hidden and a sensory neuron and one synapse. The agents were removed from the environment after completing their life span period.</p><p>The population size was restricted to a predefined range by removing the eldest agents from the environment when the number of agents reached the upper bound (due to crowding), and by producing new individuals in the environment when the number of agents reached the lower bound.</p><p>In order to evolve neural based behavior, a “mating rule” was introduced in the environment, where two agents that contacted each other reproduced offspring according to the reproduction equation presented earlier. Accordingly, we expected the agents to develop neural mechanisms that would maximize their contacts with agents of the opposite sex.</p><p>As a first step, we tested for changes in the agents' behavior along generations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001863-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the percentage of reproduction resulting from agent contact rose over generations. However, such a development could be a result of collective competence unrelated to individual neural mechanisms. In order to insure that this phenomenon was also based on individual competence, we saved the chromosome data from 200 randomly chosen agents during evolution, and tested each chromosome phenotype in a different environment that had two kinds of static objects: one with a “mate” odor, and the other with a “self” odor. The findings show a significant improvement over evolution in the average proportion of agent-mate contacts each 100 generations. (P = 1.80×10<sup>−3</sup>, r = 0.58, Spearman's Rank Correlation Test). Thus, during the evolutionary session there was some improvement in individual fitness.</p><fig id="pone-0001863-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001863.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Behavioral development during evolution.</title><p>Red: Proportion of reproduction triggered by agent contacts (as opposed to reproductions initiated by the system when the number of agents was too low).

Such a conclusion would also derive that there is no effect of the mutual information measures on the agents' fitness. In the next experiment we tested whether in these cases the information had any effect on the agents' performance; namely, whether there was any correlation between the mutual information in the previous analysis and actual performance. Again, the chromosomes were re-developed into agents, and placed one at a time in an environment similar to the previous one. The agents could move in the environment freely as their neural activity was measured. Additionally, in this test we also calculated <italic>grade</italic>:i.e., the proportion of contacts each agent had with a ‘mate’ object, divided by the ‘mate’ object frequency. We calculated the Spearman rank correlations between the mutual information measure and the grades of 1156 randomly selected agents.

Numerous studies have also reported precise time relations among spikes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Gray1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Abeles4">[35]</xref>. Our results combine these two findings and show that in some evolutionary models, such as the one presented here, evolvement of precise time relations among spikes is almost inevitable.</p><p>In our preliminary experiments our null hypothesis was that different information measures based on precise time relations among spikes would not increase during evolution. We were able to show that this null hypotheses could be rejected both in static and dynamic environments in the conditions defined by our model. We also showed a connection between the cross correlation based measure and the fitness of the agents, suggesting that the increase shown previously was due to evolutionary forces. Subsequently, we showed that ablation of precise time neurotransmission abilities has an increasing effect over evolution in each independent evolutionary session of our model.</p><p>Although both dynamic and static experiments showed a significant increase in the time dependent measures, the different rate based measure results highlight the importance of environmental coding, (which in our case was dynamic <italic>{d<sub>l</sub>,d<sub>r</sub>}</italic> vs. static <italic>{s<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>}</italic>), and not only the importance of the neural coding, (which in our case was <italic>ccor</italic> vs <italic>ccorlag</italic> vs <italic>lag</italic> vs <italic>r</italic>). We believe this feature has been unjustly overlooked in electrophysiological studies examining the mutual information between the external environment and neural code. Even in the mutual information experiments presented here, we believe much more significant results could be obtained after finding an optimal environmental code instead of querying simply whether there are more mates on the right or left side of the agent.</p><p>The results raise questions as to why the evolutionary sessions appeared to prefer basing the agents' dynamics on spike timing and not only on rate components. This could be a result of the dominance of a neural solution that is also based on spike timing or a biological infrastructure that enables faster convergence to such a solution. However, some trivial evolutionary mechanisms or experimental artifacts could also generate such a development. These include the following: (i) definition of the environment in which the evolutionary session took place as one where small time scale reactions are a significant component of the agent's fitness. (ii) mutual information growth that is a by- product of other processes and does not contribute to individual fitness directly. (iii) a coincidental evolutionary case that has no implications regarding the general evolutionary landscape. By considering the τ<italic><sub>m</sub></italic> value presented in our experiments we avoid definitions that could lead to the first case. Our latter experimental results disconfirm the second case. The third case does not seem possible in the light of repeated results in the experiments from different evolutionary sessions.</p><p>It should be noted that in this study the results are inferred from the average population values or from values obtained from randomly selected individuals. A more detailed investigation should be based on larger samples of particular phylogenies, especially to provide estimates of the population variance during evolution. The results presented here do not address the question of whether the population is homogeneous or whether there are only a few very successful individuals in the population yielding a greater fitness average.</p><p>Naturally, the relevance of the results in terms of biology is based on the applicability of the model. Although the model used is complex, we have tried to avoid pinning its parameters to certain predefined values, and most of the model parameters are self adaptive (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001863-t002">Table 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001863-t003">3</xref>), making the conditions defined by the model biologically plausible. It is also likely that other, unrelated biological results found by a previous version of the model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001863-Yerushalmi2">[14]</xref> contribute to the model's biological applicability. However, further research should be conducted by simplifying the model and deriving the essential model components that contribute to the development of time dependent neural elements.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0001863-t003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001863.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Range limits of the different chromosome parameters in the experiments.</title></caption><!--===== Grouping alternate versions of objects =====--><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0001863-t003-3" mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001863.t003" xlink:type="simple"/><table><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">θ<italic><sup>a</sup></italic>, θ<italic><sup>p</sup></italic></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Threshold values were limited to a range of (<italic>−2n,+2n</italic>) where <italic>n</italic> is the number of genes in the chromosome.
