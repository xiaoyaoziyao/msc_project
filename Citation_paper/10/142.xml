          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Dendritic morphology largely determines patterns of synaptic connectivity and electrochemical properties of a neuron. Neurons display a myriad diversity of dendritic geometries which serve as a basis for functional classification. Several types of molecules have recently been identified which regulate dendrite morphology by acting at the levels of transcriptional regulation, direct interactions with the cytoskeleton and organelles, and cell surface interactions. Although there has been substantial progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of dendrite morphogenesis, the specification of class-specific dendritic arbors remains largely unexplained. Furthermore, the presence of numerous regulators suggests that they must work in concert. However, presently, few genetic pathways regulating dendrite development have been defined.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>turtle</italic> belongs to an evolutionarily conserved class of immunoglobulin superfamily members found in the nervous systems of diverse organisms. We demonstrate that Turtle is differentially expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> da neurons. Moreover, MARCM analyses reveal Turtle acts cell autonomously to exert class specific effects on dendritic growth and/or branching in da neuron subclasses. Using transgenic overexpression of different Turtle isoforms, we find context-dependent, isoform-specific effects on mediating dendritic branching in class II, III and IV da neurons. Finally, we demonstrate via chromatin immunoprecipitation, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry analyses that Turtle expression is positively regulated by the Cut homeodomain transcription factor and via genetic interaction studies that Turtle is downstream effector of Cut-mediated regulation of da neuron dendrite morphology.</p>

          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Our findings reveal that Turtle proteins differentially regulate the acquisition of class-specific dendrite morphologies. In addition, we have established a transcriptional regulatory interaction between Cut and Turtle, representing a novel pathway for mediating class specific dendrite development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Neuronal dendrites occur in a staggering array of morphological conformations ranging from short, singular processes to large, highly complex structures. As dendrites form the vast majority of the post-synaptic structure, the architecture of dendritic arbors largely determines the synaptic connectivity of neuronal networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Williams1">[1]</xref>. In fact, dendritic arbors have been shown to undergo dynamic remodeling in response to electrochemical signaling, which could represent a morphological correlate of cognitive processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-ShojiKasai1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Wu1">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, the shape of dendrites alters the cable properties of the neuron, providing a mechanism for further modulation of electrochemical signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Vetter1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Segev1">[6]</xref>. Although it is known that the spatial distribution of dendritic geometries follows certain well-described principles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Rose1">[7]</xref>, the molecular interactions governing dendrite development remain largely unknown.</p>
      <p><italic>Drosophila</italic> dendritic arborization (da) neurons provide an exceptional model to study dendrite morphogenesis as they grow elaborate dendritic arbors that occupy a nearly two-dimensional space directly beneath the larval cuticle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber1">[8]</xref>. Investigations using da neurons as a model system have revealed a vast array of molecular mechanisms governing class specific dendrite development and dendritic field specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Corty1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Jan1">[10]</xref>. Despite having a similar profile of cell-fate selector genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Campuzano1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Jan2">[12]</xref> these da neurons can be subdivided into four unique morphological classes based on distinct patterns of dendritic arborization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber1">[8]</xref>. The diversity of da neuron dendritic arbors suggests that each class may have a unique profile of molecules and signaling pathways at work producing the characteristic morphologies. For example, the class specific distribution of the transcription factors Cut and Knot partially explains the morphological differences observed between class III and class IV da neurons by differentially regulating the actin- and tubulin-based cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Crozatier1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-JinushiNakao1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) genes encode a large family of evolutionarily conserved proteins that function as cell-adhesion molecules, ligands, and receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Barclay1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Vogel1">[17]</xref>. IgSF molecules have been directly implicated in regulating both axonal guidance and dendritic arborization. For example, the receptor Roundabout (Robo) prevents axons from crossing the CNS midline by detecting the soluble ligand Slit, which is secreted by midline cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Kidd1">[18]</xref>. Moreover, a number of studies have demonstrated roles for the IgSF receptors Robo and Frazzled/Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) in mediating the development of dendrites in both PNS and CNS neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Furrer1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Godenschwege1">[22]</xref>. In addition, several recent studies have demonstrated a requirement of the IgSF member Dscam in mediating dendritic self-avoidance, a form of dendritic tiling, in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Matthews1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Hughes1">[25]</xref> and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Fuerst1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>turtle</italic> (<italic>tutl</italic>) encodes an evolutionarily conserved member of the Tutl/Dasm1/IgSF9 subfamily of IgSF proteins. Previous studies found that <italic>tutl</italic> is required for bilateral coordinated movement, however no evident defects were observed with respect to CNS morphologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Bodily1">[27]</xref>. Recent work has identified additional roles for <italic>tutl</italic> in the specification of axon and dendrite morphology. Specifically, <italic>tutl</italic> was reported to function in dendritic and axonal self-avoidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Ferguson1">[29]</xref> and also in proper targeting of axon projections in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-AlAnzi1">[30]</xref>. Analyses of the murine Tutl homolog, Dasm1, have revealed specific expression in the developing hippocampus, however loss of function studies have generated conflicting results. RNAi-based studies implicate Dasm1 in mediating dendritic arborization and synapse maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Shi1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Shi2">[32]</xref>, whereas in Dasm1 knockout mice no evident defects in dendrite development or synaptogenesis were observed potentially due to functional redundancy of Dasm1 with the highly related <italic>IgSF9b</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Mishra1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we describe novel functional roles for <italic>tutl</italic> in the development of class specific da neuron dendritic morphologies. Consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref>, our analyses revealed expression of Tutl in all da neuron subclasses with localization to cell bodies, dendrites, and axons, however, we further demonstrate differential expression levels of Tutl among da neuron subclasses. Loss of function analyses revealed differential and cell autonomous requirements for <italic>tutl</italic> in mediating aspects of class specific da neuron dendrite morphogenesis. In class III and IV da neurons which exhibit more complex dendritic arbors, loss of <italic>tutl</italic> primarily resulted in a significant decrease in total dendritic length and dendritic field coverage, whereas in class II da neurons, which exhibit simpler dendritic arbors, loss of <italic>tutl</italic> primarily resulted in a significant decrease in branch number. A previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref> reported defects in class I da neuron branching and in dendritic self-avoidance in class IV da neurons. In sharp contrast to these findings, our analyses reveal that <italic>tutl</italic> is largely dispensable for class I da neuron dendrite morphogenesis via MARCM and trans-allelic studies, and moreover, we found no significant defects in dendritic self-avoidance among class IV da neurons. Interestingly, gain of function studies revealed different Tutl isoforms exert isoform-specific effects on terminal dendritic branching of class II, III and IV da neurons. As the Tutl expression pattern and loss of function phenotypes resemble that previously reported for the Cut homeodomain transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber2">[34]</xref>, we examined the potential regulatory relationship between Tutl and Cut and found that Cut functions as a transcriptional activator of Tutl in da neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that Tutl function is required as a downstream effector of Cut-mediated regulation of da neuron dendrite development.</p>

        <title>Tutl is differentially expressed in da neuron subclasses</title>
        <p>Previous studies first identified <italic>tutl</italic> as a novel IgSF member required for flight and coordinated body movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Bodily1">[27]</xref>. This study focused on the analysis of <italic>tutl</italic> expression and function in the CNS, however no detectable role was discovered for <italic>tutl</italic> in mediating axon pathfinding or nervous system morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Bodily1">[27]</xref> and thus the functional role of <italic>tutl</italic> in mediating these behavioral processes remains unclear. We initiated our analyses of <italic>tutl</italic> based on the identification of a P{GawB} enhancer trap insertion at the upstream limit of the <italic>tutl</italic> genomic locus (henceforth referred to a <italic>tutl-GAL4</italic>) which revealed a differential expression pattern in PNS da neurons. In order to quantify the <italic>tutl</italic> differential expression, confocal image stacks of <italic>tutl-GAL4,UAS-mCD8::GFP</italic> expressing da neurons were collected from the dorsal cluster of third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). We focused our analysis of Tutl expression on the dorsal cluster of da neurons owing to the fact that representative neurons from each of the four da neuron subclasses are present in this cluster. Projections of these images were then subjected to quantitative analyses of GFP expression levels via pixel densitometry. These analyses revealed the highest level of <italic>tutl-GAL4</italic> driven GFP expression in the dorsal-most class III da neuron (ddaF) followed by the class IV da neuron (ddaC) and the ventral-most class III da neuron (ddaA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Intermediate levels of expression were observed in the class II da neuron (ddaB) and very low levels were observed in the two class I da neurons (ddaD and ddaE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Our analyses further revealed <italic>tutl-GAL4</italic> driven GFP expression in other sensory neurons of the dorsal cluster.</p>

        <p>To investigate the Tutl protein expression within the da neurons, immuno-histochemistry (IHC) was performed on whole-mount third instar larval filets using two distinct polyclonal anti-Tutl antibodies both of which produced nearly identical expression patterns. Consistent with the <italic>tutl-GAL4,UASmCD8::GFP</italic> expression pattern, immunofluorescence analyses revealed differential levels of Tutl protein expression in da neuron cell bodies with highest levels in class III and class IV da neurons, moderate levels in class II and low levels in class I da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g001">Fig. 1C,E</xref>). In addition, we observed Tutl localization to both da neuron dendrites and axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Tutl antibody specificity was validated by the absence of Tutl protein expression in homozygous mutant <italic>tutl<sup>c00018</sup></italic> MARCM clones (see below) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g001">Fig. 1E,F</xref>). Moreover, these analyses indicate the <italic>tutl<sup>c00018</sup></italic> mutation produces a protein null allele. In summary, both the <italic>tutl-GAL4</italic> and Tutl protein expression data consistently reveal a class specific distribution of <italic>tutl</italic> gene product in da neurons.</p>
        <p>The differential expression levels of Tutl protein in da neuron subclasses is similar to that previously reported for the Cut transcription factor which has been shown to exert differential effects on class specific da neuron dendrite morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber2">[34]</xref>. As such, we hypothesized that <italic>tutl</italic> may also play a functional role in mediating class specific da neuron dendrite morphogenesis. The <italic>tutl</italic> gene occupies a large genomic locus in which a number of available P-element insertions have been identified ranging from weak to strong hypomorphic alleles. For our study we selected a very strong, novel hypomorphic allele, <italic>tutl<sup>c00018</sup></italic>, produced by a P{PB} insertion in the <italic>tutl</italic> gene. To validate the specificity of the <italic>tutl<sup>c00018</sup></italic> allele to disruptions in the <italic>tutl</italic> locus, we conducted complementation analyses with the previously characterized <italic>tutl<sup>01085</sup></italic> hypomorphic allele and with a chromosomal deficiency (<italic>Df(2L)ed-dp</italic>) which completely removes the <italic>tutl</italic> locus. These complementation analyses revealed <italic>tutl<sup>c00018</sup></italic> specifically disrupts the <italic>tutl</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022611.s004">Table S1</xref>). To further validate these findings, we performed rescue analyses of <italic>tutl<sup>c00018</sup></italic> by expressing the <italic>UAS-tutl<sup>AT02763</sup></italic> transgene under control of the pan-neuronal <italic>elavGAL4,UAS-mCD8::GFP</italic> driver. Consistent with previous studies in which this transgene rescued another strong <italic>tutl</italic> allele, <italic>tutl<sup>ex383</sup></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-AlAnzi1">[30]</xref>, we found that this transgene completely rescued adult viability providing further evidence that the lethality observed in <italic>tutl<sup>c00018</sup></italic> homozygous mutants is due to specific disruptions in the <italic>tutl</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022611.s005">Table S2</xref>). The <italic>tutl<sup>c00018</sup></italic> allele is homozygous lethal during the first larval instar, making studies using class specific <italic>GAL4</italic> reporters in the <italic>tutl</italic> mutant background difficult as da neuron dendrites have not fully elaborated until late in the third larval instar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Williams2">[35]</xref>.

        <title>Tutl functions to promote dendritic growth and branching in class III da neurons</title>
        <p>As we observed the highest levels of Tutl expression in class III da neurons, we initiated loss of function (LOF) phenotypic analyses focusing on this class of da neurons. Class III neurons are highly complex in terms of length and branching and are characterized by the presence of short “spine-like” terminal processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber1">[8]</xref>. Overall, we generated a total of 24 <italic>tutl</italic> mutant class III da neuron clones, providing representation of each of the five characterized class III da neurons. As compared to wild-type, <italic>tutl</italic> mutant class III da neurons displayed a reduction in both dendritic branching complexity and field coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g002">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). Overall, <italic>tutl</italic> mutant class III da neurons showed a significant reduction in both total dendritic length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) and total number of dendritic terminals, which is a measure of dendritic branching complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>) as compared with wild-type controls. The reduction in overall dendritic length relative to wild-type averaged approximately 34% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>) and was characterized by a “compacted” appearance in which primary dendrites do not extend the same distance as wild-type control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g002">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). Cell autonomous <italic>tutl</italic> mutation also reduced the number of dendritic branches in class III neurons, as indicated by a reduction in the number of dendritic terminals. The reduction in total number of dendritic terminals relative to wild-type averaged approximately 22% in <italic>tutl</italic> mutant neurons and was characterized by a lower incidence of terminal branching as compared with wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). As numerous short, “spine-like” processes characterize class III neurons, we sought to determine whether the <italic>tutl</italic> mutation affects these fine terminal processes. To this end, we exclusively quantified the length of terminal “spine-like” branches of <italic>tutl</italic> mutant class III neurons and compared the results to wild-type. These analyses revealed a modest, but significant reduction in the mean length of terminal branches in <italic>tutl</italic> mutants (∼5 µm) as compared to wild-type controls (∼7 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>tutl</italic> is required for development and extension of these terminal “spine-like” protrusions.</p>

Qualitatively, <italic>tutl</italic> mutant class IV neurons appeared smaller than wild-type, with shorter dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g003">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). Overall, <italic>tutl</italic> mutant class IV da neuron clones showed a significant reduction in total dendritic length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), however the number of dendritic terminals was not significantly different between <italic>tutl</italic> mutant and wild-type MARCM clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). The average reduction in overall dendritic length among all subtypes of <italic>tutl</italic> mutant class IV neurons was approximately 26% and was characterized by reduced dendritic field coverage relative to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). To further quantify the nature of the reduction in overall dendritic length in <italic>tutl</italic> MARCM clones, dendritic field area and branch order analyses were conducted. The total area covered by the dendritic arbor, as measured by the polygon method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber1">[8]</xref>, was significantly decreased in <italic>tutl</italic> mutant neurons compared with wild-type neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>).

        <title><italic>tutl</italic> is largely dispensable for class I da neuron dendrite morphogenesis</title>
        <p>Previous studies suggested that <italic>tutl</italic> is required to restrain dendrite branching in class I da neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref>. To determine if this phenotype was observed in <italic>tutl<sup>c00018</sup></italic> mutants, we conducted MARCM LOF analyses in class I neurons. In contrast to previous findings, our analyses revealed no qualitative or statistically significant quantitative defects in class I da neuron dendrite morphologies in <italic>tutl<sup>c00018</sup></italic> mutant clones relative to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g005">Fig. 5A–D</xref>).

As these findings stand in sharp contrast to previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref>, we conducted additional trans-allelic studies between <italic>tutl<sup>c00018</sup></italic> and three other previously characterized <italic>tutl</italic> alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Bodily1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-AlAnzi1">[30]</xref> to determine if the phenotypes observed were due to allelic variation. In total, we examined seven allelic combinations, including analyses of the previously reported <italic>tutl<sup>23</sup></italic> mutant allele which had been implicated in disrupting class I dendrite morphology. Moreover, we extended previous analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref> by performing systematic studies of all three class I da neurons (ddaD, ddaE, and vpda). In general these trans-allelic studies failed to reveal any significant defects in either the number of dendritic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>) or total dendritic length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>) among individual class I da neuron subtypes. In those isolated allelic combinations where we did observe an effect on either terminals or length, the effects were a reduction relative to controls which is again in opposition to previously reported results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g005">Fig. 5E,F</xref>).

In contrast, overexpression of the membrane bound HL01565 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>) and LD28224 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>) isoforms promoted dendritic branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>) relative to wild-type controls. Quantitative analyses of overall dendritic length however revealed no significant effect following overexpression of any of the four Tutl isoforms examined relative to control suggesting that the predominant effect on dendritic branching was at the level of the fine terminal branches of class IV da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>). To analyze putative isoform-specific effects on class II and III neurons, we used the class I-III <italic>GAL4<sup>C161</sup>,UAS-mCD8::GFP</italic> driver. In contrast to class IV da neurons, overexpression of the soluble AT02763 and GH15753 isoforms in class II da neurons (ldaA) resulted in increased terminal dendritic branching relative to controls, whereas overexpression of the membrane-bound HL01565 and LD28224 isoforms had no significant effect on class II dendritic branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g007">Fig. 7A–D</xref>). Moreover, quantification of total dendritic length revealed no significant change with overexpression of any of the isoforms (data not shown) indicating the primary effect was at the level of dendritic branching. In class III da neurons (v'pda), overexpression of AT02763 led to an increase in terminal dendritic branching, whereas overexpression of GH15753 caused a decrease in terminal branching relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g007">Fig. 7E–H</xref>). No significant effects on dendritic branching were observed with overexpression of HL01565 or LD28224 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g007">Fig. 7H</xref>) nor did we observe any significant change in overall dendritic length of v'pda neurons with any of the isoforms (data not shown). These isoform-specific results contrast with previous analyses of the RE40452 isoform in which no dendritic defects were reported upon overexpression in class II or III da neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref>. In contrast to the isoform-specific overexpression effects observed in class II-IV da neurons, dendritic branching and overall dendritic length were unaffected in class I da neurons relative to controls consistent with previous findings for RE40452 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022611.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that Tutl can exert complex, context-dependent, isoform-specific effects on class-specific da neuron dendrite branching.</p>

        <title>Tutl functions as a downstream effector of Cut-mediated regulation of da neuron dendrite morphogenesis</title>
        <p>To determine the potential functional significance of Cut transcriptional regulation of Tutl expression, we examined whether Tutl was required to mediate previously described effects of Cut on da neuron dendrite morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber2">[34]</xref>. Previous studies demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of Cut in class I da neurons resulted in a dramatic increase in dendritic branching complexity characterized by increased overall dendritic length and the development of numerous “spine-like” dendritic filopodia emanating from the primary dendritic branches highly similar to those normally observed in class III da neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber2">[34]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g009">Fig. 9A–D</xref>). To assess the role of Tutl as a potential downstream effector in mediating the Cut overexpression phenotype, we phenotypically compared class I da neurons ectopically overexpressing Cut with class I neurons in which we ectopically overexpressed Cut and reduced <italic>tutl</italic> gene function by 50% via introduction of <italic>tutl<sup>ex383</sup></italic> allele. The <italic>tutl<sup>ex383</sup></italic> allele was selected for these analyses as it has previously been demonstrated to be a molecular and genetic null allele that is embryonically lethal and is characterized by a 11,430 bp genomic deletion which disrupts all known <italic>tutl</italic> isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-AlAnzi1">[30]</xref>. We reasoned that if the ectopic Cut overexpression phenotype in class I neurons is dependent upon Tutl activation, then removing Tutl gene function by 50% may lead to a suppression of the Cut-induced phenotype. Indeed, these analyses revealed strong suppression of the Cut ectopic overexpression phenotype upon introduction of one copy of the <italic>tutl<sup>ex383</sup></italic> allele in all class I da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g009">Fig. 9E,F</xref>). The Tutl-mediated phenotypic suppression was particularly pronounced with respect to the number of dendritic terminals in which there was an average reduction of 65% in ddaD, 36% in ddaE, and 46% in vpda relative to the average number of terminals observed in Cut ectopically overexpressing class I da neurons alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g009">Fig. 9G</xref>). Quantitative analyses of Tutl-mediated suppression was also statistically significant with respect to overall dendritic length, albeit to a lesser extent than the suppression effects on the number of dendritic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022611-g009">Fig. 9H</xref>). These data reveal that Tutl functions as a downstream effector of Cut in directing da neuron dendrite development and suggest Tutl is particularly required to promote terminal dendritic branching.</p>

      <p>The establishment of normal dendritic morphology is critical in the formation of functional neural networks. Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PNS as a model, this study demonstrates differential expression of Tutl in da neuron subclasses and in addition reveals class-specific roles for Tutl in mediating both branching and extension of da neuron dendritic arbors. Gain of function studies reveal isoform-specific functions for Tutl in mediating terminal dendritic branching in class II, III, and IV da neurons. Furthermore, we have identified a novel transcriptional regulatory interaction between Tutl and Cut which reveals Tutl functions as a downstream target of Cut in mediating class specific da neuron dendrite development.</p>

        <title>Tutl differentially regulates class specific dendrite morphogenesis</title>
        <p>Analyses of <italic>tutl-GAL4</italic> and Tutl protein expression reveal differential expression levels in da neuron subclasses. The highest levels of <italic>tutl</italic> expression were observed in the more complex class III and IV da neurons, whereas moderate levels of Tutl expression were observed in class II da neurons, followed by weaker levels in class I da neurons. This differential expression pattern correlates with certain aspects of morphological complexity by which these neurons have been subdivided into classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber1">[8]</xref>. Specifically, the highest levels of Tutl expression correlate with the appearance of numerous, short processes extending from longer primary branches characteristic of class III and IV da neurons. Interestingly, the transcription factor Cut, a known regulator of dendritic growth, shows a strikingly similar pattern of expression in da neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber2">[34]</xref>. In addition to differential Tutl expression in da neuron cell bodies, we observed Tutl localization to dendrites and axons.</p>
        <p>Consistent with differential Tutl expression levels, we observed novel, cell autonomous and class specific defects in da neuron dendrite morphogenesis in <italic>tutl</italic> mutants. In class III da neurons, <italic>tutl</italic> mutation had objectively the most severe phenotype. A significant reduction in both branching and length was observed. Overall, class III da neurons mutant for <italic>tutl</italic> appeared smaller than their wild-type counterparts, with reduced branching and a reduction in number and length of their characteristic “spine-like” processes. In fact, by directly analyzing the length of terminal branches, we were able to show that <italic>tutl</italic> is required for full extension of these processes. MARCM analyses further revealed that class IV and class II da neurons each require Tutl for normal dendrite development. However, Tutl appears to regulate different aspects of morphogenesis in each class. For the complex, space-filling dendrites of class IV neurons, Tutl is required for dendrites to reach the appropriate length and establish full dendritic field coverage. In contrast, class II neurons require Tutl primarily to promote an appropriate number of branches.</p>
        <p>Many of the findings reported herein sharply contrast with those of a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref> in which a very similar set of experimental analyses were performed to investigate <italic>tutl</italic> function in da neurons. Among the differences in findings between studies is the question of <italic>tutl</italic> function in class I da neurons. A previous study implicated Tutl in restricting class I neuron dendritic branching complexity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref>, however, in general, we find that Tutl is largely dispensable for class I branching. In light of this striking difference, we repeated the previous studies using the same <italic>tutl<sup>23</sup></italic> mutant allele, and extended our analyses to incorporate additional novel allelic combinations and to include all three class I da neuron subtypes, however we were unable to reproduce the results of the previous study in any class I neuron. These results demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, Tutl function is largely dispensable for class I dendrite development and moreover, indicate that allelic variation is not a contributing factor to the observed differences between studies at least for class I neurons.</p>
        <p>In addition, we find that <italic>tutl</italic> exerts differential effects on class II and III dendritic branching and growth, whereas a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref>, using the <italic>tutl<sup>23</sup></italic> mutant allele, fails to reveal any significant effects on class II and III dendrite development. The basis for the differences observed herein and in the previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref> are not entirely clear, however, distinctions between studies include the use of independent <italic>tutl</italic> alleles, suggesting the potential of allelic variation with respect to phenotypic effects, as well as the fact that the previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref> focused exclusively on analyses of the class II ddaB and class III ddaA neurons, whereas the present study examined effects on class II or III neurons as a whole incorporating data from all subtypes within an individual class. Finally, while previous reports, using the <italic>tutl<sup>23</sup></italic> allele, suggested that Tutl was required to mediate dendritic self-avoidance in class IV da neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref>, we were unable to detect any significant effect on self-avoidance in our study. Ultimately, the basis for the observed phenotypic differences with respect to self-avoidance remain unclear, however may again potentially be attributable to allelic variation as independent alleles were used in each study.</p>

Consistent with these findings, a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref> reported an inhibition of class IV dendrite branching upon overexpression of the membrane bound Tutl RE40452 protein isoform and observed no defects in class I dendrite development upon Tutl RE40452 overexpression. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that overexpression of one of the previously characterized non-membrane bound Tutl isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-AlAnzi1">[30]</xref>, AT02763, inhibited terminal dendritic branching in class IV ddaC neurons, whereas overexpression of two membrane-bound Tutl isoforms, HL01565 and LD28224, promoted terminal dendritic branching in ddaC neurons. Given that both membrane bound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref> and soluble isoform overexpression inhibit class IV dendrite branching, whereas two other membrane bound isoforms promote branching there is no simple relationship in terms of soluble vs. trans-membrane Tutl isoforms in regulating class IV dendritic branching. Moreover, analyses of isoform-specific overexpression in class II and III da neurons further illustrate the complexity of Tutl function in mediating class specific dendritic branching. We found that overexpression of the soluble AT02763 and GH15753 isoforms in class II neurons promotes dendritic branching, whereas the membrane bound isoforms had no effect. In contrast, in class III neurons, overexpression of AT02763 and GH15753 isoforms in class III neurons had opposing effects on dendritic branching and again overexpression of the membrane bound forms had no effect. Consistent with these isoform-specific dendritic effects, a recent study demonstrated Tutl is required for normal CNS axon development and found that specific Tutl protein isoforms function as attractive axon guidance cues and promote axon branching and invasiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-AlAnzi1">[30]</xref>. This study demonstrated that overexpression of the membrane bound Tutl isoforms, HL01565 and LD28224, produced increased branching of ISNd motor neurons and sprouting of extra axonal processes in retinal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-AlAnzi1">[30]</xref> similar to the increased dendritic branching observed with overexpression of these Tutl isoforms in class IV da neurons. Moreover, this study demonstrated that soluble Tutl isoforms <italic>e.g.</italic> AT02763 can act as attractive axon guidance cues suggesting Tutl may also exhibit non-cell autonomous functions. However, overexpression of AT02763 in class IV da neurons led to inhibition of dendrite branching, suggesting a potential repulsive function for dendrite branching. Multiple functioning of a gene in both dendrite and axon growth is not without precedent. Another conserved IgSF member, the receptor Roundabout (Robo), first discovered for its regulation of axonal midline crossing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Kidd1">[18]</xref> has recently been shown as necessary for proper dendrite growth in the CNS and PNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Furrer1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Furrer2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Brierley1">[39]</xref>. In da neurons, Robo serves to restrict dendrite outgrowth, consistent with its role as a receptor of repulsive signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Dimitrova1">[20]</xref>. Collectively, these isoform-specific overexpression studies suggest that distinct Tutl isoforms may function in a complex context-dependent, cell-type specific manner to regulate dendritic branching morphology. It is possible that these various Tutl isoforms function in concert to “fine tune” class specific dendritic branching complexity.</p>

        <title>Regulation of Tutl-mediated dendrite morphogenesis</title>
        <p>The Cut homeodomain transcription factor was among the first genes shown to regulate class specific da neuron dendrite morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber2">[34]</xref>; however, to date the pathway through which it functions has been unknown. Although Cut was shown to influence the level of the Knot transcription factor expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-JinushiNakao1">[15]</xref>, a direct transcriptional relationship was not established. Our studies reveal that Tutl expression is positively regulated by the Cut. We demonstrate that Cut specifically binds to the <italic>tutl</italic> promoter sequence and acts as a transcriptional activator of Tutl expression in da neurons thereby identifying a novel transcriptional regulatory mechanism by which Tutl may mediate class-specific dendrite morphogenesis. Moreover, genetic interaction studies reveal that Tutl functions as a downstream effector of Cut-mediated regulation of a da neuron dendrite morphogenesis.</p>
        <p>Expression in class I da neurons, albeit at low levels, established that Cut is not the sole transcriptional regulator of Tutl since Cut is not normally detectable in class I neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber2">[34]</xref>. Consistent with this conclusion, we and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref> were able to detect Tutl protein expression in <italic>cut</italic> mutant MARCM clones. Collectively, these results indicate that Cut is not absolutely or solely required for Tutl expression in da neurons, however this does not preclude the potential that Cut contributes to transcriptional regulation of Tutl in da neurons as our data indicate. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Cut in class I da neurons leads to a significant increase in dendritic branching complexity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber2">[34]</xref>, whereas overexpression of Tutl in class I da neurons has no demonstrable effect on dendritic complexity, although our genetic interaction data reveal that Tutl is required for the observed Cut overexpression effects on class I dendritic complexity. These data suggest that Cut regulation of Tutl expression in class I neurons alone is insufficient to modulate dendritic morphology. This raises the possibility that Cut may positively regulate transcription of both Tutl and a putative partner molecule and thus the gain of function dendrite phenotype observed with ectopic Cut expression is the result of co-upregulation of both Tutl and an as yet unidentified Tutl<italic>-</italic>interacting protein. In support of this possibility are recent findings in which the deletion of the Tutl carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the longest known membrane bound Tutl isoform, RE40452, failed to produce specific loss of function defects in dendrite morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Long1">[28]</xref>, whereas <italic>tutl</italic> mutations in general produce defects suggesting that a potential partner, possibly a co-receptor, may be required to mediate downstream signaling essential for normal class specific dendrite development. Other members of the IgSF require <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> interactions to perform cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Brmmendorf1">[40]</xref>. For example, Robo-1 interacts with DCC via conserved cytoplasmic regions to neutralize the attractive effect of Netrin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Stein1">[41]</xref>. Furthermore, axonal repulsion following Slit binding appears to rely on interactions between Robo-1 and the intracellular phosphoprotein Enabled, which modulates cytoskeleton dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Bashaw1">[42]</xref>. As Cut has been shown to modulate dendritic complexity through the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-JinushiNakao1">[15]</xref>, it would be interesting to determine if potential cytoskeletal changes accompany <italic>tutl</italic> mutation. The differential changes based on neuronal class that <italic>tutl</italic> mutants display may manifest via different changes in the underlying dendritic cytoskeletal architecture.</p>

        <title>Evolutionarily conserved roles for Tutl- and Cut-related proteins in dendrite development</title>
        <p>The <italic>Drosophila tutl</italic> gene shares evolutionary homology with both humans (KIAA1355) and mice (Dasm1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Shi1">[31]</xref>. Our data indicate that Tutl is required for the differential regulation of class specific dendrite morphogenesis including dendritic extension and branching in class II-IV da neurons. These results are consistent with initial studies of Dasm1 which was found to be required in promoting dendrite outgrowth in cultured rat hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Shi1">[31]</xref>. However, later studies using a <italic>Dasm1</italic> genetic knockout did not observe the reported morphological defects, nor any overt behavioral phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Mishra1">[33]</xref>. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the presence of the co-expressed and closely related ortholog IgSF9b which may contribute to functional redundancy. As such, the contribution of mammalian homologs to mediating dendrite morphogenesis remains somewhat unclear. Future studies examining double knockout animals will likely be needed to fully elucidate the contribution of mammalian Tutl homologs to the regulation dendrite development. Due to its apparent lack of functional redundancy, further studies of the Tutl/Dasm1/KIAA1355 family of proteins using <italic>Drosophila</italic> may be a more direct route to further study this evolutionarily conserved gene family.</p>
        <p>Similar to Tutl, evolutionarily conserved Cut-related proteins in vertebrates have likewise been implicated in regulating class-specific dendrite morphogenesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that Cut-related protein, CDP, is functionally conserved in regulating dendrite morphogenesis as expression of CDP can rescue <italic>cut</italic> mutant dendritic defects in <italic>Drosophila</italic> da neurons and ectopic expression of CDP can phenocopy dendritic defects observed with ectopic Cut expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Grueber2">[34]</xref>. Moreover, a recent study has implicated the Cut-related, <italic>Cux1</italic> and <italic>Cux2</italic> genes, in regulating dendritic branching, spine morphology, and synaptogenesis in upper layer neurons of the cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Cubelos1">[43]</xref>. Moreover, these analyses implicate Cux1 and Cux2 in regulating subclass-specific mechanisms of synapse regulation providing further evidence for the evolutionarily conserved role of Cut-related proteins in the specification of class-specific dendritic morphologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0022611-Cubelos1">[43]</xref>. The fact that both Tutl- and Cut-related proteins display evolutionarily conserved roles in directing dendrite morphogenesis, coupled with our findings of a transcriptional regulatory interaction between Tutl and Cut, together with genetic interaction data indicating Tutl functions as a downstream of effector of Cut in da neuron dendrite morphogenesis suggests the potential that murine Cut homologs may also function in transcriptionally regulating the murine Tutl homolog, DASM1 and/or the highly orthologous IgSF9b. Ultimately, elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which Tutl and Cut mediate differential effects on dendrite development will require additional studies aimed at the identification of Tutl<italic>-</italic>interacting proteins which may be distinct in individual neuron subclasses and identification of other downstream effectors of Cut transcriptional regulation in da neurons.</p>
