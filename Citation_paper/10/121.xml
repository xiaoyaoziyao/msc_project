<abstract>
<p>A method to mitigate or possibly eliminate reproduction in farmed fish is highly demanded. The existing approaches have certain applicative limitations. So far, no immunization strategies affecting gonadal development in juvenile animals have been developed. We hypothesized that autoimmune mechanisms, occurring spontaneously in a number of diseases, could be induced by targeted immunization. We have asked whether the immunization against specific targets in a juvenile zebrafish gonad will produce an autoimmune response, and, consequently, disturbance in gonadal development. Gonadal soma-derived factor (Gsdf), growth differentiation factor (Gdf9), and lymphocyte antigen 75 (Cd205/Ly75), all essential for early gonad development, were targeted with 5 immunization tests. Zebrafish (n = 329) were injected at 6 weeks post fertilization, a booster injection was applied 15 days later, and fish were sampled at 30 days. We localized transcripts encoding targeted proteins by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, quantified expression of immune-, apoptosis-, and gonad-related genes with quantitative real-time PCR, and performed gonadal histology and whole-mount immunohistochemistry for Bcl2-interacting-killer (Bik) pro-apoptotic protein. The treatments resulted in an autoimmune reaction, gonad developmental retardation, intensive apoptosis, cell atresia, and disturbed transcript production. Testes were remarkably underdeveloped after anti-Gsdf treatments. Anti-Gdf9 treatments promoted apoptosis in testes and abnormal development of ovaries. Anti-Cd205 treatment stimulated a strong immune response in both sexes, resulting in oocyte atresia and strong apoptosis in supporting somatic cells. The effect of immunization was FSH-independent. Furthermore, immunization against germ cell proteins disturbed somatic supporting cell development. This is the first report to demonstrate that targeted autoimmunity can disturb gonadal development in a juvenile fish. It shows a straightforward potential to develop auto-immunization-based technologies to mitigate fish reproduction before they reach maturation. However, the highly variable results between treatments and individuals suggest significant optimization should be performed to achieve the full potential of this technology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Control of reproduction in farmed, pest, and pet animals is an important issue with multiple implications in economy, environment, and welfare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Taranger1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Cooper1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Cooper2">[3]</xref>. Unwanted sexual maturation of fish before they reach market size remains a significant constraint in aquaculture. For example, in farmed Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>), maturation often occurs in the second year, while in Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) it can happen after just one winter in seawater. Both cases result in loss of growth, condition, and flesh quality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Karlsen1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Karlsen2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-McClure1">[6]</xref>. In addition to economic consequences, precocious sexual maturation of farmed fish creates a threat of genetic pollution to natural populations because of escapes and uncontrolled gamete production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Jrstad1">[7]</xref>. The creation of mono-sex stocks can mitigate some concerns regarding gamete production and growth in some species such as catfish (<italic>Pelteobagrus spp.</italic>) or tilapia (<italic>Oreochromis spp.</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Chen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Gui1">[9]</xref>. However, it does not resolve concerns about reproductive potential of escapees and flesh quality of farmed fish.</p>
<p>Therefore, a method to mitigate or possibly eliminate gonadal growth in farmed fish is highly demanded. Transgenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-White1">[10]</xref>, morpholino-based knockdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Slanchev1">[11]</xref>, or induced triploidization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Benfey1">[12]</xref> approaches, resulting in partial or complete gamete ablation and consequently in reproduction disability, have their apparent limitations related to welfare, food safety, costs, or application potential to mass-scale production. A method based on intrinsic properties of the immune system, which does not require genetic modifications, is cost-effective and applicable at the industrial production level, would overcome the aforementioned limitations.</p>
<p>The majority of efforts in immunocontraception and immunosterilization have been focused on the mammalian reproductive system with a purpose to control wildlife populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Cooper2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Gupta1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Kirkpatrick1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Naz1">[15]</xref>. Usually the treatments stimulate the production of autoimmune antibodies to either bind to the gametes directly and prevent their function, or interfere with the GnRH pathway to prevent gamete production; some mammalian vaccines have resulted in significantly impaired fertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Kirkpatrick1">[14]</xref>. While immunocontraception serves the purpose of preventing outbreak of mammalian pest populations, it is not suitable for aquaculture as it does not affect gonadal development and the associated deteriorated growth and flesh quality. A study on rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) demonstrated that injection of a gonadal extract resulted in a limited autoimmune response in gonads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Laird1">[16]</xref>. However, that study was performed on few individuals only and no recent published studies have explored this concept further.</p>
<p>In the current study, we have asked whether the vaccination against specific targets in a juvenile gonad will produce an autoimmune response, and consequently, if it will disturb gonadal development. We chose zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) as a model. Zebrafish undergo a juvenile hermaphroditism sex differentiation pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Maack1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Maack2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-RodrguezMar1">[19]</xref>. The gonad first develops perinucleolar oocytes around 4 weeks post-fertilization (pf). While the timing of sexual differentiation can vary, a minimum length of 8 mm is a pre-requisite for development beyond an undifferentiated gonad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Maack1">[17]</xref>. Then either ovary is developed, or the oocytes degenerate and the gonad transforms into testis, with the first spermatocytes observed around 7 weeks pf. Completion of sexual differentiation occurs by weeks 11–12 pf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Maack1">[17]</xref>. However, the timing of this process is widely variable between individuals, as well as depending on fish strain and conditions.</p>
<p>After preliminary studies, we selected three proteins essential for gonad development as potential targets for induced autoimmunity: gonadal soma-derived factor (Gsdf), growth differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9), and lymphocyte antigen 75 (Cd205/Ly75). Gsdf is a member of TGFβ superfamily expressed in supporting somatic cells of ovary and testis, granulosa and Sertoli cells, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Gautier1">[20]</xref>. <italic>Gsdf</italic> expression in both sexes is highest when germ cells are in the spermatogonial or oogonial stages of gametogenesis, while expression decreases when germ cells enter the meiotic and postmeiotic stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Gautier1">[20]</xref>. This mechanism appears to be conserved in teleosts, as it is similar in rainbow trout, medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), and zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Gautier1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Sawatari1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Shibata1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Gautier2">[23]</xref>. In rainbow trout, it was demonstrated that <italic>gsdf</italic> knock-down during embryogenesis suppressed germ cell populations, while recombinant Gsdf was used for dose-dependent proliferation of type A spermatogonia in testis cell culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Sawatari1">[21]</xref>. It has been suggested that since oocytes do not proliferate under this treatment, <italic>gsdf</italic> may have a different function in ovaries than testes.</p>
<p>Gdf9 is another member of the TGFβ superfamily secreted from germ cells in both sexes and is involved in follicle development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Paulini1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Juengel1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Clelland1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-He1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Zhao1">[28]</xref>. In <italic>gdf9</italic> knock-out mice, folliculogenesis stops at the primary follicle stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Dong1">[29]</xref>. In male cats, <italic>gdf9</italic> is expressed specifically within the germ cell lineage and is involved in signaling to Sertoli and Leydig cells to regulate tight junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Zhao1">[28]</xref>. In zebrafish, <italic>gdf9</italic> is expressed predominantly in testes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Liu1">[30]</xref>, but also plays a role in ovarian follicle development, where it regulates tight junction integrity between oocytes and follicle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Clelland1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Lastly, Cd205 is an endocytic type I C-type lectin-like receptor belonging to the macrophage mannose receptor (MMR) family and consisting of a single polypeptide chain. In mammals, <italic>Cd205</italic> is strongly expressed in dendritic cells, where the protein acts as an endocytic receptor, binding with antigens and carrying them through the MHC class I and II pathways to present them to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Heath1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Kato1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Shrimpton1">[33]</xref>. In fish, <italic>cd205</italic> is expressed in multiple tissues. However, within the gonad it is expressed exclusively in the germline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Nagasawa1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Nagasawa2">[35]</xref>. In rainbow trout, the protein was localized to the surface of early germ cells, mainly primordial germ cells, type A spermatogonia, oogonia, and cortical alveoli oocytes. It was not found in spermatocytes, spermatids, spermatozoa, and vitellogenic oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Nagasawa1">[34]</xref>. While its function in teleost germ cells is unknown, the protein likely maintains a role in antigen presentation and related immune function.</p>
<p>In the current study, we immunized 6 week-old juvenile zebrafish against Gsdf, Gdf9, or Cd205 during early sexual development in order to induce autoimmune response in gonads. We gave a booster injection 15 days later, and sampled the fish at both 15 and 30 days after the initial treatment. We used <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to localize transcripts encoding the target proteins. We performed gonadal histology, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of immune-, apoptosis-, and gonad development-related genes, as well as whole-mount immunohistochemistry for the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl2-interacting-killer (Bik). We have demonstrated that gonadal development in juvenile zebrafish was affected <italic>via</italic> autoimmune mechanism.</p>

<title>Preliminary trial: effect of autoimmunization on adult female growth</title>
<p>To determine whether immunization against gonadal targets influences gonad weight and overall growth of zebrafish, a preliminary trial was performed on adult zebrafish females. Fish were immunized against four different proteins: Zona pellucida C (Zpc), Cd205, Insulin-like growth factor 3 (Igf3), or Riboflavin carrier protein (Rcp). At 10 days post-treatment (10 dpt), significant effect of treatment on fish weight (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004) and gonadosomatic index, GSI% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) was found. Fish from anti-Zpc and anti-Cd205 treatments had significantly lower weight compared to controls; the length of treated fish was not different from controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114209.s002">Table S1</xref>). The reduction in total weight in anti-Zpc and anti-Cd205 treatments likely resulted from a loss in gonadal weight, because the GSI% of fish in both treatments was significantly lower than in controls.</p>
<p>At 20 dpt, no significant differences in weight and length of fish were found. The effect of treatment on GSI% was significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Fish from anti-Zpc variant had significantly lower GSI% than controls. The GSI% of fish from anti-Zpc and anti-Cd205 treatments was significantly lower than in PBS-injected controls. Other treatments did not differ from either non-injected or PBS-injected controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114209.s002">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>At 30 dpt, significant effects of treatment on fish weight (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) and GSI% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) were observed. Fish from the anti-Zpc and anti-Igf3 treatments were significantly heavier than control fishes; however, their GSI% did not differ significantly from control fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114209.s002">Table S1</xref>).

<title>Effect of treatment on juvenile zebrafish growth</title>
<p>In the main experiment, five treatments against three gonadal proteins were tested: anti-Gsdf (two treatments, -a and –b), anti-Gdf9 (two treatments, -a and –b), and anti-Cd205. Fish were measured for total length prior to the first injection (day 0) and at 15 and 30 dpt, and weighted at 15 and 30 dpt. Length of fish at the day 0 was homogenous among treatment groups (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). At 15 dpt, fish from the anti-Gsdf-b treatment had significantly lower weight than controls, but no significant differences in length were recorded. At 30 dpt, more distinct retardation in growth was observed: fish from 3 out of 5 treatment variants had significantly lower weight than control fish; of them, fish from two variants (anti-Gsdf-b and anti-Cd205) were significantly shorter than control fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Total RNA was extracted from individuals sampled at both 15 and 30 dpt. Quantitative real-time PCR was then performed to compare relative expression of eight immune-, apoptosis, and gonadal-related genes. All investigated genes showed highly significant sexually dimorphic expression in juvenile zebrafish gonads (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Expression of <italic>T-cell receptor alpha constant</italic> (<italic>tcrac</italic>), <italic>vasa</italic>, and <italic>cytochrome P450 gonadal isoform</italic> (<italic>cyp19a1a</italic>) was female-enhanced, whereas expression of <italic>immunoglobulin M heavy chain secretory form</italic> (<italic>igμ</italic>), <italic>bcl-2-interacting-killer</italic> (<italic>bik</italic>), <italic>gsdf</italic>, <italic>inhibin alpha subunit</italic> (<italic>inhα</italic>), and <italic>anti-Müllerian hormone</italic> (<italic>amh</italic>) was male-enhanced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114209-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114209.s003">Table S2</xref>).

<title>Effect of treatment on gonadal histology</title>
<p>At each sampling point, sections of gonads were taken and stained with haematoxylin-eosin. In total, 64 ovary sections were examined: 21 control (7 at 15 dpt, and 14 and 30 dpt), 7 anti-Gsdf-a (2 at 15 dpt and 5 at 30 dpt), 7 anti-Gsdf-b (4 at 15 dpt and 3 at 30 dpt), 11 anti-Gdf9-a (7 at 15 dpt and 4 at 30 dpt), 6 anti-Gdf9-b (30 dpt only), and 12 anti-Cd205 (2 at 15 dpt and 10 at 30 dpt). In controls at 15 dpt, theovaries consisted of a uniform mass of previtellogenic oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), whereas by 30 dpt, the ovaries often contained previtellogenic and sometimes vitellogenic oocytes with a thick <italic>zona radiata</italic> surrounded by even follicular layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). No deviation from this pattern was observed in any control fish.

B) A representative ovary from a control fish (216.0 mg, 29.9 mm) at 30 dpt; stage 4 vitellogenic primary oocytes (Poc4) have a thick <italic>zona radiata</italic> (arrowhead) surrounded by an even layer of follicular cells. Stage 3 previtellogenic primary oocytes lack the thick <italic>zona radiata</italic>. C) Ovary from an anti-Gsdf-a treated fish at 30 dpt (326.3 mg, 31.9 mm): stage 4 and 5 (Poc5) primary oocytes weredeveloped. An atretic oocyte is identified by the thick arrow. Granulomatous inflammatory reaction as a consequence of invasion of peritonial cells is identified by the black star. D) Ovary from an anti-Cd205 treated fish at 30 dpt (241.0 mg, 30.5 mm): <italic>zona radiata</italic> is apparently thinner than in controls, and some invaginations are evident (arrowhead), indicating the onset of the atresia process. An irregular follicular layer also indicates atresia (thick arrow). Scalebars represent 100 µm.</p>

<p>Testis sections from 41 males were examined: 9 control (6 at 15 dpt and 3 and 30 dpt), 7 anti-Gsdf-a (2 at 15 dpt and 5 at 30 dpt), 4 anti-Gsdf-b (1 at 15 dpt and 3 at 30 dpt), 11 anti-Gdf9-a (4 at 15 dpt and 7 at 30 dpt), 2 anti-Gdf9-b (30 dpt only), and 8 anti-Cd205 (4 at 15 dpt and 4 at 30 dpt). The treatment effect was primarily through retarded growth and developmental advancement. Control testis at 15 dpt typically consisted of several stages of well-developed clusters of spermatogonial, spermatocyte, and spermatid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). At 30 dpt, testes were further developed and clusters of spermatozoa were visible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114209.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). In contrast, fish from the anti-Gsdf-a and -b treatments at 30 dpt had distinctively smaller and less developed testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g005">Fig. 5B, C</xref>). In anti-Gdf9-a treated fish, some individuals had underdeveloped testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>); in one extreme case, the testis consisted of undifferentiated gonocytes only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114209.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). There was only a single male examined from the anti-Gdf9-b treatment; its testis was comparatively well developed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114209.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>). No obvious developmental retardation was found in the anti-Cd205 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114209.s001">Fig. S1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Effect of treatment on gonadal cell apoptosis</title>
<p>Whole gonads were excised at both 15 and 30 dpt from fish of the <italic>tg</italic>(<italic>vas::egfp</italic>) line. Whole mount immunohistochemistry (IHC) was subsequently performed using a primary antibody specific for pro-apoptotic Bcl2-interacting killer (Bik) protein. In addition, several samples were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize associated somatic cells.</p>
<p>IHC was performed on 40 ovarian samples: 11 control (5 at 15 dpt, and 6 and 30 dpt), 8 anti-Gsdf-a (3 at 15 dpt and 5 at 30 dpt), 5 anti-Gsdf-b (2 at 15 dpt and 3 at 30 dpt), 9 anti-Gdf9-a (5 at 15 dpt and 4 at 30 dpt), and 7 anti-Cd205 (4 at 15 dpt and 3 at 30 dpt). The general organization of the germ cell and somatic lineages in the ovary is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g006">Fig. 6 (A, B)</xref>. In control ovaries, there was generally a weak signal originating from primary oocytes, but not oogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g006">Fig. 6C, D</xref>). Also, small, unidentified somatic cells containing Bik at a low level were detected around the primary oocytes at both 15 and 30 dpt. In the treatment groups, Bik signal was clearly stronger and with a more widespread distribution. In both anti-Gsdf-a and –b treatments at both 15 and 30 dpt, Bik was localized in stage 2 primary oocytes, but not in stage 1 oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g006">Fig. 6E → H)</xref>. At 30 dpt, Bik signal was also detected in stage 3 previtellogenic oocytes. In the anti-Gdf9-a group, Bik protein had a relatively weak signal restricted to stage 1 and stage 2 primary oocytes. No variation in signal was observed between 15 and 30 dpt. However, at both time points the ovaries appeared to develop abnormally, with many smaller primary oocytes in a scattered distribution when compared to control fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g006">Fig. 6I, J</xref>). In the anti-Cd205 treatment, there was a strong Bik signal primarily localized within somatic cells surrounding stage 2 primary oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g006">Fig. 6K, L</xref>). This pattern was observed in six of the seven ovaries examined. While the identity of somatic cells could not be confirmed, their distribution suggested supporting follicular cells of the theca and/or granulosa lineage. In primary and previtellogenic oocytes, the Bik signal was similar to that in other treatment groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Immunization of juvenile zebrafish against its own gonadal proteins generally induced an autoimmune response, which consequently affected gonadal development, although the success within and between treatments was variable. The treatment success could be evidenced from differential expression of genes being immune-related or gonadal cell markers, gonad pathology, cell apoptosis, and retarded development. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a peptide-based vaccine against structural or signaling components of a juvenile teleost gonad can affect gonadal development.</p>

<title>Transcripts encoding target proteins are localized in gonads</title>
<p>We confirmed that transcripts encoding the target proteins were expressed in gonads of zebrafish. <italic>gsdf</italic> expression was localized in the gonadal somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g001">Figs. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g002">2B</xref>), which is in agreement with the previous report showing <italic>gsdf</italic> expression localized in granulosa and Sertoli cells of zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Gautier2">[23]</xref>. Previous studies showed that strong expression of <italic>gdf9</italic> in zebrafish primary growth oocytes (stages 1 and 2) was declining progressively with the follicle development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Liu2">[36]</xref>. Our results also demonstrated an inverse relationship between oocyte growth and signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Furthermore, although <italic>gdf9</italic> transcripts were not detected in vitellogenic oocytes, this could be likely due to a lack of sensitivity in the ISH procedure, as previous work showed through RT-PCR that <italic>gdf9</italic> transcripts were present in mature oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Liu2">[36]</xref>. Although we found a weak signal of <italic>gdf9</italic> expression in testis, its specific cell localization could not be established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). ISH for <italic>cd205</italic> transcripts was generally consistent with findings in rainbow trout and bluefin tuna (<italic>Thunnas orientalis</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Nagasawa1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Nagasawa2">[35]</xref>. In rainbow trout, it was reported that <italic>cd205</italic> transcripts were detected in oogonia, nucleolus-stage oocytes, and type A spermatogonia, whereas in bluefin tuna testis, the transcripts were detected in type A spermatogonia. We detected <italic>cd205</italic> transcripts in stage 1 and 2 primary oocytes, some stage 3 previtellogenic oocytes, as well as spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g001">Figs. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g002">2D</xref>).</p>

<title>Treatment against gonadal proteins induces an immune response</title>
<p>Changes in expression of <italic>tcrac</italic>, which is a mature T-cell receptor marker gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Lam1">[37]</xref>, and <italic>igμ</italic>, which is expressed in both secreted and membrane forms of zebrafish Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Danilova1">[38]</xref>, have shown the effect of treatments on the immune system. The zebrafish immune system is both morphologically and functionally mature by the age of 4–6 weeks; by this time, mature T and B lymphocytes can be detected, as well as secreted immunoglobulins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Lam1">[37]</xref>. The three organs responsible for the majority of immune cell development are the spleen, thymus, and head kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Lam1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Huttenhuis1">[39]</xref>. Because these organs were not included in the trunk section from which RNA was extracted, we only measured immune cell concentration within the kidney, trunk muscle tissues, digestive system, and gonads.</p>
<p>The T lymphocytes are fundamental to the vertebrate specific immune response. These cells identify antigens through a CD3-associated antigen (Ag)-specific and heterodimeric T cell receptor (TCR) expressed on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Buonocore1">[40]</xref>. The majority of mature T-cells displays a αβ TCR which recognizes peptides presented on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and reside in secondary lymphoid organs. The qPCR data showed that the autoimmunization strategy used in the present study was generally not successful in stimulating increase in T-cell concentration within the gonad (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114209-t003">Table 3</xref>). Only the anti-Gsdf-a treatment resulted in a significant up-regulation of <italic>tcrac</italic> transcripts in females at 30 dpt. In contrast, while not statistically significant, the other treatments generally showed down-regulation of this marker. In cancer vaccine studies on mice, the use of vaccines with oil-based adjuvant showed that T-cells were far more likely localized in the site of vaccination rather than the sites of tumors, as the injected antigen persisted in oil droplets for extended periods of time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Hailemichael1">[41]</xref>. In the current study, peptides were also immersed in an oil-based adjuvant and consequently oil droplets from the vaccines were still observable around the injection site at the time of sampling (not shown). This may explain the general down-regulation of <italic>tcrac</italic> expression, since T-cells could be localized in the site of injection rather than the gonad, and were not included in the sample examined using qPCR. If true, this would be a major limitation of an oil-based adjuvant.</p>
<p>B-cells are lymphocytes in the adaptive immune system, with primary roles in the production of specific antibodies, as well as memory retention of past infections. B-cell activity is performed through B-cell antigen receptor, a multi-component complex on T-cell surfaces comprised of cell surface immunoglobulins, which mediates antigen binding and is responsible for B-lymphocyte maturation, maintenance, activation, and silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Hu1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Miller1">[43]</xref>. In the present study, expression of <italic>igμ</italic>, a B-cell marker, was generally up-regulated in the treated males and females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114209-t003">Table 3</xref>). B-cells can be present in the kidney as well as the blood; consequently, their specific recruitment to the gonad cannot be confirmed. However, secreted IgM antibodies in the blood would be able to interact with gonadal targets. Much of the elevation in <italic>igμ</italic> concentration was likely due to immunization against keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), which was used as an immunogenic carrier protein in the study. However, the differential expression of <italic>igμ</italic> between different treatment and control groups can be explained by immune response to the specific antigen peptide. Furthermore, transcripts of the apoptosis-promoting gene <italic>bik</italic> were significantly up-regulated in females in anti-Cd205 and anti-Gdf9-b treatments at 15 dpt; it correlated with significant up-regulation of <italic>igμ</italic> expression and could suggest a direct link between increased antibody production and programmed cell death.</p>

<title>Effect of autoimmunization in gonads is FSH-independent</title>
<p>Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a major regulator of both ovarian and testicular development. Major regulatory pathways are regulated by FSH, such as the Tgfβ pathway, which includes <italic>gdf</italic>9, <italic>gsdf</italic>, <italic>amh</italic> and <italic>inhα</italic>, and is involved in germ cell proliferation and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Sambroni1">[44]</xref>. Also, FSH is suggested to stimulate Sertoli cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Schulz1">[45]</xref>. In rainbow trout testes, FSH up-regulated <italic>inhα</italic> expression while down-regulated <italic>amh</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Sambroni1">[44]</xref>. In the present study, all treatments synergistically resulted in a significant down-regulation of both <italic>inhα</italic> and <italic>amh</italic> transcripts in males at 30 dpt when compared to control fish (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114209-t003">Table 3</xref>). These findings suggest a mechanism independent of FSH stimulation. There is evidence that the Gsdf role in germ cell proliferation does not involve the FSH regulatory pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Sambroni1">[44]</xref>. In the present study, the anti-Gsdf treatments resulted in significant down-regulation in <italic>amh</italic> and <italic>inhα</italic> expression in testes at 30 dpt, indicating that the effect of the treatment on gene expression was not gonadotropin-mediated. Consequently, disturbances in gonadal development were likely the result of direct autoimmunization against gonadal proteins.</p>

<title>Immunization against germ cell proteins affects somatic supporting cells</title>
<p>Sertoli and granulosa cells derive from a common progenitor cell type and form the first layer of supporting somatic cells surrounding the germ cells in a testis and ovary, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Albrecht1">[46]</xref>. In the gonad, <italic>inhα</italic> and <italic>amh</italic> expression is specific to somatic supporting cells and not germ cells. Inhibitin functions as an endocrine hormone from the gonads to regulate FSH secretion in the pituitary. In zebrafish, <italic>inhα</italic> is predominantly expressed in somatic follicle cells, increasing in expression as folliculogenesis progresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Poon1">[47]</xref>. <italic>Amh</italic> expression is not detected in somatic cells of germ cell-ablated gonads of medaka, which indicates that signaling from germ cells is necessary to sustain <italic>amh</italic> expression in soma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Kurokawa1">[48]</xref>. In the present study, both treatments against germ cell-specific proteins (anti-Cd205 and anti-Gdf9) resulted in down-regulation of <italic>inhα</italic> and <italic>amh</italic> in testis and ovary at 30 dpt, while <italic>gsdf</italic> was down-regulated in the testis only (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114209-t003">Table 3</xref>). This decrease in expression of somatic supporting cell-specific genes could result from a disturbance of soma-germline cross-talk in gonads, caused by an immune response towards the germ cells. Disruption of signaling from germ cells to Sertoli and granulosa cells, affecting further development and functions of Sertoli and granulosa cells, is further supported by follicular histopathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g004">Fig. 4C, D</xref>), intensive apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g006">Fig. 6K, L</xref>), as well as developmental retardation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Effect of anti-Gsdf treatments</title>
<p>Anti-Gsdf treatments resulted in retarded body growth and retarded growth and development of the testes, particularly at 30 dpt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g005">Fig. 5B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g007">Fig. 7B, C</xref>). Consequently, there was significant down-regulation of <italic>inhα</italic> and <italic>amh</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114209-t003">Table 3</xref>). In contrast, the treatments had little to no effect on female fish at the macroscopic level. Interestingly, histology of some anti-Gsdf-a treated females showed that despite having well-developed ovaries, there were signs of atresia and inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Because of the role of <italic>gsdf</italic> in spermatogonial proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Sawatari1">[21]</xref>, our results suggest that the treatment interrupted Gsdf signaling, and this suppressed spermatogonia proliferation and subsequent development. It is likely that the treatment was applied too late (6 week-old fish) to hamper ovarian germ cell proliferation, as there were already many primary oocytes present in the ovaries at that time. Since <italic>gsdf</italic> is still strongly expressed in somatic cells surrounding primary oocytes in 7 month-old zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), the gene likely retains some function during the ovarian development. However, it is unclear whether the treatment failed to interrupt the signaling, or if the <italic>gsdf</italic> role is not essential for ovarian maturation.</p>

<title>Effect of the anti-Gdf9 treatments</title>
<p>Treatments against Gdf9 protein resulted in retarded testes development and abnormal ovary development. Furthermore, significant loss in weight, but not in total length was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), which could result from smaller gonads. In testes, the significant down-regulation of <italic>inhα</italic> and <italic>amh</italic> transcripts in both treatments, as well as <italic>vasa</italic> and <italic>gsdf</italic> transcripts in the anti-Gdf9-b treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114209-t003">Table 3</xref>) was accompanied by retarded development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). While it has not been confirmed in zebrafish yet, the role of Gdf9 in testes is likely similar to that in ovaries, which is to regulate tight junction integrity between cells of the germ cell lineage and gonadal somatic supporting cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Clelland1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Zhao1">[28]</xref>. Interestingly, the strong Bik signal observed in spermatogonia, but not in clusters of spermatocytes and spermatids which had already recruited Sertoli and Leydig cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g007">Fig. 7E</xref>), suggests that an earlier application of the treatment would be more efficient. In femals, significant up-regulation of <italic>igμ</italic> and down-regulation of <italic>vasa</italic> transcripts showed that the effect was strongest at 15 dpt, suggesting that the anti-Gdf9 treatment should be done earlier in females than in males (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114209-t003">Table 3</xref>). Furthermore, the significant up-regulation of <italic>bik</italic> transcripts at 15 dpt (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114209-t003">Table 3</xref>), along with localization of Bik protein in primary oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g006">Fig. 6I, J</xref>) suggests that preventing Gdf9 signaling between primary oocytes and somatic cells promotes oocyte apoptosis. It is unclear if the treatment had any effect on preventing oocyte maturation, since the fish sampled for histology and IHC were smaller than the control fish, and therefore could not be used for direct comparisons. However, while control ovaries were compact, with a uniform gradient of growth, many anti-Gdf9-treated ovaries appeared abnormal, with a scattered distribution of primary oocytes of various sizes. This could result from impaired Gdf9 signaling, preventing the early stage oocytes from recruiting gonadal somatic cells.</p>

<title>Effect of the anti-Cd205 treatment</title>
<p>In females, the treatment resulted in reduced growth, elevated expression of immune-related genes, reduced expression of gonadal marker genes, localized signal of pro-apoptotic proteins within the gonad, and irregular gonadal development. The retarded growth at 30 dpt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114209-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) could likely result from a reduced ovary mass; as demonstrated in the preliminary experiment, anti-Cd205 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of GSI% in adult females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114209.s002">Table S1</xref>).

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present study demonstrates that immunization against specific targets in juvenile zebrafish gonads can induce an autoimmune response and, in consequence, cause disturbances in gonadal development manifested by growth and developmental retardation, intensive apoptosis, atresia, and disturbed transcript production. The treatment effect was likely FSH-independent. Targeting germ cell-specific proteins resulted in disturbed functions of somatic supporting cells, likely through disturbed cross-talk signaling. The anti-Gsdf treatments had little to no effect on females. However, testes were remarkably underdeveloped. The anti-Gdf9 treatments promoted apoptotic signals in testes, and caused abnormal development of ovaries. Finally, anti-Cd205 treatment stimulated a strong immune response in both sexes, resulting in strong pro-apoptotic signals in somatic cells and oocyte atresia. Further optimization of the treatment, including timing, dose, and type of antigen peptide, as well as investigating long-term effects of the treatment, should deliver a highly promising tool to control reproduction in fish.</p>

<title>Fish and husbandry</title>
<p>All husbandry and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Norwegian Regulation on Animal Experimentation (The Norwegian Animal Protection Act, No. 73 of 20 December 1974) and were approved by the National Animal Research Authority (Utvalg for forsøk med dyr, forsøksdyrutvalget, Norway) General License for Fish Maintenance and Breeding (Godkjenning av avdeling for forsøksdyr) no. 17. For the preliminary adult zebrafish trial, adults of mixed line were obtained from Febo Norge AS (Oslo, Norway). For the juvenile trial, adult zebrafish from three inbred lines were obtained from the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science (Oslo, Norway). These lines were: AB Tübingen (TAB), serving as a reference line; tg(vasa::vasa-EGFP)zf45 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Krvel1">[52]</xref>, showing GFP expression in the germ cell lineage; and the <italic>nacre</italic> (<italic>-/-</italic>) mutant line, lacking melanophores, thus being transparent. Fish were housed in a zebrafish recirculating system (Aquatic Habitats, Apopka FL, USA) and maintained using standard zebrafish procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Westerfield1">[53]</xref>. Water temperature was maintained at 28.0±1.0°C. Broodfish were housed in 10 L tanks at a density of 20 fish/tank with a 1∶1 sex ratio. One month prior to spawning the fish were conditioned with SDS 400 zebrafish specific diet (Special Diet Services, Essex, United Kingdom) and freshly hatched <italic>Artemia</italic> sp. nauplii. Juvenile zebrafish were produced using standard breeding techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Westerfield1">[53]</xref>. Post hatch, zebrafish larvae were housed in 1L tanks with fine mesh baffles and restricted water flow. Starting at 5 days post hatch, fish were weaned using SDS 100 zebrafish specific diet (Special Diet Services). From days 14 to 21 they were given a mix of SDS 100 and <italic>Artemia nauplii</italic>. Post day 21 they were only fed <italic>Artemia</italic> nauplii.</p>

<title>Preliminary trial on adult females</title>
<p>Four experimental vaccines consisted of a synthetic peptide conjugated to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114209.s004">Table S3</xref>). Each peptide was chosen from the complete respective amino acid sequence based on predicted antigenicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Hopp1">[54]</xref>. The peptides were commercially synthesized at &gt;80% purity (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Ulm, Germany) and conjugated to KLH using a maleimide activated conjugation kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma Aldrich, Oslo, Norway). After conjugation, the protein conjugates were isolated through column chromatography (Sephadex G-25M, Sigma Aldrich) and eluted in phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS). Coupling efficiency was determined by comparing the absorbance at 412 nm from a cysteine standard assay with each peptides cysteine absorbance values before and after conjugation. Final protein concentration was estimated by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Peptide-KLH conjugates were stored at −20°C until immediately before use. After thawing, the conjugates were diluted in PBS (1.0 mg/mL) and emulsified by vortex at a 1∶1 ratio with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA, Sigma Aldrich).</p>
<p>In total, 485 adult zebrafish were injected with one of the four treatments or a PBS/FCA control. Because of a limited availability of males, only female zebrafish were considered for this experiment. Each treatment group initially consisted of 105 fish whereas the control group had 65 fish. Prior to immunization, zebrafish were anaesthetized in a bath of 150 mg/L MS-222 (Tricaine; Sigma Aldrich) buffered with 150 mg/L sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>). Fish were considered in surgical anesthesia (stage III) when they became unresponsive to physical stimuli but maintained opercular movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Matthews1">[55]</xref>. Fish were removed from the bath and placed on a wet sponge inside a Petri dish. Injections were made intraperitoneally, below the pectoral fin. All injections were 10.0 µL (5.0 µg peptide-KLH) volume. After injection, fish were placed in a recovery tank for 10 min. Injection mortality was 13 out of 485 injected fish. Once recovered, zebrafish were returned to housing tanks.</p>
<p>Zebrafish were sampled immediately prior to immunization. Treated fish were then sampled every 10 days for 30 days. Because of higher mortality, sampling of control fish was only done at 20 dpt. Prior to sampling, fish received an overdose of buffered MS-222 (200 mg/L) and remained in the solution for 10 min following cessation of opercular movement. Upon removal from the bath, the fish were patted dry and weight and fork length measurements were taken. Fish were decapitated before opening the body cavity and the gonads were excised and weighed.</p>

<title>Autoimmunization vaccine preparation</title>
<p>Peptides for three target proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114209-t004">Table 4</xref>) were designed based on predicted antigenicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Hopp1">[54]</xref>. Six custom peptides (two for each target protein) were synthesized and conjugated to KLH by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Upon arrival, lysophilized peptides were dissolved in PBS to make a stock solution of either 10.0 or 5.0 mg/L, depending on protein solubility. Treatments consisted of either a single antigen (anti-Gdf9 and anti-Gsdf) or, where possible, a combination of both antigens (anti-Cd205) emulsified 1∶1 in FCA. For anti-Gsdf and anti-Gdf9 treatments, peptides were dissolved individually and had a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL each. Because of high solubility, both Cd205 peptides were combined and retained a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL.</p>

<title>Immunization</title>
<p>Zebrafish were first injected at 6 weeks post fertilization, with a booster treatment at 15 dpt and final sampling at 30 dpt. The choice of timing for these treatments was based on the window in which the zebrafish can be safely injected (minimum total length of 15 mm; personal observations), have a mature adaptive immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Lam1">[37]</xref>, and have not yet developed a mature gonad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Maack1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Maack2">[18]</xref>. In total, 329 fish (15.5±2.8 mm average ± S.D.) were immunized with one of five vaccines or a PBS/FCA control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114209-t005">Table 5</xref>). Fish were anesthetized in a Petri dish filled with tank water containing 50 mg/L MS-222(Sigma Aldrich) buffered with 50 mg/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Each anesthetized fish was first individually photographed and measured for total length using a Zeiss Axio Zoom v.16 microscope. Fish from the tg(vas::egfp) line were also screened for eGFP signal. For injections, fish were transferred to a wet sponge and injected with 2.0 µL of the experimental vaccine using a 50 µL syringe equipped with a 34g needle (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland). Post injection, fish were transferred to a Petri dish filled with tank water to monitor recovery for 10 min before returning to a housing tank. In total, there were 36 mortalities. For the booster treatment at 15 dpt, the protocol was the same except the vaccination volume was reduced to 1.0 µL and Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) was used as the adjuvant. There was a single mortality from the booster injection.</p>

<p>The RT-qPCR was performed on LightCycler 480 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) using 96-well plates (Roche). SYBR green-based detections were done under the thermal cycle conditions of 95°C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 63°C for 20 s and 72°C for 10 s. All samples were run in duplicate, together with minus reverse transcriptase, no template and a positive plate control. Five-point standard curves (dilutions 1∶1–1∶81) were used to calculate the efficiency of the PCR reaction. The reaction specificity was evaluated by melting curve analysis. Cycle threshold (<italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic>) values were determined using the LightCycler 480 software with a level of fluorescence intensity set to one. The reference genes (<italic>ß-actin</italic>, <italic>ef1α, rpl13α</italic>) were examined for data normalization using geNorm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Vandesompele1">[65]</xref>. An optimal stability value of 0.486 was obtained using <italic>rpl13α</italic> and <italic>ef1α</italic> and target gene expressions were normalized to relative levels.</p>

<title>Gonad histology</title>
<p>Sections and slides were prepared as described above in 5.5. Samples were stained with haematoxylin-eosin (HE) in the Robot Slide Stainer (Microm HMS 760X, Thermo Scientific) and mounted using Pertex mounting media (Leica Biosystems). Evaluation and imaging on the samples done by use of the light microscope Olympus BX 51 (Olympus Optical Co. GmbH, Germany) and Olympus Imaging software Cell B. The identification of structures within the zebrafish gonads was done in accordance with the Histology and Histopathology Atlas of the Zebrafish (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zfishtoxpat.comoj.com" xlink:type="simple">http://zfishtoxpat.comoj.com</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Whole mount immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Whole mount immunohistochemistry was performed to detect Bcl2-interacting-killer (Bik), a pro-apoptotic protein, which is normally suppressed by survival-promoting factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Boyd1">[58]</xref>. The procedure was performed as described by Draper (2012) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Draper1">[66]</xref> with the following modifications: the primary antibody used was rabbit polyclonal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific for anti-zebrafish Bik protein (Anaspec, Belgium). The primary antibody was diluted 1∶150 and administered overnight at 4°C. The secondary antibody used was Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA) at a 1∶500 dilution for 5 hours at room temperature. Staining with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was also performed to visualize somatic cells using several washes with a concentration of 2.0 µg/mL. After the completion of the IHC procedure, the gonads were imaged using an AxioZoom V16 microscope equipped with the ApoTome.2 combined with DsRed and eGFP filters. As a positive control to test the procedure, the primary antibody was replaced with an anti-eGFP monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Because of a shortage of samples for anti-Gdf9-b treated fish, no whole mount IHC was performed on this treatment group.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed according to Zar (1999) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114209-Zar1">[67]</xref>. The data are presented as averages ± standard deviations (S.D.). ANOVA was used to test the effects of treatments on fish weight, length and relative values of gene expression. Homogeneity of variances was tested using Levene's test. Fisher's least significant difference <italic>post-hoc</italic> test was used to investigate differences between groups. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient r was used to investigate relationships between gene expressions. Significant effects were considered at <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05.</p>
