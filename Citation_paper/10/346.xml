<abstract>
<p>The low efficiency of differentiation into male germ cell (GC)-like cells and haploid germ cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) reflects the culture method employed in the two-dimensional (2D)-microenvironment. In this study, we applied a three-step media and calcium alginate-based 3D-culture system for enhancing the differentiation of hESCs into male germ stem cell (GSC)-like cells and haploid germ cells. In the first step, embryoid bodies (EBs) were derived from hESCs cultured in EB medium for 3 days and re-cultured for 4 additional days in EB medium with BMP4 and RA to specify GSC-like cells. In the second step, the resultant cells were cultured in GC-proliferation medium for 7 days. The GSC-like cells were then propagated after selection using GFR-α1 and were further cultured in GC-proliferation medium for 3 weeks. In the final step, a 3D-co-culture system using calcium alginate encapsulation and testicular somatic cells was applied to induce differentiation into haploid germ cells, and a culture containing approximately 3% male haploid germ cells was obtained after 2 weeks of culture. These results demonstrated that this culture system could be used to efficiently induce GSC-like cells in an EB population and to promote the differentiation of ESCs into haploid male germ cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, have the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into all three germ layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Thomson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Martin1">[2]</xref>.

<p>Millions of mature sperm are produced from spermatogonia during spermatogenesis. These spermatogonia originate from PGCs in the genital ridge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-StarzGaiano1">[6]</xref>.

In addition, retinoic acid (RA), which regulates the transcriptional activity of various target genes, has been shown to induce the differentiation of PGCs into germ (spermatogonial) stem cells (GSCs, self-renewed spermatogonia) or differentiated spermatogonia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Zhou1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Koshimizu1">[12]</xref>.

In humans, germ cell differentiation from ESCs via spontaneous or BMP-induced embryoid body (EB) formation has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Kee1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Clark1">[13]</xref>, and these studies revealed that human ESCs are capable of forming germ cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, the efficiency of this differentiation is low, and a specific protocol using BMPs and RA for differentiation into germ cells has not been well-established.</p>
<p>Three-dimensional (3D)-culture systems based on biomaterials are important tools for studying cell proliferation, differentiation and regeneration. Alginate is one of the biomaterials used in 3D-culture systems. Alginate is a natural polysaccharide obtained from brown seaweed, which forms a physical hydrogel in the presence of divalent cations, such as calcium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Thomas1">[14]</xref>. Alginate is stable against mammalian enzymatic digestion but can be eliminated by <italic>in vivo</italic> mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Boontheekul1">[15]</xref>. Owing to the biocompatibility, the mildness of gelation conditions and the low immunogenicity of purified alginate, this compound has been widely used in biomedical, biomaterial and therapeutic applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Shang1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to refine the induction protocol for enriching GSC-like cells (induced spermatogonia) from human ESCs, to characterize the gene expression of these cells compared with testicular spermatogonia, and to develop an efficient 3D-co-culture system using alginate encapsulation and testicular somatic cells for differentiation into advanced male germ cells.</p>

<title>Culture of Human ESCs</title>
<p>This study was undertaken under approval of the Institutional Review Board for Human research of CHA Gangnam Medical Center, Seoul, Korea and the National IRB board regarding the research using human ESCs. Protocols for the use of animals in these experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of CHA University (IACUC). Human ESCs (CHA-hES15: hES12010028, 40∼50 passages, Korea Stem Cell Registry, KNIH, Osong, South Korea; and H1: WiCell, 70∼80 passages, Madison, WI; both normal 46XY) were maintained according to a previously described method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Lee1">[17]</xref>. Briefly, undifferentiated human ESCs were maintained on mitomycin-C treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells in ES medium [DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 20% (v/v) knockout serum replacement (KSR, Invitrogen), penicillin (100 IU/mL, Welgene, Daegu, South Korea), streptomycin (100 µg/mL, Welgene), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM <italic>β</italic>-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen) and 4 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Invitrogen)]. The medium was changed daily. For the maintenance of undifferentiated human ESCs, the ESCs cultures were mechanically passaged weekly and were subsequently transferred onto freshly prepared MEF cells. The cell lines were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

The cultures were maintained under the same conditions for an additional week. The medium was changed every 2 days. To collect and propagate GSC-like cells, the EBs were dissociated and sorted using a GFR-α1 antibody (Chemicon, Billerica, MA) through a magnetic activated cell sorting system (MACS; Dynal Flowcomp, Invitrogen). MACS-sorted GSC-like cells were additionally cultured in GC-proliferation medium for 3 weeks. Cultured cells were divided into two groups.

All donors for testicular tissues were understood the scope of the study and participated in this study by providing their written informed consent. There was no monetary compensation for their donations. Human fetal testis was obtained following elective termination of pregnancy (18 weeks gestation). Adult testicular tissues were obtained from obstructive azoospermic (OA) patients (with normal spermatogenesis) undergoing testicular sperm extraction (TESE)–intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatments.

The samples were washed three times in DPBS containing 5% FBS and subsequently fixed in paraformaldehyde (4% v/v in DPBS) for 24 hr. For permeabilization, the cells were incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 10 min. After washing three times with DPBS, non-specific antibody binding was suppressed through incubation in blocking solution (4% normal goat serum in DPBS) for 30 min at room temperature. After additional washing three times with PBS, the fixed samples were subjected to immunocytochemical staining through incubation with a primary antibody diluted to 1∶200–1∶500 with DPBS containing 1% BSA for 60 min at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The immunoreactive protein was subsequently detected using CY3 or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted to 1∶500 with DPBS for 60 min at room temperature. The samples were counterstained using 1 µg/ml 4′,6-diamidino 2-phenyindiol (DAPI; Sigma). Following multiple washes, the cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The stained cells were viewed on an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with fluorescence at 400× magnification. The micrographs were stored in LSM (Zeiss LSM Image Browser version 2.30.011; Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany). Negative control was performed by using the isotype IgG instead of primary antibody or protein Block (DAKO Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) without primary antibody. Percentage of VASA-positive cells in EBs derived from CHA-hES15 and H1 hESC lines were evaluated with a counting of 200 cells per each slide.</p>

<title>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</title>
<p>FISH was performed to confirm the haploidy of presumptive spermatids derived from 3D co-cultured GSC-like cells. After 2 weeks of <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation, the differentiated germ cells were dispersed and placed in hypotonic solution [6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.5% sodium citrate (Sigma)] for 10 min, and fixed in Carnoy's solution (methanol:acetic acid = 3∶1) for 10 min. Next, fixed cells were spread onto cleaned glass slides, dehydrated, and examined with directly labeled DNA probes (Vysis Inc., Framingham, MA, USA), Chromosome 9 (spectrum red) and Chromosome X (spectrum green). The probe mixture was applied to the slide and covered with a cover glass. Probe and target cells were co-denatured by heating the slide to 73°C for 10 min. Hybridization was carried out in a moist chamber at 37°C for overnight. Following hybridization, the slides were washed using 0.4× SSC/0.3% NP40 solution at 73°C for 3 min.

The control cells were not treated with primary antibodies. The cells were maintained in the dark on ice until analysis on a Becton Dickinson FACS IV Calibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). At least 5000 to 10000 events were acquired for each sample.</p>
<p>To analyze the DNA content after germ cell differentiation, the encapsulated cells were dissociated in trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in DPBS to release single cells. After filtering through 80-µm nylon mesh, the cells were fixed in cold 70% ethanol and maintained at 4°C until further analysis. For the DNA content assay, 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells were washed twice with DPBS and incubated in 500 µL of 0.2% pepsin for 10 min at 37°C. After centrifugation, the cells were stained in a solution containing 25 µg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma), 40 µg/ml RNase (Gibco/Invitrogen), and 0.3% Tween-20 in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. The stained cells were analyzed using a FACS IV system.</p>

The W/W<sup>v</sup> recipient mouse was anesthetized, and the testis was exteriorized through a midline abdominal incision and immobilized. The injection pipette was constructed from a three-inch length of borosilicate glass with an internal diameter of 0.75 mm and an external diameter of 1 mm (World Precision Instruments # TW100-3). The glass was drawn on a Kopf pipette puller (Model 750) creating two potential injection pipettes [40–60 µm outside diameter (o.d.)]. The glass pipette was inserted into the efferent duct under a dissecting microscope, and the pressure in the injection tubing was raised until the cell suspension flowed into the seminiferous tubule. The flow was monitored based on the color change. A cell suspension of approximately 3–5 µl (less than 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells) was injected into a W/W<sup>v</sup> recipient testis, filling ∼50% of the tubules in each testis. One to three weeks after transplantation, the recipient testes were collected, detunicated and analyzed for GFP expression using a fluorescent microscope.</p>

<title>Microarray and data analysis</title>
<p>Each total RNA sample (200 ng) obtained from the undifferentiated hESC, hESC-derived GSC-like cells and testis-derived spermatogonia were labeled and amplified using the Low Input Quick Amp Labeling kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The Cy3-labeled RNAs were resuspended in 50 µl of hybridization solution (Agilent Technologies). After the labeled RNAs were placed in an Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8×60K Microarray (Agilent Technologies) and covered with a Gasket 8-plex slide (Agilent Technologies), the slides were hybridized for 17 hr at 65°C. The hybridized slides were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 min, 1× SSC for 3 min, and 0.2× SSC for 2 min at room temperature. The slides were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 sec to dry. The arrays were analyzed on an Agilent scanner using the associated software. The gene expression levels were calculated using Feature Extraction v10.7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). The relative signal intensities for each gene were generated using the Robust Multi-Array Average algorithm. The data were processed based on the median polish normalization method using GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). This normalization method mediates the distribution of intensities for each array in a set of similar arrays. The normalized and log-transformed intensity values were subsequently analyzed using GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). The fold-change filters included a requirement that the genes are present in at least 200% of the controls for up-regulated genes and lower than 50% of the controls for down-regulated genes. The hierarchical clustering data comprised clustered groups with similar characteristics across experiments using GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). The clustering algorithm represented the Euclidean distance and average linkage.

<title>Characterization of hESCs and spermatogonia from human testis</title>
<p>Prior to the experiments, the expression of the pluripotent stem cell markers OCT4, NANOG, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, and TRA1-60 was reconfirmed in both of the undifferentiated human ESC lines: CHA-hES15 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090454.s002">Fig. S2</xref>) and H1 cells (data not shown). The expression of the GC-specific markers VASA and GFR-α1 was not observed in undifferentiated human ESC lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090454.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). However, these markers were detected in the primordial germ cell and spermatogonia from the testes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090454.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>). In the fetal gonad, immunohistochemical staining revealed that the VASA protein was present in the primordial germ cell only. But, in the adult testis, VASA protein was present in the spermatogonia, spermatocytes and some mature spermatozoa (data not shown). The GFR-α1 protein was detected only in the spermatogonia located on the basement of a tubule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090454.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>), suggesting that this marker could be a more specific marker of spermatogonia.

<title>The first step: Induction of GSC-like cells from hESC-derived EBs</title>
<p>When ESCs were cultured for 3 days in EB medium, three-dimensional structures called EBs were formed. For specification into the germ lineage, BMP4 and/or RA were added into the EB medium for 4 days. The EBs were attached and spread onto a culture dish in non-treated or BMP4-only treated groups. However, in the RA only- or BMP4/RA-treated groups, the EBs were clustered together at the periphery of the cells and were swollen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). For effective induction of EBs into GSC-like cells, the specification rate into the GC lineage was compared based on the expression of VASA for 2–8 days after treatment of the cells with BMP4 and/or RA. The VASA protein was expressed on the membrane and in the cytoplasm of developing PGCs at the genital ridge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Castrillon1">[28]</xref>. Although there was no VASA expression in undifferentiated hESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090454.s002">Fig. S2</xref>), the VASA-positive cells were most frequently localized on the surface of EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the percentages of VASA-positive putative GSC-like cells. The results also indicated that the specification in CHA-hES15 and H1 cells could potentially be enhanced through treatment with BMP4 or RA, which are important for differentiation into GCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. On day 2, VASA was detected in EBs cultured with and without BMP4/RA. The percentage of VASA-positive cells in EBs cultured with RA (9.0%±0.7, 10.3%±1.8 in CHA-hES15 and H1) and BMP4/RA (8.8%±0.9, 10.3%±1.1) was significantly greater than that in EBs cultured without factors (4.0%±0.4, 4.3%±1.1) and that in the BMP4 (5.8%±0.5, 6.8%±1.1)-treated group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). After 4 days, a significant increase in percentage of VASA positive cells was detected in EBs cultured with BMP4 (15.5%±2.6 and 17.5%±2.9 in CHA-hES15 and H1), RA (20.4%±3.6 and 26.3%±4.0) or BMP4/RA (24.5%±3.2 and 32.8%±4.2) compared with the EB medium group (7.0%±1.3 and 8.5%±1.7)(<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). In particular, on day 4, the EBs treated with BMP4/RA showed the highest expression of VASA. The VASA expression on day 8 (EB medium group: 5.8%±1.4 and 4.5%±1.6 in CHA-hES15 and H1, BMP-treated: 9.0%±2.9 and 18.0%±3.4, RA-treated: 21.3%±1.7 and 20.5%±2.8, BMP4/RA-treated: 23.0%±3.5 and 28.5%±3.8) was not increased compared with that of the 4-day culture groups. Indeed, the VASA expression was reduced in certain groups, and there were slightly more dead cells in the EBs (data not shown). The number of putative GSC-like cells was higher in BMP4/RA-treated EBs than in the other groups. Thus, we decided to use BMP4/RA in further experiments.</p>

<title>The second step: Proliferation and isolation of PGC-like cells from hESC-derived EBs</title>
<p>GC-proliferation medium was used to propagate GSC-like cells for 1 to 3 weeks.

Before the flow cytometric analysis, we have counted total cell number of each group (EB medium group+BMP4/RA, EB medium group and GC-medium). As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, total cell numbers after 1 week of culture were decreased compared to that of starting material, but not different among three groups.

A total of 22 genes were then excluded because of similar expression in the undifferentiated hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Of the 118 remaining genes, 112 genes were expressed by both the ESC-derived PGC-like cells and the testis-derived spermatogonia. The other six genes were expressed by only the ESC-derived PGC-like cells or the testis-derived SSCs. Forty-eight of the remaining 118 genes, including TAF4B, GPR-125, GFRA1, POU3F1, DND1, and SEPTIN6, showed similar expression levels in both ESC-derived GSC-like cells and the testis-derived spermatogonia, and 52 of the 118 genes, including INTG5, INTGB1, EGR2, THY-1, CD9, SOX 13, and IFITM3, were up-regulated in testis-derived spermatogonia compared with ESC-derived GSC-like cells. Only 18 of the 118 genes, including NANOG, POU5F1, LIN28, UTF1 and SATB1, were up-regulated in ESC-derived GSC-like cells compared with testis-derived spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We used quantitative RT-PCR to validate the differential expression of selected spermatogonia-specific genes in ESC-derived GSC-like cells compared with testis-derived spermatogonia. The RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of selected genes, including STARD13, NID2, PTPRM, DUSP6, NCH1 and NR0B1, in the two groups were similar to the levels detected in the microarray results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The pluripotency of ESCs provides an excellent model for studying differentiation and dedifferentiation in various lineages, including the production of germ cells. Previous studies have shown that ESC-derived PGC-like cells and germ cells have been spontaneously or directly differentiated by applying RA and/or BMP4 in culture, but a substantial number of these differentiated cells expressed specific markers for PGCs or germ cells only <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Hubner1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Geijsen1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Kee1">[9]</xref>. In the present study, we applied an efficient three-step sequential method for inducing and propagating ESC-derived GSC-like cells and producing haploid male germ cells in <italic>in vitro</italic> systems. The results have confirmed that the addition of RA and BMP4 to cultures effectively induces the expression of GSC-specific markers in differentiated hESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Aflatoonian1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Ying2">[32]</xref>. In addition, more enriched ESC-derived GSC-like cells were obtained using a germ cell culture system, and the efficiency of haploid male germ cell production was increased using a 3D-co-culture system as compared to a 3D culture system alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) and a 2D culture system(&lt;1%, data not shown). Propagated ESC-derived GSC-like cells maintained the potential for proliferation capacity, as confirmed through cell transplantation into the testes of host mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090454.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated GSC-like cells have shown similar gene expression profiles in SSCs obtained from human testes.</p>
<p>To improve low differentiation efficiency, we identified the critical factors involved in the differentiation of GSCs into germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-DeFelici1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Resnick1">[34]</xref> and the proliferation of <italic>in vitro</italic> induced GSC-like cells. Indeed, the addition of BMP and RA has shown that some growth factors might affect the induction of differentiation into GSC-like cells and the enrichment of GSC-like cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Several groups have reported that mouse GSC clumps continuously proliferate under culture conditions with GDNF and bFGF, and these proliferating clump-forming cells maintain the properties of GSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-KanatsuShinohara1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Kubota1">[35]</xref>. In human systems, GSC-like cells proliferate when certain growth factors are added to the culture medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Lim1">[23]</xref>. In the present study, we applied GC-proliferation medium supplemented with EGF, LIF, GDNF and bFGF to propagate and enrich ESC-derived GSC-like cells, and the population of GFR-α1-positive cells derived from cultured EBs was highly enriched compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In our previous studies, we introduced an <italic>in vitro</italic> 3D-culture system using sodium alginate for differentiation into haploid male germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Lee2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Lee3">[22]</xref>. For the effective differentiation of GSC-like cells derived from human ESCs, we employed a modified 3D-co-culture system using testicular somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). After <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation and quantification using markers for haploid male germ cells, we observed that a 3D-co-culture system was more effective than a simple 3D-culture system for the differentiation of GSC-like cells from human ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). In particular, approximately 3% of the GSC-like cells could be differentiated into haploid male germ cells, exhibiting specific markers after only two weeks of short-term culture, although morphologically normal or functional spermatozoa were not observed in the cell cultures.</p>
<p>GFR-α1 is the receptor for GDNF, a growth factor that regulates the ratio of self-renewal and differentiation of GSCs. GDNF-knockout mice exhibited a depletion of GSCs, whereas mice over-expressing GDNF show an accumulation of GSCs. von Schonfeldt and colleagues reported that GFR-α1 is localized to spermatogonia in the adult mouse testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-vonSchonfeldt1">[29]</xref>, suggesting that male GSCs could be highly purified using this marker. Although CD9 and THY-1 are generally accepted to be male GSC markers, these surface markers were also detected on undifferentiated stem cells. In the present study, GFR-α1 was used as a marker for sorting male GSCs, and the sorted GFR-α1-positive cells were cultured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast to previous studies showing a 16 to 32-fold expansion after culturing for 1 month <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-KanatsuShinohara1">[20]</xref>, the expansion rate of our GSC-like cells was low (3–4-fold). The results suggest that these cells might be different from other GSCs obtained from the testes, although GSC-like cells derived from hESCs exhibited similarities in morphology and marker expression of human male GSCs. Therefore, we compared the gene expression profiles of ESC-derived GSC-like cells and male GSCs (spermatogonia) obtained from human testes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Lim1">[23]</xref> using microarray analysis. The gene sets over-expressed in GSC-like cells derived from hESCs showed a significant overlap with the reference gene lists used to characterize male GSC-specific genes in previous rodent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Hamra1">[36]</xref>. The previously identified male GSC-specific genes, such as <italic>ITGA6</italic>, <italic>FGFR3</italic>, <italic>EPB41L4A</italic>, <italic>DPPA5</italic>, <italic>DPPA3 (STELLA)</italic>, <italic>CHEK2</italic>, <italic>CHD7</italic>, <italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>BCL6B</italic>, <italic>ABCG2</italic>, <italic>TERT</italic>, <italic>TACSTD1</italic>, <italic>SOX3</italic>, <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>SOHLH2</italic>, <italic>SEMA4D</italic>, <italic>RELN</italic>, <italic>PUNC</italic>, <italic>PIWIL2</italic>, <italic>NOTCH1</italic>, <italic>LIN28B</italic>, and <italic>LHX1</italic>, showed similar expression levels in all human and rodent samples. However, some SSC-specific genes, such as <italic>UPK1B</italic>, <italic>SOHLH1</italic>, <italic>SNAP91</italic>, <italic>TEX14</italic>, <italic>TEX101</italic>, <italic>NANOS2</italic>, <italic>MBP</italic>, <italic>DAZL</italic>, <italic>MAGEA4</italic> and <italic>STAR8</italic>, were not expressed in either human sample (data not shown). The absence of those genes could reflect the fact that the human samples (GSC-like cells from hESCs and testicular spermatogonia) did not exhibit the same gene expression patterns as the rodent samples. Using microarray analysis, we identified six male GSC-specific genes showing differential expression in both human samples: the expression of <italic>TSPAN8</italic> and <italic>FOXA2</italic> in the testis and the expression of <italic>SLC6AL</italic>, <italic>FOXA2</italic>, <italic>ANKRD6</italic> and <italic>ABCG2</italic> in GSC-like cells from hESCs. The results revealed that cultured GSC-like cells derived from hESCs have high similarity with human spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>
<p>In the validated gene analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090454-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), <italic>protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)</italic>, namely, <italic>DUSP6</italic>, <italic>PTPN14</italic>, <italic>PTPRG</italic>, <italic>PTPRM</italic>, and <italic>PTPRD</italic>, regulate adhesion and differentiation. <italic>Dual specific phosphatase 6 (DUSP6</italic> or <italic>MKP</italic>-3) encodes a negative feedback regulator of ERK signaling and regulates FGFR signaling during mouse development. <italic>PTPRM</italic> is associated with adherent junctions and dephosphorylates key signaling substrates, such as beta-catenin and cadherin adhesion molecules. <italic>PTPRG</italic> is transiently expressed during ESC-derived embryoid body differentiation and is required for male GSC lineage commitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Li1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-BradyKalnay1">[39]</xref>. <italic>TENC1</italic> encodes a member of the tensin family that is a focal adhesion molecule that binds to actin filaments (ENC1) and participates in signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Kawai1">[40]</xref>. <italic>NID2</italic> encodes a member of the nidogen family, and this protein is a cell-adhesion protein that binds collagen I and IV and laminin and might be involved in maintaining the structure of the basement membrane. These genes have been associated with the formation of male GSC clumps and showed similar expression levels in ESC-derived GSC-like cells. <italic>STARD13</italic> encodes a protein that contains an N-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) for protein-protein interactions followed by an ATP/GTP-binding motif, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain, and a C-terminal STAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain, suggesting that this protein might be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. In addition, <italic>STARD13</italic> interacts with EPB41L and TENC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Kawai1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Nagaraja1">[41]</xref>. These genes have been associated with the proliferation of male GSC clumps and exhibited lower expression in GSC-like cells from hESCs than in male GSCs from testes, potentially reflecting the low expansion rate of GSC-like cells. <italic>NR0B1</italic> encodes an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor family that is expressed in tissues involved in the production of steroid hormones and the reproductive function of the testes. Indeed, NR0B1 null homozygous male mice have adrenal insufficiency and testicular disorganization, as well as failed spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Zanaria1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0090454-Park1">[43]</xref>. All of the above genes are associated with spermatogenesis, reflecting the fact that ESC-derived GSC-like cells are more similar to germ cells than to undifferentiated hESCs.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We developed a sequential culture system to induce and propagate human GSC-like cells that strongly express the male GSC-specific maker GFR-α1 and differentiate into male germ cells. Although the GSC-like cells derived from hESCs were not identical to spermatogonia, this study provided insight into the induction and propagation of spermatogonia. In addition, a large number of GSC-like cells can be applied to 3D-co-culture for differentiation into male germ cells. Therefore, we suggest that a sequential differentiation system is a useful tool for the study of male germ cell development and for future clinical trials using patient specific stem cells after more improvement of male GSC induction and the completion of meiosis.</p>
