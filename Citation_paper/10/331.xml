<abstract>
<p>RNA interference (RNAi) screens have been shown to be valuable to study embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and they have been successfully applied to identify coding as well as noncoding genes required for maintaining pluripotency. Here, we used an RNAi library targeting &gt;640 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) to probe for their role in early cell differentiation. Utilizing a Sox1-GFP ESC reporter cell line, we identified the lncRNA <italic>lncR492</italic> as lineage-specific inhibitor of neuroectodermal differentiation. Molecular characterization showed that <italic>lncR492</italic> interacts with the mRNA binding protein HuR and facilitates its inhibitory function by activation of Wnt signaling. Thus, lncRNAs modulate the fate decision of pluripotent stem cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are characterized by their ability of long-term self-renewal as well as their potential to differentiate into each cell type of the embryo proper. After the first isolation of embryonic stem cells from the mouse blastocyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref002">2</xref>] the research community has achieved a reasonable understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling self-renewal of ESC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref003">3</xref>]. However, knowledge about the transition from pluripotency to the first lineage commitment is still less well understood.</p>
<p>Recent sequencing approaches have shown that the majority of the genome is transcribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref004">4</xref>]. Among the identified transcripts are RNAs that are transcribed by Polymerase II, usually 5’ capped, polyadenylated and spliced but have little or no protein coding potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref006">6</xref>]. With a transcript length of &gt;200 nucleotides they are defined as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA). LncRNAs can originate intergenically or are transcribed from a promoter shared with the protein-coding gene. Recent research revealed very diverse mechanisms how lncRNA function: e.g. by chromatin remodeling, histone modification, DNA methylation or interaction with transcription factors but also as scaffolds for protein assembly, as miRNA sponges, or posttranscriptional gene regulators by controlling alternative splicing or influencing degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Large-scale functional studies have identified numerous lncRNAs that play a regulatory role in the maintenance of pluripotency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref010">10</xref>]. It has been shown that lncRNAs are under tight control of important pluripotency-associated transcription factors, but also feed back into the circuit of self-renewal and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref011">11</xref>]. For instance, the lncRNA <italic>TUNA</italic> was identified as sustainer of pluripotency but was also required for neural differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref010">10</xref>]–highlighting the extensive and context-dependent role of lncRNAs.</p>
<p>To identify specific neural differentiation regulating lncRNAs, we performed a large-scale loss-of-function RNAi screen in a Sox1-GFP ESC reporter line. We discovered the lncRNA <italic>lncR492</italic> as an inhibitor of neural differentiation, which exerts its function by interacting with the mRNA binding protein HuR and activating Wnt signaling, thereby blocking ectodermal differentiation in a lineage specific manner.</p>

<title>Cell culture and high-throughput screen</title>
<p>Austin Smith and Konstantinos Anastassiadis kindly provided the Sox1-GFP and Oct4-GFP cell lines. The Foxa2-GFP and T-GFP cell lines were generated in the BAC TransgeneOmics project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref012">12</xref>] and kindly provided by Ina Poser. R1/E ESCs were obtained from the transgenic core facility of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics.</p>
<p>Sox1-GFP, Foxa2-GFP, T-GFP ESC and R1/E ESC lines were cultured on gelatin-coated plates in DMEM (high glucose, GlutaMAX<sup>™</sup>) supplemented with 1x N2, 1x B27, 1x NEAA, 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (all from ThermoFisher Scientific), 3 μM CHIR99021, 1 μM PD0325901 (both from Calbiochem) and LIF (generated in house). For differentiation towards the ectoderm cells were cultured in N2B27 containing medium without the two inhibitors and LIF. For differentiation into endoderm (Foxa2-GFP ESC) and mesoderm (T-GFP ESC), the two inhibitors and LIF were replaced by 30 μg/ml ActivinA (MPI protein facility) or 10 μg/ml BMP4 (R&amp;D Systems), respectively. The cells were seeded on gelatin-coated dishes with a density of 15000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and grown for 4 to 5 days before they were harvested for experiments.</p>
<p>Oct4-GFP ESC were additionally cultured on gelatin-coated plates in DMEM (high glucose, GlutaMAX<sup>™</sup>) supplemented with 10% Pansera ES FBS (PAN Biotech), 1x NEAA, 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin, 50μM 2-mercaptoethanol (all from ThermoFisher Scientific) and LIF (MPI-CBG protein facility).</p>
<p>For SILAC-labeling the standard DMEM was replaced with SILAC-DMEM medium (-Arg, -Lys) supplemented with 40 mg/mL <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>4</sub> <sc>l</sc>-arginine and 80 mg/mL <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> <sc>l</sc>-lysine (Sigma Isotec or Euris-top) or the corresponding non-labeled amino acids, respectively. All other supplements were maintained as described. Cells were grown for five passages, lysed and checked for successful label incorporation by MS.</p>
<p>EsiRNAs were synthesized as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref013">13</xref>]. For the lncRNA screen cells were transfected with esiRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref014">14</xref>]. GFP fluorescence and cell numbers were measured after 96 hours of differentiation using a FACS Calibur (BD biosciences) equipped with an HTS loader for high throughput analysis.</p>

<title>Transient overexpression</title>
<p>The cDNAs for lncR492 and HuR were amplified by PCR introducing <italic>NheI</italic> and <italic>XhoI</italic> restriction sites in the flanking regions. After sequencing, the PCR products were cloned into the pCGIT destination vector under the CAG promoter (a kind gift from Prof. Palle Serup). pCGIT without insert was used as control (EV—empty vector).</p>
<p>ESCs were transiently transfected with the overexpression or control plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific). 50 ng of plasmid DNA were combined with 0.2 μl Lipfectamine 2000 and incubated in 50 μl OptiMEM for 10 minutes. The transfection mix was added to one well of a 96-well plate. 4500 cells per well in 200 μl N2B27 medium supplemented with 2i+LIF were seeded on top. After 24h differentiation was initiated as described above.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>RT-PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). For each RT reaction 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific) utilizing oligo(dT)<sub>18</sub> primer. Standard RT-PCR reactions were performed with a MyTaq<sup>™</sup> Red DNA Polymerase (Bioline). Quantitative RT-RCRs (qRT-PCR) were run with the SYBR Green qPCR kit (Abgene) on an CFX96 Touch<sup>™</sup> Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Measured transcript levels were normalized to <italic>Gapdh</italic>. Samples were run in duplicates. Primers used are listed below.</p>
<p>For endonuclease treatment 5 μg RNA were treated with a 5’-phosphate-dependent exonuclease according to manufactor’s instructions (mRNA-ONLY<sup>™</sup> Eukaryotic mRNA Isolation Kit, EpiCentre). Subsequent 500 ng of RNA were reverse transcribed as described above.</p>

<title>Northern blot</title>
<p>The sequences of the gene-specific Northern blot probes are listed below (written 5’ to 3’). Two probes per gene were mixed together. Northern blot was performed according to the DIG Northern Starter Kit’s (Roche) manual. Briefly, RNA was separated on a pre-cast 1% agarose gel at 35V for 3.5h in 1x MOPS buffer. The separated RNA was blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) and cross-linked by UV-light. The membrane was prehybridized with DIG easy Hyb for 30 minutes at 68°C, followed by an hybridization step with a DIG-labeled, gene-specific RNA probe mix diluted in DIG easy Hyb over night at 68°C. Unspecific binding was eliminated by several stringency washes. Thereafter the membrane was blocked, incubated with a DIG-specific antibody and washed. Finally, the membrane was incubated with CDP-<italic>Star</italic> solution, exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare), which was developed using an OPTIMAX (PROTEC).</p>

<title>RNAi screen identifies lncRNA regulating ectodermal differentiation</title>
<p>Sox1 is one of the earliest transcription factors marking the neural ectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref015">15</xref>] and Sox1-GFP ESCs have been demonstrated to be capable of differentiating into neural progenitors when cultured in serum-free N2B27 supplemented medium without LIF (or other pluripotency maintaining cues) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref016">16</xref>]. To identify lncRNAs that regulate ectodermal differentiation we used an established esiRNA library targeting 642 lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref009">9</xref>] in differentiating Sox1-GFP mouse ESC. Sox1-GFP ESCs were cultured in medium supplemented with N2B27+2i+LIF under self-renewing conditions. Cells were then transfected with esiRNAs in 384-well plates while still maintaining pluripotency growth conditions. At 24 hours post transfection the medium was changed to N2B27 medium to stimulate neural differentiation. To identify differences in the differentiation behavior, the number of Sox1-GFP+ cells was analysed by FACS in a high-throughput manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This approach allowed identifying both inducers (increased fraction of Sox1 positive cells) and inhibitors (reduced fraction of Sox1 positive cells) of ectodermal differentiation in a single screening setup. Knock-down of Apc, a component of the ß-catenin destruction complex, results in an activation of Wnt signalling, which has previously been shown to negatively affect neuroectodermal differentiation in ESC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref018">18</xref>] and was therefore used as one of the controls in our screen. As a second control Rad21 was used, as its knock-down leads to a general differentiation into all lineages, including Sox1-positive ectodermal cells.

<p>The primary screen resulted in 9 lncRNA hits with a Z-score &gt; 3 or &gt; -3 scoring in two biological replicates, whereof 3 up-regulated and 6 down-regulated the number of Sox1-GFP+ cells after knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s004">S1 Table</xref>). For the validation screen a second independent, non-overlapping esiRNA for each hit was designed and tested. With stringent criteria, 3 of our 9 candidates scored in 6 out of 7 replicates demonstrating a robust phenotype. Among the validated screening hits <italic>lncR492</italic> (accession no. <italic>AK016992</italic>) had the strongest effect (Z-score (1<sup>st</sup> esiRNA) = 4.0 and Z-score (2<sup>nd</sup> esiRNA) = 5.4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To verify the results obtained in the screen we tested the knock-down efficiency of the utilized esiRNAs targeting <italic>lncR492</italic>. Both esiRNAs achieved a knock-down efficiency of &gt;60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and were able to consistently reproduce the screening phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the lncRNAs have been identified by computational annotation. Thus, they are classified as &gt;200 nucleotides long transcripts with no coding potential. Coding potential calculators have been utilized to score the coding potential of <italic>lncR492</italic>. CPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref021">21</xref>] and CPAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref022">22</xref>] analysis resulted in a negative coding potential score (-1.17) and a low coding probability (0.05) for <italic>lncR492</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), supporting the non-coding assignment. <italic>LncR492</italic> is located within the first intron of the protein-coding gene <italic>Srrm4</italic>, a splicing factor involved in the development of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref024">24</xref>]. Due to its intronic location we first wanted to exclude that <italic>lncR492</italic> is an alternative exon of the host protein-coding gene. Northern blot analysis with a <italic>lncR492</italic>-specific probe identified a single band of approx. 1.4 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), confirming that <italic>lncR492</italic> is an <italic>Srrm4</italic>-independent transcript.</p>

<p>Like mRNAs many lncRNAs are poly(A)-tailed and capped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref006">6</xref>]. cDNA synthesis using Oligo(dT) primers confirmed that <italic>lncR492</italic> has a poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Furthermore, we were able to amplify <italic>lncR492</italic> after exonuclease treatment, verifying the existence of RNA capping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). To further characterize and attempt a functional description, we investigated its cellular localization. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed a predominant nuclear localization of <italic>lncR492</italic>. The specificity of the FISH signal was confirmed by a loss of signal after <italic>lncR492</italic> knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Consistent with FISH, nuclear fractionation followed by qRT-PCR analysis confirmed an enrichment of <italic>lncR492</italic> in the nuclear lysate together with <italic>U1 snRNA</italic> and <italic>Malat1</italic> mRNA, whereas the coding mRNA of <italic>Gapdh</italic> was enriched in the cytoplasmic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g002">Fig 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the esiRNA-based screen in differentiating ESCs identified <italic>lncR492</italic> as a non-coding nuclear transcript, which might play a role in regulating ectodermal cell fate commitment.</p>

<title><italic>lncR492</italic> impedes ESC differentiation in a lineage specific manner</title>
<p>The screening result suggested that <italic>lncR492</italic> acts as an inhibitor of ectodermal differentiation.

<p>The ectoderm-specific action of <italic>lncR492</italic> was further supported by an increased abundance of beta-3-tubulin (Tubb3)-positive cells in the <italic>lncR492</italic> knock-down condition compared to cells treated with a control esiRNA as seen by immunofluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Additionally, we analysed the gene expression of pluripotency as well as germ layer specific genes during the time course of differentiation after lncRNA knock-down. Knock-down of <italic>lncR492</italic> accelerated the loss of <italic>Oct4</italic> gene expression slightly without affecting <italic>Nanog</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In accordance with the initially observed inductive effect on Sox1, <italic>lncR492</italic> knock-down resulted also in an increased expression of the neural markers <italic>Pax6</italic>, and <italic>Nestin</italic> from day 3 onwards, whereas the mesendodermal lineage markers <italic>T</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Hence, our knock-down experiments suggest that loss of <italic>lncR492</italic> is required to enable differentiation towards the neural lineage.</p>
<p>Next we wanted to test whether overexpression of <italic>lncR492</italic> is sufficient to block neural commitment. To test this hypothesis, we transfected the Sox1-GFP ESCs with a plasmid that overexpressed <italic>lncR492</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) and plated the cells under conditions that promote differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The percentage of Sox1-GFP+ cells dropped significantly from over 20% to roughly 5% unmasking the ability of <italic>lncR492</italic> to block neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of <italic>lncR492</italic> had no effect on T-GFP and Foxa2-GFP differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g003">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>), demonstrating that overexpression of <italic>lncR492</italic> does not per se block ESC differentiation. To confirm that the observed phenotypes are not cell line specific, we repeated the knockdown and overexpression experiments in a second mouse ES cell line (R1/E) and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To verify that <italic>lncR492</italic> is not required for the maintenance of ESC stemness, we tested whether its mis-expression affects Oct4 expression under self-renewing conditions. To address this, Oct4-GFP ESCs were first cultured and transfected in N2B27 medium supplemented with 2i+LIF. 48h post transfection, neither <italic>lncR492</italic> knockdown, nor overexpression showed any changes in Oct4-GFP expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). To exclude that the result was dependent on the chosen self-renewal culture condition, we repeated the experiment with Oct-GFP cells cultured in the presence of FCS+LIF. Again neither knock-down nor overexpression altered the number of Oct4-GFP positive cells. In contrast, knock-down of Rad21 reduced the number of Oct4-GFP positive cells, signifying loss of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s002">S2F Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref020">20</xref>]. Thus, we were able to confirm that <italic>lncR492</italic> is not involved in the maintenance of pluripotency but that it has its regulatory function in the lineage specific inhibition of ESC differentiation towards the neural lineage.</p>

<title><italic>lncR492</italic> interacts with HuR and inhibits neuroectodermal differentiation by activating Wnt signaling</title>
<p>Several lncRNAs have been shown to regulate their neighboring genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref025">25</xref>]. To test whether this is true for <italic>lncR492</italic>, we tested the effect of <italic>lncR492</italic> knock-down and overexpression on <italic>Srrm4</italic> expression. Experiments employing two independent esiRNAs targeting <italic>lncR492</italic> as well as overexpression of <italic>lncR492</italic> did not significantly change the mRNA levels of <italic>Srrm4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s003">S3A Fig</xref>), indicating that <italic>lncR492</italic> exerts its function without regulating the expression of <italic>Srrm4</italic>. To search for other possible mechanisms of <italic>lncR492</italic> action we employed a proteomic approach.</p>
<p>To identify putative proteins that physically interact with <italic>lncR492</italic>, we used SILAC-based RNA pull-downs followed by mass spectrometry to identify proteins bound to the <italic>lncR492</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We generated five 450 bp long overlapping fragments of <italic>lncR492</italic> by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. As negative control for the RNA pull-downs a fragment of the well characterized <italic>PTPN13</italic> mRNA with exactly the same size was chosen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref026">26</xref>]. For each of the five overlapping fragments proteins were enriched as putative specific interaction partners (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s003">S3B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s005">S2 Table</xref>). Among the strongest <italic>lncR492</italic>-binding candidates was HuR (encoded by <italic>Elavl1</italic>), which was most enriched in pull downs with fragment 1 (1–450 bp, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) as well as fragment 4 (671–1130 bp, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s003">S3B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s005">S2 Table</xref>). Western blot analysis indeed confirmed the interaction of HuR with fragment 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Repeating this western blot produced virtually identical results (data not shown). HuR is a known mRNA binding protein involved in both, mRNA decay and stabilization, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref028">28</xref>] and has been described in supporting lncRNA function during muscle differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref029">29</xref>] and in cancerogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref028">28</xref>]. Thus, we decided to test whether HuR is involved in <italic>lncR492</italic>’s role as ectodermal inhibitor.</p>

<p>HuR has been shown to bind to ARE-containing (adenylate–uridylate-rich elements) mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref030">30</xref>] and RNA-protein interaction studies have identified additionally uracil-rich motifs specific for HuR mRNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref032">32</xref>]. Our sequence analysis of <italic>lncR492</italic> revealed two distinct uracil-rich regions, where we were able to map several of the described heptameric or 17- to 20-base long motifs. In the 5’ region a 57 bp long motif-containing sequence (HuR BS1) was identified as well as an 11 bp long sequence in the 3’ region (HuR BS2) of the transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). The position of HuR BS1 correlates with the HuR enrichment in the RNA pull-down experiment, as it is located within the first fragment (1–450 bp). Assuming that <italic>lncR492</italic> and HuR act in a complex, we wanted to test whether knock-down of HuR results in a similar phenotype as the <italic>lncR492</italic> knock-down. EsiRNA mediated knock-down as well as overexpression of HuR was confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s003">S3D Fig</xref>). ESC differentiation in N2B27 after HuR knock-down resulted in an increase of Sox1-GFP+ cells, similar to what was observed after <italic>lncR492</italic> knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Importantly, <italic>lncR492</italic> overexpression was able to reverse the knock-down phenotype in Sox1-GFP ESC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Likewise overexpression of HuR was capable of reducing the differentiation into Sox1-GFP+ cells significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). In accordance with the <italic>lncR492</italic> results, differentiation into Foxa2-GFP+ cells was not affected by HuR mis-expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s003">S3E Fig</xref>). However, knock-down and overexpression of HuR reduced and increased T-GFP expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>). Given that <italic>lncR492</italic> knock-down and overexpression did not affect differentiation into T-GFP+ cells, this result suggests additional functions of HuR with an <italic>lncR492</italic>-independent mechanism here. Similar to <italic>lncR492</italic>, HuR is not required to maintain self-renewal, as the pluripotency marker Oct4 was not altered after HuR knock-down or overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s003">S3F Fig</xref>). Hence, phenotypic consequences after HuR knockdown and overexpression on the Sox1-GFP reporter mirrored the <italic>lncR492</italic> phenotype to a large extend, suggesting that <italic>lncR492</italic> and HuR are interlinked.</p>
<p>Due to HuR’s potential to bind mRNA as well as non-coding RNA, we next wanted to verify whether HuR has an impact on <italic>lncR492</italic> gene expression. Interestingly, knock-down and overexpression of HuR resulted in a respective decrease and increase of <italic>lncR492</italic>, whereas <italic>Srrm4</italic> transcript levels were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). These results suggest that binding of HuR to <italic>lncR492</italic> regulates the stability of <italic>lncR492</italic>.</p>

<p>Among its broad spectra of action, HuR has also been shown to regulate Wnt signaling in a context dependent manner. HuR was shown to block Wnt5a signaling in human breast cancer by direct inhibition of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref033">33</xref>], whereas in the intestinal epithelium HuR supports Wnt signaling by stabilizing LRP6 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref034">34</xref>]. Together with the known inhibitory effect of Wnt signaling on neural differentiation, we finally tested, whether <italic>lncR492</italic> together with HuR have an impact on this signaling pathway. We utilized the TOPFlash luciferase reporter assay to monitor canonical Wnt signaling after <italic>lncR492</italic> and HuR mis-expression. Both, knock-down of <italic>lncR492</italic> as well as HuR reduced Wnt signaling significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of <italic>lncR492</italic> and HuR enhanced Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191682.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), confirming, that <italic>lncR492</italic> together with HuR augments Wnt signaling, which in return might exert the inhibitory effect on neural differentiation in ESCs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RNAi based libraries targeting protein coding as well as non-coding genes have been valuable tools to study gene function in pluripotent ESC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref035">35</xref>]. Our present work establishes that loss-of-function screens for lncRNAs via RNAi are also feasible in differentiating ESCs. Taking advantage of the Sox1-GFP reporter cell line, we were able to identify lineage specific lncRNAs regulating ectodermal differentiation. Notably, our hits did not score in a pluripotency screen with the same library in ESC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref009">9</xref>] demonstrating further applications for RNAi-based lncRNA screens in the lineage transition, here towards the ectoderm. Reporter cell lines for the endodermal and mesodermal lineages could be used in the future to complement the dataset for the first lineage commitment in ESC relating to gastrulation. This might not only allow for the identification of lineage specific lncRNAs, but also help to discover lncRNAs that regulate differentiation more globally.</p>
<p>Many functionally studied lncRNAs have been shown to regulate their neighboring genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref036">36</xref>]. <italic>LncR492</italic> is located within the first intron of the protein-coding gene <italic>Srrm4</italic>. However, knock-down and overexpression of the lncRNA did not affect <italic>Srrm4</italic> expression. In fact, <italic>Srrm4</italic> is hardly expressed in ESC and was only marginal up-regulated after 4 days of differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191682.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), which is in accordance with literature, where <italic>Srrm4</italic> has been shown to play a role later on during neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref023">23</xref>]. Interestingly, Srrm4 was assigned the function of regulating alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref024">24</xref>], a cellular function that has been shown to involve lncRNAs such as <italic>Malat1</italic> and <italic>Pnky</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref038">38</xref>]. Therefore, it might be interesting to investigate whether there exists a functional relation between <italic>lncR492</italic> and <italic>Srrm4</italic> in later developmental stages and whether this includes alternative splicing.</p>
<p>In our study, we identified and validated the mRNA binding protein HuR as interaction partner of <italic>lncR492</italic> during the regulation of neural differentiation. Yet, <italic>lncR492</italic> is not the first lncRNA that has been described to act in concert with HuR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref042">42</xref>]. All these studies including ours demonstrate that lncRNAs are essential in specifying the large repertoire of functions that HuR can fulfill. Thereby, HuR can have a stabilizing or destabilizing property depending on the spatial and temporal context. This highlights once more the regulatory function of lncRNAs. Interestingly, several other proteins known to be involved in regulating ESC identity and differentiation were also identified to interact with <italic>lncR492</italic> in our mass spec analysis, suggesting that protein interactions of this lncRNA could be complex. Additional work will be required to unravel the protein interaction network of <italic>lncR492</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, we could show that both, <italic>lncR492</italic> and HuR, are involved in maintaining Wnt signaling, as knock-down and overexpression of both genes resulted in a decrease and increase of Wnt signaling, respectively. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies in ESC have shown that the upregulation of Wnt antagonist like Dkk1 and Sfrp2 are required for neuroectodermal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref018">18</xref>]. Also members of the Tcf/Lef protein family were shown to balance self-renewal and differentiation as down-stream effectors of Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0191682.ref045">45</xref>]. Further studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which <italic>lncR492</italic> in concert with HuR control Wnt signaling during the transition from pluripotency to neuroectodermal differentiation.</p>
