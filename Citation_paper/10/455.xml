<title>Background</title>
<p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major worldwide constraint to crop productivity on acidic soils. Al becomes soluble at low pH, inhibiting root growth and severely reducing yields. Maize is an important staple food and commodity crop in acidic soil regions, especially in South America and Africa where these soils are very common. Al exclusion and intracellular tolerance have been suggested as two important mechanisms for Al tolerance in maize, but little is known about the underlying genetics.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>An association panel of 282 diverse maize inbred lines and three F<sub>2</sub> linkage populations with approximately 200 individuals each were used to study genetic variation in this complex trait. Al tolerance was measured as net root growth in nutrient solution under Al stress, which exhibited a wide range of variation between lines. Comparative and physiological genomics-based approaches were used to select 21 candidate genes for evaluation by association analysis.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Six candidate genes had significant results from association analysis, but only four were confirmed by linkage analysis as putatively contributing to Al tolerance: <italic>Zea mays Alt<sub>SB</sub> like</italic> (<italic>ZmASL</italic>), <italic>Zea mays aluminum-activated malate transporter2</italic> (<italic>ALMT2</italic>), <italic>S-adenosyl-L-homocysteinase (SAHH)</italic>, <italic>and Malic Enzyme</italic> (<italic>ME</italic>). These four candidate genes are high priority subjects for follow-up biochemical and physiological studies on the mechanisms of Al tolerance in maize. Immediately, elite haplotype-specific molecular markers can be developed for these four genes and used for efficient marker-assisted selection of superior alleles in Al tolerance maize breeding programs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity from acidic soil is a major constraint to worldwide crop production. Al, one of the most abundant elements in the soil, is solubilized as Al<sup>3+</sup> under acidic soil conditions. This form of Al is highly toxic to plant roots. Approximately 30% of the worlds ice-free soils are acidic, 17% of which are considered arable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Uexkll1">[1]</xref>. Maize has become one of the most important grain crops grown on acidic soils due to its demand as a food crop and its ability to tolerate Al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Uexkll1">[1]</xref>. Up to a 70% reduction in maize yields have been seen in these regions due to Al toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Uexkll1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Welcker1">[3]</xref>. Acid precipitation and intensive agricultural practices such as overuse of ammonia fertilizers accelerate the natural process of soil acidification, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Rao1">[4]</xref>. Soil amelioration with compounds such as lime can be used to temporarily neutralize the topsoil. However, this is not a feasible option for resource poor farmers or for subsoil acidity, and is not an economically or agronomically sustainable solution. Investing in the production of Al tolerant maize varieties and alternative management practices can contribute greatly to increased yield and sustainable crop production from acidic soils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-VargasDuque1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Granados1">[6]</xref>. Therefore, an understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying Al tolerance in maize is essential to accelerate the development of Al tolerant varieties.</p>
<p>The toxic effects of acid soil result from an interaction between pH and elements in the soil. Several metals, including Al and Mn, become soluble at and below pH 5.5, which causes stress in the plant. In a neutral or basic environment, Al is found in insoluble divalent and monovalent forms of Al-oxides or Al-hydroxides, but the soluble trivalent Al<sup>3+</sup> ion becomes the dominant species in an acidic environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Rao1">[4]</xref>. Al<sup>3+</sup> disrupts many physiological processes in plants through both apoplastic and symplastic interactions, but exact mechanisms remain elusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Kochian1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Poschenrieder1">[8]</xref>. The root apex is the most sensitive part of the plant to Al because it is the site of cell division and expansion for the root <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Delhaize1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Ryan1">[10]</xref>. Al-induced inhibition of root growth is the primary symptom of Al toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Kochian1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Delhaize1">[9]</xref>. Reduction in root growth and function leads to increased susceptibility to other stresses, primarily drought and mineral deficiencies, due to the limited capacity of Al-intoxicated roots to acquire sufficient water and nutrition from the soil. There have been numerous mechanisms proposed for Al toxicity, but it is likely from the disruption of a number of different processes. One important site of Al<sup>3+</sup> intoxication is the cell wall of the root apex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Kollmeier1">[11]</xref>. In response to Al<sup>3+</sup> exposure, callose formation seals off the cell walls, increasing rigidity, decreasing extensibility and preventing further transport into the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Jones1">[12]</xref>. Al<sup>3+</sup> displaces Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which are required for ATPases, cell signaling, and altering or inactivating the function of many proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Delhaize1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Kochian2">[13]</xref>. Other possible mechanisms of Al toxicity include interference with the cytoskeleton, promotion of lipid peroxidation and blocking of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Yamamoto1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Jones2">[15]</xref>. Specifically for maize grown in the field, Al intoxication causes several stress related physiological effects, including stunting, reduced number of ears per plant, delayed flowering, and reduced biomass and total yield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Welcker1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-VargasDuque1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Plants have developed several mechanisms for dealing with Al toxicity, which can be classified as either external or internal tolerance mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Kochian2">[13]</xref>. External mechanisms include differential binding of Al to the cell wall, selective permeability of the plasma membrane, formation of a plant induced pH barrier in the rhizosphere, and root exudation of chelating compounds, such as organic acids (OA) or phenolic compounds. Internal mechanisms include chelation of Al in the cytosol, compartmentalization in the vacuole, Al-binding proteins, Al tolerant enzyme isoforms, and elevated enzyme activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Rao1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Kochian2">[13]</xref>. Most Al tolerance research has focused on Al induced root exudation of OA to chelate Al in the rhizosphere, where non-toxic complexes can be formed between Al and an OA such as citrate. Root exudation of OAs is a widespread response to Al in both monocots and dicots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Ma1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Ryan2">[17]</xref>. This mechanism has been shown to play a role in Al tolerance in several species though the activation of anion transporters in the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Ma1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Magalhaes1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Maize has considerable genetic variation in levels of Al tolerance, but clear physiological bases and molecular mechanisms for this tolerance remain elusive. Physiological studies found that OA exudation contributes to maize Al tolerance, but is not the only mechanism, as some Al sensitive varieties have been shown to exude high amounts of OA from the roots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Pieros1">[21]</xref>. Differences in cell wall pectin content and degree of methylation have also been suggested to contribute to Al tolerance in maize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Eticha1">[22]</xref>. Understanding the mechanisms of Al tolerance can accelerate the efforts to identify and incorporate superior genes and alleles into maize breeding programs. Recurrent selection has been used to develop Al tolerant maize populations with yields as much as 200% greater than susceptible lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Welcker1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Edmeades1">[23]</xref>. However, a strong genetic by environment (GxE) interaction and relatively low heritability of Al tolerance in maize complicates selection and has made substantial progress difficult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Welcker1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-VargasDuque1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Pandey2">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>The genetic variation for Al tolerance in maize indicates it is a complex trait, involving many genes and physiological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Welcker1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Pandey2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Garvin1">[25]</xref>. Several QTL studies examined Al tolerance in maize, and suggest that about 6 loci account for ∼60% of the variation in tolerance levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Pieros1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Sibov1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Mason1">[28]</xref>. However, QTL in these different biparental populations are not shared, suggesting genetic heterogeneity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Holland1">[29]</xref>. This is not unreasonable, as the first two populations were constructed from South American maize varieties and the latter from North American lines. Transgressive segregation is seen in these three biparental mapping populations indicative of additive and/or interaction effects among alleles contributed by the two parents. Al stress was likely a powerful selective force during maize domestication and early improvement, as maize exhibits regional adaption to various levels of Al toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Rao1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Biparental crosses used in linkage mapping, in which one or a few loci controlling Al tolerance may segregate, provide limited insight into the analysis of complex traits in general <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Holland1">[29]</xref>. Linkage mapping has strong statistical power and is useful for understanding how and to what extent allelic effects are dependent on one another, but provides low genetic resolution unless the population is very large <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Buckler1">[30]</xref>. Alternatively, association mapping is a method for high-resolution mapping of QTL based on linkage disequilibrium (LD), and is useful for dissecting complex traits controlled by multiple QTL in species where LD decays rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Holland1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Buckler1">[30]</xref>. Unlike linkage mapping, where only two alleles are evaluated, association mapping evaluates a greater number of alleles in a broader population. Linkage mapping uses shared inheritance of polymorphism and linked markers within families of known ancestry. Association mapping takes advantage of the historic recombination of several hundred lines, to identify common genes contributing to the trait of interest. The LD structure of the gene is essential in association mapping. This approach allows evaluation of genes from smaller sampled regions, within the range of LD decay, instead of requiring complete candidate gene sequencing. This method requires three data types: phenotypic trait information, genotypic data from or near the gene of interest and an understanding of population structure within the test panel. Beyond the requirement for prior molecular knowledge, the other principal disadvantage of association mapping is that spurious marker trait associations can arise from population structure. However, we can identify many of these false positive results via a mixed linear model (MLM) approach, which takes population structure and varietal relatedness into account <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Yu1">[31]</xref>. The combination of association mapping and linkage mapping can provide both the power and resolution needed for detecting QTL of interest.</p>
<p>In this study, we used an integrated approach combining association mapping with linkage mapping to identify and evaluate candidate Al tolerance genes in maize. Without positively identified mechanisms or biochemical pathways involved in Al tolerance, selection of candidate genes requires knowledge based on previous studies and proposed mechanisms. We tested 21 candidate genes for association with Al tolerance, in a maize diversity panel of 282 inbred lines, using the MLM approach discussed earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Yu1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-FlintGarcia1">[34]</xref>. Candidate genes were screened in a subset of 27 diverse lines (DL), selected to be representative of the genetic and phenotypic diversity in the association panel, in order to identify highly polymorphic regions for further association studies. Due to strong GxE effects in field studies of Al tolerance, selection or testing of tolerance in pots of acid soil or hydroponics solutions is a quick and efficient way to determine tolerant and sensitive lines in maize while controlling for environmental effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-UrreaGomez1">[35]</xref>. Al tolerance levels were measured, as net root growth (NRG) in nutrient solution containing a toxic level of Al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Magnavaca1">[36]</xref>. Several genes were found to be associated with NRG under Al stress and subsequently confirmed using linkage analysis.</p>

<title>Phenotypic data</title>
<p>Phenotypic data for Al tolerance in the maize association panel was collected as net root growth (NRG) in a hydroponic nutrient solution with or without a toxic level of Al<sup>3+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Pieros2">[37]</xref>. Al stress measurements were taken before and after 2 days of stress in a hydroponic solution containing {27 µM Al<sup>3+</sup>} at pH 4.0. A control treatment was carried out over the same time period in an identical hydroponic solution, containing no Al<sup>3+</sup>. A wide range of tolerance levels is seen in this panel for both control NRG and Al treated NRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009958-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009958.s001">Table S1</xref>). Mean NRG under control treatment and under Al stress was 50.04±11.58 mm and 37.79±11.91 mm, respectively. Differences between the two groups were highly significant (p = 1.5×10<sup>−27</sup>). Mean correlation between replications was 42.5% in Al stress treatments and 37.3% in control treatment replications.</p>

<p>Narrow sense heritability (h<sup>2</sup>) for NRG in the Diversity Panel, calculated using the relatedness (K) matrix, was between 30 and 32% in the Al stress environment and 22% without Al stress. Broad sense heritability (H<sup>2</sup>) for NRG under Al stress and without Al stress was 41% and 37%, respectively.

<title>Genotypic data</title>
<p>Genotypic data for association mapping came from polymorphisms identified in candidate gene sequences. Genes were chosen based one of two factors: as responsive to Al-stress treatments according to gene expression analysis or by sequence similarity to Al tolerance genes found in other species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009958-t001">Table 1</xref>). Genes throughout the remainder of this study are referred to by the Gene ID listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009958-t001">Table 1</xref>. Thirteen candidate genes were identified as differentially responsive to Al stress treatments in root tips, from Al tolerant and Al sensitive maize lines, in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Maron1">[38]</xref>.

<p>Six genes had statistically significant associations (p≤0.01) with NRG under Al stress and were selected for further study in F<sub>2</sub> linkage populations: <italic>malic enzyme (ME)</italic>; <italic>isocitrate lyase (ISL)</italic>; <italic>SAH hydrolase (SAHH)</italic>; <italic>ZmALMT2 (ALMT2)</italic>; <italic>ZmASL (ASL)</italic>; <italic>pectin methylesterase (PME)</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009958-t002">Table 2</xref>). Complete results from the MLM analysis can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009958.s003">Table S3</xref>. <italic>ISL</italic> was statistically significant at a less stringent value (p&lt;0.05) for Al stress. In order to estimate the number of expected false positives due to multiple testing of sites, a false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated for each model using 1,095 random SNPs throughout the genome. FDR allows for the comparison of significant sites in our candidate genes to those we would expect to see by random chance alone. Based on the FDR values for the MLMs, about 24% of the sites under the Q+K model and 34% under the Q+K+C model under Al stress could be accounted for by false positives. Given this high rate for false discovery, it is crucial to test the connection between the six genes with putative association to Al stress tolerance using an independent line of reasoning.</p>

<title>Linkage mapping</title>
<p>If the association analysis truly identified Al tolerance genes, then the associated SNPs should explain significant variance for Al tolerance in segregating populations. Linkage mapping could therefore be used to test the results of association mapping. Linkage to Al tolerance was tested for the six genes listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009958-t002">Table 2</xref> using three F<sub>2</sub> populations. F<sub>2</sub> populations were phenotyped in the same manner as the association panel and genotyped for the sites of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009958.s004">Table S4</xref>). These F<sub>2</sub> populations were constructed so that each would segregate for polymorphisms associated with two putative Al tolerance loci: <italic>ZmASL</italic> and <italic>SAHH</italic> within B73×CML247; <italic>ME</italic> and <italic>ISL</italic> within B73×CML333; <italic>PME</italic> and <italic>ZmALMT2</italic> within B73×NC350 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009958-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A comparison of means for each allelic class suggested that the polymorphisms tested at <italic>ZmASL</italic>, <italic>SAHH</italic>, <italic>ME</italic>, and <italic>ZmALMT2</italic> were significantly associated with Al tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009958-g002">Figure 2</xref>). However, allelic means for <italic>ISL</italic> and <italic>PME</italic> were equivalent no matter the state, suggesting that the polymorphisms tested were not associated with Al tolerance. Linkage was tested by GLM for the 4 putative Al tolerance genes, assuming complete dominance (<italic>ZmASL</italic>, <italic>SAHH</italic> and <italic>ZmALMT2</italic>) or additive gene action (<italic>ME</italic>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009958-t003">Table 3</xref>). These results indicate that small effect (3–6% variance explained) QTL exist for Al tolerance at these four loci. No significant interactions between Al tolerance genes were found, suggesting that epistasis is not at work. The identification of <italic>ISL</italic> and <italic>PME</italic> as Al tolerance gene based on association mapping were likely false positives, as there was no linkage to Al tolerance differences with the polymorphisms tested in F<sub>2</sub> populations, and is consistent with our expectations based on the FDR calculation.</p>

<p>Two minimally overlapping regions of this gene were sequenced in the association panel, covering a total of ∼1.7 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009958-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These regions represent the first three exons and part of the fourth, and were selected as they were highly polymorphic for both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, including 7 of the 12 common amino acid substitutions. Based on this sequence the remaining 5 amino acid substitutions were inferred from haplotype structure. The MITE insertion in the 5′ UTR was also scored in the panel.

<p>Instead of utilizing one of the associated SNPs, an indel polymorphism identified in the first intron during whole gene sequencing was used for the linkage analysis. The choice of the indel provided us a simple PCR based assay for genotyping and took advantage of the difference in genetic resolution between association mapping and linkage mapping. Far fewer recombination events were captured in the F<sub>2</sub> population than in the association panel, thus an indel that was not scored in the complete association panel was equally useful for linkage analysis.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found four new genes that may contribute to Al tolerance in maize by integrating several approaches. Candidate genes were selected based on comparative genomics and gene expression analysis, which we evaluated with association and linkage mapping. Two of these genes, <italic>ZmALMT2</italic> and <italic>ZmASL</italic>, are very similar to Al-activated organic transporters that play crucial roles in determining Al tolerance in other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Magalhaes1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Sasaki1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Wang1">[43]</xref>. Whether these new maize genes are also membrane transporters has yet to be determined. <italic>ME</italic> and <italic>SAHH</italic> are involved in several central metabolism reactions and speculations on their contribution to Al tolerance can be made based on previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Ravanel1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Detarsio1">[48]</xref>. The low heritability and complex nature of Al stress tolerance makes it challenging for both genetic improvement and genetic dissection. This complexity highlights the value for molecular markers for use in breeding programs for Al tolerance. To maximize their efficacy, molecular markers should be closely linked to major tolerance loci, so that markers are highly concordant with the desired genotypes. Given the limited amount of DNA sequence obtained for association mapping within many of the genes we investigated, we cannot positively identify these particular polymorphisms as causative without further investigation. However, they are most likely in LD with causative sites or contribute to an allelic series controlling Al tolerance, and therefore will be highly useful as markers for selection of Al tolerance materials. We demonstrated that using polymorphisms identified during gene sequencing as markers for linkage analysis allowed us to confirm the identification for four of the six putative Al tolerance genes. We utilized sites that were both significantly associated with Al tolerance differences in the association panel and sites not significantly associated, taking advantage of the difference in genetic resolution between association and linkage mapping. It was important to use linkage mapping to test the genes identified from association mapping, as we predicted a high rate for false discovery based on empirically calculating an FDR. Each of the Al tolerance loci produced similar phenotypic effects in both the association panel and F<sub>2</sub> populations (13–20% increases in NRG). While none of these new Al tolerance genes represent major effect QTL, combining multiple small QTL can make a significant impact to enhance the desired trait. In the B73×CML247 F<sub>2</sub> population, combining the elite alleles of <italic>ZmASL</italic> and <italic>SAHH</italic> enhanced net root growth by 30% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009958-t003">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009958.s004">S4</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>ZmASL</italic> (<italic><underline>Z</underline>ea <underline>m</underline>ays <underline>A</underline>lt<underline><sub>S</sub></underline><sub>B</sub> <underline>l</underline>ike</italic>) is a maize gene homologous to <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic>, the major Al tolerance gene from sorghum and is a member of the <underline>M</underline>ultidrug <underline>A</underline>nd <underline>T</underline>oxic Compound <underline>E</underline>xtrusion (MATE) family of transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Magalhaes1">[20]</xref>. Both proteins are predicted to contain 10 putative transmembrane domains. It is unknown whether the <italic>ZmASL</italic> gene mediates Al-activated root citrate efflux, as is the role of <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> in sorghum. Although many sites in <italic>ZmASL</italic> were associated with NRG under Al stress, none were amino acid substitutions. The significant sites we detected may be in LD with regulatory elements of the gene, as is the case in <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic>, where polymorphisms in the promoter help to determine the level of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Magalhaes1">[20]</xref>. <italic>ZmASL</italic> contained the most significant independent sites of any gene tested, but also contained extensive LD among many of the other significant sites. Fortunately, future experiments to evaluate the relationship of <italic>ZmASL</italic> with Al tolerance will be relatively straightforward given the presumed gene function.</p>
<p><italic>SAHH</italic>, <italic>S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase</italic>, is an enzyme that removes the feedback inhibitor of SAM (<italic>S-adenosylmethionine</italic>) mediated methylation in any organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Ravanel1">[47]</xref>. Any enzymatic process that requires high rates of SAM-mediated methylation will also require high SAHH activity, including DNA/RNA modification, nucleic acid metabolism, and synthesis of cell wall constituents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Li1">[49]</xref>. <italic>SAHH</italic> has a high degree of sequence conservation among eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Li1">[49]</xref>. In plants, <italic>SAHH</italic> is a cytokinin binding protein in plants, induced by auxin and cytokinin, and has been associated with salt-stress response in spinach and sugar beets and viral resistance in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Ravanel1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Weretilnyk1">[50]</xref>. The isoform of maize <italic>SAHH</italic> we examined was previously found to be highly expressed in root tips under Al stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Maron1">[38]</xref>. The connection of SAHH to Al tolerance could come through any of several mechanisms due to the broad range of processes the enzyme is involved in. However, given recent reports on the correlation pectin methylation in cell walls with Al tolerance and Al exclusion, it is certainly possible the <italic>SAHH</italic> contributes to Al tolerance differences via cell wall modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Eticha1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Yang1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>NADP-ME (ME)</italic> catalyzes the conversion of malate to pyruvate. The maize <italic>ME</italic> examined in this study was the cytosolic rather than plastidic isoform of the enzyme. Maize <italic>Cyt-ME</italic> is highly similar to <italic>Cyt-ME</italic> found other in C3 and C4 plant species. This isoform was found to be expressed in the embryo and emerging roots, with expression responsive to hypoxia and drought <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Detarsio1">[48]</xref>. High malate and other organic acid concentrations are optimal for activity of the cytosolic isoform and not inhibitory as is the case in plastidic isoforms of NADP-ME <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Detarsio1">[48]</xref>. There is strong evidence that Al-activated release of malate underlies wheat Al tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Delhaize1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Ryan2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Sasaki1">[39]</xref>. Malate appears to chelate and detoxify Al in the apical rhizosphere or the apoplastic space. ME may help regulate malate concentration in the cytosol, which could connect to Al tolerance either through OA efflux or internal detoxification of Al via Al-OA chelation.</p>
<p><italic>ME</italic> was unusual among the genes we examined as the results from linkage and association studies were opposite in direction, while still both highly significant. In the association mapping, three significant sites were identified – a site in the first exon (SNP #4), which was in linkage equilibrium with all other sites, and two sites in the second intron (SNP #7 and SNP #11), which were in high linkage disequilibrium with all of nearby the SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009958-g005">Figure 5c</xref>). Based on these sites, we predicted that the B73 allele would be inferior to the CML333 allele. However, in the linkage mapping B73 was superior to CML333 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009958-g002">Figure 2</xref>). One possible explanation is that an allelic series exists at <italic>ME</italic> that was not observed in the polymorphic sites studied in the association panel. However, an allelic series could be detected in the larger linkage blocks of the segregating population. We see evidence of allelic series in several other candidate genes studies in maize, such as <italic>su1</italic> and <italic>LcyE</italic>, that also exhibit these inconsistencies between association and linkage mapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Harjes1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>ALMT2</italic> is related to transport proteins that have been found to contribute to Al tolerance in <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and <italic>Brassica napus</italic>, and are either activated or show enhanced malate efflux in response to external Al<sup>3+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Hoekenga1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Sasaki1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Ligaba1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Kovermann1">[56]</xref>. It is proposed that binding of Al<sup>3+</sup> to the transporter induces a conformational change, opening the anion channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Pieros4">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Kovermann1">[56]</xref>. However, not all ALMT family proteins are Al-activated or important for Al tolerance processes. <italic>AtALMT9</italic> encodes a vacuolar malate transporter, instead of being localized to the plasma membrane like <italic>AtALMT1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Hoekenga1">[18]</xref>. Unlike <italic>AtALMT1</italic>, <italic>AtALMT9</italic> is completely unresponsive to Al treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Kovermann1">[56]</xref>. The first <italic>ZmALMT</italic> family member to be characterized, <italic>ZmALMT1</italic>, transports inorganic anions and not malate, and is not activated by exogenous Al<sup>3+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Pieros3">[54]</xref>. Based on its transport properties and expression, <italic>ZmALMT1</italic> was determined not to be involved in maize Al tolerance. This is consistent with the results from the association analysis, as <italic>ZmALMT1</italic> was not associated with NRG under Al stress. Only <italic>ZmALMT2</italic> was found to be significant for Al tolerance of the seven <italic>ZmALMT</italic> genes that we evaluated by association analysis. Future work on <italic>ZmALMT2</italic> will include a biophysical characterization of the protein to verify that it does encode an Al-activated OA transporter.</p>
<p>In summary, we used association mapping to evaluate twenty-one candidate Al tolerance genes. Linkage mapping was used to test six putative Al tolerance genes found from association mapping; this was especially important given the high predicted FDR for the association mapping. Linkage mapping supported four of the six genes as true Al tolerance genes. These four genes, <italic>ZmASL</italic>, <italic>ZmALMT2</italic>, <italic>ME and SAHH</italic>, are excellent candidates for future laboratory and field-based studies on Al tolerance in maize. Although the most significant polymorphisms explain less than 3% of the variation seen in the association panel, our best marker can increase NRG up to 20%. If this increased root growth transfers to field trials, integration of these markers could substantially improve maize root growth and overall maize yield under Al toxic conditions.</p>

Linkage mapping experiments were conducted with three independent F<sub>2</sub> populations derived from B73 and one of three other inbred lines from the maize association population (CML247, CML333, NC350).

<title>Phenotypic analysis</title>
<p>Maize seeds were germinated in either autoclaved sand or on filter paper, moistened with deionized water, for 3–5 d at 28°C in continuous darkness. Seedlings were rinsed and placed into sample cups suspended in 8L vessels containing a nutrient solution without Al<sup>3+</sup> at pH 4.0, for 1 d, for acclimation to hydroponic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009958-Pieros2">[37]</xref>. When plants were placed into hydroponic culture, secondary roots were removed to promote measurement of primary seminal root growth only. Tubs were aerated and plant grown under controlled environmental conditions (26°C day/24°C night, 16 h/8 h photoperiod). After 24 hrs of acclimation, initial root growth (IRG) measurements were taken using rulers with millimeter precision and solutions were replaced with Magnavaca nutrient solution containing {27 µM Al<sup>3+</sup>} at pH 4.0 (Al stress treatments) or Magnavaca nutrient solution containing no Al<sup>3+</sup> at pH 4.0 (control treatments), for 2 d. After 2 d of Al stress final root growth (FRG) measurements were taken. Net root growth (NRG) was calculated as FRG – IRG.</p>
<p>Five replicate experiments were performed for Al stress treatments, while three replicates were performed for the control treatment. In each experiment, 3–4 individuals for each of the 282 inbred varieties in the association panel were phenotyped in each replicate experiment. Least squares means (LSmean) for both traits were calculated in SAS version 9.1 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and used as the phenotypic values in all models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009958.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>F<sub>2</sub> linkage populations were phenotyped in a similar manner, with {27 µM Al<sup>3+</sup>} at pH 4.0, with the modification that 200 F<sub>2</sub> individuals were evaluated for each cross plus parental checks (n = 10). Leaf tissue was collected for DNA extraction and genotypic analysis after FRG measurements.
