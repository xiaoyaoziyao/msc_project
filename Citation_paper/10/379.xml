<title>Background</title>
<p>A fundamental requirement for the exploitation of embryonic stem (ES) cells in regenerative medicine is the ability to reproducibly derive sufficient numbers of cells of a consistent quality in a cost-effective manner. However, undifferentiated ES cells are not ideally suited to suspension culture due to the formation of cellular aggregates, ultimately limiting scalability. Significant advances have been made in recent years in the culture of ES cells, including automated adherent culture and suspension microcarrier or embryoid body bioreactor culture. However, each of these methods exhibits specific disadvantages, such as high cost, additional downstream processes or reduced cell doubling times.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>Here we show that abrogation of the cell surface protein E-cadherin, using either gene knockout (Ecad-/-) or the neutralising antibody DECMA-1 (EcadAb), allows culture of mouse ES cells as a near-single cell suspension in scalable shake flask culture over prolonged periods without additional media supplements. Both Ecad-/- and EcadAb ES cells exhibited adaptation phases in suspension culture, with optimal doubling times of 7.3 h±0.9 and 15.6 h±4.7 respectively and mean-fold increase in viable cell number of 95.1±2.0 and 16±0.9-fold over 48 h. EcadAb ES cells propagated as a dispersed cell suspension for 15 d maintained expression of pluripotent markers, exhibited a normal karyotype and high viability. Subsequent differentiation of EcadAb ES cells resulted in expression of transcripts and proteins associated with the three primary germ layers.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>This is the first demonstration of the culture of pluripotent ES cells as a near-single cell suspension in a manual fed-batch shake flask bioreactor and represents a significant improvement on current ES cell culture techniques. Whilst this proof-of-principle method would be useful for the culture of human ES and iPS cells, further steps are necessary to increase cell viability of hES cells in suspension.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells, with their self-renewal ability and multiple lineage differentiation capacity, are attractive for many applications in regenerative medicine and drug screening. Mouse ES (mES) cells are derived from the inner cell mass of pre-implantation embryos and, although only present as a transient population <italic>in vivo</italic>, they can be propagated <italic>in vitro</italic> for extended periods when cultured in appropriate medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Evans1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Martin1">[2]</xref>. A popular method for the culture of mouse ES cells is adherent culture in the presence of serum and the cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Smith1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Williams1">[4]</xref>, although serum free media have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Ying1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Ying2">[6]</xref>. A fundamental element necessary to exploit the potential of ES cells in drug testing and regenerative therapies is the ability to reproducibly derive sufficient numbers of cells of a consistent quality in a cost-effective manner. Adherent methods currently employed for ES cell culture are unable to provide a suitable culture system due to the heterogeneous static conditions, resulting in batch-to-batch variation, labour intensive methodology and ultimately, restricted cell number due to the available surface area, leading to limitations in scalability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Fok1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Thomson1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Suspension bioreactors represent a cost-effective approach for the culture of cell lines and are common in industrial biotechnology applications, where nominal volumes of 25 mL to 6L are typically utilised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Buchs1">[10]</xref>. The advantage of this culture method is the provision of a scalable, non-intensive and relatively homogenous high cell volume density microenvironment which can be easily monitored. However, undifferentiated ES cells are typically anchorage dependent and are not ideally suited to suspension culture due to the formation of cellular aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Thomson1">[9]</xref>. One method of overcoming cellular aggregation in suspension bioreactors is to utilise microcarriers to aid cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Fok1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Abranches1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Dang1">[13]</xref>. Microcarriers exhibit a high surface-area-to-volume ratio which eliminates the surface area restriction of adherent culture techniques. However, this method also exhibits some disadvantages, including unknown effects of hydrodynamic shear stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Abranches1">[11]</xref>, cell agglomeration (or bead bridging) as well as additional expense and down-stream purification to remove cells from the microcarrier. An alternative method is the embryoid body (EB) cultivation method, which utilises shear stress to control aggregate size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Fok1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Cormier1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Tsuji1">[15]</xref> and may contain enzymatic dissociation steps to prolong culture times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-ZurNieden1">[16]</xref>. However, this approach is disadvantaged by diffusion limitations within individual EBs leading to EB agglomeration and less efficient cellular expansion compared to conventional culture methods.</p>
<p>Therefore, a suspension method that can eliminate cellular aggregation whilst providing a cost-effective approach to ES cell culture is highly desirable. We have previously demonstrated that mES cells lacking E-cadherin exhibit loss of cell-cell contact and exhibit a mesenchymal-like phenotype when grown under adherent culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Soncin1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Spencer1">[18]</xref>. Therefore, one mechanism for reducing cellular aggregation and EB agglomeration in mES cell suspension bioreactor culture may be the abrogation of E-cadherin protein. Fok &amp; Zandstra (2005) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Fok1">[7]</xref> have demonstrated that E-cadherin is the cause of aggregation in both microcarrier and EB bioreactor culture of mES cells, however, they concluded that expression of E-cadherin protein is desirable to maintain culture robustness. Our unpublished data suggested that culture of <italic>E-cadherin</italic> null (<italic>Ecad</italic>-/-) ES cells in suspension under low shear conditions, such as in the NovaPod™ bioreactor, enabled rapid expansion of undifferentiated cells with high viability. In the current study, we show that abrogation of E-cadherin mediated cell-cell contacts in mES cells allows for robust and scalable culture of the cells in a manual fed-batch shake flasks, akin to that utilised for bacterial culture. Furthermore, EcadAb ES cells grown for 15 d in shake flask culture maintain high viability, normal karyotype and pluripotency. This is the first demonstration of a near single-cell suspension culture method allowing the expansion of undifferentiated mES cells over prolonged periods and represents a significant improvement on current ES cell culture techniques by eliminating batch-wise enzymatic passaging variation and offering significantly decreased operator times.</p>

<title>Static Suspension culture of E-cad -/- ES cells</title>
<p>Wt and Ecad-/- ES cells (10<sup>6</sup> total cell seeding) were cultured in suspension in media lacking LIF in plastic bacteriological Petri dishes (Corning). Cell suspensions were agitated every 24 h by pipetting. Cells were passaged typically every 2 d by transfer of 2.5 mL of cell suspension into 7.5 mL of fresh medium.</p>

Cultures were sampled every 24 h over a 96 h period in triplicate to determine optimal conditions for bioreactor culture. Upon optimisation, vented shake flasks (125 mL) (Corning) were inoculated with 1.0E+04 viable cells/mL (vc/mL) <italic>E-cad</italic>-/- ES cells in a working volume of 25 mL media and placed on a shaking platform (1″ orbit- 140 rpm; Satorius, Surrey, UK) at 37°C/5%C0<sub>2</sub>. Flasks were sampled every 48 h and results plotted for each sample prior to being split to 1.0E+04 vc/mL using freshly prepared media. For EcadAb ES cell culture, shake flasks were inoculated as described in a working volume of 25 mL media supplemented with 4 µl/mL DECMA-1 antibody (Sigma, Dorset, UK) under the above conditions. Flasks were sampled every 72 h and results plotted for each sample prior to cultures being split to 1.0E+04 vc/mL using freshly prepared media and antibody.

<title>Human ES cell culture</title>
<p>Human ES cells (H1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Thomson2">[21]</xref> were cultured in 60 mm dishes (BD Falcon, Oxfordshire, UK) coated with 0.1%w/v gelatin and 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/dish of irradiated MF1 mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEfs) feeder cells. Cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 20% knockout serum replacement, 1 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% non-essential amino acids and 4 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (all Invitrogen) and incubated at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were mechanically passaged every 7–9 days and transferred to new MEF feeder layers. For static suspension culture, cells were instead transferred to uncoated 60 mm dishes and media supplemented with an E-cadherin neutralising antibody (2 µg/ml SHE78.7, Invitrogen) or isotype control antibody (2 µg/ml mouse IgG2a, Invitrogen).</p>

<title>Static Suspension Culture of Wt and <italic>E-cad-/-</italic> ES Cells</title>
<p>We have previously shown that <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells exhibit loss of cell-cell contact and are able to self-renew in serum-supplemented medium in the absence of LIF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Soncin1">[17]</xref>. To determine whether <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells would remain undifferentiated in static suspension culture in the absence of LIF, we grew the cells in bacteriological grade dishes for 30 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g001">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cell cultured in static suspension culture exhibited weak cell-cell interaction and failed to establish characteristic EB morphology compared to wtEBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g001">Figure 1A(i) and (ii</xref>), respectively). Following 30 d in suspension culture, expression of SSEA-1 was determined by fluorescent flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). WtES cells exhibited low levels of SSEA-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g001">Figure 1B(i)</xref>) whereas the <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- cell population exhibited &gt;95% of the cells expressing SSEA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g001">Figure 1B</xref>(ii)). To further confirm the undifferentiated phenotype of <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells, we assessed expression of transcripts encoding <italic>Oct-3/4</italic>, and the differentiation markers <italic>Fibroblast growth factor-5</italic> (<italic>Fgf5</italic>), <italic>Transthyretin (Ttr</italic>), <italic>ζ- globin (Zg</italic>), <italic>Brachyury (T)</italic> and <italic>α-fetoprotein (Afp)</italic> following 14 d in suspension culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). WtES cells exhibited expression of <italic>Ttr</italic>, <italic>Fgf5</italic>, <italic>Zg</italic>, <italic>T</italic> and <italic>Afp</italic> and lack of <italic>Oct3/4</italic> transcripts, demonstrating differentiation of a significant proportion of cells within the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g001">Figure 1C(i)</xref>).

Note that <italic>Ecad-/-</italic> ES cells maintain expression of Nanog, whereas wtES cells do not exhibit any Nanog positive cells. (E) H1 human ES cells were cultured in static suspension for 24 h in the presence of an isotype control antibody (Ei) or an E-cadherin neutralising antibody (Eii). Cells grown in control antibody formed typical EB morphology and cell-cell contacts. However, cells grown in neutralising antibody had low viability; forming aggregates of non-viable cells.</p>

<title>Static suspension culture of human ES cells</title>
<p>Since we have shown that abrogation of E-cadherin in adherent human ES cell culture results in loss of cell-cell contact without induction of differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Eastham1">[22]</xref>, we assessed whether these cells could survive in static suspension culture in the presence of an E-cadherin neutralising antibody (SHE78.7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Morphological analysis following 24 h in suspension showed that control antibody-treated cells maintained cell-cell contacts and viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g001">Figure 1E</xref>i); however, whilst neutralising antibody-treated cells exhibited decreased aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g001">Figure 1Eii</xref>) this was associated with very low viability.</p>

<title>Effect of inoculation density on <italic>Ecad-/-</italic>ES cell growth and viability in shake flask culture</title>
<p>Static batch culture of <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells was found to be an ineffective process as the loose cell aggregates required dispersing every 24 h, therefore, we investigated whether <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells could be cultured using a shake flask bioreactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2</xref>). An initial agitation rate of 140 rpm was chosen as this rate is commonly used in shake flask mammalian cell culture (Lea, personal communication). Analysis of inoculation densities of 5×10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup> and 2×10<sup>5</sup> viable cells (vc)/mL over 48 h revealed that lower densities were more favourable for maintaining cell viability above 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To further investigate the optimal inoculation density, we seeded shake flasks with 1×10<sup>4</sup>, 2.5×10<sup>4</sup>, 4×10<sup>4</sup> and 5×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL and assessed total viable cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2B(i)</xref>) and percentage viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2B(ii)</xref>) over 96 h. Peak total viable cell number was achieved at 48 h in the majority of inoculation densities, except for 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL, which peaked at 72 h. Mean cell viability was similar between all inoculation densities over 48 h (&gt;90%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2b(ii)</xref>), with 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL exhibiting increased viability over 72 h.

<title>Effect of agitation rate on <italic>Ecad-/-</italic> ES cell growth and viability in shake flask culture</title>
<p>To determine the effect of agitation on <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cell growth and viability in shake flasks, we cultured 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL in 25 mL media over 96 h at 120, 140 and 160 rpm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Viable cell numbers were greatest at 120 and 160 rpm following 96 h in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2D</xref>(i)). However, culture viability at 160 rpm decreased significantly to &lt;60% within 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2D(ii)</xref>) and, although the cell numbers continued to increase throughout the culture period, the decreased viability was considered sub-optimal. This was also reflected in culture morphology, where cellular debris and small rounded clumps of cells were observed at 160 rpm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2E(i)</xref>, 48 h shown). Cell viability rates of &gt;90% were observed at 120 rpm over 72 h and this was increased further (∼95%) at 140 rpm. Under all agitation rates, cell viability was decreased at 96 h which is likely to reflect exhaustion of essential media component(s). Agitation rates of 120 rpm and 140 rpm resulted in dispersed growth of <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells, with minimal aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2E</xref>(ii) and (iii), respectively at 48 h).

<title>Culture of <italic>Ecad-/-</italic> ES cells in manual fed-batch shake flask culture</title>
<p>To determine whether a continual supply of ES cells could be achieved using a fed-batch approach over a specified time frame, shake flasks were inoculated with 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL in 25 ml media and maintained at 140 rpm at over a 16 d period. Flasks were sampled every 48 h, viable cell counts determined and 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL used as an inoculum in 25 mL of fresh medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). At 48 h, total viable cell number and fold-increase in viable cells was similar to that observed in batch culture. However, at 96 h there was a significant increase in both total viable cell number and fold-increase in viable cells, suggesting the cells undergo an adjustment phase in the initial 48 h of culture. For example, at 48 h the fold increase in viable cells was 29-fold (±2.5) compared to 86.5-fold (±2.8) at 96 h. Over the subsequent culture time, viable cell number and fold increase in viable cells remained relatively constant, with a mean fold increase in cell number of 88.6±2.3 over any 48 h period. A mean cell viability of 80%±12.5 was observed over the culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2H</xref>), with the lowest viable cell count associated with the proposed adjustment phase at 96 h.

<p>EcadAb ES cells grown in adherent culture in the presence of DECMA-1 antibody as above were used to inoculate 25 mL of media with 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL, 5×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL or 1×10<sup>5</sup> vc/mL and cultured in shake flasks at 140 rpm for 96 h. Viable cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g003">Figure 3B</xref>(i)) and percentage viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g003">Figure 3B</xref>(ii)) were assessed every 24 h. A significant increase in cell number was detected within the 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL and 5×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL cultures, whereas, the 1×10<sup>5</sup> vc/mL culture exhibited decreased cell numbers compared to the inoculum density. Cell viability was highest in the 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL cultures over 96 h, with mean cell viability of 99.0±0.1% at 24 h and 60.6±0.95% at 96 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g003">Figure 3B</xref>(ii)). Culture morphology throughout showed that EcadAb ES cells appeared predominantly as a single cell suspension, with rows of cells observed suggestive of actively replicating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g003">Figure 3C</xref>(i); 48 h shown), although some small cell aggregates were visible within the culture. By contrast, wtES cells cultured in the absence of DECMA-1 exhibited tightly formed cell aggregates and relatively static cell numbers over the culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g003">Figure 3C</xref>(ii); 48 h shown). Inoculum densities of EcadAb ES cells above 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL also resulted in significantly increased levels of cell aggregation (data not shown). To assess the optimal antibody concentration required to support dispersed growth and maximal viable cell densities, four concentrations of DECMA-1 antibody (2 µl-, 4 µl-, 6 µl- &amp; 8 µl/mL) were examined over 96 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) using an inoculum density of 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL. Total viable cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g003">Figure 3D</xref>(i)) and percentage viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g003">Figure 3D</xref>(ii)) were assessed every 24 h.

This may reflect higher concentrations of sodium azide in these samples which is contained in the DECMA-1 diluent. Concentrations of 4 µl/mL of DECMA-1 resulted in high cell viability and reproducible growth kinetics of EcadAb ES cells. In addition, cultures exhibited predominantly single cell suspension growth with evidence of actively dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g003">Figure 3E</xref>; 48 h shown (i) ×20, (ii) ×40 magnification).</p>

Triplicate flasks were inoculated with 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL in 25 mL media supplemented with 4 µl/mL DECMA-1 antibody and maintained at 140 rpm.

Every 72 h, a proportion of the population was utilised to provide a fresh inoculum of 1×10<sup>4</sup> vc/mL. Viable cell number and fold-change in cell number demonstrates two distinct stages over the 15 d culture period, similar, albeit delayed, to that observed with Ecad-/- ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). During the first 288 h of culture the cells exhibited an average of 7.7±1.8-fold increase in cell numbers and relatively similar total viable cell numbers every 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g003">Figure 3F</xref>(i)). This is consistent with that observed for wtES cells cultured in adherent culture in the presence of 4 µl/mL of DECMA-1 (data not shown). After 360 h, total viable cell number and fold-change in cell number was increased 2.5-fold, equating to a mean fold increase in cell number of 25.3±0.9 over a 72 h period. Mean cell viability was 86%±2.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012921-g003">Figure 3F</xref>(ii)) for the duration of the culture period.

Population doubling times were calculated as previously, resulting in doubling times ranging between 15.6 h–27.1 h. Karyotype analysis confirmed that following 15 d in suspension culture no abnormalities were present in EcadAb ES cells. The cumulative expansion of EcadAb ES cells achieved was 133-fold over the 15 d culture period, equating to 1.33×10<sup>6</sup> total viable cells from a single 25 mL working volume. However, using cells adapted to suspension culture, the total viable cell count over 15 d would reach approximately 3×10<sup>8</sup> cells from a single 25 mL working volume.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A fundamental element necessary to exploit the potential of ES cells in drug discovery applications and regenerative medicine is the translation of cost-effective cell culture protocols into large scale cell expansion methods. Although major advances in bioreactor culture of mouse and human (hES) cells have been made in recent years, there remain significant disadvantages with current methods, particularly in relation to the effect of cellular aggregation on scalability. ES cells readily form aggregates when placed into suspension culture and the formation of these EBs in the absence of LIF is an effective method for induction of differentiation of mES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Murray1">[26]</xref>. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that bioreactor culture of mES cells as aggregates retain pluripotency when cultured under specific conditions, the efficiency of these protocols are restricted by potential cellular necrosis within the centre of the aggregate and, more importantly, unwanted spontaneous differentiation of the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Sen1">[27]</xref>. Furthermore, enzymatic dissociation required for passaging of these aggregates results in significant cell loss/death. Encapsulation methods are disadvantaged by increased costs in down-stream processes needed to separate the cells from the microcarrier. Our proof-of-principle experiments demonstrate a novel technology for the expansion of pluripotent mES cells as a near-single cell suspension within a manual fed-batch single closed system.</p>
<p>In the current study, we initially assessed the phenotype of <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES when grown under static suspension culture conditions. <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells failed to form characteristic EB morphology compared to wtES cells following 30 d in culture. This result supports the observation that <italic>Ecad-</italic>/- ES cells exhibit loose cell-cell contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Larue1">[19]</xref> and that E-cadherin is responsible for cellular aggregation in suspension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Fok1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Dang1">[13]</xref>. Culture of <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells in shake flasks resulted in proliferation and maintenance of an undifferentiated cell phenotype. The doubling times observed for <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells were less than half of that reported for wtES cells grown in various suspension culture formats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Fok1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Dang1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Cormier1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-ZurNieden1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Dang2">[28]</xref>. These results demonstrate that abrogation of E-cadherin mediated cell-cell contact results in increased ES cell proliferation. This corroborates our previous observations in adherent culture, where <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells exhibited a 1.7-fold increase in proliferation compared to wtES cells (Ward, unpublished data).</p>
<p>Several studies have suggested that inhibition of E-cadherin in suspension culture of ES cells would be detrimental to cell viability. Fok and Zandstra (2005) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Fok1">[7]</xref> concluded that expression of E-cadherin protein is desirable to maintain ES cell culture robustness. They reported that <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells were unable to maintain viability when propagated at 100 rpm in spinner flask cultures. This discrepancy may be due to increased shear forces acting upon the cells in spinner flask cultures compared to shake flasks. Dang et al (2004) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Dang1">[13]</xref>, showed significant inhibition of EB agglomeration following treatment of established EBs with DECMA-1 in suspension culture. Therefore, E-cadherin is involved in both cell-cell and EB-EB contact, demonstrating the advantage of abrogation of this protein at the outset of suspension culture. However, Dang et al (2004) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Dang1">[13]</xref> suggested that the use of E-cadherin blocking antibodies in culture may adversely affect cell differentiation due to the critical function of E-cadherin in tissue organisation and regulation of gene expression. We have already demonstrated that abrogation of E-cadherin in mES cells does not affect their pluripotency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Soncin1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Spencer1">[18]</xref>. It has been suggested that mES cells are anchorage dependent and require appropriate support for suspension culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Abranches1">[11]</xref>. Our data demonstrates that this cannot be true since culture of EcadAb ES cells in suspension does not adversely affect either viability or proliferation of the cells. Indeed, given the shorter doubling times of our EcadAb ES cells when adapted to suspension culture, it is more likely that E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact negatively regulates ES cell proliferation in adherence culture.</p>
<p>Culture morphology of EcadAb ES cells in shake flasks showed that the cells appeared predominantly as a near-single cell suspension with minimal cell aggregation. A pronounced peak in total viable cell number was observed following 13 d in culture, indicating that the cells undergo an adjustment phase. However, this adjustment phase was not unique to EcadAb ES cells since <italic>Ecad</italic>-/- ES cells also exhibited a significant peak in total viable cell number at 96 h. Adjustment phases in mammalian cell culture are common and can be induced by changes in growth medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Ying1">[5]</xref> and substratum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Strasberg1">[29]</xref>. Maximum EcadAb ES cell expansion was achieved following 14 d in culture, with a mean fold-increase in cell number of 25.3±0.9 over a 72 h period with resultant population doubling times ranging between 15.6 h and 27.1 h. These doubling times are shorter than those reported for wtES cells grown as suspension aggregates. For example, Fok et al (2005) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Fok1">[7]</xref> reported doubling times of 24-39 h for wtES cells grown as aggregates in spinner flask culture and, more recently, Kehoe et al (2008) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Kehoe1">[30]</xref> demonstrated the expansion of mES cells in serum free media achieved a 20-fold increase in cell number over 96 h. However, one group report expansion of pluripotent wtES cells as aggregates in stirred bioreactor cultures with doubling times of ∼16 h, yet only yielding an approximate 31-fold increase in cell numbers over 5 d <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Cormier1">[14]</xref>. In a similar study, zur Neiden et al (2007) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-ZurNieden1">[16]</xref> reported doubling times of 15 h during early passaging of their ES cell aggregates. However, these aggregates required trypsinisation every 4 d. Therefore, near-single cell suspension culture of mES cells in shake flasks is as efficient as the best methods described, but offers the advantage of not been subjected to batch-wise enzymatic passaging variation and is a significant improvement compared to many current methods of ES cell culture.</p>
<p>A suspension method that can eliminate cellular aggregation whilst providing a cost-effective approach for hES or iPS cell culture is highly desirable and the technology presented in this study should be relevant to the suspension culture of both. We have previously shown that inhibition of E-cadherin in hES cells using a neutralising antibody under adherent culture conditions results in loss of cell-cell contacts without affecting cellular viability or inducing differentiation of the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Eastham1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, the ability to culture hES or iPS cells as near-single cell suspensions in shake flask bioreactors would revolutionise the stem cell field by providing a user friendly, adaptable and scalable system. However, some issues remain to be overcome, such as replacement of the antibody-mediated E-cadherin antagonist. Dang et al (2004) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Dang1">[13]</xref> stated that the use of blocking antibodies is not a cost-effective method for bioreactor culture of mES cells and this is true in the system described here. We are currently utilising peptide inhibitors of E-cadherin to provide cross-species reagents for the shake flask culture of ES cells. A difficulty we have observed with hES cells is their low viability in suspension culture. For example, H1 cells cultured in suspension in the presence of an E-cadherin neutralising antibody resulted in significant cell death after 24 h. Therefore, the culture of hES cells as a near-single cell suspension is likely to require additional factors to aid cell survival. One such factor is the small molecule ROCK inhibitor Y27632, which has been demonstrated to increase viability of dissociated hES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Harb1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0012921-Watanabe1">[32]</xref>. Whilst Y27632 can prolong hES cell survival in suspension culture, our intial data suggests that additional factors will be necessary to allow the derivation of large numbers of viable and undifferentiated hES cells over an extended period of time.</p>
