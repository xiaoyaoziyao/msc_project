          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Acid soils comprise up to 50% of the world's arable lands and in these areas aluminum (Al) toxicity impairs root growth, strongly limiting crop yield. Food security is thereby compromised in many developing countries located in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. In sorghum, <italic>SbMATE</italic>, an Al-activated citrate transporter, underlies the <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> locus on chromosome 3 and confers Al tolerance via Al-activated root citrate release.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology</title>
          <p>Population structure was studied in 254 sorghum accessions representative of the diversity present in cultivated sorghums. Al tolerance was assessed as the degree of root growth inhibition in nutrient solution containing Al. A genetic analysis based on markers flanking <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> and <italic>SbMATE</italic> expression was undertaken to assess a possible role for <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> in Al tolerant accessions. In addition, the mode of gene action was estimated concerning the Al tolerance trait. Comparisons between models that include population structure were applied to assess the importance of each subpopulation to Al tolerance.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion/Significance</title>
          <p>Six subpopulations were revealed featuring specific racial and geographic origins. Al tolerance was found to be rather rare and present primarily in guinea and to lesser extent in caudatum subpopulations. <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> was found to play a role in Al tolerance in most of the Al tolerant accessions. A striking variation was observed in the mode of gene action for the Al tolerance trait, which ranged from almost complete recessivity to near complete dominance, with a higher frequency of partially recessive sources of Al tolerance. A possible interpretation of our results concerning the origin and evolution of Al tolerance in cultivated sorghum is discussed. This study demonstrates the importance of deeply exploring the crop diversity reservoir both for a comprehensive view of the dynamics underlying the distribution and function of Al tolerance genes and to design efficient molecular breeding strategies aimed at enhancing Al tolerance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Aluminum (Al) tolerance has been deemed one of the main breeding targets in acid soil regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Garvin1">[1]</xref> and is of particular importance in sorghum in view of its primary role as a staple food and fodder crop in tropical and subtropical African countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Doggett1">[2]</xref>. At soil pH values below pH 5.0, rhizotoxic ionic forms of Al are solubilized into the soil solution, damaging sensitive root systems and reducing root growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Kochian1">[3]</xref>, finally resulting in severe yield losses. Fortunately, genetic variation for Al tolerance can be exploited in breeding programs to improve sustainable production on acid soils. In sorghum, the <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> locus, located on chromosome 3, was first identified as a major determinant for Al tolerance in the sorghum line SC283, explaining 80% of the phenotypic variation in a SC283-derived mapping population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Magalhaes1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Root organic acid release into the rhizosphere resulting in the formation of stable, non-toxic complexes with Al has long been hypothesized as a major physiological mechanism of tolerance via root Al exclusion in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Ma1">[5]</xref>. More recently, genes encoding root malate and citrate transporters belonging to the ALMT and MATE families, respectively, have been cloned in wheat (<italic>ALMT1</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Sasaki1">[6]</xref>), sorghum (<italic>SbMATE</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Magalhaes2">[7]</xref>) and barley (<italic>HvMATE</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Furukawa1">[8]</xref>). In sorghum, <italic>SbMATE</italic> has been shown to underlie the major Al tolerance locus, <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Magalhaes2">[7]</xref>. ALMT and/or MATE homologs with a likely role in Al tolerance have also been found in many other species such as maize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Maron1">[9]</xref>, Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Hoekenga1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Liu1">[11]</xref>, wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Ryan1">[12]</xref>, rape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Ligaba1">[13]</xref> and rye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Collins1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Yokosho1">[15]</xref>. Recent studies also indicated the importance of other genes acting both within and outside the organic acid release pathway that influence the ability of plants to deal with Al toxicity. The CH2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor, STOP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Iuchi1">[16]</xref>, has been shown to regulate both <italic>AtMATE</italic> and <italic>AtALMT</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Liu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Iuchi1">[16]</xref>, and <italic>ART1</italic>, a rice homolog of Arabidopsis <italic>STOP1</italic>, was shown to regulate the expression of several genes with possible roles in rice Al tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Yamaji1">[17]</xref>, a response that was also observed for <italic>STOP1</italic> in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Sawaki1">[18]</xref>. Nevertheless, mechanisms of Al tolerance different than Al-induced organic acid release have been suggested to be mediated by other genes such as those encoding ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters with a possible involvement in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Larsen1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Huang1">[21]</xref> as well as in rice Al tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Huang2">[22]</xref>. While the specific role of ABC transporters in Al tolerance is yet to be elucidated, these proteins have been hypothesized to mediate Al redistribution from sensitive sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Larsen1">[19]</xref>, Al sequestration into vacuoles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Larsen2">[20]</xref> or to promote cell wall modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Huang2">[22]</xref>. In addition, the rice Nramp metal transporter, <italic>Nrat1</italic>, has recently been proposed to mediate Al uptake as part of a tolerance mechanism based on sequestration of Al away from the cell wall into the symplasm of root cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Xia1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Sorghum</italic> Moench is a heterogeneous genus divided into 5 subgenera within which many species have been described including both rhizomatous and annual types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet1">[24]</xref>. Accordingly, subgenera <italic>Sorghum</italic> includes <italic>S. halepense</italic> and <italic>S. propinquum</italic>, two rhizomatous species, and <italic>S. bicolor</italic>, which comprises all annual taxa. Three subspecies have been recognized within <italic>S. bicolor</italic> reflecting cultivated taxa, wild types and stabilized weedy derivatives. <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> subsp. <italic>bicolor</italic> contains all of the cultivated sorghums <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Dahlberg1">[25]</xref> that are distributed among 28 grain sorghum types previously classified as species according to the original Snowden system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet1">[24]</xref>. Cultivated grain sorghums were ultimately classified into five basic botanical races defined based on panicle and spikelet morphological differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Harlan1">[26]</xref>. These races are bicolor, caudatum, durra, guinea and kafir, with an additional ten intermediates that were derived from intercrossing among members of the five main races. Sorghum domestication possibly occurred in the northeastern region of Africa at least 5000 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet2">[27]</xref>, giving rise to the early bicolor race <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet2">[27]</xref>. The origin of the guinea race probably took place in tropical West Africa resulting from selection for adaptation to a wet habitat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet3">[28]</xref>. From this region, the guinea race spread to Malawi and later to southern Africa along the mountains of eastern Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet1">[24]</xref>, being subsequently transported to Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet3">[28]</xref>. Guinea sorghums account for more than 70% of the sorghum cultivated in West and Central Africa and may account for more than 50% of all sorghum produced in Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Folkertsma1">[29]</xref>. The caudatum race probably originated in the area of original domestication of the species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet1">[24]</xref> from where it spread to West and South Africa. There is evidence suggesting a southern African origin for the kafir sorghums and the origin of the durra race might have taken place in northeastern Africa or Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet3">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Considering that Al tolerance is a rare event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Garvin1">[1]</xref>, efforts to broaden our still incipient understanding of the diversity of Al tolerance mechanisms in plants parallels the ‘needle in a hay stack’ scenario in germplasm banks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Prada1">[30]</xref>, where breeders are challenged with skimming through thousands of accessions in search for novel allelic variants for loci underlying desirable traits. To serve as a guide for these efforts, better knowledge on the relationship between population structure and Al tolerance for cultivated sorghums is sorely needed.</p>
      <p>Population substructure reflects the evolutionary history of a species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Platt1">[31]</xref> and can be understood as the presence of genetically differentiated subgroups in the original population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Hartl1">[32]</xref>. A myriad of factors can lead to genetic divergence within a population including local adaptation, selection and genetic drift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Hedrick1">[33]</xref>, and these factors may result in non-random distribution of important agronomic traits. In cultivated sorghum, genetic diversity patterns are influenced by both racial and geographical origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Deu1">[34]</xref>, resulting in well defined subgroups that can be studied for a possible relationship between Al tolerance and population structure.</p>
      <p>In the present study, the cultivated sorghum collection described by Deu and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Deu1">[34]</xref> was combined with a sorghum panel that is representative of the lines currently used by the Embrapa acid soil breeding program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Caniato1">[35]</xref>. The combined cultivated sorghum panel was then subjected to a population structure analysis. Our analysis strongly indicates that Al tolerance is a rare trait that is not randomly distributed considering the diversity patterns observed in cultivated sorghums. In addition, a wide range of diversity was observed for dominance behavior related to the Al tolerance trait, which ranged from almost complete recessivity to almost complete dominance. Finally, our population structure analysis allowed us to make inferences with regards to the origin and evolution of Al tolerance mutations in light of the domestication history leading to cultivated sorghums.</p>

        <title>Al tolerance variation</title>
        <p>At {27} µM Al<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s004">Table S1</xref>), 80% of the sorghum accessions were sensitive to Al (<italic>RNRG</italic><sub>5d</sub>&lt;30%), 14% were intermediately tolerant (30%&lt;<italic>RNRG</italic><sub>5d</sub>&lt;80%), and only 6% or 16 sorghum accessions showed <italic>RNRG</italic><sub>5d</sub>&gt;80%, thus being classified as highly Al tolerant (only these lines were designated Al tolerant in this paper). Accounting for lines that are breeding derivatives from known Al tolerant sources (e.g. the sorghum line 9929034 is derived from SC566, and CMS226 and CMS227 are derived from SC283), only 5% of the whole panel were found to be highly tolerant to Al. Sorghum Al tolerance is inducible over time, significantly increasing after two to three days of Al exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Magalhaes2">[7]</xref>. Here we have used an <italic><underline>I</underline></italic>nduction of <italic><underline>R</underline></italic>oot <italic><underline>G</underline></italic>rowth (<italic>IRG</italic>) index which is generated by dividing the daily rate of root growth calculated between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> days of Al exposure by that obtained between the 1<sup>rst</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> days. Differences in magnitude of the induction response were also observed across the panel with most of the accessions showing root growth inhibition at varying degrees (<italic>IRG</italic>&lt;1), and only 26 accessions showing induction of root growth for 3 to 5 days of Al exposure compared to root growth for 1 to 3 days in Al (<italic>IRG</italic>&gt;1). The induction response varied substantially among these 26 accessions, from nearly 1 (i.e. almost constant growth rates) to a 100% increase in the rate of root growth between days three and five in Al.</p>
        <p>At {39} and {60} µM Al<sup>3+</sup>, the sorghum accession IS14351 did not group with any other accession, showing the highest relative net root growth, which indicates it is the most Al tolerant accession in the panel.</p>
        <p>Principal Component Analysis allowed us to identify the first and second principal components as responsible for 98.7% of the total Al tolerance variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s005">Table S2</xref>). The first principal component (PC1), whose linear combination has positive eigenvector coefficients for all variables, can thus be interpreted as a general Al tolerance index, whereas the second principal component (PC2), explaining 12% of the variation, contrasts relative root growth assessed at 3 and 5 days of Al exposure to the induction response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s005">Table S2</xref>). The majority of the sorghum accessions in the diversity panel showed low scores for both PC1 and PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g001">Figure 1</xref>), reflecting the high frequency of Al sensitive accessions in the diversity panel. A significant spread in PC2 scores was observed with increasing tolerance (PC1&gt;0), with maximum amplitude being reached at PC1 near 2. Highly Al tolerant accessions (PC1&gt;3.5) showed PC2 scores in general between approximately +1.5 (IS26554) and −1.7 (IS29691). The relative importance of the induction response to <italic>RNRG</italic> varied, being substantial for accessions such as IS26554, similar in IS26457/CMS225 and smaller in IS29691 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The highly Al tolerant accession, IS14351, showed the lowest PC2 score, indicating a relatively lower importance for the induction response in this highly Al tolerant line.</p>

        <title>Genetic and expression analysis of Al tolerance</title>
        <p>We undertook linkage analysis between Al tolerance and markers flanking <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> to assess the role of the Al tolerance locus in the donor accessions. Because 80% of the accessions in the panel were Al sensitive, linkage analysis focused primarily on populations derived from the Al tolerant accessions. Populations derived from two intermediate accessions, IS21849 and IS23645, were also included in this analysis. Linkage analysis revealed that Al tolerance in IS14351, IS21519, IS21849, IS23645 and IS26554 can be attributed to the <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> locus, whereas significant marker-trait associations were not found for BC families derived from IS23142, IS26457 and IS29691 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s006">Table S3</xref>). However, analysis of Al tolerance for parents and derived F<sub>1</sub> hybrids indicated additive gene action (−0.3≤d/a≤+0.3) for 4 Al tolerance donors, whereas Al tolerance in 11 out of the 17 sorghum accessions was either a recessive (d/a≤−0.7) or partially recessive trait (−0.7&lt;d/a&lt;−0.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s007">Table S4</xref>). The sorghum accessions, CMS225 and SC283, showed the highest degree of dominance and strict complete dominance (d/a = 1) was never observed in this study. It should be noted that the power to detect genetic linkage in a backcross population decreases as gene action approaches complete recessivity, although this extreme situation was never observed in our dataset. Considering the rather recessive behavior of Al tolerance in IS23142 and IS26457, even with the lack of linkage with markers flanking <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic>, we cannot rule out the possibility that Al tolerance in these accessions is due to partially recessive <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> alleles. However, this possibility seems less likely for IS29691 in view of its rather additive mode of gene action for Al tolerance.</p>

        <p>We then studied expression for <italic>SbMATE</italic>, which underlies <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic>, in 7 Al tolerant accessions including IS14351, IS21519 and IS26554, whose Al tolerance was found to be due to <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> according to our genetic analysis, and IS23142, IS29691 and IS26457, for which non-significant marker-trait associations were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s006">Table S3</xref>). Two known sources of Al tolerance due to <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic>, SC283 and SC566, in addition to the Al sensitive standards, BR007 and BR012 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s004">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Caniato1">[35]</xref>), were also included as controls.

Expression in the tolerant lines ranged from ∼10- to ∼80-fold higher than that observed in BR012. This is consistent with a strong role of <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> in Al tolerance for these accessions despite the recessive mode of gene action observed in some sources. In agreement with our expectations, due to its extremely low level of <italic>SbMATE</italic> expression, only IS29691 is likely to strongly rely on Al tolerant loci distinct from <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic>.</p>

        <title>Distribution of Al tolerance with respect to racial classification</title>
        <p>The five basic morphological races were represented in the diversity panel with a larger and similar representation for the guinea and caudatum races (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Aluminum sensitive accessions tended to be randomly distributed across the major sorghum races with a slightly higher frequency in caudatum sorghums (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Nonetheless, the racial distribution for intermediate and Al tolerant accessions was strikingly different. The vast majority of intermediate accessions, 19, were found to be members of the guinea race with an additional 8 and 4 accessions belonging to guinea margaritiferums and the caudatum races, respectively. The remaining intermediate accessions were evenly distributed at a lower frequency within guinea-caudatums, bicolors or were uncharacterized for racial origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Seven of the sixteen Al tolerant accessions were guinea sorghums and two were caudatums, with one accession, IS23142, morphologically classified as a durra type. The six remaining Al tolerant accessions were breeding derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Because the sorghum panel is unbalanced with respect to racial representation, we undertook a Chi-square test for independence based on a six (number of accessions in each of the five basic sorghum races and guinea margaritferum)×2 (Al tolerant + intermediate and Al sensitive) contingency table. The results (χ<sup>2</sup> = 50.8, P[χ<sup>2</sup>&gt;50.8] = 1.3E-14) indicated that the distribution of Al tolerance cannot be explained solely by differences in racial representation in the diversity panel, thus significantly departing from a random pattern.</p>

The Polymorphic Index Content (PIC) value over the 38 SSR markers averaged 0.65, ranging from 0.19 for marker <italic>mSbCIR246</italic> to 0.93 for markers <italic>Xgap206</italic> and <italic>Xtxp321</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s008">Table S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Upon population structure analysis, the Ln(k) vs. k curve showed a steep increment in model likelihood up to k = 4 although additional but apparently slighter increments occurred between 5 and 12 subpopulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Using the Δk criterion, the most evident level of differentiation was observed with k = 4, but additional peaks, although much less evident, were also detected at k = 6 and k = 12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Nevertheless, the largest proportion of individuals assigned to a specific cluster with a cluster membership probability higher than 0.8 was obtained with k = 4 and k = 6, with 81 and 71%, respectively, contrasting with ∼60% for k = 12. However, particularly in sorghum, where hybridization between sorghum races is a common event, cluster membership should not be adopted as the sole criterion to define the most likely number of subpopulations. Thus, we subsequently analyzed in detail the nature of the clusters obtained setting k at 4 and 6 subpopulations. The corresponding clusters for k = 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) were composed of guinea accessions from western Africa and guinea margaritiferum (k4Q1), durra accessions from central-eastern Africa and from Asia, bicolor and caudatum accessions from Asia (k4Q2), caudatum accessions from Africa, a group of transplanted caudatum and durra accessions from the Lake Chad region, and lines from the Embrapa collection and the US (k4Q3), and kafir and guinea accessions from southern Africa (k4Q4). At k = 6, the former k4Q3 group was separated into k6Q2, which included caudatum accessions from Africa and a group of transplanted caudatum and durra accessions from the Lake Chad region, and k6Q3, with lines from the Embrapa collection and the US. In addition, the k4Q4 group was separated into k6Q4, which included kafir accessions from southern Africa and k6Q6, which included guinea accessions from southern Africa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s003">Figure S3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020830.s009">Table S6</xref>). Based on these results, we believe that six subpopulations result in a meaningful representation of the genetic diversity patterns underlying this panel, which led us to define k = 6 as the starting point to look into the distribution of Al tolerance in sorghum.</p>

        <p>The distribution of Al tolerance within each of the six subpopulations defined with STRUCTURE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g006">Figure 6B</xref>. The distributions were in general asymmetric and skewed towards Al sensitivity (<italic>RNRG</italic><sub>5d</sub>&lt;∼50%). Intermediate accessions were predominantly clustered in Q1 (guinea accessions from western Africa and guinea margaritiferum accessions), Q3 (lines from the Embrapa collection and US) and Q6 (guinea accessions from southern Africa and Asia), resulting in greater interquartile range for Q1, Q3 and Q6 compared to the other subpopulations. Al sensitive accessions were mainly clustered in Q2 (caudatum accessions from Africa and the group of transplanted caudatum and durra accessions from Lake Chad region), Q4 (kafir accessions from southern Africa) and Q5 (durra, bicolor and caudatum accessions from eastern Africa and Asia). Al tolerant accessions appear as outliers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g006">Figure 6B</xref> and were again predominantly present in Q1, Q3 and Q6 but were also present in Q2 (caudatum types).</p>

        <p>Finally, we undertook a series of model selection steps as an attempt to more formally isolate the individual contribution of the different subpopulations to Al tolerance. Our rationale is based on the idea that removing a subpopulation that captures a significant proportion of the Al tolerance variation from the model should result in a decrease in model likelihood. The complete model showed the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value, indicating that all subpopulations are important to explain the observed variation in Al tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020830-g007">Figure 7</xref>). However, excluding subpopulations, Q1, Q3 and Q6 resulted in a stronger reduction in model performance when compared to excluding the remaining subpopulations. Moreover, based on the increment in BIC estimates, guineas from southern Africa and Asia (Q6) appear to be the most important in capturing Al tolerance variation, followed by guinea accessions from western Africa and guinea margaritiferum (Q1), and lines from the Embrapa collection and the US (Q3). The contribution of the remaining subpopulations, Q2 and Q4, although significant, was lower than that of Q6, Q1 and Q3. This is expected, considering the lower representation of intermediate accessions in Q2 and Q4, whose removal caused a nearly equal increase in BIC estimates. We also used the PROC STEPWISE procedure implemented in SAS with the MAXR option to obtain the proportion of the variance explained by population structure alone, which was approximately 16%. This indicates that although the incorporation of population structure covariates is important to control for false positives in association analysis for Al tolerance, a substantial fraction of the phenotypic variance should still persist and can be potentially assigned to Al tolerance QTL.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The sorghum panel used in this study was assembled to represent the genetic diversity present in cultivated sorghums <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Deu1">[34]</xref>, thus allowing us to look in detail into a possible relationship between population structure and Al tolerance with a focus on sorghum production on acid soils. A similar low frequency for Al tolerance was also observed by Reddy and collaborators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Reddy1">[37]</xref> based on field screening and is consistent with Al tolerance being a derived state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Garvin1">[1]</xref>, with a possible relatively recent origin of Al tolerance mutations in sorghum.</p>
      <p>Our previous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Caniato1">[35]</xref> and present genetic analyses indicate that 11 out of the 16 highly Al tolerant accessions rely on the <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> locus to express their tolerance. Because of the rather recessive nature of some <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> alleles that could lead to false negatives in the genetic analysis, we also studied expression for <italic>SbMATE</italic>, which underlies <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic>, in a subset including 4 of the 5 remaining Al tolerant accessions in addition to other Al tolerant accessions for which our genetic analysis confirmed a role for <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> in Al tolerance control. All Al tolerant accessions except for one showed expression levels significantly higher than that in the Al sensitive standards, BR007 and BR012. Considering that Al tolerance and <italic>SbMATE</italic> expression are highly correlated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Magalhaes2">[7]</xref>, our data supports a role for <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> in providing tolerance to the vast majority of the Al tolerant accessions in the diversity panel. In addition, tolerant lines were found to vary for <italic>SbMATE</italic> expression levels, suggesting contrasting allelic effects. This expands on our previous findings indicating substantial diversity for Al tolerance control at the <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> locus, which in a small, 12-member panel, was largely due to an allelic series at <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> encoding highly variable Al tolerance phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Caniato1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Population structure analysis revealed that Al tolerance is by no means randomly distributed across the diversity continuum but instead is rather specific to certain genetically differentiated subgroups featuring specific racial and geographical origins. Particularly, the guinea subpopulations Q1 and Q6 are important repositories of Al tolerance in sorghum. Although the caudatum subpopulation, Q2, appears to be relatively less important than Q1, Q3 and Q6 in explaining the variation for Al tolerance in the panel according to our Q+K model, this subpopulation included eight lines with <italic>RNRG</italic> values between 40 and 100. This indicates that sorghum subpopulations containing caudatum types may also be useful for the identification of Al tolerance donors. Interestingly, the only non-guinea/caudatum accession that was found to be Al tolerant, IS23142, morphologically classified as a durra type, showed high membership coefficients to guinea subpopulations Q1 and Q6, suggesting a guinea-durra transfer of Al tolerance. The high level of tolerance observed within Q3, a subpopulation with a predominance of lines from the Embrapa collection and the US, reflects the fact that some of those lines have been purposely selected for breeding Al tolerant sorghums for the Brazilian acid soils, also reflecting the presence of Al tolerant breeding derivatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Caniato1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Correlation between population structure and variation for a phenotypic trait has been reported and may result from adaptation and/or genetic drift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Semon1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-CamusKulandaivelu1">[39]</xref>. In maize, a deletion allele of the <italic>D8idp</italic> gene, which is associated with flowering time, was found in high frequency among Northern Flint material and in low frequency among tropical material, likely resulting from diversifying selection for flowering time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-CamusKulandaivelu1">[39]</xref>. Interestingly, the guinea race is the main race of sorghum cultivated in West Africa due to its adaptation to a range of stresses commonly found there, including poor soil fertility and low soil pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Weltzien1">[40]</xref>. This suggests that the strong relationship between population structure and Al tolerance in sorghum is not solely caused by genetic drift and may be the result of local adaptation to acid, Al toxic soils. Considering that those soils can be distributed in rather localized regions, thus escaping the resolution level of our soil map, a more detailed soil characterization in West Africa with regards to Al toxicity is needed to gain additional insights into this hypothesis. The local adaptation hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that Al toxicity has indeed been documented to impair sorghum production in West Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Doumbia1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Doumbia2">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The fact that the vast majority of the Al tolerant accessions in the diversity panel were either guinea types or were genetically closely related to guinea sorghums from West and South/East Africa, leads us to speculate that Al tolerance mutations were originated after the initial migration from the original area of sorghum domestication between Sudan and Ethiopia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Doggett1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet2">[27]</xref>, arising in West Africa after the guinea race differentiated from the primordial bicolor types. Supportive of this hypothesis is the presence of Al tolerant accessions in the Malawi region, which is thought to be a secondary center where guinea sorghums occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Harlan1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deAlencarFigueiredo1">[43]</xref>. Interestingly, one of the most Al tolerant accessions in the diversity panel, SC566, a caudatum type from Nigeria, clustered with guinea sorghums, reinforcing the possibility for a single racial origin with subsequent interracial spread of Al tolerance genes in sorghum. In fact, it is known that the guinea race is sympatric with all four of the other basic races of sorghum and interracial hybrids among them are occasionally observed, which are commonly encountered in drier areas from Nigeria to Uganda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-deWet3">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The accessions in the diversity panel showed strikingly different modes of gene action for Al tolerance, with the vast majority showing recessive gene action at varying degrees. Interestingly, the dominance level in newly adaptive genes for insecticide resistance has been shown to be extremely plastic, varying from almost recessive to almost complete dominance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Bourguet1">[44]</xref>. Considering the plausible possibility that the rather new Al tolerance mutations were originally recessive in nature, we are then presented with the question of how dominance arose for Al tolerance genes. Although it has been the subject of great debate (reviewed by Bourget <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Bourguet2">[45]</xref>), the hypothesis of dominance arising from evolutionary change has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Fisher1">[46]</xref>. More recently, the degree of dominance for QTL controlling differences in plant and influorescence architecture between maize and teosinte was found to be greater in the maize background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Doebley1">[47]</xref>. This observation led the authors to hypothesize that changes in gene action could possibly result from selection during the domestication process for modifier loci that enhance the expression of the trait in the heterozygote. The strong correlation between Al tolerance and <italic>SbMATE</italic> expression and the highly monomorphic nature of the <italic>SbMATE</italic> coding region suggest an important role for regulatory polymorphisms in Al tolerance controlled by the <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Magalhaes2">[7]</xref>. Along those lines, the fact that MATE genes have been found to be modulated by transcription factors such as STOP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Liu1">[11]</xref> leads us to raise the hypothesis that dominance in the case of Al tolerance is an acquired state, with a possible origin at modifier loci interacting with Al tolerance genes. One possible precedent for this is the acethylcholinesterase gene conferring insecticide resistance, which showed extremely plastic dominance behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Bourguet3">[48]</xref>. Clearly, in the case of Al tolerance, a more specific study on background effects modulating the expression of Al tolerance genes is needed to gain further insights into this hypothesis. In addition, our experimental design allowed us to assess the degree of dominance related to the Al tolerance trait as a whole, whereas the dominance behavior for <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> was not individualized. Although our data strongly suggest a pivotal role for <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic> in conferring Al tolerance, evidence for other Al tolerance genes has been found both here for IS29691 and in our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Caniato1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The strong relationship observed in the present study between Al tolerance and population structure and the significant plasticity in dominance behavior indicate that the dynamics involving the distribution and function of major Al tolerance genes is much more complex than initially suggested by simple inheritance outcomes in the pioneering genetic studies with a few parental genotypes. A more comprehensive and detailed view of plant Al tolerance enabling powerful molecular breeding strategies will require a detailed understanding of the evolutionary history leading to Al tolerance loci in each species.</p>

        <title>Assessment of Al tolerance in nutrient solution</title>
        <p>Analysis of Al tolerance was conducted in nutrient solutions containing either 0 or 148 µM Al, which correspond to free Al<sup>3+</sup> activities of {0} and {27}µM Al<sup>3+</sup> (values inside brackets indicate Al<sup>3+</sup> activity estimated with the speciation software, GEOCHEM-PC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Parker1">[49]</xref>). A subset of 27 accessions including all Al tolerant accessions determined at {27}µM Al<sup>3+</sup> were re-screened at 0, 222 and 360 µM Al, which correspond to free Al<sup>3+</sup> activities of {0}, {39} and {60} µM Al<sup>3+</sup>. The highly Al tolerant line, SC566, and the Al sensitive line, BR007, which had been previously identified as such by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Caniato1">[35]</xref>, were included as controls. The experiments consisted of a completely randomized design with two replications and seven plants per replication. Hydroponic analyses of Al tolerance were undertaken as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Caniato1">[35]</xref>. Briefly, seeds of each genotype were germinated for four days and seedlings were transferred to containers with nutrient solution lacking Al (pH 4.0) placed in a growth chamber with 27°C day and 20°C night temperatures, a light intensity of 330 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and a 12-h photoperiod. After 24 h of acclimation, the <italic><underline>i</underline></italic>nitial <italic><underline>l</underline></italic>ength of each seedling's root growing in <italic><underline>c</underline></italic>ontrol solution (<italic>ilc</italic>) was measured. The solution was then replaced by nutrient solution of identical composition but containing either no Al or {27}, {39} or {60} µM Al<sup>3+</sup> supplied as AlK(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.12H<sub>2</sub>O. <italic><underline>F</underline></italic>inal root <italic><underline>l</underline></italic>engths under <italic><underline>Al</underline></italic> treatment (<italic>flAl</italic>) or <italic><underline>c</underline></italic>ontrol solution (<italic>flc</italic>) were obtained after three and five days of exposure to Al. For each inbred line, mean values of <italic><underline>r</underline></italic>elative percent <italic><underline>n</underline></italic>et <italic><underline>r</underline></italic>oot <italic><underline>g</underline></italic>rowth (<italic>RNRG</italic><sub>3d</sub> and <italic>RNRG</italic><sub>5d</sub>, where d is the Al exposure period in days) at each Al activity of {27}, {39} and {60} µM Al<sup>3+</sup>, were estimated by dividing the net root growth under Al treatment (<italic>flAl−ilc</italic>) by the net root growth without Al (<italic>flc−ilc</italic>).</p>
        <p>For the genetic analysis of Al tolerance control at <italic>Alt<sub>SB</sub></italic>, 8 BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub> families were phenotyped for Al tolerance at {27} µM Al<sup>3+</sup>. An independent control lacking Al cannot be employed in families segregating for Al tolerance due to the genetically dissimilar nature of individual plants. Thus, Al tolerance was assessed on an individual plant basis as described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Caniato1">[35]</xref>, by estimating the degree of root growth inhibition caused by Al over a five-day exposure period relative to the control root growth. <italic><underline>R</underline></italic>elative <italic><underline>r</underline></italic>oot <italic><underline>g</underline></italic>rowth (%) was calculated with the formula <italic>RRG</italic> = [(<italic>flAl</italic>−<italic>flc</italic>)<sub>5d</sub>/((<italic>flc−ilc</italic>)<sub>1d</sub>×5)]×100 where d is the Al exposure period measured in days.</p>
        <p>To investigate the mode of gene action for Al tolerance, 17 F<sub>1</sub> hybrids having BR007 as the common Al sensitive parent were evaluated at {27} µM Al<sup>3+</sup>, including the parents of each cross as controls, and RRG was estimated. The experiments consisted of completely randomized designs with at least 7 plants per genotype.</p>
        <p>The sorghum accessions were also inspected for root damage after five days of Al exposure and a <italic><underline>V</underline></italic>isual <italic><underline>R</underline></italic>oot <italic><underline>D</underline></italic>amage (<italic>VRD</italic>) scale ranging from 1 (root apices heavily damaged) to 5 (root apices undamaged) was applied. Three independent evaluations were carried out for estimating <italic>VRD</italic> means.</p>
        <p>Al tolerance in sorghum has been reported to be inducible over time, significantly increasing after two to three days of Al exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Magalhaes2">[7]</xref>. In the current study, an <italic><underline>I</underline></italic>nduction of <italic><underline>R</underline></italic>oot <italic><underline>G</underline></italic>rowth (<italic>IRG</italic>) index was estimated by dividing the daily rate of root growth calculated between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> days of Al exposure by that obtained between the 1<sup>rst</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> days. <italic>IRG</italic> values less than one indicate that the rates of root growth recorded between days 3 and 5 of Al exposure were smaller than those between days 1 and 3, values equal to one indicate constant root growth rates whereas induction of root growth results in <italic>IRG</italic>&gt;1, reflecting higher rates of root growth between days 3 and 5 relative to those between days 1 and 3 of Al exposure.</p>

        <p>The degree of dominance for the Al tolerance trait was estimated as the ratio between dominance (d) and additive (a) effects, d/a, where <italic>d = Tt−[(TT+tt)/2</italic> and <italic>a = (TT−tt)/2. TT</italic> denotes the <italic>RRG</italic> mean for the tolerant parent, <italic>tt</italic> is the <italic>RRG</italic> mean for the sensitive parent, BR007, which was common to all crosses, and <italic>Tt</italic> denotes the <italic>RRG</italic> mean for each F<sub>1</sub> hybrid. Therefore, a d/a value of −1 indicates that the phenotypic mean of the F<sub>1</sub> (Tt) hybrid equals that of the homozygous sensitive (tt) parent, d/a = +1 means that the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid is as tolerant as the homozygous tolerant (TT) parent, and d/a = 0 indicates that Al tolerance in the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid equals the average of the RRG means estimated for the two parents.</p>
        <p>In the present study we adopted the following convention for assigning modes of gene action related to Al tolerance: recessive (d/a≤−0.7), partially recessive (−0.7&lt;d/a&lt;−0.3), additive (−0.3≤d/a≤+0.3), partially dominant (+0.3&lt;d/a&lt;+0.7) and dominant (d/a≥+0.7).</p>

The admixture model with correlated allele frequencies was adopted, with burn-in length 100,000 and 1,000,000 run length, with five independent runs for each k set to range from 1 to 13. It has been reported that in some instances the log probability of data may not provide a correct estimate of number of clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Evanno1">[56]</xref>. Thus, we also calculated Δk as the second order change of log of probability of data, Ln(k), divided by its standard deviation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Evanno1">[56]</xref> and the rate of change in Δk between successive k values was adopted as an auxiliary criterion to identify the most likely number of subpopulations.</p>

        <title>Analysis of Al tolerance with respect to subpopulations defined by STRUCTURE</title>
        <p>The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was initially used to test whether the defined subpopulations differed for the Al tolerance response variables assessed at {27} µM Al<sup>3+</sup>. Statistical significance for all pairwise differences among subpopulations for each variable were estimated by calculating the least significant difference (<italic>lsd</italic>) between subpopulations as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0020830.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0020830.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the superior limit of the normal distribution; <italic>n<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>n<sub>j</sub></italic> are the number of individual within each subpopulation, <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, respectively, and N is the total number of individuals.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, a linear mixed model accounting for population structure and familial relatedness or kinship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Yu1">[57]</xref> was fit to the data in order to clarify a possible relationship between population structure and the distribution of the Al tolerance in sorghum. Our model was <bold>y = Qν+Zu+e</bold>, where <bold>y</bold> is a vector of phenotypic observations, <bold>ν</bold> is a vector of fixed effects related to population structure and <bold>u</bold> is a vector of random effects related to familial relatedness. <bold>Z</bold> is an incidence matrix of 0 s and 1 s, relating <bold>Z</bold> to <bold>y</bold>. <bold>Q</bold> is the population membership assignment matrix obtained with STRUCTURE.

        <p>Our complete model included the subpopulations Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q6. Q5 was found to comprise basically Al sensitive genotypes and was thus excluded from the model to remove dependency. Each one of subpopulations Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q6 were then sequentially removed following model selection based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020830-Schwarz1">[59]</xref>).</p>
