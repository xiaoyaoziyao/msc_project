          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Pluripotent embryonic stem cells are considered to be an unlimited cell source for tissue regeneration and cell-based therapy. Investigating the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of embryonic stem cell expansion is thus important. 14-3-3 proteins are implicated in controlling cell division, signaling transduction and survival by interacting with various regulatory proteins. However, the function of 14-3-3 in embryonic stem cell proliferation remains unclear.</p>

          <title>Methodology and Principal Findings</title>
          <p>In this study, we show that all seven 14-3-3 isoforms were detected in mouse embryonic stem cells. Retinoid acid suppressed selectively the expression of 14-3-3σ isoform. Knockdown of 14-3-3σ with siRNA reduced embryonic stem cell proliferation, while only 14-3-3σ transfection increased cell growth and partially rescued retinoid acid-induced growth arrest. Since the growth-enhancing action of 14-3-3σ was abrogated by β-catenin knockdown, we investigated the influence of 14-3-3σ overexpression on β-catenin/GSK-3β. 14-3-3σ bound GSK-3β and increased GSK-3β phosphorylation in a PI-3K/Akt-dependent manner. It disrupted β-catenin binding by the multiprotein destruction complex. 14-3-3σ overexpression attenuated β-catenin phosphorylation and rescued the decline of β-catenin induced by retinoid acid. Furthermore, 14-3-3σ enhanced Wnt3a-induced β-catenin level and GSK-3β phosphorylation. DKK, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, abolished Wnt3a-induced effect but did not interfere GSK-3β/14-3-3σ binding.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Significance</title>
          <p>Our findings show for the first time that 14-3-3σ plays an important role in regulating mouse embryonic stem cell proliferation by binding and sequestering phosphorylated GSK-3β and enhancing Wnt-signaled GSK-3β inactivation. 14-3-3σ is a novel target for embryonic stem cell expansion.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells that possess self-renewal properties and retain the capacity for differentiation into all 3 germ layer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Evans1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Martin1">[2]</xref>. Because of their high proliferation capability, pluripotency and low immunogenicity, ES cells are considered to be a valuable source for cell therapy, tissue regeneration, drug testing and developmental biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Bouhon1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Sakurai1">[4]</xref>. ES cell proliferation and renewal are maintained by diverse factors that activate the renewal genetic program via selective signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Liu1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Okita1">[6]</xref> among which the β-catenin pathway plays a pivotal role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Katoh1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Kleber1">[8]</xref>. At the basal state, β-catenin is associated with a multiprotein destruction complex composed of APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), axin, casein kinase 2 and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) where it is phosphorylated and degraded via ubiquitin/proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Doble1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Zeng1">[11]</xref>. Upon Wnt activation through binding to frizzled and/or LRP5/6 receptors, disheveled (Dvl) displaces GSK-3β from the APC complex resulting in reduced β-catenin degradation, and increased cytosolic β-catenin which is translocated to nucleus where it is associated with Tcf/Lef transcription factor to drive the expression of renewal and proliferative genes. Experimental data have provided convincing evidence for the crucial role of GSK-3β/β-catenin in ES cell renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Aubert1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Sato1">[14]</xref>. GSK-3β is a serine/threonine protein kinase which was originally discovered as an enzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase in response to insulin, and was subsequently reported to phosphorylate β-catenin and facilitate β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Welsh1">[15]</xref>. GSK-3β inhibition was shown to maintain ES cells in the renewal state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Sato1">[14]</xref>. Thus, GSK-3β occupies a central position in controlling β-catenin and ES cell renewal and differentiation. Its activity must be tightly regulated. However, little is known about its regulation in ES cells. We propose in this study that 14-3-3 proteins regulate GSK-3β availability.</p>
      <p>14-3-3 proteins are 28- to 33-kDa acidic polypeptides found in all eukaryotic organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Fu1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Yaffe1">[18]</xref>. 7 members (β, γ, ε, η, σ, θ/τ and ζ) are found in mammals. These isoforms form homo- or hetero-dimers to serve as scaffolds. At least 200 proteins are reported to interact with 14-3-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Fu1">[16]</xref>. Through binding to various classes of proteins including enzymes, transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, signaling molecules, apoptosis factors and tumor suppressors, 14-3-3 proteins are involved in diverse cellular functions and pathophysiological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Morrison1">[17]</xref>. 14-3-3 isoforms have been reported to regulate GSK-3β. 14-3-3ζ was reported to bind GSK-3β, and stimulates tau phosphorylation in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-AgarwalMawal1">[19]</xref>. 14-3-3β interacts with Ser9-phosphorylated GSK-3β to control neuronal survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Mwangi1">[20]</xref>. 14-3-3 was also reported to interact with β-catenin and modify its transcriptional activity. 14-3-3ζ interacts with β-catenin and enhances β-catenin transactivation action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Tian1">[21]</xref>. On the other hand, 14-3-3ζ was reported to interact with Chibby protein to export β-catenin from nucleus and consequently attenuate the β-catenin transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Li1">[22]</xref>. These results indicate that 14-3-3 proteins are functionally complex. Little is known about 14-3-3 proteins in ES cells, let alone their roles in ES cell renewal and proliferation. In this study, we investigated the involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in regulating mouse ES cell (mESC) proliferation. We provide evidence that 14-3-3σ isoform regulates mESC proliferation by binding and sequestering GSK-3β and enhancing Wnt3a-induced GSK-3β phosphorylation and inactivation. 14-3-3σ overexpression rescues retinoid acid (RA)-induced growth arrest by increasing GSK-3β phosphorylation and β-catenin level.</p>

        <title>14-3-3σ Promotes Mouse ES Cell (mESC) Proliferation</title>
        <p>Retinoic acid (RA) is known to induce differentiation and suppress proliferation of mESC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Duester1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-MartinIbanez1">[39]</xref>. However, the underlying mechanism is not entirely clear. To investigate whether 14-3-3 proteins are involved in regulating the actions of RA, we analyzed 14-3-3 isoforms in RA-treated mESCs. Among seven 14-3-3 isoforms, only 14-3-3σ was significantly reduced by RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine the role of 14-3-3σ in mESC proliferation, we treated CCE cells with two 14-3-3σ siRNA sequences. Using a previously reported sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Wilker1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Yang1">[29]</xref>, our results confirm that 14-3-3σ siRNA specifically suppressed 14-3-3σ proteins without changing the expression of other 14-3-3 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Knockdown of 14-3-3σ resulted in reduced CCE viable cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) at 48 h. The inhibitory effect of 14-3-3σ knockdown was confirmed by another siRNA sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040193.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We next evaluated the influence of 14-3-3 overexpression on CCE proliferation. CCE cells were transfected with each isoform of 14-3-3 and the isoform protein overexpression was verified by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Only 14-3-3σ overexpression increased CCE cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of 14-3-3σ significantly increased viable cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, upper panel) and BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) and partially rescued RA-induced decline in cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panel). To ensure that the involvement of 14-3-3σ in mESC proliferation is not limited to CCE, we evaluated the effect of 14-3-3σ in other mESC proliferation. Overexpression of 14-3-3σ in R1 and D3 mESC significantly increased viable cell number and BrdU incorporation to an extent comparable to CCE cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040193.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

        <title>14-3-3σ Promotes mESC Proliferation via β-catenin</title>
        <p>To determine whether β-catenin is involved in 14-3-3σ-mediated mESC proliferation, CCE cells were co-transfected with 14-3-3σ overexpression vector and β-catenin siRNA. Suppression of β-catenin expression in CCE transfected with a previously described siRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Liu2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Yan1">[31]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) resulted in abrogation of 14-3-3σ-induced cell number increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These results were confirmed by another siRNA sequence of β-catenin which exhibited a lesser effect on suppressing β-catenin and a correlated lesser effect on reducing CCE proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040193.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To investigate the relationship between 14-3-3σ and β-catenin, we transfected CCE cells with 14-3-3σ and analyzed β-catenin phosphorylation, ubiquitination, degradation and nuclear translocation. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination of β-catenin were significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>), whereas total β-catenin protein level was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, upper panel) in 14-3-3σ overexpressed CCE cells. Furthermore, β-catenin protein levels were increased in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, lower panel). Thus, 14-3-3σ prevents β-catenin from phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation, thereby increasing β-catenin protein stability and nuclear translocation.</p>
        <p>To ensure that nuclear β-catenin is active in promoting β-catenin/Tcf-targeted gene expression in mESCs, we analyzed β-catenin transcriptional activity by using TOPFLASH/FOPFLASH reporters. 14-3-3σ overexpression increased the promoter activity by ∼5-fold over the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). We next determined the expression of cyclin D1, one of the β-catenin target genes that are critical in cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. Cyclin D1 protein level was increased by ∼3-fold in 14-3-3σ-overexpressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Taken together, the results indicate that 14-3-3σ promotes mESC proliferation via β-catenin.</p>

        <title>14-3-3σ Interacts with GSK-3β and Suppresses GSK-3β Activity</title>
        <p>We performed immuneprecipitation (IP) to determine interaction of 14-3-3σ with GSK-3β as well as proteins in the β-catenin destruction complex. CCE cells were transfected with Flag-tagged 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3σ protein complex was pulled down by IP using a Flag antibody and interacting proteins were analyzed with Western blotting. 14-3-3σ was co-immunoprecipitated with GSK-3β but not β-catenin, axin or APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. upper panel). 14-3-3σ was also co-immunoprecipitated with GSK-3β in R1 and D3 mESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, middle and lower panels). To determine whether GSK-3β selectively interacts with 14-3-3σ isoform, we transfected CCE with each Flag-tagged 14-3-3 isoform, immunoprecipitated the complex with Flag antibody and analyzed GSK-3β protein by Western blotting. GSK-3β was co-precipitated only with 14-3-3σ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These results suggest that 14-3-3σ binds GSK-3β in 14-3-3σ transfected CCE cells. Binding and catalytic activities of GSK-3β are regulated by phosphorylation. We prepared GSK-3β mutants for potential 14-3-3 binding sites at Ser9 (S9A) or Thr309 (T309A), constructed the mutant into the expression vector and analyzed the influence of mutant overexpression on interaction with 14-3-3σ. 14-3-3σ interaction with GSK-3β was reduced by S9A mutation but not T309A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These results suggest that 14-3-3σ binding of GSK-3β requires phosphorylation at Ser9. Since PI-3K/Akt pathway is involved in GSK-3β Ser9 phosphorylation, we evaluated the effect of wortmannin, a PI-3K inhibitor on interaction of GSK-3β with 14-3-3σ. Wortmannin blocked the interaction in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
        <p>We suspected that 14-3-3σ binding of GSK-3β might result in GSK-3β sequestration and inactivation. To address this, we analyzed the level of phosphorylated GSK-3β (pGSK-3β) and GSK-3β catalytic activity in 14-3-3σ overexpressed CCE cells. Compared to non-transfected cells, GSK-3β catalytic activity was significantly reduced in 14-3-3σ transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). In accordance with reduction of the catalytic activity, pGSK-3β was enhanced by 14-3-3σ overexpression which was abrogated by wortmannin induced Akt dephosphorylation and inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). These results indicate that 14-3-3σ overexpression enhances GSK-3β phosphorylation and induces 14-3-3σ binding and sequestration of phosphorylated GSK-3β in a PI-3K/Akt dependent manner.</p>

        <title>14-3-3σ Overexpression Disrupts Association of β-catenin with the Multiprotein Destruction Complex</title>
        <p>Since 14-3-3σ overexpression induces GSK-3β binding and inactivation, we reasoned that 14-3-3σ overexpression could reduce β-catenin association with GSK-3β in the multiprotein destruction complex. To assess this, CCE cells were co-transfected with/without HA-tagged β-catenin and 14-3-3σ vectors. Association of β-catenin with APC, axin or GSK-3β was analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. Overexpression of 14-3-3σ significantly reduced association of β-catenin with GSK-3β as well as APC and axin, and increased the β-catenin level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Besides, the binding of overexpression or endogenous β-catenin with p-GSK-3β is barely detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). In addition, transfection of S9A GSK-3β mutant abolished 14-3-3σ-induced β-catenin expression while transfection of T309A did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These results are consistent with the interpretation that 14-3-3σ level is pivotal in controlling GSK-3β action and regulating β-catenin bioavailability. To provide additional evidence for this, we evaluated the effect of RA on pGSK-3β and β-catenin levels. RA treatment suppressed 14-3-3σ-increased pGSK-3β and reduced p-β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). 14-3-3σ transfection restored pGSK-3β and increased β-catenin reduced by RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Furthermore, RA treatment for 48 h slightly reduced Oct3/4 level. However, 14-3-3σ did not significantly affect Oct3/4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). These results indicate that 14-3-3σ may regulate mouse ES cell proliferation without influence stemness and pluripotency. To further evaluate the endogenous association of 14-3-3σ with GSK-3β, we performed the IP experiments and found that GSK-3β interacts with endogenous 14-3-3σ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Treatment of RA significantly reduced 14-3-3σ binding with GSK-3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate high 14-3-3σ levels increase β-catenin by releasing β-catenin from GSK-3β and confer resistance to RA-induced β-catenin degradation by maintaining GSK-3β phosphorylation.</p>

        <title>14-3-3σ Acts in Concert with Wnt to Control GSK-3β</title>
        <p>As anticipated, Wnt3a increased pGSK-3β and β-catenin in CCE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). 14-3-3σ overexpression augmented Wnt3a-induced pGSK-3β phosphorylation and β-catenin elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). DKK1, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling blocked the action of Wnt3a on pGSK-3β and β-catenin but had a lesser effect on 14-3-3σ transfected CCE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We next determined the GSK-3β binding by 14-3-3σ in the presence of Wnt3a and 14-3-3σ transfection. In the absence of 14-3-3σ overexpression, we detected lower interaction between endogenous 14-3-3σ and GSK-3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). 14-3-3σ binding of GSK-3β was detected in 14-3-3σ transfected cells which were enhanced by Wnt3a treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). DKK1 did not have a significant effect on interaction of 14-3-3σ with GSK-3β in 14-3-3σ transfected cells treated with Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). These results suggest high levels of 14-3-3σ augment the Wnt signaling to enhance GSK-3β inactivation and increase β-catenin stability.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our findings provide important information regarding the novel role of 14-3-3σ in regulating mESC proliferation. Despite the expression of all seven isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins in mESCs, only 14-3-3σ participates in mESC proliferation by binding, sequestration and inactivating GSK-3β. Our results demonstrate that 14-3-3σ overexpression enhances GSK-3β phosphorylation and inactivation as well as increases interaction between 14-3-3σ and GSK-3β. Furthermore, 14-3-3σ overexpression triggers dissociation of β-catenin from the APC/axin/GSK-3β complex, the so-called multiprotein destruction complex. Since the transcriptional bioavailability of β-catenin is tightly controlled by GSK-3β in the destruction complex, our data lead us to conclude that 14-3-3σ is capable of sequestering GSK-3β and thereby releasing β-catenin from the multiprotein destruction complex which translocates into the nucleus and carries out the proliferative transcription.</p>
      <p>GSK-3β inactivation depends on phosphorylation within the multiprotein destruction complex. At resting state, GSK-3β is active in phosphorylating β-catenin to induce its degradation via ubiquitination/proteasome. When stimulated by Wnt, GSK-3β is phosphorylated and dissociated from the multiprotein destruction complex, thus releasing β-catenin. It is generally thought that phosphorylated GSK-3β is rapidly dephosphorylated and reassociated with the APC/axin complex. In this study, we provide evidence that phosphorylated GSK-3β is controlled by 14-3-3σ. High levels of 14-3-3σ sequester and inactivate GSK-3β via which they enhance Wnt signaling to increase β-catenin. It is interesting that DKK blocks the effect of Wnt3a as expected but did not interfere with action of 14-3-3σ on GSK-3β binding. These findings indicate that 14-3-3σ provides a discrete pathway to control GSK-3β availability and activity.</p>
      <p>It is well recognized that RA induces ES cells to undergo differentiation and proliferation arrest. A number of mechanisms of RA actions have been proposed but the exact mechanisms are not clear. We show in this study that 14-3-3σ/GSK-3β pathway is involved in RA-induced inhibition of mESC proliferation. RA selectively suppresses 14-3-3σ. It increases β-catenin phosphorylation and reduces β-catenin resulting in reduction of mESC proliferation. High levels of 14-3-3σ confer resistance to RA by restoring GSK-3β phosphorylation and sequestration. Thus, 14-3-3σ is pivotal in regulating GSK-3β/β-catenin bioavailability as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g008">Fig. 8</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results reveal that knockdown of 14-3-3σ with siRNA reduces mESC proliferation by only 30–40% compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>), suggesting that mESC proliferation does not depend entirely on 14-3-3σ. A compensatory effect may be regulated by other signal pathways. This notion was supported by a recent report which indicates that 14-3-3σ-deleted mESC give rise to viable mice with B-cell developmental defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Su1">[40]</xref>. It is interesting that of all seven 14-3-3 isoforms expressed in mESCs, only 14-3-3σ is involved in regulating β-catenin-mediated mESC proliferation. In contrast, 14-3-3ζ was reported to bind GSK-3β and enhances Tau phosphorylation in brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-AgarwalMawal1">[19]</xref>, and 14-3-3ζ was reported to facilitate β-catenin export from the nucleus and thereby reduces β-catenin transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Li1">[22]</xref>. Reasons for differential regulation of GSK-3β and β-catenin by different 14-3-3 isoforms in different tissues and cells are unclear and require further investigation.</p>
      <p>According to the result in association of 14-3-3σ with GSK-3β S9A mutant, our results indicate that 14-3-3σ binds preferentially phosphorylated GSK-3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Using a pharmacological inhibitor of PI-3K, we show that PI-3K/Akt is required for 14-3-3σ binding of GSK-3β. GSK-3β phosphorylation at Ser9 and Thr309 are potential residues for 14-3-3 interaction. Mutation of GSK-3β Ser9 abrogates GSK-3β binding to 14-3-3σ whereas mutation of Thr309 did not alter its binding. These results suggest that PI-3K/Akt plays an essential role in promoting 14-3-3σ binding and sequestration of GSK-3β by Ser9 phosphorylation. PI-3K/Akt is recognized as an important signaling pathway for promoting ESC proliferation. We demonstrate that enhanced 14-3-3σ/GSK-3β interaction is an important downstream mechanism by which PI-3K/Akt mediates ESC proliferation and renewal.</p>
      <p>It is interesting to note that β-catenin siRNA does not completely abrogate the enhancing action of 14-3-3σ on cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040193-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). It is possible that 14-3-3σ may enhance cell proliferation by multiple mechanisms. Besides the Wnt/β-catenin mechanism, 14-3-3σ may bind phosphorylated Raf-1, activate Raf-1 and its downstream signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Fantl1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Li2">[42]</xref>. Moreover, 14-3-3 was found to regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by interacting with tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), and sequestering it from binding to mTOR complex, thereby increasing the mTOR activity on de novo protein synthesis and cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Li3">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040193-Shumway1">[44]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, this study shows for the first time that 14-3-3σ regulates mESC proliferation by binding and sequestering GSK-3β as well as inducing GSK-3β phosphorylation and inactivation in a PI-3K/Akt-dependent manner. 14-3-3σ is a novel target for ES cell expansion.</p>
