        <p><italic>Ell3</italic> is a testis-specific RNA polymerase II elongation factor whose cellular function is not clear. The present study shows that <italic>Ell3</italic> is activated during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Furthermore, <italic>Ell3</italic> plays a critical role in stimulating lineage differentiation of mESCs by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppressing apoptosis. Mouse ESCs engineered to stably express <italic>Ell3</italic> were rapidly differentiated compared with control cells either under spontaneous differentiation or neural lineage-specific differentiation conditions. Gene expression profile and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of EMT markers, such as Zeb1 and Zeb2, two major genes that regulate EMT, was upregulated in <italic>Ell3</italic>-overexpressing mESCs. Remarkably, knockdown of Zeb1 attenuated the enhanced differentiation capacity of <italic>Ell3</italic>-overexpressing mESCs, which indicates that <italic>Ell3</italic> plays a role in the induction of mESC differentiation by inducing EMT. In contrast to <italic>Ell3</italic>-overexpressing mESCs, <italic>Ell3</italic>-knock down mESCs could not differentiate under differentiation conditions and, instead, underwent caspase-dependent apoptosis. In addition, apoptosis of differentiating <italic>Ell3</italic>-knock out mESCs was associated with enhanced expression of p53. The present results suggest that <italic>Ell3</italic> promotes the differentiation of mESCs by activating the expression of EMT-related genes and by suppressing p53 expression.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pluripotency refers to the capacity of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to differentiate into all cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Evans1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Martin1">[2]</xref>. ESCs possess self-renewal capacity, which is the ability to proliferate for prolonged periods while maintaining the undifferentiated state. Recently, a core set of transcription factors, including <italic>Oct4</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Nanog</italic> were found to upregulate the expression of genes that control self-renewal while repressing genes that drive differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Bernstein1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Lee1">[6]</xref>. How ESCs overcome the constraints of their self-renewal machinery and initiate differentiation is of great interest because understanding the mechanisms underlying differentiation will facilitate the therapeutic application of ESCs in promoting lineage-specific differentiation. The findings of recent studies have led to major advances in the molecular and biochemical understanding of the transition of ESCs from the self-renewal state to early differentiation. A recent report showed that the transcriptional repressor <italic>Rest</italic>, which is abundantly expressed in ESCs and is a target of the <italic>Oct3/4-Sox2-Nanog</italic> regulatory network, is not required for the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency, but promotes cell differentiation by suppressing self-renewal genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Yamada1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Several signaling networks including the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/Stat3, Bmp/Smad, Ras/MAPK and Calcineurin-NFAT pathways also regulate the molecular switch between ESC self-renewal and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Jirmanova1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Ying1">[12]</xref>. For example, Zap70 functions to modulate the balance between LIF/Stat3 and Ras/MAPK pathways to maintain the pluripotent differentiation capacity of mouse ESCs (mESCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Cha1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Cha2">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to transcription factors and signaling pathways, epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling are essential for determining cell fate between self-renewal and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Jiang1">[15]</xref>. However, while recent studies on the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of the self-renewing pluripotent state have improved our understanding of ESCs, how ESCs initially enter into lineage commitment is still only partially understood.</p>
      <p>Epithelial cells form coherent tissue layers because their lateral membranes are closely attached by intercellular adhesion complexes such as tight junctions, adherens junctions, and gap junctions, whereas mesenchymal cells can move as individual cells throughout the extracellular matrix because they are nonpolarized and lack intercellular junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Kalluri1">[16]</xref>. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the phenotypic transformation of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells and is related to various biological changes in development and disease. Recently, it was described that calcineurin-NFAT signaling promotes EMT during the switch of ESCs from an undifferentiated state to lineage differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Li1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, several ESC-specific transcription factors were shown to bind promoters of EMT-related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Chen1">[17]</xref>. Therefore, EMT appears to be an early and essential step in lineage specification of ESCs.</p>
      <p>Ell is a 621-amino acid protein that functions as a transcription elongation factor by suppressing the transient pausing of RNA polymerase II at multiple sites on DNA from both promoter-dependent and promoter-independent templates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Shilatifard1">[18]</xref>. <italic>Ell3</italic> is a testis-specific RNA polymerase II elongation factor, which increases the catalytic rate of transcription elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Miller1">[19]</xref>. The C-terminal domain of <italic>Ell3</italic> shares strong similarities to that of <italic>Ell</italic>, which acts as a negative regulator of p53 and regulates cell proliferation and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Johnstone1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Shinobu1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we analyzed the role of <italic>Ell3</italic> in the differentiation of mESCs. We show that <italic>Ell3-</italic>overexpressing mESCs rapidly differentiated compared with control cells. Furthermore, <italic>Ell3</italic>-knock-down mESCs underwent apoptosis under differentiation conditions. We also demonstrate that <italic>Ell3</italic> activates EMT-inducing genes, including Zeb1, and regulates the expression level of p53. Collectively, our results identify a unique function for <italic>Ell3</italic> during the initiation of mESC differentiation, and we suggest that <italic>Ell3</italic> promotes the differentiation of mESCs by inducing EMT and suppressing p53.</p>

        <title>Expression of <italic>Ell3</italic> in mouse ESCs</title>
        <p>In a previous study, we reported that comparing the gene expression profiles of oocytes and ESCs with those of differentiated cells is a valuable approach to identifying novel factors involved in the regulation of self-renewal or pluripotency of ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Cha1">[13]</xref>. Comparison of the immature oocyte specific transcriptome, which was previously obtained using the annealing control primer-polymerase chain reaction (ACP-PCR) technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Yoon1">[22]</xref>, with that of mESCs revealed that both oocytes and mESCs express <italic>Ell3</italic>, a testis-specific RNA polymerase II elongation factor. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, <italic>Ell3</italic> is actively expressed in mESCs, but the transcripts are weakly detected in differentiated cells such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and NIH3T3 cells. These results suggest that <italic>Ell3</italic> may be confined to the undifferentiated state of mESCs. To test this idea, the expression level of <italic>Ell3</italic> was analyzed in mESCs treated with retinoic acid (RA) to induce differentiation. Surprisingly, expression of <italic>Ell3</italic> transiently increased during EB formation and in the early stages of spontaneous differentiation (up to 4 days), but subsequently decreased as differentiation progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Ell3</italic> may play a role in the early differentiation of mESCs. To investigate the function of <italic>Ell3</italic> in mESCs, stable <italic>Ell3-</italic>OE or KD mES cell lines were generated. Analysis of <italic>Ell3</italic> mRNA in the OE or KD cell lines confirmed that the expression level of <italic>Ell3</italic> was stably maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

        <p>LIF and its cognate signaling pathway through Jak/Stat3 are crucial for self-renewal and pluripotency in mESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Cha1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Cha2">[14]</xref>. Phospho-Stat3 levels were therefore examined in <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE and KD cell lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, the phospho-Stat3 levels in <italic>Ell3-</italic>OE or KD cell lines were similar to those of control cells. In addition, the level of Oct4, a self-renewal marker of ESCs, was not affected by the change in <italic>Ell3</italic> expression. These results indicate that changes in <italic>Ell3</italic> levels do not affect the expression of major factors governing self-renewal of mESCs.</p>
        <p>The efficiency of secondary EB formation, which reflects the capacity of ESCs to maintain an undifferentiated state and self-renewal capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Guo1">[23]</xref>, was examined next. Surprisingly, the efficiency of secondary EB formation in <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells was 50% higher than that in control cells, while in <italic>Ell3-</italic>KD cells the secondary EB formation efficiency was lower than that in control cells when measured 10 days after EB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). This result correlates with the finding that <italic>Ell3</italic> expression increases during EB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and strongly suggests that the expression level of <italic>Ell3</italic> affects the efficiency of EB formation, even though it does not regulate <italic>Stat3</italic> signaling or the expression of self-renewal markers.</p>

        <p>The morphology of <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE and KD mESCs was indistinguishable from that of control cells under self-renewal or EB forming conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

The expression of lineage markers such as <italic>nestin</italic>, <italic>gata4,</italic> and <italic>brachyury-T</italic> was markedly increased in EBs or differentiated <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells compared to control cells, whereas the decrease of self-renewal marker expression was similar between <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE and control cells (Fig. S2).

        <p>Despite the enhanced differentiation potential of <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells, the expression of self-renewal factors such as Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog during differentiation decreased in similar levels in control and <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).

        <title>The effect of <italic>Ell3</italic> expression on the neural differentiation of mESCs</title>
        <p>To further investigate the effect of <italic>Ell3</italic> on lineage specific differentiation, we compared the neural differentiation of <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells to that of control cells. Compared with control cells, <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells rapidly lost ESC morphology within 3 days in neural induction media and showed significantly enhanced differentiated morphology during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). <italic>Ell3</italic> expression increased during neural differentiation both in control and <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells (Fig. S3). Quantitative analysis of nestin mRNA supported the notion that <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells differentiated into neural cells more rapidly than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Immunocytochemical staining showed that nestin-expressing cells were abundant among the differentiating <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells than among the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). This result was further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of nestin<sup>+</sup> cells sorted using a fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) assay. <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells contained a significantly higher proportion of nestin<sup>+</sup> cells than control cells when 1×10<sup>4</sup> differentiating cells were analyzed by FACS, indicating that <italic>Ell3</italic> expression promotes the neural differentiation of mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Furthermore, we compared the number of differentiating cells between <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE and control cells. When 1×10<sup>4</sup> mESCs were cultured in neural differentiating medium for 4 days, the number of <italic>Ell3-</italic>OE cells was approximately 4 times higher than that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>).

        <p>Recently, it was shown that EMT is an early and essential step in lineage specification of ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Li1">[9]</xref>. To investigate the underlying mechanism of <italic>Ell3</italic> promotion of mESC differentiation, we compared the gene expression patterns of <italic>Zeb1</italic> and <italic>Zeb2</italic>, core transcription factors that induce EMT, between <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE and control cells.

Since Zeb factors are core transcriptional repressors that suppress the expression of epithelial genes, including <italic>E-cadherin</italic>, as well as stemness-inhibiting microRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Wellner1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Vandewalle1">[25]</xref>, we analyzed the expression of E-cadherin to examine whether EMT was increased during the differentiation of <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells. As expected, immunoblot analysis showed that E-cadherin expression in differentiating <italic>Ell3-</italic>OE cells was lower than that in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

        <p>Since the C-terminal domain of Ell3 shows strong similarities to that of Ell, which acts as a negative regulator of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Johnstone1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Shinobu1">[21]</xref> (a major mediator of apoptosis in mammalian cells), we investigated whether <italic>Ell3</italic> expression affects the amount of p53 in differentiating mESCs. Indeed, the p53 protein level, which was significantly higher in differentiating <italic>Ell3</italic>-KD cells compared with control cells, returned to the control cell level when <italic>Ell3</italic>-KD cells were transfected with an <italic>Ell3</italic>-expressing plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g005">Fig. 5G</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Ell3</italic> functions as a negative regulator of p53 in differentiating mESCs. Consistently, p53 expression in differentiating <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells was significantly lower than that in control cells, and depletion of <italic>Ell3</italic> by siRNA resulted in an increase in p53 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040293-g005">Fig. 5H</xref>, Fig. S4A). Furthermore, <italic>Ell3</italic> siRNA-mediated depletion of <italic>Ell3</italic> enhanced apoptosis in <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells during differentiation (Fig. S4B). These results show that changes in p53 protein expression in differentiating <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE or KD mESCs depend on the expression level of <italic>Ell3.</italic></p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our data establish a model whereby <italic>Ell3</italic> promotes EMT and suppresses <italic>p53</italic> levels, which leads to the initiation of differentiation of mESCs. We showed that <italic>Ell3</italic> overexpression promotes differentiation of mESCs with the concomitant activation of EMT marker genes. In addition, <italic>Ell3</italic>-knock-down mESCs undergo apoptosis along with an accumulation of <italic>p53</italic>. Interestingly, we found that the activation of <italic>Zeb1</italic>, which is known to link EMT-activation and stemness maintenance in mESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Wellner1">[24]</xref>, is an essential event for <italic>Ell3</italic> to promote differentiation of mESCs, as shown by the finding that suppression of <italic>Zeb1</italic> in <italic>Ell3</italic>-OE cells compromises the differentiation-promoting effect of <italic>Ell3</italic>. Based on these results, we propose that the promotion of EMT may account for the role of <italic>Ell3</italic> in ESC differentiation, which is in line with a previous study demonstrating that EMT is an early and essential step in the differentiation of ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Li1">[9]</xref>. Since <italic>Ell3</italic> is known as a transcription elongation factor, it would be important to elucidate whether <italic>Ell3</italic> directly regulates the expression of <italic>Zeb1</italic> and <italic>Zeb2</italic>. The mechanism by which <italic>Ell3</italic> activates EMT marker genes, including <italic>Zeb1 and Zeb2,</italic> is currently under investigation in our laboratory.</p>
      <p>Another important advance of this study is the discovery that <italic>p53</italic> protein stability is enhanced, and the caspase pathway is activated, when <italic>Ell3</italic> expression is suppressed in differentiating mESCs. <italic>P53</italic> functions as a decision maker in mESCs, inducing differentiation by repressing <italic>Nanog</italic> expression, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Lin1">[30]</xref> or inhibiting differentiation by inducing expression of several WNT ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Lee2">[31]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> differentiation of mESCs results in decreased levels of <italic>p53</italic> and shifts p53 conformational status to the mutant form, allowing differentiating cells to evade apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Sabapathy1">[32]</xref>. Our study indicates that <italic>Ell3</italic> may function to safeguard differentiating ES cells by escaping apoptosis via suppression of p53.</p>
      <p><italic>Ell3</italic> overexpression or suppression did not affect the protein or transcript levels of <italic>p53</italic> in the self-renewal state of mESCs, indicating that <italic>Ell3</italic>-mediated regulation of <italic>p53</italic> was active only under differentiation conditions (Fig. S5). One possible hypothesis is that other factors induced during mESC differentiation may cooperate with <italic>Ell3</italic> to activate the <italic>p53</italic> degradation pathway when mESCs transition from self-renewal to differentiation. Additional studies are needed to elucidate how <italic>Ell3</italic> only affects <italic>p53</italic> expression in differentiating mESCs, but not in self-renewing mESCs.</p>
      <p>Activation of caspase-3 induces differentiation of ESCs by inducing the cleavage of Nanog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Solozobova1">[33]</xref>. However, the enhanced activity of caspase-3 in <italic>Ell3</italic>-KD cells induced apoptosis instead of promoting differentiation. This result indicates that a more complex mechanism may underlie the involvement of caspase activity in the differentiation of ESCs. One possibility is that caspase levels may be regulated to balance the rates of differentiation and apoptosis in ESCs during differentiation.</p>
      <p>The regulatory mechanism underlying how <italic>Ell3</italic> regulates <italic>p53</italic> expression remains elusive. <italic>Ell3</italic> did not have an affect on p53 transcription, suggesting that <italic>Ell3</italic> controlled <italic>p53</italic> levels by modulating <italic>p53</italic> protein stability (data not shown). Since Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination-dependent degradation is one of the main pathways negatively regulating p53 levels, future studies should examine whether <italic>Ell3</italic> regulates the level of p53 by the Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination pathway.</p>
      <p>It remains unclear whether there is a link between the regulation of EMT and that of <italic>p53</italic> expression by <italic>Ell3</italic>. Indeed, <italic>p53</italic> loss of function or mutations was recently found to promote cancer cell EMT by de-repressing Snail 1 protein expression and activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040293-Kim1">[34]</xref>. Therefore, it would be interesting to study the link between p53 and EMT in the initiation of ESC differentiation.</p>
