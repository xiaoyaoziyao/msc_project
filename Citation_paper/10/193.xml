<abstract>
<p>Two CT features were developed to quantitatively describe lung adenocarcinomas by scoring tumor shape complexity (feature 1: convexity) and intratumor density variation (feature 2: entropy ratio) in routinely obtained diagnostic CT scans. The developed quantitative features were analyzed in two independent cohorts (cohort 1: n = 61; cohort 2: n = 47) of patients diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma, retrospectively curated to include imaging and clinical data. Preoperative chest CTs were segmented semi-automatically. Segmented tumor regions were further subdivided into core and boundary sub-regions, to quantify intensity variations across the tumor. Reproducibility of the features was evaluated in an independent test-retest dataset of 32 patients. The proposed metrics showed high degree of reproducibility in a repeated experiment (concordance, CCC≥0.897; dynamic range, DR≥0.92). Association with overall survival was evaluated by Cox proportional hazard regression, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and the log-rank test. Both features were associated with overall survival (convexity: p = 0.008; entropy ratio: p = 0.04) in Cohort 1 but not in Cohort 2 (convexity: p = 0.7; entropy ratio: p = 0.8). In both cohorts, these features were found to be descriptive and demonstrated the link between imaging characteristics and patient survival in lung adenocarcinoma.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. and worldwide[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite therapeutic advances, the overall 5-year survival remains disappointingly low, at around 16%. Clinical decisions for the treatment of lung cancer are largely based on patient characteristics such as performance status, stage at diagnosis, and tumor histology. However, the clinical and biological heterogeneity within histological subtypes remain a major roadblock to successfully treatment of the disease as histologically similar tumors display a wide range of treatment response and metastatic behavior[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
<p>More recently, treatment strategies have begun to involve the subdivision of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) into molecular subsets based on specific driver mutational status in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes [<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recent works have demonstrated a link between imaging features and gene expression patterns[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] thus highlighting the potential of imaging features to be used as independent prognostic or predictive biomarkers essential for enhancing the clinical decision making process. It is expected that the changes at the molecular level will be observable as related imaging phenomena[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Tumors within the same histological subtype demonstrate variable and definable imaging characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We propose that these characteristics can be quantified and used in addition to clinical and molecular characteristics to enhance medical decision-making process.</p>
<p>While complete genome profiling has not yet been adapted into the clinic, radiographic imaging is routinely performed on most patients. Computer tomography (CT) has remained an important diagnostic tool used for initial tumor assessment and staging in lung cancer. CT imaging interrogates the entire tumor ‘in situ’ in the context of its environment and can thus be used to assess the tumor globally. Additionally, it can be used to describe tumor heterogeneity and sub-regional “habitats” within the tumor[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Due to the increasing number of therapy options for NSCLC patients, these patient-specific prognostic biomarkers have the potential of individualizing and thus improving patient care and outcome.</p>
<p>NSCLC tumors are routinely characterized, using diagnostic imaging, based on their size, shape and margin morphology, and the extent of internal enhancement and necrosis. However, the terminology used in radiology to characterize the pathological findings remains subjective and the underlying data are rarely quantified; hence, we contend that their full potential to support medical decision making is underutilized. Quantifying these observations with computer assistance could provide systematic prognostic information with minimal inter- and intra-reader variability. Furthermore, quantitative data can be stored in databases, allowing these data to be mined to develop models for improved diagnosis, prognosis and prediction [<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Although there has been an increase in research activity in the areas of lung nodule detection and classification using image processing and data mining algorithms, few investigators have pursued the development of diagnostic CT-based prognostic imaging biomarkers in NSCLC[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].In this work, we quantitatively analyzed diagnostic CT scans of lung adenocarcinomas to develop prognostic imaging features. In order to minimize genetic heterogeneity, we focused our research on lung adenocarcinomas, the most common histological subtype of lung cancer [<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Diagnostic scans were collected retrospectively and augmented with patient information and clinical follow-up data, which enabled us to develop and test models to predict survival. Since the data were collected retrospectively as part of routine clinical practice, there was variability in terms of instrumentation, image acquisition and reconstruction parameters. We therefore recognized the importance of developing imaging features that were robust across the wide variability encountered in clinically-acquired diagnostic scans.</p>
<p>The development of the proposed imaging features was driven by the hypothesis that tumor shape and intratumor density variation reflect tumor biology and systematic quantification of these imaging characteristics can be used to describe tumor development and patient survival. Both features consistently scored tumors according to the pursued characteristics and showed prognostic behavior. Furthermore, the features were tested for reproducibility under standard patient related variations which showed high degree of reproducibility.</p>

<title>Study population and data</title>
<p>The protocol for this retrospective study, including the participation of the MAASTRO clinic, was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Imaging and clinical data were obtained on patients diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma who were treated in the Thoracic Oncology Program at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute and the Maastricht Radiation Oncology Clinic (MAASTRO). The Moffitt cohort (Cohort 1) included 61 patients and orthogonal MAASTRO cohort (Cohort 2) included 47 patients. Inclusion criteria encompassed patients who underwent surgical resection and had corresponding pre-surgery diagnostic CTs obtained within 60 days of the diagnosis.</p>
<p>For each patient, the cohorts included de-identified diagnostic pre-treatment contrast-enhanced CT scans acquired between years 2006 and 2009 as well as clinical data including demographics, diagnosis, TNM stage, and patient survival.</p>
<p>Clinical data were obtained from Moffitt’s cancer registry, which abstracts self-report information and clinical data from patient medical records including demographics, diagnosis, stage, and treatment. Follow-up for vital status information occurs annually through passive and active methods. Pathologic TNM staging was utilized when available and clinical stage was used if these pathologic staging was missing. For this analysis smoking status was categorized as self-report ever smoker (current or former smoker) or never smoker.</p>

<title>Tumor and lung segmentation</title>
<p>Patient CT scans were segmented to identify lung fields and tumors. The delineation of the lung fields was carried out using single click ensemble algorithm developed using Lung Tumor Analysis (LuTA) tool within the Definiens Developer XD© (Munich, Germany) software platform. Target lesions were volumetrically segmented using semiautomatic approach. The resident radiologist (over 2 years of experience) oversaw the segmentation boundaries on the CT slices. Performing semi-automatic segmentation not only decreased user interaction and eliminated the need for a manually drawn boundary, but also provided robust, reproducible and consistent delineation of the tumor region across the CT slices. We have previously demonstrated that the single click ensemble segmentation algorithm reduced inter-observer variability while capturing the intricacies and important details of the tumor boundary[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Algorithms for image feature extraction and quantification of the segmented tumor regions were implemented in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA).</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Convexity morphological feature</title>
<p>Convexity algorithm (<xref rid="pone.0118261.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref>) was developed to quantify shape variation of the tumor border. Irregularities along tumor perimeter can result from intratumor heterogeneity and differences in growth patterns, interaction with the surrounding environment and spiculations, multiple finger-like projections into the parenchyma which are generally considered to be a poor prognostic indicator[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p>The convexity of the tumor border was calculated as the ratio of the areas contained within a) the tumor perimeter to b) the calculated convex hull (<xref rid="pone.0118261.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The convex hull was computed by defining the smallest convex polygon enclosing a planar tumor region of interest (ROI) using the implementation of QuickHull algorithm[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Using tumor segmentation mask for a given CT slice as input, the divide and conquer approach automatically computed a convex hull vector of pixel locations. Intrinsically the ratio between the area of the tumor mask and its convex hull described the amount of substantial protuberances and depressions along the tumor border.</p>

</fig>
<p>In order to account for all sequential slices containing tumor ROI, the calculation was performed individually on each slice and a mean score was computed using all slices for the tumor. A convexity score of <italic>one</italic> corresponded to a shape that does not present with any concavities along its perimeter. Convexity scores less than one measure the degree of deviation from a convex shape.</p>
<p>Since tumor pressing against the pleural wall can compromise the appearance of tumor morphology, automatic pleural attachment detection was incorporated into the convexity feature algorithm. For each CT slice, perimeters from segmented tumor and lung regions were extracted (<xref rid="pone.0118261.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref>). Pleural attachment was determined if perimeters overlapped. If for a particular slice more than half of the tumor perimeter pixels were also in the lung perimeter, its convexity score was eliminated from the mean score calculation. This step allowed us to account for significant cases of shape smoothing that resulted from tumor pressing against the pleural wall.</p>

<title>Entropy Ratio of intratumor intensity variation feature</title>
<p>Entropy ratio feature (<xref rid="pone.0118261.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref>) was developed to score heterogeneity of pixel attenuation coefficients across the tumor. The entropy filter is the implementation of Shannon entropy. In the image processing context, entropy is the measure of variation computed on the pixel histogram distribution within a given ROI. It is defined as <inline-formula id="pone.0118261.e001"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0118261.e001g" position="anchor" mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0118261.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mn>255</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> where <italic>p</italic><sub>i</sub> represents the probability (normalized frequency) of the given intensity value <italic>i</italic>. In our study we used a 256 intensity bins.</p>
<p>Segmented tumor mask was subdivided into two distinct regions: core and boundary. The subdivision was driven by the hypothesis that these distinct regions reflect unique, spatially explicit biological processes, e.g. necrosis in the core and proliferation along the periphery, and should therefore be assessed separately. Tumor growth and interaction with the surrounding microenvironment has been shown to lead to intratumor changes observable in radiographic scans[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, the introduced spatial constraint helped account for edge effect manifesting itself in higher changes in intensities at the tumor interface which would otherwise skew the calculations had the summary statistics across the entire tumor ROI been applied.</p>
<p>Core and boundary masks were generated automatically from the original tumor segmentation using a series of morphological operations, erosion and dilation (<xref rid="pone.0118261.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>). Two disk-shaped structural elements with radii of 3 or 5 pixels were used. A binary segmentation mask for each tumor slice was first dilated using a disk with a 3 pixel radius. This produced a dilated mask which was then eroded using a disk with a 5 pixel radius to generate the core region mask. The ‘doughnut shape’ mask for the boundary region was produced by subtracting the core mask from the dilated mask (<xref rid="pone.0118261.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to entropy filtering, each CT slice containing tumor was converted to its normalized grayscale equivalent. Binning Hounsfield units into 256 discrete intensity bins allowed the method to normalize tumor intensity ranges and to emphasize the differences in intensity gradient over small local pixel intensity variations. For each pixel within the tumor, an entropy coefficient was computed in its 7-by-7 pixel surrounding neighborhood. The mean of the coefficients was computed for pixels in the boundary and core regions as ensemble scores to represent them (<xref rid="pone.0118261.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Entropy ratio feature was computed by dividing entropy score of the boundary region by the entropy score of the core region in order to characterize the contrast between them.</p>

<p><bold>Image feature reproducibility analysis.</bold> Since feature stability is an important trait for a biomarker, we tested the developed metrics against typical patient variations using the Reference Image Database to Evaluate Therapy Response (RIDER) dataset. The RIDER project was a National Cancer Center (NCI) sponsored project to create consensus across institutions and help in harmonization of the quantitative features. The dataset was downloaded from the NBIA National Biomedical Imaging Archive [<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Unenhanced thoracic CT images for 32 patients in the test-retest dataset (baseline and follow-up) were acquired within 15 minutes of each other, using identical CT scanner and imaging protocol[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. GE Medical Systems Lightspeed 16 or VCT scanner with 16/ 64 detectors in 28/4 patients were used, respectively. The dataset was matched with equal number of early and late stage tumors with equal mixture of men and women in the study.</p>
<p>Tumors were delineated by a semi-automated segmentation tool with boundary markings finalized by a radiologist. Convexity and entropy ratio features were extracted independently from baseline and follow-up scans of the RIDER dataset and consistency of the assigned score was examined. For each proposed feature, concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was computed to quantify reproducibility between two scans performed on each patient. The concordance correlation coefficient measures deviation from the 45 degree line which has been shown to be superior to the Pearson correlation coefficient for comparing repeated experiments[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We then computed the Dynamic Range (DR) for each feature, which is defined as the average difference between measurements to the observed biological (inter-patient) range in the data set. The method has been first proposed and used to find informative feature set [<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The imaging feature data, demographic information, and vital status data were merged into a single file for subsequent statistical analyses using Stata/MP 12.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Student’s t-test and ANOVA were used to test for differences in imaging features by the demographic features and imaging parameters. A correlation matrix was used to assess dependency between the imaging features. Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curves; statistical significance was computed using the log-rank test. The imaging features were dichotomized into two groups using the median score value.</p>

<title>Overall Survival of Entropy Ratio Feature</title>
<p>Median score were used to discriminate between low and high entropy groups. Entropy measures for the entire segmented region were not statistically significant (p = 0.28) with respect to overall survival. Evaluating entropy within the boundary region only was also not significant (p = 0.96). Furthermore, it appeared that high entropy values in the border region skewed the performance of the feature when calculated across the entire tumor region. While restricting the calculation of entropy to the core region was not statistically significant (p = 0.059), tumors with high (&gt;median) core entropy tended to associate with worse overall survival. Entropy of the core may capture important intratumor characteristics such as necrosis and heterogeneity. While entropies of core and boundary regions were not statistically significant independently, their ratio was associated with overall survival (p = 0.04, <xref rid="pone.0118261.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Tumors for which the entropy was consistent throughout the core and boundary regions (i.e. ratio&lt;1.41; <xref rid="pone.0118261.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig.</xref>) were associated with better survival outcome and tumors presenting with larger (&gt;1.41) ratios (<xref rid="pone.0118261.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig.</xref>) were correlated with worse overall survival.</p>

<p>When the imaging biomarkers were analyzed independently in separate univariate models for overall survival (<xref rid="pone.0118261.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) in Cohort 1, we noted statistically significant associations with tumor volume (HR = 2.59; 95% CI 1.06–6.29) and convexity (HR = 0.34; 95% CI 0.14–0.82), and a borderline significant association with entropy ratio (HR = 2.19; 95% CI 0.94–5.08). Age, gender, and stage were significantly associated with survival in the univariable models. When all three imaging biomarkers were included in a stepwise forward selection model (see <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">methods</xref>), tumor volume dropped out while convexity (HR = 0.32; 95% CI 0.13–0.78) and entropy ratio (HR = 2.33; 95% CI 1.00–5.45) remained. Convexity and entropy ratio remained statistically significant in the final multivariable model adjusting for age, gender, and stage. The final model was replicated in Cohort 2.

<title>Imaging features s performance in an independent cohort</title>
<p>The distributions of the computed feature scores were compared between two independent cohorts: Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (<xref rid="pone.0118261.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).

In either of the cohorts, low convexity corresponded to more irregular tumor shapes, while high convexity scores were indicative of rounder shapes with fewer concavities and irregularities along the tumor perimeter.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to develop objective and robust quantitative imaging descriptors that were associated with patient survival. The developed CT features quantified lung adenocarcinomas based on their shape and intratumor intensity variations. The features systematically scored tumors and identified imaging phenotypes which exhibited survival differences in two independent cohorts. The features were extracted from routinely obtained CT images and were reproducible and stable despite the inherent clinical image acquisition variability.</p>
<p>Outcomes after resection in early-stage NSCLC are poor, with 30–50% of the deaths due to distant recurrence[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Current decision support for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery is ill-informed. Gene signatures [<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have been developed to improve risk stratification of early stage NSCLC patients and while an improvement, the approach suffers from sampling bias, as to all biopsy-dependent approaches. Incorporating additional knowledge from individual patients’ scans into the post-operative decision making can potentially identify distinct phenotypes of the disease and serve as a noninvasive approach to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from additional post-surgical treatment such as adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, imaging features can be used as surrogates for tumor specific factors when limited pathological specimens are obtained from diagnostic biopsies [<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, we believe that inferring tumor biological activity and aggressiveness from minimally-invasive imaging techniques can inform precision medicine strategies longitudinally where serial biopsies may be too difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>In order to avoid data sparsity, we recognized the importance of keeping the number of imaging features reasonably low and reflective of the cohort. It has been recommended to keep a rather stringent ratio between the number of patients in each prognostic class and the features above 10[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In order to adequately relay tumor characteristics while coping with dimensionality restrictions, preference should be given to hypothesis-driven features predicated on available biomarkers and tumor biology associations[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Owning to the absence of a validation cohort with matching clinical and imaging parameters, we could not adequately explore the prognostic behavior of the developed features. Validation of imaging features derived from retrospectively assembled cohorts presents an interesting challenge as the field continues to mature. It is essential to refute spurious findings by validating imaging biomarkers in independent, previously unseen cohorts. However, the lack of ‘golden standard’ for testing derived features is often coupled with a number of confounding factors stemming from imaging variability and heterogeneity within patient cohort. It is therefore important to recognize that differences in patient population, quality and manner of data acquisition and subsequent processing can result in validation cohorts that are not adequate for fair assessment. This also highlights the significance and merits of hypothesis-driven imaging feature design which can serve as additional validation criteria in an independent cohort. In our study we have taken the effort to develop image based metrics to quantify observable tumor characteristics.</p>
<p>Additional exploration of the prognostic utility was carried out in an independent cohort (Cohort 2) from a partnering institution located on a different continent, with inherent differences in patient population. In both cohorts, extreme tumor phenotypes were identified based on the distribution of the computed feature scores (Table D in <xref rid="pone.0118261.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Patient subpopulations were chosen using the opposite extreme quartiles of the convexity score distribution (&lt;0.8 and &gt;0.9) from Cohort 1. Survival difference between the two phenotypes was statistically significant for Cohort 2 (p = 0.02; Cohort 1: p = 0.06). Similarly, two subpopulations were identified using low (&lt;1.23) and high (&gt;1.5) entropy ratio scores from Cohort 1. The difference between the subpopulations was statistically significant for Cohort 1 (15 patients vs. 19 patients, p = 0.04). However, due to the differences in entropy score distributions (<xref rid="pone.0118261.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), there were not enough patients (n = 2) in Cohort 2 to represent the phenotype with high (&gt;1.5) entropy ratio scores. The survival significance found in the entire Cohort 1 and in Cohort 2, using quartile split, is promising.</p>
<p>Our study had several limitations. The cohort sample sizes were small which limited our ability to perform extensive stratified analyses. Additionally, the two cohorts are likely not comparable since we have observed significant differences for the imaging features by stage and convolution kernel in Cohort 2 but no difference by stage (or any other characteristic) in Cohort 1. While patients in Cohort 1 were surgical candidates, predominantly stages I and II, Cohort 2 consisted of radiotherapy planning patients with more advanced stages of the disease. Furthermore, the overall survival trend for the cohorts differed (<xref rid="pone.0118261.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig.</xref>). The differences between the two cohorts may explain why our multivariate model did not replicate in Cohort 2 (<xref rid="pone.0118261.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Standardization of image protocols remains a challenge in image biomarker development[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Variability in image acquisition and reconstruction parameters is inherent to retrospective imaging studies. Although this variability can be a significant limitation in studies, ultimately for the computed tomographic biomarkers to be adopted into clinical practice and utilized across multiple imaging centers, these biomarkers must be stable in the presence of image acquisition variability[<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The size of our cohorts and imaging parameter variability are equivalent to other recently published studies [<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118261.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The strength of our study was the development of imaging features that were descriptive and reproducible using retrospectively acquired clinical scans.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used as an additional diagnostic tool in management of lung adenocarcinomas. Although more work is needed to determine clinical utility, it is clear that these descriptors are capable of quantifying and consistently ranking key tumor characteristics. Imaging biomarkers, combined with RECIST measurements and laboratory test results, will in the future be the <italic>de facto</italic> standard of a decision support pipeline employed to personalize and optimize treatment protocols.</p>
