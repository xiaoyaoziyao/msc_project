      <abstract>
        <p>Porcine induced pluripotent stem (piPS) cell lines have been generated recently by using a cocktail of defined transcription factors, however, the features of authentic piPS cells have not been agreed upon and most of published iPS clones did not meet the stringent requirements of pluripotency. Here, we report the generation of piPS cells from fibroblasts using retrovirus carrying four mouse transcription factors (mOct4, mSox2, mKlf4 and mc-Myc, 4F). Multiple LIF-dependent piPS cell lines were generated and these cells showed the morphology similar to mouse embryonic stem cells and other pluripotent stem cells. In addition to the routine characterization, piPS cells were injected into porcine pre-compacted embryos to generate chimera embryos and nuclear transfer (NT) embryos. The results showed that piPS cells retain the ability to integrate into inner and outer layers of the blastocysts, and support the NT embryos development to blastocysts. The generations of chimera embryos and NT embryos derived from piPS clones are a practical means to determine the quality of iPS cells ex vivo.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The first recognized embryonic stem (ES) cell lines were established from the inner cell mass (ICM) of preimplantation blastocysts of 129 strain mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Evans1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Martin1">[2]</xref>. However, it took nearly two decades to isolate human ES cells from in vitro fertilization (IVF) blastocysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Thomson1">[3]</xref>. ES cells cultured in vitro provided powerful cell resources for developmental research and clinical application. So far, the establishment of authentic ES cells was only succeeded in rodents, including mouse and rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Evans1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Buehr1">[4]</xref>. The domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) is one of the most common livestocks around the world, and also is an ideal animal model for the regenerative medicine due to its close resemblance to human on body size, physical structure and metabolism. Despite the fact that intense efforts have been taken to establish porcine ES cells since the 1990s, few validated successes have been achieved except for the recent establishment of LIF-dependent pig pluripotent stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Telugu1">[5]</xref> and pig epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Alberio1">[6]</xref>. Therefore, the application of pigs for the genetic engineering and production of transgenic pigs are highly limited.</p>
      <p>Through ectopic expression of defined transcription factors, the mouse somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent state which shares similar morphology and characteristics with mouse ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Takahashi1">[7]</xref>. Until recently, numerous iPS cell lines have been successfully established in many species, including human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Takahashi2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Yu1">[9]</xref>, rhesus monkey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Liu1">[10]</xref>, rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Liao1">[11]</xref>, pig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Esteban1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Wu1">[14]</xref>, sheep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Bao1">[15]</xref>, canine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Luo1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Shimada1">[17]</xref>, rabbit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Honda1">[18]</xref>, goat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Ren1">[19]</xref> and bovine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Han1">[20]</xref>. It is anticipated that the establishment of piPS cells can provide in-depth view on the properties of porcine pluripotent stem cells. Whereas, controversy still exists on the morphology, the expression of pluripotent markers and suitable culture conditions for the maintenance of piPS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051778.s006">Table S1</xref>), most of these reported cell lines morphologically resembled human ES cells and mouse EpiSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Tesar1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Brons1">[22]</xref>. Notably, retroviral transgenes were not efficiently silenced under current culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Esteban1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Ezashi1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-West1">[23]</xref>. Moreover, only few live-born offspring of germline transmission chimera from iPS cells have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-West2">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Okita1">[26]</xref>, suggesting that these reported reprogrammed porcine iPS cells may only partially reprogrammed and do not process full pluripotent potentials. The difficulty for these iPS cells to produce the cloned animals and viable chimeras might result from the known defects of iPS cells, such as the abnormalities of chromosome and aberrant silencing of Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted domain that arisen during cellular reprogramming. These defects are also likely to impair the application of piPS cells for the regenerative medicine and transgenic animal research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Stadtfeld1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Gore1">[29]</xref>. Moreover, the persistent expression of retroviral reprogramming genes may also disturb the expression pattern of downstream genes in iPS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Okita1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, piPS cells were generated using a combination of four mouse factors (mOct4, mSox2, mKlf4 and mc-Myc, 4F). Unlike previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Esteban1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Wu1">[14]</xref>, these cells exhibited three-dimensional and tightly packed colonies, similar to mouse and rat ES cells in morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Evans1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Buehr1">[4]</xref>, and were dependent on LIF/STAT3 signaling pathway. In addition to their potentials of self-renewal and pluripotency in vivo and in vitro, the obtained piPS cells were capable of producing chimeric and reconstructed nuclear transfer (NT) embryos. The resulting embryos could develop into the blastocysts. Thus, these piPS cells were qualified to be used as donor cells for development of chimeric or NT pig offspring.</p>

        <title>Cells Culture</title>
        <p>The piPS cells established in this study were cultured in piPS medium, including Knock-out DMEM (KO-DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FBS (HyClone), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Invitrogen), 1 mM L-glutamine, 10 ng LIF (Millipore, ESG1106), 10 ng bFGF (Millipore, GF003), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 50 units/50 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, at 38.5°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere. The piPS cells were maintained on mitotically inactive mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) feeder layers derived from ICR mice, and passaged using 1 mg/ml Collagenase type IV (Invitrogen) and 0.05% Trypsin (Invitrogen) every 2 to 3 days. Phoenix-A cells, a second-generation retrovirus producer line, were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS.</p>
        <p>The pig specimens were purchased from a licensed local slaughterhouse, Shaanxi Wansheng meat food processing Co., Ltd., a branch of YURUN Group. And they permitted the porcine parts to be used for the scientific and educational research in our lab. The treatment of porcine samples was based on the protocol of the farm animal research guidelines approved by the Animal Research Committee of Northwest A&amp;F University. The porcine embryonic fibroblasts (PEF) were prepared from a 35-day-old porcine fetus. After washing with PBS plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, the boneless tissues were cut into pieces, and digested by 3–5 ml of collagenase IV (1 mg/ml) at 38.5°C for 5–6 hours. Following the addition of equal amount of culture medium into the digestion, the mixture was centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM with 15% FBS, and 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells were seeded on a 100 mm dish at 38.5°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 72 hours. Cells grown to 90% confluence were collected and cryopreserved for future use.</p>
        <p>To perform the live-cell imaging experiments, piPS cells were treated with 0.05% Trypsin for 5 min, and then seeded on a 35 mm culture plate with MEF feeder at 38.5°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 hours, images of cultured cells were recorded in 2 min intervals by Leica microscope (Leica AF6000, Germany).</p>

        <title>Retroviral Production and Generation of Porcine Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Lines</title>
        <p>The day before transfection, Phoenix-A cells were planted on a 6-well plate with 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells per well. After 24 hours, pMXs plasmids carrying mouse Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc were transfected into Phoenix-A cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. 48 hours after transduction, the medium with virus particles was collected and filtered through 0.45 mm cellulose acetate filter (Millipore). The equal amounts of supernatants containing each of the four factors was mixed and used to infect PEF cells in the presence 4 µg/ml Polybrene for 12 hours. To increase infection efficiency, a second infection with fresh virus was conducted. After infection, PEF cells were collected and counted. The infected cells were re-plated on 60 mm dish (50,000 cells per plate) with iPS medium. To optimize the culture conditions, the following three types of iPS media were tested, M1 (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 20% Knock-out Serum Replacement (KSR, Invitrogen), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM L-Glu, 0.1 mM β-Me and 10 ng/ml bFGF), M2 (KO-DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM L-Glu, 0.1 mM β-Me, 10 ng/ml LIF and 10 ng/ml bFGF) and M3 (KO-DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM L-Glu, 0.1 mM β-Me, 10 ng/ml LIF, 10 ng/ml bFGF and 1 mM Valproic acid, VPA ). Small ES-like colonies appeared 6–8 days post-infection. After another 3–5 days, the colonies became big enough to pick up. Then the fine colonies were picked up and digested with 0.05% Trysin for 5 min, and transferred into a 96-well plate with MEF feeder. 3–5 days later, the colonies in 96-well plate re-appeared and were passaged as routine procedure for mouse ES cells culture. To monitor the infection efficiency and silencing of exogenous gene expression during PEF reprogramming, the pMXs-GFP was mixed into virus particles of four factors.</p>
        <p>The media lacking either LIF or bFGF and addition of JAK I inhibitor (Calbiochem #420099, 3 µM) were also used to culture piPS cells to test the influence of LIF signal pathway on piPS cell self-renewal. For 5 days growth, cells were harvested and used to detect the phosphorylation of STAT3 and the expression of pluripotent genes.</p>

        <title>Alkaline Phosphatase Staining and Karyotype Analysis of piPS Cells</title>
        <p>The alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity of piPS cells was determined by AST Fast Red TR and α-Naphthol AS-MX Phosphate (Sigma Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were washed twice using ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by washing three times using ice-cold PBS. Cells were then incubated at room temperature (RT) in the solution containing Fast Red TR 1.0 mg/ml, Naphthol AS-MX 0.4 mg/ml in 0.1 M Tris Buffer. After 10–20 min incubation, the AP positive iPS colonies showed in red color.</p>
        <p>Karyotype analysis was performed following the standard procedure described in Cell Biology Laboratory Manual (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homepages.gac.edu/~cellab/chpts/chpt10/ex10-6.html" xlink:type="simple">http://homepages.gac.edu/~cellab/chpts/chpt10/ex10-6.html</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>For immunocytochemical analysis, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min at RT. Fixed cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, incubated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and washed three times with PBS.

The results showed that piPS cells started to differentiate and AP activity was lost when LIF was drawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g004">4</xref>), but these cells could retain ES cell-like morphology and AP activity when bFGF was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g006">6</xref>). Thus, LIF pathway may play a key role in maintaining pluripotency in piPS cells. The expression level of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) in piPS cell lines was then examined by the quantitative RT-PCR assay. The expression level of LIFR increased significantly in piPS cell lines comparing with PEFs. Among piPS clones, the LIFR level in PS24 clone was 3–4 folds higher than that in PS23 and PS31 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Furthermore, the Western blotting assay confirmed that the level of phosphorylated STAT3, which is a transcription factor downstream of LIF signal pathway, was significantly reduced in piPS clones upon LIF removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

        <title>Chimera Embryos Derived from piPS Cells</title>
        <p>To investigate the pluripotency and developmental potential of piPS cells, PS23 and PS24 clones were used to construct chimera embryo. The piPS clones transfected by the PiggyBac transposon PB[Act-RFP]DS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Ding1">[33]</xref>, which carried a RFP reporter, were sorted by flow cytometry. PS24-RFP cells were subcultured and used for the generation of chimeric embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g003">3</xref>). Initially, we used the ex vivo embryos from natural mating sows to perform microinjection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g004">4</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, a hatched blastocyst after the 3-day incubation in vitro shows that the red cells derived from piPS cells were located in both ICM and trophoblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Five to ten PS24-RFP cells were delivered into pre-compacted 8-cell parthenogenetic embryos by the microinjection. The injected embryos were monitored at four different time points, 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Immediately after injection, almost all the injected embryos showed red fluorescence (93.9%). During the embryo development, the ratio of embryos carrying with PS24-RFP cells reduced from 59.8% in 24 hours, to 31.3% in 48 hours and to 25.9% in 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g005">Fig. 5C, right panel</xref>). On the other hand, PEF-RFP cells were injected into embryos as the control, and unable to proliferate in the embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051778.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). The injected embryos derived from piPS cells could further develop into blastocysts and the blastocyst rate was similar to our previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Hu1">[30]</xref>. The results of blastocyst generation showed the rate of chimera blastocysts from ex vivo embryos could reach up to 40%, which was higher than that from parthenogenetic embryos (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051778-t001">Table 1</xref>). Our observations suggested that piPS cells were able to integrate into early porcine embryos and formed chimeric blastocysts.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Since the first mouse iPS cells were reported in 2006, a large number of iPS cell lines have been established in mouse, human and other animal species. Several piPS cell lines have been established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Esteban1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Wu1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-West1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Montserrat1">[36]</xref>, and the chimeric pigs derived from piPS cells were also reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-West1">[23]</xref>. However, most of the reported piPS cells resembled to human ES cells or mouse EpiSCs in morphology and molecular and cellular features, except for one report that showed the piPS cells in a LIF-dependent state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Telugu2">[37]</xref>. After the comparison of culture conditions among the different piPS cell lines, we found that most of culture media were related to human iPS cell media, which the main components were KSR and bFGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Ezashi1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Wu1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Montserrat2">[38]</xref>. Because of this selection condition, the obtained pig pluripotent cells resembled to human ES cell and showed the bFGF-dependence. In our studies, we compared few different cultural media for culturing porcine iPS cells, including both mouse and human ES cell culture conditions, and found that the medium with LIF and FBS could significantly increase the number of iPS clones. The observations that piPS clones express high level LIF receptors and withdrawing LIF cause spontaneous differentiation of piPS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) indicate that LIF is required to keep piPS cell self-renewal and pluripotency. On the other hand, the medium withdrawing bFGF has the minor effect on piPS clone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g004">Fig 4A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Cheng1">[39]</xref>, suggesting that bFGF may not be an essential growth factor for maintaining piPS cells. Our results agreed with the data reported by Thomson et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Thomson2">[40]</xref>, who recently reported that LIF signaling pathway played an important role during the porcine fetal fibroblast reprogramming. Under the culture condition of FBS+ LIF, we observed the 3-D type of piPS clones in primary culture. After several passages, three piPS cell lines that retain 3-D morphology have been generated and the characteristics of pluripotency were sustained for more than 30 passages. The ES-like pluripotent cells derived from porcine ICM were LIF-dependent and showed 3-D morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Telugu1">[5]</xref>. In general, our study shows that the LIF-dependent piPS cell with 3-D morphology is more closed to genuine porcine pluripotent stem cells.</p>
      <p>The previously reported piPS cells were generated by retrovirus or lentivirus induction system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Esteban1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Ezashi1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-West1">[23]</xref>, due to the efficient integration and persistent expression of transgenes by these virus vectors. However, the continued expression of exogenous reprogramming factors will likely affect the pluripotency and multi-differentiation potential of iPS cells. Therefore, the silence of transgenes is an important criterion for evaluate the cellular reprogramming, because retroviral are epigenetically silenced in pluripotent stem cells. However, the transgene silencing was not achieved in most previously reported piPS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Esteban1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Ezashi1">[13]</xref>. In our studies, we monitored the expression of both exogenous and endogenous genes during the cell reprogramming, and found that, in early stage of induction (8 days), the stage-specific embryonic antigen 4 (SSEA4), a cell surface marker to identify human embryonic stem cell, was detected and co-localized with retroviral GFP<sup>+</sup> cells. After two weeks induction, the ratio of SSEA4<sup>+</sup>/GFP<bold><sup>-</sup></bold> cells increased to 3.9% of total cell population. In these GFP<sup>-</sup> cells, the transgenes were evidently down regulated, despite not completely silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051778-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). This observation indicates that the induction term and culture conditions still need to be further optimized. Furthermore, the piPS cells derived from Xiao’s lab started to spontaneously differentiate soon after withdrawing doxycycline (Dox) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Wu1">[14]</xref>, suggesting that although Dox dependent expression of four human factors initiated reprogramming process and maintained the piPS self-renewal and pluripotency, the reprogramming process had not reached to a point that endogenous pluripotent networks could uphold the pluripotency of piPS cells. Thus, identification of appropriate culture conditions for piPS is still a key issue in porcine pluripotent stem cell study.</p>
      <p>Both less stringent tests for pluripotency, such as embryoid body and teratoma formation and differentiation in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Takahashi1">[7]</xref>, and more rigorous assays, including chimeras and tetraploid complementation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Zhao1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Okita1">[26]</xref> have shown that mouse iPS cells are similar to the ES cells derived from ICM, which contributes to every tissue in the resulting mice, including germline tissues. Recently, Dr. Stice’s group has shown that piPS cells with human 6 factors were able to generate the chimeric offspring, demonstrating that piPS cells held a high level of plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-West1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-West2">[24]</xref>. In this study, we detected the developmental potential of piPS cells through chimera in porcine embryos and NT to assess the piPS cells. Even though the transgenes were not fully silenced, PS23 and PS24 cells incorporated into chimera embryos and iPS-NT embryos, which developed into blastocysts. The results showed that the efficiency of piPS harboring chimera embryos was significantly higher using the fertilized embryos comparing to parthenogenetic embryos. In particularly, chimera formation in fertilized embryos was easier to develop into blastocysts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051778-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, the research of piPS cells is still in its infancy, and there are far away from that these cells are used as targeting cells to generate trangenic pigs for the medical research.</p>
      <p>We have noticed that the blastocyst rate of PS24-derived NT embryos was similar to that of PEF-NT embryos. In contrast, the detailed observation revealed that the cleavage rate of iPS-NT embryos was significantly lower than that of PEF-NT embryos. Thus, the blastocyst rate of iPS-NT embryos after cleavage is higher than PEF-NT embryos (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051778-t002">Table 2</xref>). Hochedlinger et al reported that the development of reconstructed oocytes into blastocysts was particularly sensitive to the cell-cycle stage and physical condition of the transferred nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Hochedlinger1">[41]</xref>. In previous studies, we also found that oocyte nuclear modifications and cytoplasmic maturation underwent dramatic alterations during in vitro maturation (around 42 h) that affected subsequent embryo development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Hu2">[42]</xref>. The studies of the cell cycle profile of mouse iPS cells cultured with LIF showed that LIF-induced DNA synthesis caused the high percentage of iPS cells in S and G2 phases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051778-Ishizuka1">[43]</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that the large proportion of piPS cells in the S and G2/M phases influences the rate of cleavage division of iPS-NT embryos. On the other hand, the PEF cells in the G<sub>0</sub> phase can obtain the higher cleavage rate. Thus, the blastocyst rate of piPS-NT embryos was higher than that of PEF-NT embryos based on the cleavage.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we successfully established several piPS cell lines based on the induction by mouse OSKM transcriptional factors under the culture condition with FBS, LIF and bFGF. The piPS clones preserve the morphological and biological features of self-renewal and pluripotency as the mouse ES and iPS cells. The generation of chimeric embryos and NT embryos derived from piPS clones is a practical means to examine the quality of iPS cells ex vivo.</p>
