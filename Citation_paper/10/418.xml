<abstract>
<p>Lesion mimics (LMs) that exhibit spontaneous disease-like lesions in the absence of pathogen attack might confer enhanced plant disease resistance to a wide range of pathogens. The LM mutant, lm3 was derived from a single naturally mutated individual in the F<sub>1</sub> population of a 3-1/Jing411 cross, backcrossed six times with 3–1 as the recurrent parent and subsequently self-pollinated twice. The leaves of young seedlings of the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant exhibited small, discrete white lesions under natural field conditions. The lesions first appeared at the leaf tips and subsequently expanded throughout the entire leaf blade to the leaf sheath. The lesions were initiated through light intensity and day length. Histochemical staining revealed that lesion formation might reflect programmed cell death (PCD) and abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The chlorophyll content in the mutant was significantly lower than that in wildtype, and the ratio of chlorophyll <italic>a/b</italic> was increased significantly in the mutant compared with wildtype, indicating that lm3 showed impairment of the biosynthesis or degradation of chlorophyll, and that Chlorophyll <italic>b</italic> was prone to damage during lesion formation. The <italic>lm3</italic> mutant exhibited enhanced resistance to wheat powdery mildew fungus (<italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic>; <italic>Bgt</italic>) infection, which was consistent with the increased expression of seven pathogenesis-related (<italic>PR</italic>) and two <italic>wheat chemically induced</italic> (<italic>WCI</italic>) genes involved in the defense-related reaction. Genetic analysis showed that the mutation was controlled through a single partially dominant gene, which was closely linked to <italic>Xbarc203</italic> on chromosome 3BL; this gene was delimited to a 40 Mb region between <italic>SSR3B450</italic>.<italic>37</italic> and <italic>SSR3B492</italic>.<italic>6</italic> using a large derived segregating population and the available Chinese Spring chromosome 3B genome sequence. Taken together, our results provide information regarding the identification of a novel wheat LM gene, which will facilitate the additional fine-mapping and cloning of the gene to understand the mechanism underlying LM initiation and disease resistance in common wheat.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lesion mimic mutants (LMMs) in plants spontaneously produce cell death or necrotic lesions in the absence of any pesticide, mechanical damage and pathogen infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref001">1</xref>]. The hypersensitive response (HR), localized cell death at sites of pathogen infection, is an innate immune response to protect plants from pathogen attacks, representing a form of programmed cell death (PCD) and conferring necrosis lesions to inhibit pathogen spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref003">3</xref>]. Spontaneous cell death without the pathogen-induced HR response typically occurs in LMMs, which display necrotic lesions compared with plants infected with a pathogen. The necrotic spots and chlorotic leaves of LMMs result from the altered regulation of cell death processes, such as the HR and senescence or the perturbation of metabolic pathways, resulting in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref004">4</xref>]. During the HR process, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), accumulation of callose, production of phytoalexins and activation of the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes generally occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref006">6</xref>]. Therefore, these lesion mimic (LM) genes might play a dual role in regulating cell death and activating plant defenses.</p>
<p>To reveal the function of LMs, numerous LMMs and their encoding genes have been identified from various plant species, such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, maize, barley and wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref014">14</xref>]. In rice, <italic>spl7</italic> (Spotted-leaf, <italic>spl</italic>) was the first isolated spotted-leaf gene, encoding a heat stress transcription factor (HSF) protein, and <italic>spl7</italic> lesions are induced in response to high temperature and ultraviolet solar irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref015">15</xref>]. Thereafter, various genes were shown to be involved or controlled in cell death and resistance responses, such as those encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase protein (Spl11) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref009">9</xref>], coproporphyrinogen Ⅲ oxidase (CPOX) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref016">16</xref>], splicing factor 3b subunit 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref011">11</xref>], and ATPase associated with various cellular activity type (AAA-type) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref017">17</xref>]. Early leaf senescence and lesion formation are observed in mutants for several genes, such as clathrin-associated adaptor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref018">18</xref>], Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref019">19</xref>], and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref020">20</xref>]. Moreover, several rice LMM genes have been fine-mapped, including <italic>Lmes1</italic> in an 88-kb region on chromosome 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref021">21</xref>], <italic>Spl30</italic> delimited to a 94-kb region on chromosome 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref022">22</xref>], and <italic>spl2</italic> and <italic>spl6</italic> on chromosomes 2 and 1, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref024">24</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a number of LM genes play an essential role in chloroplast development, resulting in small necrotic spots on plant leaves, such as chloroplast chaperonin 60β (<italic>len1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref025">25</xref>], membrane-remodeling GTPase (<italic>fzl</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref026">26</xref>], and porphobilinogen deaminase (<italic>rug1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref027">27</xref>]. In addition, <italic>lin2</italic> encodes a CPOX protein, similar to <italic>llm1</italic> and <italic>rlin1</italic> in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref029">29</xref>], and several LM genes have been revealed to alter the expression of <italic>PR</italic> genes during the formation of spontaneous LMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref032">32</xref>]. In addition to the above mutated genes identified in rice and Arabidopsis, a few genes involved in necrotic lesion formation have also been characterized through overexpression or RNAi experiments in other species, including tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref033">33</xref>], tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref034">34</xref>], and cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Because of the complexity of the wheat genome and incomplete sequence information, only a few LMMs have been identified or mapped in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref037">37</xref>], the majority of which are invloved in pathogen resistance. The hypersensitive-like phenotype (HLP) mutant was obtained through a mutagenic treatment on the Argentine cultivar Sinvalocho M.A. with ethyl methanesulfonate, in which the disease- resistance response is simulated in the absence of any pathogen, and a spontaneous HR-like response associated with cell death and enhanced resistance to leaf rust are observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref037">37</xref>]. The M66 mutant originated from X-ray mutagenesis of the Guardian wheat cultivar, and shows increased resistance to powdery mildew and yellow rust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref038">38</xref>]. LMMs also display significant adult-plant resistance to leaf rust compared with non-LMMs, and <italic>lm</italic> has been localized between either the marker <italic>Xwmc85</italic>.<italic>1</italic> or <italic>Xgwm264</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and the centromere of chromosome 1B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref012">12</xref>]; The LM phenotype characterized in recombinant inbred lines of Yanzhan1/Zaosui30, results from the interaction of two recessive genes derived from each parent, which have been mapped to chromosomes 3BS and 4BL. The observed lesions are light-dependent and have negative effects on subsequently developing traits and the enhanced expression of resistance to leaf rust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition, the lesion symptoms of both AIM9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref039">39</xref>] and LF2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref014">14</xref>] are controlled by a single recessive gene, and the total chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rates of these plants are reduced with the onset of symptoms in the leaves. LF2010 is a light- and temperature- affected LMM, whose plant height, spike length, spike number per plant, grain weight per plant, grain number per spike, seed setting rate, and flag leaf length are lower compared with wildtype plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>An F<sub>1</sub> individual derived from a 3-1/Jing411 cross in 2000 was identified as an LMM, and after being backcrossed six times using 3–1 as the recurrent parent and self-pollinated twice, this mutant was designated lm3. In the present study, we described the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant exhibiting spontaneous cell death, and provided evidence that PCD and ROS accompanied the formation of lesion spots. The mutant phenotype is light dependent, as revealed through different light intensities and photoperiods, and a panel of defense-related genes was up-regulated during the initiation of lesion formation, resulting in the resistance to the powdery mildew fungus. We mapped the mutant <italic>lm3</italic> gene to a narrow region on the long arm of chromosome 3B using the Chinese Spring genome sequence.</p>

<p>The LMM was obtained at the Experimental Station (ES) of the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IDGB, CAS), in May 2000. During anthesis, one plant among the 30 F<sub>1</sub> plants derived from the 3-1/Jing411 cross exhibited LM leaves. Jing411 is a commercial winter wheat variety released in 1991 in Beijing, China, whereas 3–1 is an advanced breeding line bred in the 1990s at China Agricultural University, Beijing. The mutated F<sub>1</sub> was backcrossed six times with the female parent 3–1 in the subsequent three years, and the necrotic symptoms in the progenies of each backcrossing generation were selected. The BC<sub>6</sub> progeny was subsequently self-pollinated twice, and one plant with the necrotic symptom phenotype was selected and designated as lm3 in 2005, which resembled the initial maternal parent 3–1 plant, except for the necrosis phenotype. Thus, lm3 and 3–1 could serve as a set of near-isogenic lines for the investigation of related gene expression in the LM. Both lines were grown at the ES of IDGB, CAS during the 2005–2006 cropping season for further analysis.</p>

<p>Chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> contents were measured using the flag leaves of lm3, 3–1 and the associated F<sub>1</sub> plants two weeks after the anthesis stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref040">40</xref>]. The flag leaves of lm3 at this stage were fully scattered with lesions. Flag leaf samples of ~200 mg each were cut into pieces, and subsequently soaked in 20 mL of 80% acetone at 4°C for 48 h in darkness until the leaf samples became colorless. A solution of 80% acetone was used as a blank. The absorbance values at wavelengths of 663- and 645- nm were measured using the chlorophyll extract and a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1700). Three biological repeats were assayed for each sample.</p>

<title>Light-dependent analysis</title>
<p>lm3 and 3–1 seeds were surface-sterilized in 10% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for 10 min, rinsed with Millipore water, and germinated on moist filter paper for 2 d at 25°C. Uniformly sized seedlings were transplanted to 1000 mL rectangular plastic pots containing 600 mL of half-strength aerated Hoagland nutrient solution. The nutrient solution was refreshed every three days. Wheat seedlings were grown in a greenhouse under a day/night temperature regime of 22–25°C and normal 50% air moisture. Illumination was provided by cool-white fluorescent lamps with photosynthetically active radiation of 200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<italic>μE</italic>) under a 16 h photoperiod. The treatments involving different light intensities and day lengths were performed on the 8<sup>th</sup> day, when the plants exhibited a fully developed first leaf and expanding second leaf. The distance of the seedlings from the lamps was adjusted to provide a 50% light intensity (100 <italic>μE</italic>), and 6 h and 12 h day lengths were controlled by turning off the lamps. Sections of the second newly expanded leaves were covered with aluminum foil to completely reflect incident light. After lesions on the 3<sup>rd</sup> leaves of lm3 plants had formed completely under the conditions of 200 <italic>μE</italic> with a 16 h photoperiod, the lesions on all leaves were carefully checked, including the regions covered with aluminum foil and the leaves of 3–1 plants.</p>

<title>Histochemical analysis</title>
<p>Fresh leaf samples were collected from LM plants and wildtype plants during the heading stage, and trypan blue staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref041">41</xref>] was performed to detect cell death in LM plants. The leaves were immersed in a 70% lactic acid-phenol- trypan blue solution [2.5 mg/ml trypan blue, 25% (w/v) lactic acid, 23% water-saturated phenol, 25% glycerol, and H<sub>2</sub>O], and the leaf samples were then heated in boiling water for 15 min, and stained for 12 h at room temperature. The leaf samples were finally stored in chloral hydrate solution (25 mg in 10 mL H<sub>2</sub>O) for destaining and subsequently photographed.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was detected in leaves using 3,3’- diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref042">42</xref>]. Leaf samples were submerged in 1mg/mL DAB (pH = 3.8), and incubated in a growth chamber for 8 h to allow DAB uptake and reaction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; then, they were transferred to 95% ethanol and heated in boiling water for chlorophyll extraction. Finally, the leaf samples were stored in fresh ethanol at 25°C until chlorophyll had disappeared, and examined using scanner (Image Scanner III).</p>

<title>Lesion-related gene expression analysis</title>
<p>Relative quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed with gene-specific primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0155358.t001">Table 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref043">43</xref>], designed based on wheat sequences, to assess the transcript abundances of lesion-related genes during the development of necrotic spots.

<p>Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Sigma Chemical Co., USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and DNase treatment (Invitrogen, USA) was performed on the crude RNA preparations, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref044">44</xref>]. Complementary DNA was synthesized using a combination of 5 ng/μL oligo(dT) and 2.5 ng/μL random hexamers for priming, employing the SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each 20 μL sample of synthesized cDNA was diluted 5-fold with nuclease-free water and 2 μL of this diluted cDNA was used for each amplification reaction in the RT-qPCR analysis. RT-qPCR was performed in optical 96-well plates using the Roche LightCycler 480 Detection System (Roche, USA). Each reaction contained 5 μL of 2X SYBR Green Ⅰ Master Mix (Roche, USA), 250 nM each forward and reverse gene-specific primer and 2 μL of the cDNA template. The PCR program consisted of a pre-denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 10 s and 72°C for 10 s, with a final step at 95°C for 1 min and 40°C for 5 min. Three biological replicates of each sample together with two technical replicates were examined and the data were retained only when the standard deviation between replicates was ≤0.3 Ct.

<title>Evaluation of powdery mildew resistance</title>
<p>The LM and wildtype plants were evaluated for their response to powdery mildew under natural infection in the field at the ES of IDGB, CAS during the 2009–2015 cropping seasons, and in the greenhouse in the winter of 2015. LM and wildtype plants were grown randomly with two replications. At the anthesis stage, a mild-to-severe powdery mildew epidemic usually occurred in the field at the ES of IDGB, CAS.</p>
<p>The powdery mildew response of lm3 was also assessed following artificial inoculation in a growth chamber. The single spore-derived isolate, <italic>Bgt</italic> E18 was inoculated by shaking conidiospores from susceptible Kenong199 plants onto adult lm3 and wildtype plants. For each line, approximately five seeds were planted in a 25 cm pot as one replicate, and three replicates were grown in the greenhouse until the anthesis stage, at which time the pots were transferred to the growth chamber for inoculation. Reactions were scored 10 days after inoculation, when the wildtype plants were clearly infected.</p>

<p>Two commercial winter wheat varieties, Jingdong8 and Nongda3291, which were released in Beijing in 1995 and 2001, respectively, were crossed as the male parents with lm3 in 2005. The F<sub>1</sub> progenies of the lm3/Nongda3291 cross were self-pollinated or backcrossed with Nongda3291 in 2006, and the necrotic symptoms in the F<sub>2</sub> and BC<sub>1</sub> populations were measured during the 2006–2007 cropping season at the ES of IDGB, CAS. A second F<sub>2</sub> population derived from the lm3/Jingdong8 cross was also screened during the same season. The necrotic symptoms were scored at the anthesis stage and recorded as the presence (1) or absence (0) of the lesions on the flag leaf. The F<sub>2</sub> population derived from the lm3/Jingdong8 cross was employed for mapping the LM phenotype, and the derived F<sub>7:8</sub> segregating population was for fine-mapping to the 3B chromosome of Chinese Spring.</p>

<title>Occurrence of lesion symptoms in lm3</title>
<p>Lesion symptoms were observed in an F<sub>1</sub> plant derived from 3-1/Jing 411 at the anthesis stage in the field during 2000. The mutated F<sub>1</sub> was backcrossed six times with the female parent 3–1 and self-pollinated twice. One progeny was selected and designated as lm3 in 2005, resembling 3–1 except for the lesion symptoms. The lesion symptoms in lm3 were thoroughly examined for more than three growing seasons. The young seedlings exhibited small (1–3 mm), discrete white lesions in the absence of pathogens, and the lesions became more obvious at booting stage and merged into large necrotic spots at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The lesions progressively developed from the lower to upper leaves, and the lower leaves showed more severe symptoms of necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). On a specific leaf, the lesions were observed at the tip and expanded to the middle and bottom of the leaf blade to the leaf sheath. The lesions were not observed in other tissues except the leaf blade and leaf sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The older leaves with lesions turned yellow and showed early senescence. Eventually, the entire plant dried up earlier than normal plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). With the lesion formation, the total chlorophyll content in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant significantly decreased, showing a 74.90% reduction of which the contents of both Chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> were distinctly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant, the Chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> content was 0.83 mg/g, showing a 71.07% reduction compared with wildtype, whereas the Chlorophyll <italic>b</italic> content decreased by 82.77%, resulting in a higher Chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> ratio (3.46 vs. 2.09) in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant. Moreover, the reduction in the Chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> content was slower than that of the Chlorophyll <italic>b</italic> content in F<sub>1</sub> plants between lm3 and 3–1, resulting in a Chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> ratio of 3.02, intermediate between that of 3–1 and lm3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These findings indicated that Chlorophyll <italic>b</italic> was more prone to damage than Chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> during lesion formation.</p>

<title>Light activates the lesion mimic phenotype</title>
<p>Light has been reported as an important stimulus in some LMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref059">59</xref>]. Therefore a shading assay was performed in the greenhouse of IDGB, CAS to test whether lesion formation in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant was dependent on light. Leaves were covered with aluminum foil to block light before the expression of lesions, and 2 weeks later, no lesions were observed on the covered portions of the lm3 leaves, whereas necrotic spots were scattered throughout the bare areas under the normal illumination treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), which revealed that light plays an important role in lesion formation.</p>

</fig>
<p>We speculated that the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant might be sensitive to the light intensity because seedlings at the same stage grown in late autumn and early spring showed a different severity of lesion symptoms. To investigate the involvement of light in lesion formation, various photoperiod and light intensity treatments were applied to lm3 seedlings cultured with half-strength Hoagland solution in the greenhouse. Under the condition of 200 μ<italic>E</italic> and a 16 h photoperiod, lesions first appeared as small necrotic spots on the leaves and later expanded to form larger lesions with increasing incubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Compared with the lesions observed under a 16 h photoperiod, the number of large lesions (&gt;3 mm) was visibly decreased under a 12 h photoperiod, an even more so under a 6 h photoperiod, though the number of lesions did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The light intensity also influenced lesion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Under the conditions of a 50% light intensity (100 μ<italic>E</italic>) and a 16 h photoperiod, the size and number of lesions decreased significantly; large lesions (&gt;3 mm) were not observed and most of the visible lesions were very small (&lt;1 mm) with the total number of lesions being reduced to less than 20% of that under a 100% light intensity with a 16 h photoperiod. These results indicated that lesion symptoms were more easily stimulated by the light intensity treatments than the photoperiod treatments. The severity of lesion formation was also noted with the emergence of leaves in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant, and the older leaves were found to exhibit a greater severity of lesion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). These findings suggested that the lm3 lesion were induced by light, but both the light intensity and day length modulated lesion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Programmed cell death and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation</title>
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are usually accompanied by necrotic spot formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref001">1</xref>]. Trypan blue staining assay is a traditional method for staining dead tissues or cells and irreversible membrane damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref060">60</xref>]. After Trypan blue staining, the leaves of the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant exhibited a deep blue color at the site of lesions, whereas the surrounding normal cells in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant and wildtype leaves exhibited negative Trypan blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g004">Fig 4A–4D</xref>), suggesting that PCD occurred during lesion formation in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant. PCD was also demonstrated by a DNA laddering during lesion formation (data not shown). To confirm that ROS accompanied PCD, we performed a DAB staining assay to assess H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, in which a reddish-brown polymer precipitate is generated by the interaction between DAB and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of peroxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref061">61</xref>]. After staining, a large amount of reddish-brown precipitate was only observed at necrotic sites in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g004">Fig 4E–4H</xref>), and dark reddish-brown staining appeared with increasing severity of necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g004">Fig 4F and 4H</xref>), indicating a high level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant. This finding indicated that ROS accumulation in cells might be responsible for cell death and lesion formation, and the histochemical staining assay confirmed that the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant suffered from a hypersensitive reaction and exhibited programmed cell death with a visible phenotype at necrotic sites.</p>

<title>Wheat defense genes induced through LM</title>
<p>LMMs are widely considered to be involved in defense responses in plants. The expression of defense genes is strongly correlated with the onset of lesion formation in both dicots and monocots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref062">62</xref>]. To evaluate whether lesion formation is correlated with the expression of defense-related genes, total RNA was isolated from samples of the 1<sup>st</sup> leaves (fully developed lesions), 3<sup>rd</sup> leaf (developing lesions) and roots (no lesions) of the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant, and corresponding tissues in WT (3–1). A set of wheat defense-related genes was selected, including <italic>wheat chemically induced</italic> (<italic>WCI</italic>) and <italic>PR</italic> genes based on the involvement of these genes in defense responses to fungal pathogens in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref063">63</xref>], and primers were designed based on wheat sequences to amplify all three orthologous copies of each defense-related gene in the hexaploid wheat genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0155358.t001">Table 1</xref>). Using RT-qPCR, changes in the transcript levels of these genes in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant relative to those in WT plants were determined in root, 1<sup>st</sup> leaf, and 3<sup>rd</sup> leaf tissues, with the reference gene, Ta2776 (RNase L inhibitor-like protein), which was evaluated using various samples from a panel of candidate reference genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref045">45</xref>]. The RT-qPCR data revealed similar patterns of transcript abundance for seven of the ten selected defense-related genes in three assayed tissues in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant compared with WT. No significant changes in root samples but slight up-regulation (1.5–6.1-fold, except for the 21.4-fold up-regulation in <italic>WCI2</italic>) in the 1<sup>st</sup> leaf, and dramatic up-regulation (6.1–186.1-fold) in the 3<sup>rd</sup> leaf of the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant were observed in defense-related genes, <italic>PR2</italic>, <italic>PR3</italic>, <italic>PR4</italic>, PR9, <italic>PR10</italic>, <italic>WCI2</italic> and <italic>WCI3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g005">Fig 5</xref>). When the fold-change between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> leaves was compared in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant and WT plants, all seven genes were found to exhibit a stronger response to lesion formation, particularly <italic>PR9</italic> and <italic>WCI3</italic>, which presented 9- and 30-fold increases, respectively. This finding revealed that these defense-related genes were induced during lesion formation, and their up-regulation significantly decreased once the lesions had fully developed. Contrast to the seven genes indicated above, the up-regulation of <italic>PR1</italic> and <italic>TaGLP2a</italic> differed only slightly between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> leaves of the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The transcript abundance of <italic>PR1</italic> in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> leaves was approximately two-fold higher, while that of <italic>TaGLP2a</italic> was four-fold higher in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant compared with WT, suggesting potential preservation of the constitutive activation of a defense signaling pathway after lesion initiation in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant. In contrast, the transcript abundance of <italic>PWIR2</italic>, a thaumatin-like protein induced in plant defenses during pathogen attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref063">63</xref>], remained unaltered during lesion formation. However, the expression of this gene was unexpectedly found to be induced two-fold in the root samples from the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant, although no lesions were detected in the roots. This phenomenon was also observed for <italic>WCI3</italic> and <italic>TaGLP2a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g005">Fig 5</xref>), suggesting that root tissues might respond to lesion formation in the shoots.</p>

<title>Enhanced resistance to powdery mildew pathogens</title>
<p>Many LMMs of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice show various levels of defense resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref062">62</xref>]. To determine whether the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant is resistant to powdery mildew, natural powdery mildew infections were evaluated at the anthesis stage in field-grown 3–1 and lm3 plants during the 2009–2015 cropping seasons. In most seasons, sporulation was widely observed on the leaves of wildtype plants, indicating an epidemic of powdery mildew and showing the high susceptible of 3–1 plants to powdery mildew pathogens, whereas spores were not observed on the flag leaves of lm3 plants undergoing lesion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). This phenomenon was also observed in adult lm3 and wildtype plants in the greenhouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), which suggested resistance to powdery mildew during lesion formation in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant. However, a small amount of sporulations appeared on older leaves with lesion spots in <italic>lm3</italic> mutant plants in later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). To confirm the observed resistance, both lm3 and 3–1 adult plants were inoculated with the wheat powdery mildew fungus <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Bgt</italic>) in a growth chamber. At 10 days after inoculation with <italic>Bgt</italic> E18, the wildtype, 3–1 plants were heavily infected with large areas of white and brown spores on the flag leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) and top second leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), whereas few spores were observed in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant, despite the many lesions on its leaves.

<title>Genetic control of the lesion mimic phenotype</title>
<p>To investigate the inheritance of the LMM, two crosses (viz. lm3/Nongda3291, and lm3/Jingdong8), were performed, and the resultant F<sub>1</sub> plants showed lesion symptom on the leaves, but the speed and severity of lesion formation were reduced compared with homozygous <italic>lm3</italic> plants, suggesting that the <italic>lm3</italic> LM phenotype was genetically partial dominant. The genetic segregation was investigated using two F<sub>2</sub> populations derived from the lm3/Nongda3291 and lm3/Jingdong8 crosses.

<title>Molecular mapping of the <italic>lm3</italic> locus</title>
<p>The <italic>lm3</italic> locus was genetically mapped using the genomic DNA from 190 individual F<sub>2</sub> plants derived from the lm3/Jingdong8 cross and their corresponding LM phenotype. A total of 729 SSR primers distributed over all 21 chromosomes in hexaploid wheat were screened, and ~150 SSR markers exhibited polymorphisms between lm3 and Jingdong8. The bulked segregant analysis of these polymorphic markers was applied to assay the mutant and WT pools, in which equal amounts of DNA from 10 F<sub>2</sub> individuals with or without lesion symptoms were pooled. Only two markers, <italic>Xbarc203</italic> and <italic>Xbarc268</italic>, both located on chromosome 3B, were detected as polymorphic between the two parents and the lesion and WT bulks. These two polymorphic markers were closely linked with the lesion symptom after screening all 190 F<sub>2</sub> individuals derived from the lm3/Jingdong8 cross. To confirm these data, we performed the linkage analysis of <italic>Xbarc203</italic> and <italic>Xbarc268</italic>, along with five other SSR markers located on chromosome 3B exhibiting polymorphisms between lm3 and Jingdong8, and eventually a linkage map including seven polymorphic markers and the <italic>lm3</italic> locus was constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

Because <italic>Xbarc1140</italic>, <italic>Xbarc203</italic>, and <italic>Xbarc268</italic> were located at positions 374.423 Mb (BV211508, <italic>Xbarc1140</italic>), 511.906 Mb (BV211642, <italic>Xbarc203</italic>), and 549.106 Mb (BV211841, <italic>Xbarc268</italic>), respectively, additional SSR markers were developed from the 400–402 Mb, 450–452 Mb, 479–481 Mb, 492–494 Mb, 499–500 Mb, 511–513 Mb, and 520–524 Mb regions of chromosome 3B (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/gb2/gbrowse/wheat_annot_3B/" xlink:type="simple">https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/gb2/gbrowse/wheat_annot_3B/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0155358.t003">Table 3</xref>). The newly developed SSR markers were first screened through lm3 and Jingdong8, and then these polymorphic markers were applied to a subset population including 24 segregating F<sub>7:8</sub> individuals. Moreover, six markers (<italic>SSR3B400</italic>.<italic>4</italic>, <italic>SSR3B450</italic>.<italic>37</italic>, <italic>SSR3B492</italic>.<italic>6</italic>, <italic>SSR3B499</italic>.<italic>24</italic>, <italic>SSR3B511</italic>.<italic>2</italic> and <italic>SSR3B520</italic>.<italic>6</italic>) were closely linked with <italic>lm3</italic>, and these markers were further assayed using the entire F<sub>7:8</sub> segregating population. The linkage analysis was performed using the genotypes of SSR markers and the phenotypic data of the entire F<sub>7:8</sub> population, and the <italic>lm3</italic> locus was flanked by <italic>SSR3B450</italic>.<italic>37</italic> and <italic>SSR3B492</italic>.<italic>6</italic> at genetic distances of 2.07 cM and 0.95 cM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). To delimit the <italic>lm3</italic> locus to a narrow region, the 482–484 Mb, 487–489 Mb, and 490–492 Mb regions of chromosome 3B were subjected to SSR development, and SSR markers with polymorphisms between two parents were monomorphic between individuals with or without lesion symptoms, failing to map in the genetic linkage map. Thus, <italic>lm3</italic> was mapped to a 40 Mb region on chromosome 3B, flanked by <italic>SSR3B450</italic>.<italic>37</italic> and <italic>SSR3B492</italic>.<italic>6</italic>.</p>

<title>A new type of LM in wheat</title>
<p>The <italic>lm3</italic> mutant is a novel LMM of wheat, characterized by the spontaneous cell death phenotype typical to previously reported LMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This mutant likely originated from a natural mutation in the field, expressed as small, discrete white lesions on the leaf blades during the early stages of development, and expanding into large whitish-brown necrotic spots on the leaf blade and leaf sheaths in late stages of development, particularly after the anthesis stage, during which the time and intensity of solar illumination increased markedly in the field. On a specific leaf blade, lesions originated from the leaf tips and subsequently extended to the entire leaf blade. The stages and patterns of lesion development in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant differed from those reported in previous studies. The development of lesions in the C591 (M8) mutant arising from N-nitroso methyl urethane treatment is only observed beginning at the booting stage, progressing from the lowest leaf sheath and leaf toward the top; the appearance of spots is random, and the spotting intensity varies on a particular leaf blade and leaf sheath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref064">64</xref>]. The M66 lesion mutant obtained through X-ray mutagenesis expressed necrotic spots on the leaves at the young seedling stage with the main shoot and two or three tillers and continued to develop up to seed setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref065">65</xref>].The lesions in the HLP mutant, induced through ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), only became evident on the leaf tips at the fifth or sixth leaf stage and randomly spread along the leaf blades, the leaf sheathes and flowering tissues; however these lesions were small (1–2 mm) and white in color [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref037">37</xref>]. The spotted-leaf mutant LF2010A was also obtained through EMS treatment; this mutant initially shows bright yellow spots on its primary leaves at the three-leaf stage, which subsequently spread to the leaves and leaf sheaths of the entire plant, including spike tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref014">14</xref>]. The natural LM mutant in Ning7840 spontaneously exhibited small, discrete, yellowish spots only on the leaf blades around the heading stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref012">12</xref>]. Different from previous lesion mutants, a novel lesion-mimic phenotype, appearing in a segregating population of the common wheat cross Yanzhan1/Zaosui30, was controlled through the interaction of two recessive genes. The lesion-mimic phenotype became most obvious at the booting stage, progressively developing from the lower leaves to the flag leaf and characterizing discrete brown lesions on the leaf blades, leaf sheathes and flowering tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref013">13</xref>]. Moreover, most of those LMMs are controlled by recessive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref039">39</xref>], but only a few mutations are regulated by dominant genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref064">64</xref>]. In the present study, it could be concluded that the lm3 mutant had newly arisen because its LM phenotype was controlled by a partially dominant gene. In the heterozygous F<sub>1</sub> individual, the lesions were less abundant and smaller than those in the homozygous <italic>lm3</italic> mutant, and the chlorophyll content also decreased to values observed between those of the two parents (lm3 and 3–1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Chromosome location of <italic>lm3</italic></title>
<p>Many LMMs have been identified in higher plants, particularly in Arabidopsis, rice and maize, and a number of genes conferring the corresponding phenotype have been mapped onto chromosomes, and even cloned with the availability of the genome sequences. In hexaploid wheat, several LMMs have been characterized using a variety of methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref065">65</xref>], whereas few genes have been mapped and cloned, reflecting the genome complexity and insufficiency of the genome sequences. The LM in Ning7840 was mapped to chromosome 1BL 15 cM away from the closest markers <italic>Xwmc85</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>Xwmc264</italic>.<italic>1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref012">12</xref>]. MNR220 is located on chromosome 2BS flanked by XBE497494 (9.3 cM) and Xbarc183 (12.6 cM), and is responsible for the pathogen-induced necrotic spots observed in a broad-spectrum disease resistant mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref066">66</xref>]. Two interactive loci (<italic>lm1</italic> and <italic>lm2</italic>) resulting in the LM phenotype in a segregating population of the common wheat cross Yanzhan1/Zaosui30 were mapped to chromosomes 3BS flanked between <italic>Xwmc674</italic> and <italic>Xbarc133</italic>/<italic>Xbarc147</italic> and 4BL between <italic>Xgwm513</italic> and <italic>Xksum154</italic>, respectively. In the present study, <italic>lm3</italic> was mapped to chromosome 3BL, close to the centromere region, different from the <italic>lm1</italic> locus on chromosome 3BS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref013">13</xref>]. Taken together, among the mapped loci/genes for the LM phenotype, most loci were mapped on B genomes, suggesting that these B genomes harbor more necrosis-related genes or are prone to mutation.</p>
<p>Because the complete 3B genome sequence of Chinese Spring is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref067">67</xref>], fine mapping and map-based cloning of the <italic>lm3</italic> locus was attempted using the derived F<sub>7:8</sub> segregating population obtained from the lm3/Jingdong8 cross. Several dozens of SSR markers were designed within the 400 to 520 Mb genome regions of chromosome 3B. These SSR markers were screened with lm3, Jingdong8 and a subset of the derived F<sub>7:8</sub> segregating population, and only a few markers could be anchored to the <italic>lm3</italic> locus map of chromosome 3B after genotyping 5376 individuals. This result revealed the flanking of the <italic>lm3</italic> locus within <italic>SSR3B450</italic>.<italic>37</italic> and <italic>SSR3B492</italic>.<italic>6</italic>, having the genetic distances of 2.07 cM and 0.95 cM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). To fine map the <italic>lm3</italic> locus, additional SSR markers were designed in the regions of 482 to 490 Mb, but these markers failed to reveal polymorphisms between individuals with or without the LM symptoms even though several markers were polymorphic between the two parents of the initial population. In the present study, the strategy of the derived segregating population was explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref068">68</xref>], the heterozygous individuals were preserved and self-pollinated in each segregating generation from the F<sub>2</sub> generation, and a F<sub>7:8</sub> segregating population comprising 5,376 individuals was developed from twenty self-pollinated F<sub>7</sub> individuals. Selection based on the phenotypic data might lead to the recombination between the <italic>lm3</italic> locus, and these recombinants were selected and propagated, causing monomorphisms between individuals with or without LM symptoms. Moreover, the <italic>lm3</italic> locus in 3BL was located near the centromere region, where low polymorphisms were generally detected among the different lines. Several F<sub>2</sub> populations were currently being developed to solve these problems.</p>

<title>Light requirements for the occurrence of LMs</title>
<p>The formation of plant LMs is correlated with the disturbance of the regulation of metabolic pathways through related gene mutations, and is also associated with environmental factors, including light, temperature, humidity and nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref069">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref070">70</xref>]. The size of the rice <italic>spl1</italic>, <italic>spl3</italic> and <italic>spl4</italic> lesions increased with light intensity and elevated temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref024">24</xref>]. Variable lesion densities were observed on the rice <italic>spl7</italic> mutant at different temperatures and ultraviolet solar irradiation, with the density decreasing at low temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref015">15</xref>]. The <italic>spl30(t)</italic> lesions were induced through light, including fluorescent light, and enhanced by higher temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref022">22</xref>], whereas the lesions of the rice <italic>Oslsd1</italic> mutant were induced at a lower temperature and under shorter duration of daylight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref001">1</xref>]. Moreover, the expression of lesion spots in <italic>spl30</italic> mutants is sensitive to light and humidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref061">61</xref>]. In the present study, no visible lesions were detected under the 0 -h photoperiod, but lesions appeared under illumination, indicating that the mutant was light dependent, similar to the LF2010A mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref014">14</xref>] and the LM lines derived from the Yanzhan1/Zaosui30 cross [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition, the size and number of lesions significantly increased under the conditions of higher light intensity and longer photoperiods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These data suggested that both light intensity and photoperiod play essential roles in lesion formation. However, additional studies on responses to the specific spectrum of light and the mechanisms of the light-dependent lesion formation in this mutant should be considered.</p>

<title>Expression of defense-related genes</title>
<p>Lesion mimic mutants are interesting genetic materials for dissecting pathways of disease resistance and PCD. Thus far, 37 of the 49 identified spotted-leaf mutants of rice have been reported to show enhanced resistance to at least one pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref022">22</xref>]. Although the detailed underlying mechanism remains poorly understood, a wide range of defense genes have been implicated in an intricate network of defense signaling pathways associated with resistance to microbial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref071">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref072">72</xref>]. The elevated expression of these defense genes accompanied the pathogen inoculation, and the over-expression of a range of genes has led to improved disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref073">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref074">74</xref>]. In the present study, we speculated that the initiation of lesions in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant might also be associated with the activation of defense genes, particularly pathogen-related genes linked to resistance to powdery mildew. To examine this possibility, we analyzed the expression of a panel of wheat defense genes including representatives of the <italic>WCI</italic> and <italic>PR</italic> gene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref043">43</xref>]. Five <italic>PR</italic> and two <italic>WCI</italic> genes were significantly up-regulated during the initiation of lesion formation in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant, and the elevated fold-changes of these genes decreased once the lesions were fully developed. The <italic>WCI</italic> genes are a specific set of genes induced through benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothionic acid S-methyl ester (BTH), and this induction increased protection against the wheat powdery mildew fungus <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref075">75</xref>]. The expression of <italic>WCI2</italic> and <italic>WCI3</italic> in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant was induced through the initiation of lesion formation, and the expression of these genes remained at a higher level after lesion formation, suggesting that both genes are involved in the HR of PCD and ROS accumulation. Two other <italic>PR</italic> genes, <italic>PR1</italic> and <italic>TaGLP2a</italic> showed stable up-regulation during lesion formation in the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant, indicating that the potential constitutive activation of a defense signaling pathway was preserved after lesion initiation. <italic>TaGLP2a</italic> is strongly induced by <italic>Fusarium pseudograminearum</italic>, methyl jasmonate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref043">43</xref>], and <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref076">76</xref>], and the encoded protein displays functions involved in resistance, as transient overexpression in wheat cells enhances resistance against <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic>, whereas transient silencing through RNA interference reduces resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref077">77</xref>]. <italic>PR1</italic>, which is considered a defense marker in plant–pathogen interactions, is induced by a wide-range of microbial pathogens, environmental stresses and chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref078">78</xref>] and over-expression of this gene confers improved resistance to the powdery mildew fungus <italic>Peronosclerospora sorghi</italic> in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref059">59</xref>]. In the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant, the up-regulated expression of these defense genes suggested that <italic>lm3</italic> acts as a positive regulator in the plant resistance signaling pathway. In contrast, the transcript abundance of <italic>PWIR2</italic>, a thaumatin-like protein induced in plant defense during pathogen attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155358.ref063">63</xref>], remained unchanged during lesion formation. However, the expression of this gene was two-fold higher in root samples from the <italic>lm3</italic> mutant even though no lesions were detected in the roots. This phenomenon was also observed in <italic>WCI3</italic> and <italic>TaGLP2a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155358.g005">Fig 5</xref>), suggesting that root tissues responded to lesion formation in the shoots. Therefore, further cloning of the <italic>lm3</italic> gene will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cell death and disease resistance signaling in plants.</p>
