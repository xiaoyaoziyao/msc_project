<abstract>
<p>Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is required for maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Here, we have confirmed transcription factor Forkhead Box m1 (Foxm1) as a LIF/Stat3 downstream target that mediates LIF/Stat3-dependent mESC self-renewal. The expression of Foxm1 relies on LIF signaling and is stimulated by Stat3 directly in mESCs. The knockdown of Foxm1 results in the loss of mESC pluripotency in the presence of LIF, and the overexpression of Foxm1 alone maintains mESC pluripotency in the absence of LIF and feeder layers, indicating that Foxm1 is a mediator of LIF/Stat3-dependent maintenance of pluripotency in mESCs. Furthermore, the inhibition of Foxm1 expression prevents the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), suggesting that Foxm1 is essential for the reprogramming of somatic cells into iPSCs. Our results reveal an essential function of Foxm1 in the LIF/Stat3-mediated mESC self-renewal and the generation of iPSCs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are derived from the inner cell mass of the pre-implantation blastocyst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Martin1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Evans1">[2]</xref> and characterized by three distinguishing features: pluripotency (the capability of differentiating into tissues derived from all three germ layers), self-renewal (maintenance of an undifferentiated state) and limitless proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Smith1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Chambers1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Niwa1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Pera1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Nichols1">[7]</xref>, which can be maintained in part by the cytokine LIF in mESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Williams1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Yoshida1">[9]</xref>. LIF participates in the maintenance of the mESC self-renewal mainly by activating Stat3 through the LIF/JAK (Janus kinase)/Stat3 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Niwa2">[10]</xref> and the removal of LIF results in rapid differentiation of mESCs in the culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Matsuda1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Niwa3">[12]</xref>. Inactivation of Stat3 also abolishes LIF-dependent mESC proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Takeda1">[13]</xref>. These findings implicate that Stat3 is tightly integrated into regulatory mechanisms for the maintenance of the mESC identity.</p>
<p>Stat3 forms a homodimer upon induction by LIF through JAK-mediated phosphorylation and subsequently translocates into the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Raz1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Wen1">[15]</xref>, where it regulates transcription of its downstream targets to maintain embryonic stem cell identity. Genome-wide ChIP-sequencing experiments confirm that Stat3 binds to the regulatory regions of many pluripotency genes including Oct4 and Nanog, and approximately one third of Stat3-binding loci in the mESC genome are co-occupied by Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Chen1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Kidder1">[17]</xref>. Extensive studies have identified Stat3 downstream targets that regulate mESC self-renewal, including transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, and kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Hirai1">[18]</xref>. For example, transcription factor Klf4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Niwa2">[10]</xref> and SH2 domain-containing protein Socs3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Forrai1">[19]</xref>, which have been shown to be fundamental for the LIF-mediated maintenance of pluripotency and for the inhibition of differentiation in mESCs, are the downstream targets of Stat3.</p>
<p>Transcription factor Forkhead Box m1 (Foxm1) belongs to the fork head/winged-helix family of transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Kaestner1">[20]</xref> and is ubiquitously expressed in proliferating and regenerating mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Ye1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Koo1">[22]</xref>. Foxm1 is a key cell cycle regulator in both the transition from G1 to S phase and the progression to mitosis by regulating transcription of cell cycle genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Wang1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Laoukili1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Wang2">[25]</xref>. It is also involved in stimulating angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Zhang1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Li1">[27]</xref>, counteracting stresses induced by cytotoxic or genotoxic signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Tan1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Li2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Tan2">[30]</xref>, and enhancing epithelial to mesenchymal transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Yang1">[31]</xref>. Foxm1 is highly expressed in various types of human malignancies and is considered as a potential therapeutic target for the development of anti-cancer treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Wang3">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Chen2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Yang2">[34]</xref>. Our previous study has confirmed that Foxm1 participates in maintenance of pluripotency of mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells and the transcription of Oct4 is stimulated directly by Foxm1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Xie1">[35]</xref>. In addition, the overexpression of Foxm1 alone in human newborn fibroblasts restarts the expression of pluripotent genes, including Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Xie1">[35]</xref>, implicating a critical involvement of Foxm1 in maintenance of stem cell pluripotency. A recent study has found that Stat3 stimulates the expression of Foxm1 to enhance the proliferation, survival and DNA repair in human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Mencalha1">[36]</xref>, suggesting the potential of Foxm1 as a Stat3 target gene.</p>
<p>In this study, we have identified Foxm1 as a critical LIF/Stat3 downstream target that mediates LIF/Stat3-dependent mESC self-renewal. We have found that the expression of Foxm1 relies on LIF signaling and is stimulated by Stat3 directly in mESCs. The knockdown of Foxm1 has an obvious effect on mESC self-renewal even in the presence of LIF signaling. The overexpression of Foxm1 alone maintains mESC pluripotency in the absence of LIF and feeder layer, indicating that Foxm1 is a mediator of LIF/Stat3-dependent maintenance of pluripotency in mESCs. In addition, the inhibition of Foxm1 expression abolishes the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), suggesting that Foxm1 is essential for the reprogramming of somatic cells into iPSCs. Our results reveal an essential function of Foxm1 in the LIF/Stat3-mediated mESC self-renewal and the generation of iPSCs.</p>

<p>MEFs and HEK293T cells (Invitrogen, USA) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, GIBCO,USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, USA), L-Glutamine (GIBCO, USA), 100 nM nonessential amino acids (GIBCO, USA), and 100 uM beta-mercaptoethanl (GIBCO, USA). Mouse ESC lines D3 (ATCC, USA) and iPSCs were co-cultured with feeder cells [MEFs (isolated from BALB/c mouse embryos at day 13 of gestation and expanded for 4 passages, 3×10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Jozefczuk1">[37]</xref> that were treated with 10 mg/L Mitomycin C (Sigma, USA) for 2.5 h before use] in 0.1% gelatin (Sigma, USA)-coated dishes at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. ESC medium is DMEM/F12 (GIBCO, USA) containing the same supplements as MEF medium, plus 15% fetal bovine serum qualified (GIBCO, USA) and 1000 unit/ml LIF (Millipore, USA). In standard D3 cell culture, feeder layers were plated one day before passaging the cell and the single cell suspensions of trypsinized D3 cells were passaged to feeder layers by the ratio 1∶5 and the medium was changed every 3 to 4 days following the instructions of ATCC CRL-1934 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.atcc.org/products/all/CRL-1934.aspx" xlink:type="simple">http://www.atcc.org/products/all/CRL-1934.aspx</ext-link>). Feeder layers were not replated during the 7 day culture time course. For Mek, GSK3, and JAK inhibition, D3 medium was supplemented with the inhibitors: 1 µM PD0325901 (Selleck, USA), 3 µM CHIR99021 (Selleck, USA), and 10 µM JAK inhibitor I (Carbiochem, Germany). FOXM1-overexpressing D3 cells were passaged in standard ESC medium without LIF and feeders for 10 passages.</p>

<title>LIF signaling pathways maintain the expression of Foxm1 in mESCs</title>
<p>LIF belongs to the interleukin-6 cytokine family and binds to a heterodimeric receptor consisting of the LIF receptor and gp130, with downstream signals being transmitted through gp130 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Gearing1">[41]</xref>. Self-renewal of mESCs under conventional culture conditions depends on the presence of LIF and the withdrawal of LIF results in the induction of differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Niwa2">[10]</xref>. As expected, D3 ES cells derived from the 129S2/SvPas mouse strain lost the typical colony morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and positive alkaline phosphatase staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) when cultured in the presence of feeders without LIF for one week. The withdrawal of LIF prevented the activation of JAK kinase, evidenced by the decreased levels of phosphorylated Stat3 and the Stat3 target gene Klf4 after D3 ES cells were cultured without LIF for 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the withdrawal of LIF for 2 days also resulted in the decreased levels of Foxm1 protein in D3 ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g001">Fig. 1C–D</xref>), implicating that the expression of Foxm1 in D3 ES cells relied on LIF signaling. The withdrawal of LIF for 2 days in D3 ES cells did not affect significantly the protein levels of the known pluripotency genes such as Nanog and Sox2 although a mild decrease for Oct4 protein was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Moreover, we found that the decrease of Foxm1 mRNA happened as early as at 6 hours post the LIF withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), suggesting that the expression of Foxm1 was regulated at its transcriptional level through LIF signaling pathway. The mRNA levels of the two known direct targets regulated at the transcriptional level by Stat3, Klf4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Niwa2">[10]</xref> and Socs3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Forrai1">[19]</xref>, were also found to decrease as similar as that of Foxm1 post the LIF withdrawal in D3 ES cells by qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), implicating that the transcription of Foxm1 could be regulated by Stat3 in mESCs.</p>

<title>Stat3 regulates the transcription of Foxm1 in mESCs</title>
<p>In mESCs, the Stat3 pathway plays a critical role in the maintenance of self-renewal and is activated through the Stat3 phosphorylation by JAKs mediated through gp130 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Heinrich1">[42]</xref>. We found that the withdrawal of LIF for two days abolished the phosphorylation of Stat3 in D3 ES cells and the addition of LIF again for another two days resulted in the re-phosphorylation of Stat3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), suggesting a re-activation of Stat3 transcriptional activity. This re-phosphorylation of Stat3 with the LIF addition correlated with the induction of Foxm1 expression, evidenced by the increased levels of Foxm1 protein in Western blot analysis of –LIF/+LIF D3 ES cell samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, the Foxm1 promoter activity was induced by LIF addition in D3 ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), providing the direct evidence that the Foxm1 induction by LIF signaling happened at its transcriptional level. There are a number of pathways downstream of LIF signaling, including the JAK-Stat3, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Hirai1">[18]</xref>. Among them, the JAK-Stat3 pathway is solely regulated by LIF in mESCs but the other two are regulated by multiple pathways. The two inhibitors (2i) of Mek (PD0325901) and GSK3β (CHIR99021), which block MAPK pathway and the common target of PI3K/AKT pathway GSK3β respectively, have been shown to maintain the self-renewal of mESCs without LIF addition in the mESC medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Ying1">[43]</xref>. To confirm that the Foxm1 transcription was regulated by JAK-Stat3 pathway, we incubated cells with the 2i before LIF stimulation. We found that the 2i treatment did not affect the induction of Foxm1 mRNA levels by LIF stimulation, similar to the induction of the two Stat3 transcription targets Klf4 and Socs3 at the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of JAK inhibitor I abolished the induction of Foxm1 levels by LIF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), implicating Foxm1 as a potential transcription target of JAK-Stat3 pathway. The Stat3 DNA binding consensus sequence (TTCCNGGAA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Chen1">[16]</xref> was found at the region of −1209 to −1201 bp of the −2 kb mouse Foxm1 promoter by gene sequence analysis and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to confirm that Stat3 bound to the endogenous Foxm1 promoter in mouse D3 ES cells, measured by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>) and qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) with primers specific to the Foxm1 promoter −1372 to −1056 bp region. This Stat3 binding activity on Foxm1 promoter was further confirmed by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA). Nuclear extracts were prepared from Stat3-overexpressing D3 ES cells and used for EMSA with a FAM-labeled DNA probe synthesized from the mouse Foxm1 promoter sequence position −1218 bp to −1192 bp. The protein of Stat3 bound to the probe and the addition of 100 fold an unlabeled probe outcompeted the formation of Stat3/DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). The addition of 100 fold an unlabeled mutated probe did not affect the Stat3/DNA complex formation and the addition of Stat3-specific antibody resulted in a super-shift band of the Stat3/DNA complex in EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). The binding of Stat3 on the promoters of well-known Stat3 target genes such as Klf4 and Socs3 was tested with the probes (Klf4:−1487/−1461 bp and Socs3:−68/−42 bp) from these two genes' promoters as positive controls for EMSA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). The ESMA was also performed with nuclear extracts from the No LIF/No feeder D3 ES cell samples, in which the expression levels of Stat3 protein was dramatically abolished, to confirm the specificity of Stat3 binding activity on Foxm1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). Together, these results suggested that the transcription of Foxm1 was stimulated by LIF signaling pathway through Stat3 in mESCs.</p>

<p>(A) Response to the activation of LIF signaling. D3 ES cells were cultured in the presence of feeders without LIF for two days and then LIF was added back for another two days. Western blot analyses were performed with antibodies specific for Foxm1, Stat3, phosphorylated Stat3 (p-Stat3), and β-actin. (B) The response of Foxm1 promoter activity to LIF signaling. D3 ES cells were cultured in LIF-free and feeder-free conditions and transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing −1.3 kb Foxm1 promoter and the pRL-CMV plasmid (loading control). LIF (1000 U/ml) was added 1 day later and luciferase activities were measured at 24 h after addition of LIF. (C) Sensitivity of LIF-mediated upregulation of Foxm1 to pathway-specific inhibitors. D3 ES cells were cultured without LIF for 4 days and then LIF was added for 6 h. The mix of two inhibitors (2i) of Mek (PD0325901 1 µM) and GSK3β (CHIR99021 3 µM), or JAK inhibitor I (10 µM) was added 1 hour before the addition of LIF. The mRNA levels of Foxm1, Klf4 and Socs3 were estimated by qPCR. (D–E) Stat3 bound to endogenous Foxm1 promoter. The position of a putative Stat3 binding site (TTCCNGGAA) in −2 kb mouse Foxm1 promoter was predicted by gene sequence analysis and the product of ChIP assays was also predicted. The chromatin of D3 ES cells was cross-linked, sonicated, and then immunoprecipitated (IP) with either Stat3 antibody or IgG (control) and the amount of promoter DNA associated with the IP chromatin was estimated by PCR/agarose gel electrophoresis (D) or qPCR (E) with the primers specific to Foxm1 promoter region. The predicted size of the PCR product was 328 bp. (F) Stat3 bound to the Stat3 binding sequence in Foxm1 promoter. Protein lysates were prepared from Stat3-overexpressing D3 ES cells and used for EMSA with a FAM-labeled DNA probe synthesized from the mouse Foxm1 promoter sequence position −1218 bp to −1192 bp. An unlabeled probe (100×), an unlabeled mutated probe (100×), or a Stat3-specific antibody was used in EMSA as controls. Protein lysates prepared from D3 ES cells without LIF and feeder layers was used as a control of the decreased Stat3 proteins.</p>

<title>Knockdown of Foxm1 results in the loss of pluripotency of mESCs</title>
<p>Our previous study found that Foxm1 participated in maintenance of mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cell pluripotency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Xie1">[35]</xref>. To further confirm the essential role of Foxm1 in maintaining the pluripotency of mESCs, we constructed a lentiviral vector expressing Foxm1-specific shRNA. This shRNA sequence was chosen from three Foxm1 siRNA sequences based on their knockdown efficiency on Foxm1 expression and the consequent effects on the expression of putative Foxm1 target gene Nanog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s003">Fig. S3A–B</xref>). The constructed Foxm1 shRNA lentivirus mediated an effective knockdown of Foxm1 expression in mouse cells post viral infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s003">Fig. S3C</xref>). The Foxm1 shRNA lentivirus was used to infect D3 ES cells with the standard ES cell culture condition and the knockdown of Foxm1 expression resulted in the loss of the typical mESC morphology of D3 ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The protein levels and phosphorylation of Stat3 were not affected by the Foxm1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting that Foxm1 was a downstream protein of Stat3 in D3 ES cells. A dramatic decrease of Oct4 and Nanog protein levels was observed in Foxm1-deficient D3 ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Our previous study confirmed that the transcription of Oct4 was stimulated directly by Foxm1 in pluripotent stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Xie1">[35]</xref>, and the transcription of Nanog was also regulated by Foxm1 (unpublished data). Consequently the Foxm1-deficient D3 ES cells lost the positive alkaline phosphatase staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). In addition, we measured the effects of Foxm1 knockdown on the mRNA levels of pluripotency-related genes in D3 ES cells. The Foxm1 knockdown decreased mRNA levels of Utf1, Oct4, Nanog, and Esrrb dramatically but did not result in significant changes on the transcription of Klf4, Tbx3, Klf2, and Sall4 in D3 ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), suggesting that Foxm1 was involved in the regulatory circuit essential to the mESC identity and participated in regulating the expression of important transcription factors for mESC pluripotency. Taken together, these observations suggested an essential role of Foxm1 in maintenance of the pluripotency of mESCs.</p>

<title>Overexpression of FOXM1 is sufficient to maintain the pluripotency of mESCs in the absence of LIF and feeder layers</title>
<p>We constructed a lentiviral vector expressing human FOXM1B cDNA that mediated an effective overexpression of FOXM1 post viral infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s003">Fig. S3D</xref>). The lenti-FOXM1 vector was used to infect D3 ES cells and the lentivirus-infected D3 ES cells were cultured for one week in the absence of LIF and feeder layers.

The endogenous expression of Foxm1 was hardly detected but the lenti-FOXM1 infection maintained the exogenous FOXM1 expression in D3 ES cells cultured without LIF and feeder layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s003">Fig. S3E</xref>), suggesting that the expression of endogenous Foxm1 relied on the both the LIF signaling and feeder layers.

Consistent with the ESC morphology of lenti-FOXM1 infected D3 ES cells cultured without LIF and feeders, the decreased levels of Oct4 and Nanog in D3 ES cells in the absence of LIF and feeder layers were upregulated by the overexpression of FOXM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

<title>Foxm1 is essential for the reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent cells</title>
<p>Overexpression of a cocktail of four transcription factors (i.e. Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) has resulted in the induction of pluripotency in somatic cells and these induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs-4F) have all the properties of pluripotent cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Takahashi1">[44]</xref>. Because we observed a critical function of Foxm1 in the LIF/Stat3-mediated mESC self-renewal, it's worthy to test whether Foxm1 participated in the progression of iPSC generation. We did not find that FOXM1 was able to replace any of the four known iPSC factors during iPSC induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s004">Fig. S4A–B</xref>). In addition, the overexpression of FOXM1 plus the four factors (4F+FOXM1) did not result in an obvious improvement on the efficiency of iPSC generation but created bigger colonies and better iPSC morphology than 4F alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s004">Fig. S4C</xref>, data not shown). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed for Nanog, Utf1, Tbx3, Klf2, Sall4, Esrrb, and Foxm1 mRNA levels in D3 ES cells, iPSCs-4F and iPSCs-4F+FOXM1. The mRNA levels of endogenous Foxm1 were significantly increased in iPSCs-4F+FOXM1 compared to that of D3 ES cells and iPSCs-4F (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s004">Fig. S4D</xref>). On the other hand, except Nanog and Utf1 whose levels were moderately increased in iPSCs-4F+FOXM1, the levels of Tbx3, Klf2, Sall4, and Esrrb were similar among the samples of D3 ES cells, iPSCs-4F and iPSCs-4F+FOXM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s004">Fig. S4D</xref>). It's well known that pluripotency-related transcription factors formed regulatory feedback circuits to maintain their suitable levels in ESCs for pluripotency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Boyer1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092304-Loh1">[46]</xref>. The results of the levels of the many tested pluripotency-related genes that were expressed similarly between iPSCs-4F and iPSCs-4F+FOXM1 could explain why the efficiency of iPSC generation was not improved by the addition of FOXM1 overexpression. Interestingly, we found that the knockdown of Foxm1 expression affected the formation of iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). As expected, the typical iPSC colony formation from MEFs was induced by the infection of four lentiviruses (4F) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s004">Fig. S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g005">Fig. 5A–B</xref>). The Foxm1 shRNA lentivirus coupled with the infection of 4F during iPSC formation prevented the formation of iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed in the samples of MEFs infected by 4F or 4F coupled with the Foxm1 shRNA lentivirus at day 14 post lentiviral infection, and the infection of Foxm1 shRNA lentivirus during iPSC induction dramatically decreased the numbers of alkaline phosphatase positive clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092304-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). We further investigated the ability of Foxm1-deficient cells to form teratomas. MEFs were infected by 4F or 4F coupled with the Foxm1 shRNA lentivirus for 14 days and the cells were collected and injected into the nude mice subcutaneously. Compared with the 4F iPSC-formed teratomas, which contained derivatives of all three germ layers, MEFs infected by 4F coupled with the Foxm1 shRNA lentivirus were not able to form teratomas at day 24 post inoculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092304.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). The observations suggested that Foxm1 is essential for the reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent cells.</p>

<title>Foxm1 is essential for the reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent cells.</title>
<p>(A) The procedure of iPCS induction with the infection of a cocktail of lentiviral vectors. (B) The knockdown of Foxm1 expression prevented the formation of iPSCs. MEFs (3×10<sup>4</sup> cells) were infected by four lentiviruses that expressed Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc respectively (OSKM). The lentiviral vector expressing Foxm1-specific shRNA was coupled with the infection of OSKM four factors during iPSC formation. Fluorescent and light microscopy images were taken at day 10 of the iPSC formation. (C) Alkaline phosphatase staining of MEFs infected by OSKM or the four factors coupled with the Foxm1 shRNA lentivirus was performed at day 14 post lentiviral infection and the alkaline phosphatase positive (AP<sup>+</sup>) colony numbers were counted.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, we identified Foxm1 as a critical LIF/Stat3 downstream target that mediated LIF/Stat3-dependent mESC self-renewal in this study. Moreover, we found that the overexpression of Foxm1 alone maintained mESC pluripotency in the absence of LIF and feeder layers. In addition, we observed that the inhibition of Foxm1 expression abolished the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to iPSCs. Together, our results revealed an essential function of Foxm1 in the LIF/Stat3-mediated mESC self-renewal and the generation of iPSCs.</p>

<p><bold>The effects of Foxm1 siRNA and lentivial vectors.</bold> (A) The transfection of FoxM1 siRNA into mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells effectively diminished the expression of Foxm1. The increasing amounts of Foxm1 siRNA #1, #2, or #3 were transfected into P19 cells. Protein extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection and then analyzed for Foxm1 protein levels by Western blotting (WB). The knockdown of Foxm1 mRNA in P19 cells by the transfection of Foxm1 siRNA #1, #2, or #3 (30 nM) was also measured by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). (B) Dose response of Foxm1 siRNA transfections on the expression of Nanog protein in P19 cells. (C) The lentiviral vector expressing Foxm1-specific shRNA mediated an effective knockdown of Foxm1 expression in P19 cells post viral infection. Western blot analyses were performed for the expression of Foxm1 and b-actin in P19 cells, P19 cells infected with the control lentivirus (NC shRNA), or P19 cells infected with the Foxm1 shRNA lentivirus (Foxm1 shRNA) for 2 days. (D) The lentiviral vector expressing human FOXM1 cDNA mediated an overexpression of FOXM1 in 293T cells post viral infection. Western blot analyses were performed for the expression of FOXM1 and b-actin in 293T cells or 293T cells infected with the Foxm1 shRNA lentivirus (Lv-hFOXM1) for 2 days.
