      <abstract>
         <p>Activation of the FGF-ERK pathway is necessary for naïve mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to exit self-renewal and commit to early differentiated lineages. Here we show that genetic ablation of <italic>Erk2</italic>, the predominant ERK isozyme expressed in ES cells, results in hyper-phosphorylation of ERK1, but an overall decrease in total ERK activity as judged by substrate phosphorylation and immediate-early gene (IEG) induction. Normal induction of this subset of canonical ERK targets, as well as p90RSK phosphorylation, was rescued by transgenic expression of either ERK1 or ERK2 indicating a degree of functional redundancy. In contrast to previously published work, <italic>Erk2</italic>-null ES cells exhibited no detectable defect in lineage specification to any of the three germ layers when induced to differentiate in either embryoid bodies or in defined neural induction conditions. However, under self-renewing conditions <italic>Erk2</italic>-null ES cells express increased levels of the pluripotency-associated transcripts, <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Tbx3</italic>, a decrease in <italic>Nanog</italic>-GFP heterogeneity, and exhibit enhanced self-renewal in colony forming assays. Transgenic add-back of ERK2 is capable of restoring normal pluripotent gene expression and self-renewal capacity. We show that ERK2 contributes to the destabilization of ES cell self-renewal by reducing expression of pluripotency genes, such as <italic>Nanog</italic>, but is not specifically required for the early stages of germ layer specification.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are immortal, karyotypically stable, cell lines derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) or early epiblast of pre-implantation embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Brook1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Martin1">[3]</xref>. They maintain many of the characteristics of their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts even after prolonged periods of culture, not least of which is the ability to generate differentiated cell types of all three germ layers as well as contribute to the germ line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Robertson1">[4]</xref>. The efficient derivation and maintenance of ES cells is heavily dependent on genetic background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Ying1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Najm1">[6]</xref>, and supported by the combined activities of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Ying2">[7]</xref>. Both genetic studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Avilion1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Niwa1">[9]</xref> and whole transcriptome analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Loh1">[10]</xref> have provided a wealth of information as to the factors that maintain ES cells in an undifferentiated state, and the signaling networks that regulate their expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Niwa2">[11]</xref>. Our current understanding is that the combined activities of a core network consisting of the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2 and Nanog act to maintain ES cell identity by inhibiting the expression of lineage affiliated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Silva1">[12]</xref> and supporting a pluripotent epigenetic signature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Loh1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although much is now known about the molecular requirements for efficient ES cell self-renewal, the means by which cells exit this state and acquire the competence to respond to differentiation cues is less well understood. Genetic studies have shown that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling through GRB2-RAS is essential for peri-implantation mouse embryogenesis and the formation of the primitive endoderm lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Arman1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Feldman1">[16]</xref>. The ES cell, and presumably ICM/epiblast expression of <italic>Fgf4</italic> is driven by a ternary complex consisting of OCT4, SOX2 and the <italic>Fgf4</italic> distal enhancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Yuan1">[17]</xref>, and acts as a major auto-inductive cue for ES cell differentiation, but is largely dispensable for proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Kunath1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Wilder1">[19]</xref>. Moreover, it has been shown that the combined pharmacological inhibition of FGF-ERK and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) signaling pathways promotes long-term self-renewal of ES cells in the absence of both LIF and BMP4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Ying2">[7]</xref>. This dual inhibitor (2i) culture condition permitted the derivation of ES cell lines from previously refractory genetic backgrounds such as CBA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Ying1">[5]</xref>, and non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Nichols1">[20]</xref>, and importantly the establishment of authentic rat ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Buehr1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Li1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Because ERK2 is the predominant ERK enzyme expressed in ES cells, and because of its early embryonic phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-SabaElLeil1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Yao1">[24]</xref>, we sought to determine the effect of <italic>Erk2</italic> genetic ablation on FGF signaling, self-renewal and lineage specification. Here we present evidence that ERK2 is necessary for maximal FGF-ERK signaling and its deletion results in a modest, but consistent increase in self-renewal capacity and reduction in heterogeneity of <italic>Nanog</italic> expression in self-renewing culture conditions. In contrast to our previous work which indicated a requirement for ERK2 in both neural and mesodermal specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Kunath1">[18]</xref>, we found that our new <italic>Erk2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> ES cells did not exhibit any significant defects in germ layer specification when induced to differentiate. Either ERK1 or ERK2 could rescue the FGF signaling defects in <italic>Erk2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells suggesting these enzymes share some functional redundancy in mouse ES cells. We propose that total combined ERK activity impacts on ES cell self-renewal by reducing pluripotent gene expression and that ERK1 and ERK2 share overlapping functions during the earliest stages of ES cell differentiation.</p>

         <title>Targeting <italic>Erk2</italic> in Mouse ES Cells</title>
         <p>To disrupt <italic>Erk2</italic> function, germ-line competent 129/Ola ES cells (E14Ju) were depleted for exon 3 of the <italic>Erk2</italic> gene by two round of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This strategy removes the region coding for kinase sub-domains V and VI, essential for ERK2 function, and has been previously shown to create a protein-null <italic>Erk2</italic> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-SabaElLeil1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Fischer1">[25]</xref>. Heterozygous ES cell clones were first screened for reduction of exon 3 alleles by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and putative targeted lines were confirmed by Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Two heterozygous <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> ES cell clones (D2 and D7) were subjected to a second round of homologous recombination and clones were first screened for complete loss of exon 3 by qPCR, and further confirmed by Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). All clones were karyotyped following clonal expansion and retained normal ploidy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060907.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Two <italic>Erk2</italic>-null clones, D7N2 and D2N4, each derived from independent heterozygous clones, D7 and D2, respectively, were selected for further analysis.</p>

         <title>ERK2 Depletion Attenuates Short Term, but not Long Term FGF-ERK Signaling</title>
         <p>To test whether ERK signaling was perturbed in the absence of ERK2, lysates from WT and <italic>Erk2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> ES cells, as well as <italic>Erk2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells expressing FLAG-ERK2 from a randomly integrated transgene were examined for phosphorylation status of the ERK, MEK, and p90RSK enzymes. In steady-state self-renewing conditions ERK2 depletion resulted in a 3-fold increase in the ratio of phospho-ERK to total ERK, which was returned to a normal ratio in FLAG-ERK2 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>). However, the amount of total phospho-ERK, i.e. pERK1(+pERK2)/GAPDH, was decreased by approximately 50% in ERK2-deficient ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover the decrease in total phospho-ERK in <italic>Erk2</italic> knock-out cells translated into a similar decrease in phospho-p90RSK levels on the ERK-dependent sites T358 and S362 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Dalby1">[26]</xref>. Interestingly, depletion of ERK2 resulted in an increase in the levels of phospho-MEK1/2 (upstream ERK kinases) at S211 and S217 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that the observed increase in ERK1 phosphorylation in <italic>Erk2</italic>-null ES cells was due to decreased ERK-dependent negative feedback up-stream in the kinase cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Santos1">[27]</xref>. To examine FGF responsiveness in the absence of ERK2 we inhibited endogenous FGF signaling with a chemical inhibitor (PD173074) for 24 h followed by a wash-out and stimulation with recombinant FGF2 for 5–120 min. This acute stimulation with FGF2 exhibited similar time-to-peak (10–30 min) and decay kinetics in the presence or absence of ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). However, the ERK2-deficient ES cells exhibited a decrease in p90RSK phosphorylation indicating a reduction in the overall output of ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g002">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
         <p>As both ERK1/2 and p90RSK activities have been shown to be essential for the induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) <italic>cFos</italic>, <italic>Egr1</italic>, and <italic>Egr2</italic> in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-DeCesare1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Nakakuki1">[29]</xref>, we next asked if this global reduction in ERK activity was reflected in the transcriptional response to FGF stimulation. qRT-PCR analysis of IEGs <italic>Egr1</italic> and <italic>Egr2</italic> expression following acute stimulation with FGF2 showed an approximately 70% reduction in their induction at 1 hour post-stimulation in ERK2-deficient ES cells consistent with a reduction in FGF pathway activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The induction of another IEG, <italic>cFos</italic>, was only reduced by approximately 35% in <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, its induction was similar to FGF stimulation of WT cells in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901. This indicated that only a fraction of <italic>cFos</italic> induction was MEK-dependent, with the MEK-independent <italic>cFos</italic> expression possibly being due to FGF-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3′-OH kinase (PI3K)-AKT induction of <italic>cFos</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Choudhury1">[30]</xref>.</p>

As the duration of ERK activity can determine the expression of late response genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Murphy1">[33]</xref>, we asked if the expression of <italic>Dusp6</italic> was attenuated in the absence of ERK2 and if this correlated with a difference in late response gene expression such as D-type cyclins. Similar to <italic>Egr1, Egr2,</italic> and <italic>cFos</italic>, the magnitude of <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression was reduced in <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), however FGF2-induced, MEK-dependent, <italic>Ccnd2</italic> expression was not affected by loss of ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) indicating that the initial decrease in pathway activity can be compensated for in the long term, possibly by a decreased amount of induced negative feedback.

         <p>To test whether the attenuation of IEG induction in <italic>Erk2</italic>-null ES cells was isozyme specific, or a consequence of reduced total ERK activity, ERK2 depletion was rescued by transgenic expression of either 3xFLAG-ERK1 or 3xFLAG-ERK2.

         <title>ERK2 is Dispensable for Germ Layer Specification of ES Cells</title>
         <p>We have previously reported a block in both neural and mesodermal differentiation in ERK2-deficient ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Kunath1">[18]</xref>. However, this block was not reversed upon transgenic rescue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060907.s002">Figure S2A</xref>,B), even though exogenous ERK2 was phosphorylated normally and rescued the defect in <italic>Egr1</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060907.s002">Figure S2C</xref>,D). Moreover, ERK2-deficient cells were capable of generating both endodermal and mesodermal cell types in embryoid bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060907.s002">Figure S2E</xref>). Therefore it is likely that the differentiation defect exhibited by these ES cells is not related to the targeted mutation at the <italic>Erk2</italic> locus, and possibly related to genetic background, since they were derived from a C57Bl/6–129 F1 cross <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-SabaElLeil1">[23]</xref>, or to an unknown mutation during the derivation of these ES cell lines from blastocysts. We therefore examined the ability of new <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ES cells generated on a pure 129 background to commit to various differentiated lineages. Embryoid body (EB) differentiation was employed as it produces descendants of all three germ layers in 3-D culture, and is therefore an unbiased reflection of the potency of mES cells in culture.

         <title>ERK2 Suppresses Expression of a Subset of Pluripotent Genes</title>
         <p>To further investigate the elevated <italic>Nanog</italic> expression in ES cells lacking ERK2, two independent <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ES cell clones were rescued with ERK2 expression constructs. Transgenic expression of ERK2 was capable of reinstating normal levels of <italic>Nanog</italic> to <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). A second elevated pluripotent marker, <italic>Tbx3</italic>, was similarly increased in <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ES cells and rescued to wild-type levels by an ERK2 expression construct. A similar, but less dramatic effect was also observed for <italic>Klf4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). No significant difference was observed for <italic>Oct4</italic> levels across all cell lines tested. ERK2 deficiency had the most significant effect on <italic>Tbx3</italic> levels (a one-tailed t-test giving p-values of 0.02 and 0.01 for D7N2 and D2N4, respectively). This is consistent with previous reports that <italic>Tbx3</italic> is a negatively regulated direct target of ERK signaling in ES cells, and that TBX3 can positively regulate <italic>Nanog</italic> promoter activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Niwa2">[11]</xref>. It is of note that <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Tbx3</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic> are expressed heterogeneously in self-renewing ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Niwa2">[11]</xref> in contrast to the homogenous expression of <italic>Oct4</italic>, which did not exhibit significant differences in expression in the absence of ERK2. Therefore we hypothesized that ERK2 deficiency may reduce heterogeneity of self-renewing undifferentiated ES cells. To test this hypothesis, an EGFP cassette was knocked into the endogenous <italic>Nanog</italic> promoter in <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060907.s003">Figure S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Chambers1">[36]</xref>. Two correctly targeted clones, one each from D7N2 and D2N4 <italic>Erk2</italic>-null lines, were stably transfected with an ERK2 expression cassette and the extent of EGFP expression was assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). While the majority of <italic>Erk2</italic>-null ES cells exhibited high <italic>Nanog</italic>-GFP expression, a significant <italic>Nanog</italic>-GFP low subpopulation appeared when ERK2 was re-introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This is consistent with other reports which show that Nanog heterogeneity is reduced in the presence of chemical inhibitors of MEK-ERK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Chambers1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Singh1">[37]</xref>. To further examine this phenomenon for a different pluripotent gene, we generated a <italic>Tcfcp2l1</italic>-Venus reporter construct and stably transfected it into <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and ERK2-rescued <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060907.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Tcfcp2l1 is a grainyhead transcription factor that is highly expressed in mouse ES cells and rapidly down-regulated upon differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Ivanova1">[38]</xref>, and it is a direct binding partner of OCT4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-vandenBerg1">[39]</xref>. In self-renewing (+LIF) conditions 97% of <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ES cells were positive for the <italic>Tcfcp2l1</italic>-Venus reporter, but this was reduced to 86% when ERK2 was added back to the cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060907.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). The kinetics of <italic>Tcfcp2l1</italic>-Venus reporter expression during differentiation (removal of LIF) was examined for the <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and ERK2-rescued ES cells and both cell lines efficiently down-regulated this reporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060907.s004">Figure S4C</xref>).

         <title>ERK2 Suppresses Self-renewal Capacity of ES Cells</title>
         <p>To test if this reduced heterogeneity was functionally significant the self-renewal capacity of ERK2-deficient ES cells was tested in a stringent clonal density assay in the presence of LIF. Self-renewing cells were identified by alkaline phosphatase activity after 7 days at clonal density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Chambers2">[40]</xref>. Colonies were counted and scored based on the degree of differentiation observed. In WT and <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> ES cells, a distribution of 10% undifferentiated, 70% mixed, and 20% differentiated colonies was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). This was in contrast to <italic>Erk2</italic>-null ES cell lines were a undifferentiated colonies increased from 10% to 30% and differentiated colonies were reduced from 20% to 5%. These percentages returned to a WT distribution upon transgenic expression of ERK2, indicating that ERK2 depletion enhances self-renewal in the presence of LIF. However, in the absence of LIF all genotypes differentiated to a similar extent (data not shown). Taken together these data indicate that loss of ERK2 increases the self-renewal capacity via reducing heterogeneous expression of key pluripotency genes in the presence of LIF, but is dispensable for lineage commitment of mouse ES cells. Our data supports a model where the total ERK activity, and not isozyme-specific activity, is critical for the balance between self-renewal and lineage commitment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we have determined the consequences of <italic>Erk2</italic> deletion on FGF-ERK signal transduction, self-renewal capacity, and lineage specification in mouse ES cells. We have found that ES cells compensate for the loss of ERK2 by hyper-phosphorylation of the remaining ERK1 isozyme without an increase in <italic>Erk1</italic> transcription or translation. The mechanism may be through attenuation of induced negative feedback mechanisms, such as MAPK phosphatases, or direct feedback within the MAPK core module. We have found that immediate-early gene (IEG) induction is reduced in the absence of ERK2, as well as the negative regulator <italic>Dusp6</italic>. However, expression of a late response gene, <italic>Ccnd2</italic>, was unaffected by the loss of ERK2, underscoring the robustness of the ERK pathway to various perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Kholodenko1">[41]</xref>. Taken together this data suggests that ERK activity is stabilized, and maintained within a certain range, by both short (MAPK core cascade) and long (induced phosphatases) feedback loops and indicates that targeting these feedback loops may prove effective in modulating ERK activity in mES cells. To address the issue of redundancy we have shown that the early transcriptional defects in response to FGF activation observed in <italic>Erk2</italic>-null ES cells is entirely rescued by expression of either ERK1 or ERK2 implying that in ES cells it is total ERK activity, rather than isozyme specificity, that is most important for IEG induction.</p>
      <p>In contrast to blastocyst-derived <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ES cells of mixed genetic background, <italic>Erk2</italic> deletion by two rounds of homologous recombination in ES cells of a uniform genetic background (129/Ola) has no detectable effect on lineage specification into either neural, endodermal, or mesodermal lineages, and in fact ERK2-deficient ES cells appeared to differentiate towards the mesoderm lineage more efficiently that either WT or heterozygous lines, as judged by increased induction of <italic>Gata4</italic> and <italic>Acta2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060907-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
      <p>The lack of lineage commitment defects we observe is in agreement with recent embryological data indicating that ERK2 is not required for lineage specification in the embryo proper. Voisin and colleagues used tetraploid complementation, where the extra-embryonic tissues are wild-type, to produce grossly normal E13.5 <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Voisin1">[42]</xref>. As reported previously, the early phenotype of <italic>Erk2</italic>-null embryos was due to cell autonomous defects in the trophoblast lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-SabaElLeil1">[23]</xref>, and that the reported lack in mesoderm induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Yao1">[24]</xref>, is likely a secondary defect due to a lack of inductive signals from a defective extraembryonic ectoderm.</p>
      <p>Elevated expression of key pluripotency-associated genes, <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Tbx3</italic>, and <italic>Klf4</italic> was detected in <italic>Erk2</italic>-null ES cells when compared to WT or ERK2-rescued cells. The <italic>Nanog</italic>-GFP reporter and <italic>Tcfcp2l1</italic>-Venus reporter on the <italic>Erk2</italic>-null background suggests this increase in expression is probably due to reduced heterogeneity in ES cell cultures. Undifferentiated <italic>Nanog</italic>-GFP-low ES cells are more prone to differentiate than <italic>Nanog</italic>-GFP-high ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Chambers1">[36]</xref>, and increased self-renewal activity of <italic>Erk2</italic>-null ES cells in stringent clonal assays is consistent with their reduced heterogeneity. Recent work has shown that ERK activity in ES cells increases the heterogeneous expression of the primitive endoderm marker, <italic>Hex</italic>, and epiblast marker, <italic>Tcf15</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Canham1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Davies1">[44]</xref>. These results suggest that lowering the total active ERK pool in ES cells reduces fluctuation of lineage-priming genes and parts of the pluripotency transcriptional network, consistent with observations that chemical inhibition of the MEK-ERK pathway promotes self-renewal and inhibits lineage commitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Ying1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Burdon1">[45]</xref>. The increase in <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Tbx3</italic> expression observed in <italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ES cells may contribute to the enhanced performance in clonal assays, since over-expression of either gene strongly promotes the self-renewal capacity of ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Niwa2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Chambers2">[40]</xref>. In summary, this work reveals that mouse ES cells can cope with the removal of ERK2 partially by up-regulating the activity of ERK1. This apparent functional redundancy between the ERK enzymes has been clearly shown in embryonic fibroblasts, where <italic>Erk1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>;<italic>Erk2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells rapidly undergo senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Voisin1">[42]</xref>. The complete genetic removal of both <italic>Erk1</italic> and <italic>Erk2</italic> from ES cells will be necessary to determine if naïve mouse pluripotent stem cells require ERK enzymes for cell survival, self-renewal, and to efficiently exit self-renewal to generate committed lineages.</p>

         <p>All ES cell lines were maintained in complete ES cell medium: GMEM (Sigma, G5154) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (BDH, 441413), 1xMEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen, 1140-036), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (both from Invitrogen), and 1000 units/ml LIF (made in-house) on gelatinised tissue culture flasks (Iwaki). The FGFR and Mek1 inhibitors, PD173074 and PD0325901, were used at 200 nM and 1 µM, respectively, and were both from Axon Medchem. All <italic>Erk2</italic> gene targeting was performed in E14Ju ES cells, which is a subclone of E14Tg2a ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Hooper1">[50]</xref>. E14Ju ES cells (10<sup>6</sup>) were electroporated with linearized DNA (100 µg) using a BioRad GenePulser (0.8 kV and 10 µF). Stable transfectants were selected for with the appropriate antibiotic: Hygromycin (100 µg/ml); G418 (150 µg/ml); Puromycin (1 µg/ml). ES cell colonies were picked to 96-well plates, replica plated, and initial screening for targeting was by qPCR of genomic DNA for exon 3 of <italic>Erk2</italic>.

         <title>Southern Blotting</title>
         <p>Southern blotting was performed by resolving 5 µg gDNA, digested with KpnI alone or KpnI-PstI, by agarose gel electrophoresis. gDNA was stained with ethidium bromide and nicked using a UV trans-illuminator, followed by denaturation in 500 mM NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl for 1 hour. The reaction was stopped by incubating the gel in 500 mM Tris, 1.5 mM NaCl, (pH 5.5) and gDNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham) overnight by capillary action in the presence of 20X SSC. The DNA was then cross-linked to the membrane using a UV oven (Stratalink) and baked for 1 h at 120°C. The hybridization probe was labelled using the MegaPrime™ DNA Labeling System (Amersham) according to manufacturer’s instructions, using [α<sup>−32</sup>P] dCTP, 3000 Ci/mmol and incubated overnight at 68°C. Following extensive washes the membrane was exposed to X-ray film (Kodak) overnight at −80°C and subsequently developed in an automated autoradiographic film processor.</p>

         <title>ES Cell Stimulation, Differentiation and Clonal Assays</title>
         <p>For acute FGF2 simulation, ES cells were plated at 2×10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in complete ES cell medium. The following day inhibitors were added (PD173074, 100 nM or PD0325901, 1 µM, both from Axon Medchem) and cultured for a further 24 hours. Inhibitors were washed out with PBS (2×2 ml) and cells were stimulated with complete ES cell medium supplemented with recombinant hFGF2 (10 ng/ml, NCI Frederick BRB Repository) for 5 min to 3 hours. Serum-free neural induction was performed as described by Ying et al. with N2B27 medium made in-house <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060907-Ying3">[35]</xref>. Embryoid body differentiation was performed in hanging drops of ES cell medium in the absence of LIF. Cells were diluted to a concentration of 3.2×10<sup>3</sup> cells/ml and aliquoted in 30 µl drops. After 2 days the aggregates were transferred to low adhesion bacterial grade culture dishes and cultured for the indicated times. Self-renewal capability was determined in a colony-forming assay by plating at low density (0.2×10<sup>3</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) in the presence or absence of LIF. Colonies were allowed to form over 7 days whereupon they were fixed, stained for alkaline phosphatase activity using the Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase Assay Kit (Sigma), and classified as either (i) undifferentiated, (ii) mixed, or (iii) differentiated.</p>
