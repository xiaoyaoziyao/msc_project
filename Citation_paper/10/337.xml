<abstract>
<p>Differentiated somatic cells can be reprogrammed into the pluripotent state by cell-cell fusion. In the pluripotent state, reprogrammed cells may then self-renew and differentiate into all three germ layers. Fusion-induced reprogramming also epigenetically modifies the somatic cell genome through DNA demethylation, X chromosome reactivation, and histone modification. In this study, we investigated whether fusion with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) also reprograms genomic imprinting patterns in somatic cells. In particular, we examined imprinting changes in parthenogenetic neural stem cells fused with biparental ESCs, as well as in biparental neural stem cells fused with parthenogenetic ESCs. The resulting hybrid cells expressed the pluripotency markers <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic>. In addition, methylation of several imprinted genes except <italic>Peg3</italic> was comparable between hybrid cells and ESCs. This finding indicates that reprogramming by cell fusion does not necessarily reverse the status of all imprinted genes to the state of pluripotent fusion partner.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into all three germ layers <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and have unlimited capacity to self-renew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref003">3</xref>]. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which are derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst, are the gold standard of pluripotency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref005">5</xref>]. Pluripotency is lost upon differentiation, but differentiated somatic cells can be reprogrammed back to the pluripotent state by nuclear transfer, cell fusion, and transduction of defined reprogramming factors. Indeed, somatic cells reprogrammed through nuclear transfer can be subsequently induced to form totipotent embryos, from which pluripotent ESCs may be derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref006">6</xref>]. On the other hand, ESCs, embryonic germ cells, and embryonic carcinoma cells are typically used to reprogram somatic cells by cell-cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref009">9</xref>]. Finally, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from somatic cells by exogenous expression of defined transcription factors, including Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref010">10</xref>]. These cells express pluripotency-related genes, differentiate into all three germ layers <italic>in vitro</italic>, generate germ-line chimeras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref011">11</xref>], and, remarkably, confer pluripotency to somatic cells by cell-cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Genomic imprinting patterns in pluripotent stem cells are distinct from those in somatic cells. Imprinted genes are expressed from a single allele according to the parent of origin, and regulate fetal and/or placental development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref015">15</xref>]. Genomic imprinting is erased during migration of primordial germ cells, but reestablished during gametogenesis. In primordial germ cells, genomic imprinting and DNA methylation patterns form a gradient along the phases of migration. Notably, embryonic germ cells derived from these primordial germ cells retain the imprinting pattern present at the time the germ cells are obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref008">8</xref>]. Remarkably, however, reprogramming by transduction of defined factors modifies genomic imprinting, DNA methylation, and expression of imprinted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref016">16</xref>]. For instance, maternally imprinted genes, which were completely methylated in parthenogenetic somatic cells, were demethylated after reprogramming into pluripotent state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated whether pluripotent ESCs reprogram genomic imprinting in somatic cells by fusing biparental ESCs with parthenogenetic somatic cells, and vice versa. We hypothesized that imprinting patterns of pluripotent fusion partners, ESCs or parthenogenetic ESCs (pESCs), dictate the imprinting patterns in the resulting hybrid cells.</p>

<title>Animal use ethical statement</title>
<p>Experiments were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines and all experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Konkuk University. All mouse strains were bred and housed at the mouse facility of the Konkuk University or were bought from Orient-Bio Inc. (Gyeonggi-do, Korea; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.orient.co.kr/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.orient.co.kr</ext-link>). Animal welfare was under control of local committees. Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room with automated darkness-light cycle system, fed with a regular ad libitum feeding. Before oocyte harvesting, mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation.</p>

<title>Generation of parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells</title>
<p>B6D2F1 mice were induced to superovulate by serial injections of 10 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin and 12 IU human chorionic gonadotropin 48 h later. The cumulus-oocyte complex was collected from the oviduct 14 h thereafter, and cumulus cells were removed by 0.1% hyaluronidase prepared in 15% fetal bovine serum in mouse embryonic fibroblast medium and then in CZB medium for 1 h to stabilize the embryo. Oocytes were then cultured for 6 h in CZB medium supplemented with 10 mmol/L SrCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 μg/mL cytochalasin B to induce parthenogenetic activation. Subsequently, activated oocytes were cultured for 2 days at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in G1 medium, and later in G2 medium. Embryonic stem cells were then harvested from developing blastocysts attached to mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. These cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 1× nonessential amino acids, 1× penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, 1× β-mercaptoethanol, and 1000 U leukemia inhibitory factor.</p>

<title>Generation of biparental and parthenogenetic neural stem cells (NSCs)</title>
<p>Biparental and parthenogenetic neural stem cells were derived from OG2 mice, which express an Oct4-GFP transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref019">19</xref>], according to methods described in our previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref018">18</xref>]. Briefly, brain tissue was collected from a 13.5 dpc (OG2<sup>+/−</sup>) embryo obtained by natural fertilization (and thus biparental), as well as from a 10.5-dpc parthenogenetic embryo (OG2<sup>+/−</sup>). Primary neurospheres were replated on gelatin-coated dishes in expansion media consisting of NSC media (Euroclone, Siziano, Italy, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.euroclonegroup.it/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.euroclonegroup.it</ext-link>) enriched with N2 supplement, 10 ng/mL each of epidermal and basic fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.invitrogen.com</ext-link>), 50 μg/mL bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gibcobrl.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.gibcobrl.com</ext-link>), 1× penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, and 1× nonessential amino acids (Gibco BRL).</p>

<p>Parthenogenetic and biparental ESCs were mixed 1:1 with biparental and pNSCs, respectively, and washed in PBS. The mixture was then centrifuged at 130 ×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min in 50 mL conical tubes. The supernatant was discarded, and 1 mL pre-warmed 50% polyethylene glycol 1500 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roche-applied-science.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.roche-applied-science.com</ext-link>) was added dropwise to the cell pellet. DMEM was then added up to 25 mL over 5 min with constant stirring. Finally, cells were centrifuged at 130 ×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min, washed gently with DMEM, and seeded on a gelatin-coated dish in ES culture medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Hybrid cells were dissociated, washed with PBS, filtered through 40 μm nylon mesh, and resuspended in standard ES cell medium. Cells with highly intense GFP fluorescence were sorted directly into ES cell medium using a FACSAria cell sorter with FACSDiva software (Becton, Dickinson and Company).</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Karyotyping</title>
<p>Cells cultured in a 10-cm dish were treated with 3 μg/mL Nocodazole for 4 h, and digested with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA. Cells were recovered from the supernatant, treated for 15 min with a hypotonic solution (0.56% w/v KCl), and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were then fixed and washed three times with fresh 3:1 methanol: acetic acid, and finally dropped onto clean glass slides. The slides were air-dried, stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sigmaaldrich.com</ext-link>), and examined under a fluorescence microscope.</p>

<title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>Cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and blocked for 45 min at room temperature with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.03% Triton X-100. Cells were then probed with primary antibodies against Oct4 (Oct4; monoclonal, 1:100, Abcam sc-9081), Nanog (Nanog; monoclonal, 1:200, Abcam ab80892), tubulin beta III (Tuj1; monoclonal, 1:1000, Millipore MAB1637), SMA (SMA; monoclonal, 1:200, Abcam ab7817), and Sox17 (Sox17; polyclonal, 1:200, R&amp;D systems AF1924).

<title>Teratoma formation analysis</title>
<p>ES-pNSC and pES-NSC hybrid cells were harvested by dissociation solution treatment and washed twice with PBS. Prepared cells (about 10<sup>6</sup>) were injected into testis capsule of a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse. After six weeks of injection, mice were sacrificed and teratomas were harvested and subjected to histophathological analysis. Dissected teratomas were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, processed through graded ethanol, and embedded in paraffin, followed by hematoxylin/eosin (Endoderm), PAS (Ectoderm), Alcian blue (Mesoderm) staining.</p>

<title>RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR</title>
<p>RNA was isolated with RNase MiniKit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was then synthesized from 1 mg total RNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). For real-time PCR, standard curves were created for each target gene using known quantities of total cDNA from other cells. Target genes were amplified over 40 cycles at 95°C, 60°C, and 72°C for 30 s each, using real-time PCR primer sequences for H19 (sense, 5′-CGATTGCACTGGTTTGGA-3′ and antisense, 5′-CTCAGACGGAGATGGACGA-3′), Igf2 (sense, 5′-GGATCCCAGAACCCAAGAAGA-3′ and antisense, 5′-GGGCGGCTATTGTTGTTCTCA-3′), Peg1 (sense, 5′-CCGCGGTCCACAGTGTCGATTC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GGGGGAGGTAATACAGGGAGGCTA-3′), Peg3 (sense, 5′-TACGAATGCAAAGATTGCGGCCAG-3′ and antisense, 5′-TGGGCAGTGGCAGCTACTATTTCT-3′), and ACTB (sense, 5′-CGCCATGGATGACGATATCG-3′ and antisense, 5′ -CGAAGCCGGCTTTGCACATG-3′). ACTB was used as reference. We corrected for differences in PCR efficiency between target and reference loci using the efficiency correction in the Relative Quantification Software (Roche LC 480).</p>

<title>Derivation of biparental and pESCs</title>
<p>To determine whether pESCs also can reprogram somatic cells by cell-cell fusion, pESCs were newly derived and fused with NSCs. pESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) were obtained from BFD1 mice by culturing oocytes for 6 h in CZB medium containing SrCl<sub>2</sub> and cytochalasin B. Approximately 62% (44/71) of parthenogenetic embryos progressed to blastocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). pESCs derived from these parthenogenetic blastocysts were morphologically similar to biparental ESCs, and expressed alkaline phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and pluripotency markers such as Oct4 and Nanog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). These results indicate that ESCs derived from parthenogenetic blastocysts are similar to biparental ESCs.</p>

<title>pESCs reprogram somatic cells, and parthenogenetic NSCs are reprogrammable by cell-cell fusion</title>
<p>Newly derived pESCs were fused with biparental NSCs using polyethylene glycol to test whether the former can reprogram the latter by cell-cell fusion. Conversely, parthenogenetic NSCs (pNSCs) were fused with biparental ESCs to test whether the parthenogenetic somatic cells are reprogrammable. The NSCs were established from fertilized and parthenogenetic OG2<sup>+/-</sup> mouse embryos that express Oct4-GFP.</p>
<p>GFP-positive (GFP<sup>+</sup>) cells were detected at day 3 after pESCs were fused with biparental NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), and were established as a hybrid cell line (pES-NSC). Another hybrid cell line (ES-pNSC) was established in a similar manner using pNSCs and biparental ESCs. The hybrid cell lines were morphologically very similar to ESCs. Hybrid cells were then expanded by colony picking, re-plating in feeder-layered dishes, and sorted by FACS to obtain a pure population of reprogrammed GFP<sup>+</sup> hybrid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156491.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Karyotyping showed that these cells are nearly tetraploid, confirming that they are cell fusion hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Parthenogenetic fusion partner cells, pESCs and pNSCs, maintained normal diploid karyotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156491.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).

<title>Characterization of hybrid cells</title>
<p>Hybrid cells were tested for pluripotency. Both ES-pNSC and pES-NSC hybrid cells expressed alkaline phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In addition, ESCs, pESCs, and hybrid cells expressed pluripotency markers, such as <italic>Oct4</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Nanog</italic>, as measured by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

<title>DNA methylation patterns in imprinted genes after cell-cell fusion</title>
<p>Bisulfite genome sequencing was used to investigate possible changes in genomic imprinting patterns in hybrid cells that had been passaged more than 10 times. In particular, the paternally imprinted genes <italic>H19</italic> and <italic>insulin-like growth factor 2</italic> (<italic>Igf2</italic>) were analyzed, as were the maternally imprinted genes <italic>Peg1</italic> and <italic>Peg3</italic>. <italic>H19</italic> and <italic>Igf2</italic> are physically clustered in the genome, and share the same enhancers and control elements. However, <italic>H19</italic> is expressed only from the maternal allele (paternally imprinted and maternally expressed), while <italic>Igf2</italic> is expressed only from the paternal allele (paternally imprinted and paternally expressed) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref020">20</xref>]. In accordance with our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref016">16</xref>], these genes were completely demethylated in pNSCs lacking a paternal allele, while <italic>Peg1</italic> and <italic>Peg3</italic> were completely methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>H19</italic> and <italic>Igf2</italic> were partially methylated in pESCs, as in biparental ESCs, but <italic>Peg3</italic> was completely demethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). These results indicate that parthenogenetic imprinting patterns could be altered by fusion with pESCs. Next, we tried to perform the SNP-based methylation analysis, but it cannot be possible because there was no SNP in these genes between fusion partner cells (between ESCs and pNSCs, and pESCs and NSCs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156491.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>We then investigated whether DNA methylation patterns in somatic cells are altered after fusion with pluripotent stem cells. Notably, methylation patterns of <italic>H19</italic> and <italic>Igf2</italic> in ES-pNSC hybrid cells differ from those in pNSCs, but are comparable to those in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Similarly, pES-NSC hybrid cells showed similar DNA methylation patterns as pESCs. These results indicate that methylation marks on paternally imprinted genes were altered in hybrid cells to resemble those in pluripotent stem cells. In contrast, changes in methylation on the maternally imprinted genes <italic>Peg1</italic> and <italic>Peg3</italic> were not as clear as <italic>H19</italic> or <italic>Igf2</italic>. For instance, DNA methylation patterns on <italic>Peg1</italic> and <italic>Peg3</italic> in ES-pNSC hybrids were similar to those of ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), but, in pES-NSC hybrids, methylation patterns were similar to those pESCs and NSCs, respectively. Based on these observations, it is possible that (1) imprinting patterns from pESCs and NSCs coexisted independently in pES-NSC hybrids, or (2) imprinting patterns in pESCs were modified to resemble those of biparental NSCs. In any case, these data suggest that pluripotent fusion partners do not necessarily determine the status of imprinted genes in the resulting hybrids.</p>
<p>Because DNA methylation generally silences genes and demethylation arrows activation of genes, we measured the expression of the representative imprinted genes, <italic>H19</italic>, <italic>Igf2</italic>, <italic>Peg1</italic> and <italic>Peg3</italic>, by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g005">Fig 5</xref>). <italic>H19</italic> and <italic>Igf2</italic> was not expressed in biparental NSCs, but was expressed at low levels in pNSCs, presumably because the gene is demethylated in both alleles (two maternal genome). In addition, <italic>H19</italic> was expressed in pESCs at about twice the level as that in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g005">Fig 5</xref>), presumably as a result of reduced methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Similarly, <italic>H19</italic> was twice more abundant in pES-NSC hybrids than in ES-pNSC hybrids, reflecting the pattern observed in the ESC fusion partners and the DNA methylation patterns showed in hybrids. Also, <italic>Igf2</italic> is more expressed in ESC and pESC than NSC and pNSC. Both fusion hybrid RNA expression level were similar to pluripotent cells. On the other hand, pESCs and pNSCs, in which <italic>Peg1</italic> and <italic>Peg3</italic> are completely methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), expressed <italic>Peg3</italic> at negligible levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156491.g005">Fig 5</xref>). <italic>Peg3</italic> was also expressed negligibly in biparental NSCs, even though the gene is the normal pattern of imprinted genes (differentially methylated pattern) in these cells. Moreover, ESCs and ES-pNSC hybrids expressed <italic>Peg3</italic> at similar levels, while pES-NSC hybrids expressed <italic>Peg3</italic> much more abundantly than both pESCs and NSCs. These results indicate that regulation of <italic>Peg3</italic> expression does not depend solely on methylation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fusion-induced reprograming is a powerful technique that induces pluripotency in differentiated cells within 2 days, in contrast to induced pluripotency, which requires more than 7 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref023">23</xref>]. In this light, we evaluated the ability of pluripotent stem cells to reprogram and reconfigure genomic imprinting in somatic cells through cell fusion. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that the epigenetic status of somatic cells is altered to resemble that of pluripotent fusion partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0156491.ref018">18</xref>]. Accordingly, we speculated that genomic imprinting, also a type of epigenetic regulation, would be similarly modified.</p>
<p>To characterize changes in genomic imprinting, we fused parthenogenetic somatic and pluripotent cells with biparental pluripotent and somatic cells, respectively. We found that pESCs successfully reprogram somatic cells, and that pNSCs are reprogrammable into pluripotent cells by cell-cell fusion. In most cases, methylation patterns of imprinted genes in hybrid cells resembled those in pluripotent fusion partners. However, we could not conclude that pluripotent cells universally determine imprinting patterns in fused cells, as we cannot exclude the possibility that unaltered somatic alleles may persist along with pluripotent alleles in the tetraploid hybrid cells. Indeed, we found clear evidence that <italic>Peg3</italic>, a maternally imprinted and paternally expressed gene, is methylated differently in pES-NSC hybrid cells than in pESCs. However, pES-NSC hybrid cells expressed <italic>Peg3</italic> abundantly, in contrast to the initial two fusion partners. Remarkably, <italic>Peg3</italic> is also expressed abundantly in biparental ESCs, suggesting that the gene was somehow reprogrammed in pES-NSC hybrid cells to resemble its epigenetic status in biparental ESCs. Taken together, these results indicate that reprogramming does not necessarily return imprinting patterns in somatic cells to the pluripotent state. Thus, reprogramming using parthenogenetic cells may be a useful tool to investigate genomic imprinting mechanisms, as well as expression of imprinted genes.</p>
