<abstract>
<p>A reliable extraction of filament data from microscopic images is of high interest in the analysis of acto-myosin structures as early morphological markers in mechanically guided differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells and the understanding of the underlying fiber arrangement processes. In this paper, we propose the filament sensor (FS), a fast and robust processing sequence which detects and records location, orientation, length, and width for each single filament of an image, and thus allows for the above described analysis. The extraction of these features has previously not been possible with existing methods. We evaluate the performance of the proposed FS in terms of accuracy and speed in comparison to three existing methods with respect to their limited output. Further, we provide a benchmark dataset of real cell images along with filaments manually marked by a human expert as well as simulated benchmark images. The FS clearly outperforms existing methods in terms of computational runtime and filament extraction accuracy. The implementation of the FS and the benchmark database are available as open source.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the last decade it has become evident that for cellular behavior the mechanical environment can be as important as traditionally investigated biochemical cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref002">2</xref>]. Especially striking is the mechanically induced differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured on elastic substrates of different elasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref003">3</xref>]. During the early stage of this mechano-guided differentiation process in hMSCs, the structure and polarization of actin-myosin stress fibers depend critically on the Young’s elastic modulus of the substrate and can be used as early morphological markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref004">4</xref>]. An analogous study showed that also for myoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Stress fibers are contractile structures mainly composed of actin filaments, myosin motor mini filaments (non-muscle myosin II’s) and distinct types of cross-linkers e.g. <italic>α</italic>-actinin, fascin, etc.. These ‘cellular muscles’ are connected to the extra-cellular matrix via focal adhesions and generate and transmit forces to the outside world by pulling on the ECM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref006">6</xref>]. Acto-myosin filaments are therefore considered key players in the mechano-sensing machinery of the cell that integrates physical cues from the surrounding to bio-chemical signaling and finally differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>To further elucidate and potentially model the complex mechanical interplay between matrix and the cell a full description and understanding of the structure and dynamics of acto-myosin stress fibers is essential. Using fluorescence microscopy, filament arrangements can be visualized where stress fibers can be considered as linear filaments of varying width and length. Typical images of acto-myosin stress fibers of different quality are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g001">Fig 1</xref>. This poses certain challenges for a reliable extraction of all filaments’ location, length, width and orientation (e.g. relative to the cell’s major axis). In particular, studies of the dynamics of stress fibers where multiple time series of living cells are recorded in parallel over periods of 24 hours, demand a fast and reliable fiber detection algorithm. Such experiments are essential towards a more detailed understanding of the role of acto-myosin cytoskeleton structure formation during the mechanically induced differentiation of hMSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref004">4</xref>].</p>

</fig>
<p>While our motivation is based on the cytoskeleton structure of hMSCs, there is also demand to trace and track stress fibers over space and time in other research areas. For example, studies on migrating cells indicate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref013">13</xref>] various stress fiber types (dorsal, ventral, arc) appearing at different locations inside a migrating cell. Their exact cellular function yet remains unknown but could be clarified by live cell imaging. Following the filament dynamics over time gives further insight into the formation and function of stress fibers. Recently, Soine et al. described a novel method to analyze traction force microscopy data, so called model-based traction force microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref014">14</xref>]. Here, it is imperative to detect and mark the stress fibers of a cell to gain more insight into cellular force generation and transmission to the substrate. Such live cell experiments are ideally performed for many cells in parallel to achieve sufficiently significant statistics, therefore the fiber analysis algorithm ideally performs tracing and tracking in (nearly) real-time.</p>
<p>With the Filament Sensor we provide such an image processing tool that yields the stress fiber structure from observations of live as well as fixed cells in terms of images with widely varying brightness, contrast, sharpness and homogeneity of fluorescence, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g001">Fig 1</xref>. In our live cell imaging setup, typically 30 cells are followed over a period of 24 hours with an image taken every 10 minutes. Thus, the aim of real time processing allows for about 20 seconds of processing time per image.</p>
<p>Of course, such a tool can be employed to extract filament features for any (sets of) images containing fiber structures. Applications are conceivable in a wide range of cases especially in the context of actin fiber structures, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref015">15</xref>], but also more generally in biology, medical imaging and material science.</p>

<p>The FS is specifically designed to meet these challenges. Dealing with image inhomogeneity calls for the application of local image processing tools. Blurring effects will be mitigated by line enhancement through direction sensitive methods. Crossings of lines of varying intensities can be rather successfully detected by what we call <italic>line Gaussians</italic> which are specific oriented thin masks, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g003">Fig 3</xref>. After local binarization, finally an adaption of the semilocal line sensor approach to fingerprint analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref016">16</xref>] is applied to extract all filament features. As the FS is modularized, employs local and orientation dependent image analysis methods and outputs the entire filament data, expert knowledge such as detecting fewer filaments in specific low variance areas, say, can be easily incorporated.</p>

<p>To assess our method we have devised two benchmark datasets. One set comprises filaments in hMSCs of varying image quality, manually labeled by an expert. The second database consists of simulated fiber structures providing a test scenario with complete knowledge of spatial information.</p>
<p>In order to compare our new method to existing methods (discussed in Section “Results”) we have to restrict our comprehensive output to the limited output of others. Specifically for eLoG (elongated Laplacian of Gaussian) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref004">4</xref>] as well as for the Hough transformation such limited output is given by angular histograms: accumulated pixel length of filaments per angular orientation. For the constrained inverse diffusion (CID) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref017">17</xref>] we can only compare sets of pixels which is also possible for the eLoG method.</p>

<title>Related Work</title>
<p>Despite the existence of a tremendous body of techniques for image processing and especially line detection (for an overview e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref018">18</xref>], Chapter 4), currently the methods used for filament identification in cell images are often ad hoc, require partial manual processing and a fair amount of runtime, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref019">19</xref>]. The latter two requirements are particularly undesirable if large numbers of images are to be evaluated, as is typically the case.</p>
<p>Fundamental global methods in this context include the Hough transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref020">20</xref>] and brightness thresholding via the Otsu method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref021">21</xref>]. However, variable brightness of cell plasma and filaments demand that such methods must at least be supplemented by local methods like the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref023">23</xref>]), anisotropic diffusion (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref025">25</xref>]), or a beamlet approach, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Many algorithms exist that focus on the analysis of networks of strongly curved microtubuli (as opposed to the properties of single filaments), such as line thinning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref027">27</xref>], active contours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref028">28</xref>] and the recently proposed constrained inverse diffusion (CID) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Other methods which are geared toward extraction not only of filament pixel position but also of local orientation include the FiberScore algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref029">29</xref>], elongated Laplacians of Gaussians (eLoGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref004">4</xref>] and gradient based methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>The eLoG method, like the gradient method aims at detecting not only filament pixels but also their orientations. While filament length and width are not extracted, counting the number of pixels per orientation, these methods yield histograms of cumulated filament length per orientation angle which are then further analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Line thinning and CID identify only a skeletal filament network structure without filament orientation, length, nor width. Rather, these methods are geared towards detection of thin microfilaments and not of wide stress fibers we are interested in.</p>
<p>The CID method uses a maximum cross correlation coefficient method for templates with different orientations as a preprocessing step. While this yields considerable line enhancement in many cases, in some cases it leads to situations where bright lines sever fainter lines they cross, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Certainly, this is undesirable in view of the aforementioned challenge IIa. One could try to account for this by adding cross masks to the list of filters. This, however, increases the number of filters and thereby calculation time considerably; additionally bright lines acquire a halo.</p>
<p>The FiberScore program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref029">29</xref>] produces local orientation and centerline images and provides global information on accumulated line length and average width. It produces no line objects as output. It turned out that the methods applied in FiberScore did not yield optimal results for our cell images. The most important obstacle, however, for using FiberScore is that neither the program’s nor its framework’s source codes are freely available. Although the original developer has very helpfully supported us to make the program run we could not tailor FiberScore to our needs.</p>
<p>An overview over the different types of output of some methods is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0126346.t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The cells used in this work are human mesenchymal stem cells derived from human bone marrow, acquired from the commercial vendor Lonza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref031">31</xref>] under the product number PT-2501. The vendor anonymizes personal data of cell donors.</p>
<p>Our proposed method decomposes into two parts. First, a set of specifically tailored image enhancement and binarization procedures are applied, followed, secondly, by a width aware segment sensor, which extracts filament data from the binary image. For this core part of the FS its involved workflow is sketched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Suitable default values detailed below have been determined by expert knowledge on hMSCs images from a database separate from the two databases we have tested on in Section “Results”.</p>

<title>Parameter Choice and Typical Workflow</title>
<p>The empirically determined default values proposed by the FS yield good results for most images. Otherwise, starting from the default values a local optimum in the parameter space can usually be determined very quickly. Tracing results are fairly weakly dependent on parameter variation in the optimal parameter region and image properties do not vary strongly over individual 24–48 hours time series of images with overall acceptable quality. Therefore, to commonly adjust parameters for a whole batch of images, it is usually sufficient to consider one of the first and one of the last images only. In this sense, the FS is “semi-automated”.</p>

<title>Preprocessing and Binarization</title>
<p>Apart from an adjustable contrast enhancement and a normalization of the image to 256 gray levels, only local methods are employed. The first two preprocessing steps use generic Gaussian and Laplacian filters with adjustable variance and magnitude (with empirically successful default values), respectively, the order of which can be interchanged.</p>
<p><bold>The linear Gaussian</bold>. In the third preprocessing step we accumulate intensities along rod kernels which have been used for cross correlations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref029">29</xref>]. This filter is orientation sensitive and thus very well suited for line enhancement. It is comparable to the eLoG approach but performs much better in terms of calculation time because the filter uses a Gaussian mask which is then restricted to lines of different orientations only and convolved with the image, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g005">Fig 5</xref>. In our implementation we choose the filter size to be <italic>l</italic> = 2·⌈3<italic>σ</italic>⌉ + 1 pixels (here “⌈·⌉” denotes rounding to the next integer and <italic>σ</italic> is 3 pixels by default) and we use 2<italic>l</italic> − 2 lines; one line per pair of opposite boundary pixels of the mask. Because the filter operation is only performed on pixels on a line, it is by a factor of approximately <italic>l</italic> faster than the eLoG approach which uses square filter masks. The highest response is taken as the new grey value of the pixel. In fact, this filter proves to be very successful at enhancing darker lines crossing bright lines, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g003">Fig 3</xref>.</p>

<p><bold>Local binarization</bold> is achieved via a combination of Gaussian weighted adaptive means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref032">32</xref>] and global thresholding, where the global threshold is not compared to single pixels but to neighborhood means. The global threshold is usually set to only about 10% of the maximum brightness and serves mainly to reduce calculation time by removing obvious background from consideration.</p>
<p><bold>Homogeneous noise cancellation</bold> is achieved by one of two filters. The default filter calculates mean brightness along rods as used in the linear Gaussian filter around the white pixels of the binary image and then thresholds the ratio of standard deviation to a function <italic>f</italic> of the mean <italic>μ</italic> of these mean brightnesses. The simpler alternative filter thresholds the ratio of Gaussian weighted standard deviation and the same function <italic>f</italic> of the mean <italic>μ</italic> of pixel brightnesses in neighborhood of white pixels.

<title>A Width Aware Segment Sensor</title>
<p>After preprocessing and binarization, filament data is now extracted from the white pixels using the following algorithm, illustrated by a flow chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Denote the binary image by <italic>B</italic> and its pixel value at position (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>) by <italic>B</italic>(<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>) and denote the subset of white pixels by <italic>B</italic><sup>+</sup>

<p>As lines are blurred due to scattering and as the preprocessing usually enhances line width, the FS tends to find greater line width than a human expert. Taking into account this expert knowledge, the FS returns a filament width reduced by one for filaments with width larger than 1. Such and other adjustments are feasible for the FS because it extracts filaments individually.</p>

<title>Benchmark Datasets</title>
<p>To obtain benchmark images of different quality, images of cells that were bleached by long exposure to light, less bleached cells from time series with moderate exposure to light and completely unbleached fixed cells have been chosen.

<p>The FQS thus determines image quality in terms of three features.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Sharpness and contrast of lines are determined using the means of Gaussians along rods and comparing the highest response to a Gaussian weighted neighborhood mean. The relative number of cell pixels where this ratio exceeds a threshold contribute to the score. This criterion is inspired by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The size of the cell in the image contributes positively to the score as a small cell area leads to a high boundary to bulk ratio and a small number of lines, both of which are error sources.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Marked bright spots due to overexposure contribute negatively to the score. As we are looking for bright structures, high brightness is more problematic than low brightness, because it acts as a smearing effect on lines. Therefore, we do not penalize low brightness regions likewise.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>For simulations of another 10 images we take a simple straightforward approach. The filament process is viewed as a random marked Poisson point process (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref034">34</xref>]) where the marks indicate length and orientation of filaments centered at the respective points. Only filaments with their center point contained in an independently generated ellipse are recorded (unbiased sampling) and the cytoplasm background is mimicked by strongly blurring a subset of the filament pixels. We let angular orientation follow an independent mixture of one or two wrapped Gaussians—giving an angular distribution with a realistic mode pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref035">35</xref>]. Grey levels of cell background and of filaments are independently perturbed; the resulting image is blurred by a Gaussian filter, and finally, independent Gaussian white noise is added.</p>
<p>Like the FS, also eLoG and CID allow for visual display of filament pixels. Along with the ground truth we provide such images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g009">Fig 9</xref> for a real cell image as well as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g010">Fig 10</xref> for a simulated cell image.</p>

<title>Qualitative Comparison</title>
<p>To illustrate the limits of the methods compared qualitatively, in view of the challenges outlined as IIa) to IIc) from Section “The Filament Sensor and the Benchmark Dataset”, we picked three suitable examples from the benchmark dataset and the specifically simulated image, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g011">Fig 11</xref>. In this context, “segmentation” means the detection of lines or line pixels. Therefore we refer to the detection of excess lines or line pixels as oversegmentation.</p>

<p>It also contains several crossings of lines of different brightness at small angles. The image is used as a test case to qualitatively highlight the performance of the three methods compared here in terms of filament pixel detection and especially structure detection. As the FS is the only method that extracts line data, the notion of parallel or intersecting lines only makes sense for this method.</p>

<p><bold>Comparison for inhomogeneous brightness and crossing of lines</bold> is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g012">Fig 12</xref> which shows a detail from cell image M3. The upper right image regions display crossings of filaments which are almost completely captured by the FS and slightly less by CID, that tends to produce a network structure with only short straight segments. The eLoG method highly oversegments, essentially identifying all pixels in this region. Oversegmentation is also done by the FS and CID, but on a much lower scale. Image inhomogeneity is introduced by the dark area on the left. Clearly, the FS is the only method that finds most of the labeled segments, followed by the eLoG method that tends to break longer lines into pieces. While CID finds almost none of the filaments, together with the eLoG method it also features almost no oversegmentation in this area. In contrast, the oversegmentation by the FS features line segments that are visible in the raw image also, that were not labeled by the human expert.</p>

CID detects lines almost exclusively in the higher contrast bright region, where it produces a cobweb structure with an amount of oversegmentation similar to the FS.</p>

The CID finds 48.65% of labeled filament pixels with an oversegmentation rate of 58.02%. Of course, it cannot give orientation information. Notably the orientation due to oversegmentation of the FS is compatible with the ground truth orientation labeling. The eLoG method dramatically oversegments, rendering its result useless for further analysis. This cell VB2 is one of the outliers both for the eLoG and Hough methods, cf.

<p>In penultimate row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g017">Fig 17</xref>, angles up 6.5° (two-tined fork in the centers of the penultimate row) are well resolved by FS and the eLoG method, CID fails, however. Lower angles (3.5°, located southwest of the fork in the same row) are not resolved by any of the methods. While the angle of 5° (in the center of the fourth row images) is almost fully resolved only by the eLoG method, we stress that the eLoG method only identifies pixels; extracting line information would require separate tracing, with the segment sensor, say, which tends to destroy this angular resolution.</p>
<p>Notably, the eLoG method tends to make lines thicker and longer, cf. the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g017">Fig 17</xref>.</p>
<p><bold>The nature of oversegmentation</bold> is distinctively different among the three methods. All methods tend to oversegment in challenging images. The eLoG method tends to solidly fill entire image areas and CID tends to produce fine network structures with straight lines only at very small scales. The FS produces false straight segments, often parallel to labeled filaments.</p>
<p><bold>Challenges summary</bold>. While the eLoG method tends to make lines thicker and longer and under noise and blur to fill the entire image, CID tends to return a network structure, performing poorly at close parallel lines and lines intersecting with small angles. With the eLoG method it shares the difficulty to identify features under image inhomogeneity. Regarding image inhomogeneity, noise and (nearly) parallel line detection, the FS outperforms the other methods. Regarding line crossings, the eLoG method seemingly outperforms the FS which outperforms CID, however only “seemingly” because the eLoG method would have to be followed by a tracing step. Under blur the FS features more false positives than CID, the FS’s false positives tend to reflect labeled nearby filament orientation better than those of CID.</p>
<p>Overall, the FS performs well in terms of the challenges lined out before and often outperforms the eLoG and CID methods in terms of correct line pixel identification.</p>

We normalize histograms, because the canonical computation of the EMD requires both histograms to have the same mass. Note that this comparison disregards the effect of excess mass on shape features, the noise level, say. For a complete picture with ground truth available, however, from the illustration in the bottom rows of Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g014">14</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0126346.g020">20</xref> we observe that

<title>Speed</title>
<p>Using an orientational grid of 180 angles, eLoG takes more than 20 minutes per image compared to approximately 20 seconds for the FS and for HT (these runtimes have been observed on a single core 1.73 GHz Intel Celeron with 2 GB ram). In contrast, the CID method required more than 20 hours (running on an AMD Opteron 6140 with 32 cores at 2.6 GHz and 128 GB ram). The disparity of runtimes is illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0126346.t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The comparatively short runtime in connection with the semi-automated nature of its workflow (fast, uninterrupted batch processing) thus makes the FS a viable tool for analyzing the actin cytoskeleton via time series of live cell images. Especially, as 50 images are taken every 10 minutes in our setup, the FS can analyze the full filament structure of images almost in real time. This cannot be achieved with any of the existing methods. A future application in terms of automatic microscopy and real time stress fiber analysis is thus conceivable.</p>

Reliable extraction of the entire filament data is essential for a better understanding and future modelling of the complex mechano-sensing phenomena e.g. for detailed statistical studies of the relationship between matrix elasticity and early mechano-guided differentiation of hMSCs or myoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref005">5</xref>]. In view of live cell imaging, approximately 4000 images (30 cells followed over 24 hours with an image every 10 minutes) need to be processed per day. To the knowledge of the authors, no method has previously been available for this task (even without extracting the entire filament structure, the conventional eLoG method would require 60 days for this, CID almost 10 years).</p>
<p>We have provided for a proof of concept by checking against a database of filaments manually marked by a human expert and a simulated database. Moreover, we have compared our FS against three other methods, the output of which, however, encompasses only a small portion of the entire filament data we are interested in. In this comparison, the FS performs best in terms of histogram mass and histogram distances and takes a middle ground between false positives (where, for real cells, eLoG is best and CID is worst) and false negatives (where, for real cells, CID is best and eLoG is worst).</p>
<p>In terms of speed, the FS overwhelmingly outperforms all competitors. While the HT would require additional tracing, eLoGs are slower by a factor of more than 60 and CID by a factor of more than 10<sup>3</sup> (on a stronger machine). Clearly the latter is beyond any acceptable runtime for the processing of thousands of images we are aiming at.</p>
<p>In summary, recalling goals I), II) and III) from Section “The Filament Sensor and the Benchmark Dataset”, the FS is the first tool available to extract complete filament data from hMSCs images (goal III), unsupervised in near real time (goal I) that is equally or more robust (goal II) than slower competitors with more limited output.</p>
<p>At the end of this exposition we would like to point out two challenges we leave for future work.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>As the FS starts finding wide lines first and then proceeds to thinner lines, it will sometimes detect lines of variable width as several pieces with different width. These line fragments could be matched to produce a single long line.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A future version of the FS may include slightly curved stress fibers and a correspondingly appropriate matching procedure. We plan to explore the application of curved Gabor filters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref038">38</xref>] for detecting curved stress fibers and for coping with fiber crossings. Recently, Gabor wavelets have proved to be beneficial for a similar application in retinal vessel tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0126346.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
