        <p>Nanog is a pivotal transcription factor in embryonic stem (ES) cells and is essential for maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of ES cells. SUMOylation has been proved to regulate several stem cell markers' function, such as Oct4 and Sox2. Nanog is strictly regulated by Oct4/Sox2 heterodimer. However, the direct effects of SUMOylation on <italic>Nanog</italic> expression remain unclear. In this study, we reported that SUMOylation repressed <italic>Nanog</italic> expression. Depletion of Sumo1 or its conjugating enzyme Ubc9 increased the expression of Nanog, while high SUMOylation reduced its expression. Interestingly, we found that SUMOylation of Oct4 and Sox2 regulated <italic>Nanog</italic> in an opposing manner. SUMOylation of Oct4 enhanced Nanog expression, while SUMOylated Sox2 inhibited its expression. Moreover, SUMOylation of Oct4 by Pias2 or Sox2 by Pias3 impaired the interaction between Oct4 and Sox2. Taken together, these results indicate that SUMOylation has a negative effect on Nanog expression and provides new insights into the mechanism of SUMO modification involved in ES cells regulation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst, ES cells can proliferate indefinitely in vitro and differentiate into cells of all three germ layers. These unique properties make ES cells exceptionally valuable for cell replacement therapies, drug discovery and regenerative medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Martin1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Evans1">[2]</xref>. An intricate network of transcription factors has been found in undifferentiated ES cells for maintaining its features. And recent studies indicated that Nanog, a homeobox transcription factor, was involved in this network and played a critical role in regulating the cell fate of the pluripotent ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Chambers1">[3]</xref>. Nanog is expressed in ES cells and is thought to be a key factor in maintaining ES cells pluripotency. It functions together with other factors such as Oct4 and Sox2 to establish ESC identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Lavial1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Yamaguchi1">[6]</xref>. In addition, Nanog is essential for early embryonic development, and is regarded as the gateway for somatic cells to reprogram into induced pluripotent cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Silva1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins are structurally similar to ubiquitin although they share less than 20% sequence identity. Like ubiquitylation, protein SUMOylation is regulated by a cascade of reactions involving SUMO-activating enzymes (SAE1/SAE2), conjugating enzymes (Ubc9) and multiple E3 ligases (e.g. PIAS1, PIAS2, PIAS3, PIAS4 (PIASy), RanBP2 and Pc2) that covalently attach SUMO to specific protein substrates. In addition, a number of de-SUMOylation enzymes (i.e. Ulp/SENPs) for rapid deconjugation are core components of this reversible post-translational modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Kerscher1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In lower eukaryotes, a single SUMO gene is expressed (<italic>Smt3</italic> in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), whereas in vertebrates three paralogs designated as SUMO1–3 are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, the human genome also encodes a gene for SUMO4 that appears to be uniquely expressed in the spleen, lymph nodes and kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Guo1">[9]</xref>. Ubc9 is the sole E2 enzyme for SUMOylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Okuma1">[10]</xref>. SUMO E3 ligases are the enzymes assumed to ensure substrate specificity, and most E3 ligases interact with both the SUMO-Ubc9 thioester and substrate to bring them in close proximity for SUMO transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Maderbck1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Covalent modification of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) cause changes in the intracellular localization and stability of proteins, and alters their abilities to interact with other proteins and nucleic acids. In particularly, these modifications affect the functions of proteins involved in a wide range of cellular processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Kerscher1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Johnson1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Seeler1">[14]</xref>, including macromolecular transport, the maintenance of nuclear structure, nucleic acid DNA metabolism and cell signaling.</p>
      <p>The most well-known group of SUMO substrates is transcription factors, in which SUMOylation regulates transcriptional activity. Previous studies have revealed that SUMOylation can positively or negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of pluripotent factors such as Oct4 and Sox2, which play critical roles in the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency and promote reprogramming of fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Tsuruzoe1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Zhang1">[17]</xref>, thereby linking SUMOylation with pluripotency. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the expression of Nanog is strictly regulated by the Oct4/Sox2 heterodimer and other transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Kuroda1">[18]</xref>. To further investigate the role of SUMOylation in the regulatory gene network of ES cells, we examined the effect of SUMOylation on <italic>Nanog</italic> expression. Our results showed that SUMOylation of transcription factors Sox2 and Oct4 regulates their transcriptional activity differentially and represses Nanog expression.</p>

        <p>SUMOylation is an important post-translational protein modification and regulates many critical cellular processes. SUMOylation of Sox2 inhibited its DNA binding activity and negatively regulated its transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Tsuruzoe1">[15]</xref>, while SUMOylation of Oct4 enhanced its stability, DNA binding, and transactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Wei1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Zhang1">[17]</xref>. These data indicated that SUMOylation plays an important role in regulation of genes expression in ES cells. To gain a general understanding of the potential role of SUMO modification in ES cells, we reduced the SUMOylation level by knockdown of Sumo1/Ubc9, or increased the SUMOylation level by exogenously expressed Sumo1/Ubc9 in F9 embryonal carcinoma (F9 EC) cells. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot results showed that short hairpin RNAi constructs could efficiently reduce the expression level of <italic>Sumo1</italic> and <italic>Ubc9</italic> compared with that of empty vector or scramble RNAi vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). Overexpression of Sumo1 and Ubc9 was detected in HA-<italic>Sumo1</italic> and HA-<italic>Ubc9</italic> transfected F9 EC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Under this condition, we measured the mRNA levels of key regulators <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Oct4</italic>, and found that <italic>Nanog</italic> transcripts were increased by 1.5–2-fold upon knockdown of Sumo1/Ubc9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of Sumo1/Ubc9 reduced the <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA level to 20–30% compared with that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). The expression level of transcription factors <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Oct4</italic> (<italic>Pou5f1</italic>) did not change significantly (data not shown). Consistent with qPCR results, overexpression of Sumo1/Ubc9 led to a dramatic reduction of Nanog protein compared with control cells, while knockdown of Sumo1/Ubc9 increased Nanog expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). To confirm these results, F9 EC cells were treated with ginkgolic acid, an inhibitor of SUMOylation for 10 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Fukuda1">[19]</xref>. Then, we detected the SUMOylation level and Nanog expression by western blot and qPCR. The result further proved that Nanog gene expression is suppressed by SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039606.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Dual-luciferase assays were performed to determine whether SUMOylation repressed the transcriptional activity of the <italic>Nanog</italic> proximal promoter. The proximal promoter sequence of <italic>Nanog</italic> containing the Sox2/Oct4 element (−230 to +50 relative to the transcription start site) was cloned and inserted into a pGL4.10 vector, then we cotransfected F9 EC cells with the reporter vector and shRNA or Sumo1/Ubc9 expression constructs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, low luciferase activity was observed in Sumo1/Ubc9-overexpressing cells. However, we noted that the luciferase activity of the Nanog proximal promoter did not increase significantly in Sumo1/Ubc9 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>), in F9 EC cells, there still be many other SUMO substrates except Oct4 and Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>), the global reduction of SUMOylation may decreases the SUMO modification of other protein, thereby disturbs the results.

        <p>Next, we investigated how SUMOylation suppressed <italic>Nanog</italic> expression.

SUMOylation of Sox2 and Sox2 K247R was also characterized.

        <p>Subsequently, qPCR was used to quantify the <italic>Nanog</italic> transcripts in F9 EC cells expressing wild type Oct4 or Oct4 K118R. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the relative transcription level of <italic>Nanog</italic> in cells co-expressing Oct4 and Sumo1 or Ubc9 was 1.5–2-fold higher than in Oct4 K118R-transfected cells.

These results indicate that SUMOylation of Oct4 increases the expression of Nanog.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, we examined the effect of SUMOylation of Sox2 on Nanog expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g003">Figure 3</xref>, co-overexpression of wild-type Sox2 and Sumo1/Ubc9 decreased the Nanog expression at both mRNA level and protein levels. Accordingly, compared with the control group, <italic>Nanog</italic> transcripts were increased by more than 1.5-fold in Sox2 K247R-transfected cells, in which Sox2 was not modified by Sumo1. The results of western blot confirmed that Nanog expression was inhibited by SUMOylated Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g003">Fig. 3B and C</xref>). Luciferase assays showed that SUMOylation of Oct4 promoted Nanog transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), while covalent modification of Sox2 with Sumo1 reduced Nanog transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g003">3</xref>, we noted that cotransfection of Oct4 K118R or Sox2 with Sumo1 and Ubc9 caused the expression level of Nanog to fall back to the baseline level. This effect may be due to the complexity of endogenous Oct4 and Sox2, because the Oct4/Sox2 dimers would be altered by manipulating either Oct4 or Sox2. To overcome this effect, we performed additional experiments using NIH 3T3 cells that do not express endogenous Oct4 or Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Consistent with results using F9 EC cells, we found that SUMOylation of Oct4 promoted transcription of the Nanog proximal promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), and SUMOylation of Sox2 decreased its transactivity for the Nanog proximal promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). However, the luciferase activity did not fall back to the levels of the negative control, indicating that the SUMOylation levels of both exogenous and endogenous Oct4/Sox2 was altered by overexpression of Sumo1 and Ubc9 in F9 EC cells.</p>

Cotransfection of the 3×Oct reporter construct with Flag-Oct4 led to a 2-fold increase in luciferase activity, and the luciferase activity increased to 4–4.5 fold by cotransfecting Sumo1 and Ubc9 plasmids. In contrast, the luciferase activity of Oct4 K118R-transfected NIH 3T3 did not increase significantly, even with cotransfection of Sumo1 and Ubc9 plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the regulation of SUMO on Nanog, a transcription factor required for maintaining the pluripotency of ES cells. We found that SUMOylation mediated a negative effect on <italic>Nanog</italic> expression, in which overexpression of the key components of the SUMO system decreased Nanog expression significantly. We also tried to elucidate the mechanisms of SUMOylation, which regulate Nanog. We revealed that SUMO modification of Sox2 and Oct4 alters their transcriptional activity and interaction. Furthermore, the results showed that SUMO E3 ligases Pias2 and Pias3 are involved in regulating Nanog by enhancing SUMOylation of Sox2 and Oct4, respectively. Taken together, our study indicates that SUMOylation regulates Nanog by affecting transcription factors Sox2 and Oct4.</p>
      <p>SUMOylation is a post-translational modification involved in various cellular processes, such as nuclear-cytosolic transport, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, protein stability and the DNA damage response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Hong1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Nagai1">[27]</xref>. Most recently, it has been reported that the SUMOylation pathway is involved in early development and the cellular pluripotency of vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Chiu1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Du1">[31]</xref>. Additionally, some transcription factors, which function in the protein interaction network for the pluripotency of ES cells, are regulated by SUMOylation. These data suggests that SUMOylation has pivotal roles in cell differentiation and the maintenance of ES cell stemness.</p>
      <p>Because the <italic>Nanog</italic> promoter has a Nanog consensus site upstream of the transcription start site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Chickarmane1">[32]</xref>, we considered that Sumo1 may covalently modify Nanog as a feedback response to repress <italic>Nanog</italic> expression. We analyzed the Nanog amino acid sequence using the SUMOsp 2.0 software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Ren1">[33]</xref>, but no potential SUMOylation site Ψ-K-X-E (where Ψ represents a hydrophobic amino acid, and X represents any amino acid) was found. Next, we focused on two SUMO targets, Oct4 and Sox2, which positively regulate <italic>Nanog</italic> by binding to the proximal promoter of <italic>Nanog</italic>. However, our results showed that SUMOylation of Oct4 and Sox2 had opposing effects on Nanog expression. SUMOylated Oct4 enhanced Nanog expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), and conversely, SUMOylated Sox2 downregulated Nanog expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Additional luciferase assays demonstrated that SUMOylation repressed <italic>Nanog</italic> transcription via modulating Oct4/Sox2 binding to the Oct/Sox element in the <italic>Nanog</italic> proximal promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g003">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g004">4D</xref>). This effect might be due to the fact that SUMOylation diminishes the DNA binding activity of Sox2, but enhances Oct4 binding to DNA octamer element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Tsuruzoe1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Wei1">[16]</xref>. F9 EC cells express endogenous Oct4 and Sox2, hence the dynamic of the endogenous Oct4/Sox2 dimers that bind to the <italic>Nanog</italic> promoter would be altered by adjusting the SUMOylation levels of exogenous Oct4/Sox2, thereby further disturbing the endogenous effect of SUMOylation on Nanog transcription. To reduce the complexity introduced by endogenous Oct4/Sox2, we performed reporter assays with NIH 3T3 cells, and the results further demonstrated that SUMOylation of Oct4 enhances its transactivation, and covalent modification of Sox2 with Sumo1 decreases the transactivation ability of the <italic>Nanog</italic> proximal promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039606-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

In this study, to determine whether SUMOylation altered the subcellular localization of Sox2 and Oct4, we investigated the intracellular distribution of Sox2 and Oct4 in pluripotent F9 EC cells. The results showed that the subcellular localization of Sox2 and Oct4, which are normally localized in the nucleus, was not affected by SUMOylation. Therefore, our findings indicate that SUMOylation regulates the transcriptional activity of Sox2 and Oct4 by a mechanism other than altering nuclear localization.</p>
      <p>It is well known that Oct4 and Sox2 are necessary to maintain the pluripotency of ES cells. In ES cells, Oct4 and Sox2 often form the Oct4-Sox2 heterodimer to regulate the expression of <italic>Nanog</italic> and other target genes, and an Oct4-centered transcriptional network controls the pluripotent cell identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Rodda1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-vandenBerg1">[38]</xref>. In our current study, the effect of SUMO modification on the protein-protein interaction between Oct4 and Sox2 was evaluated by CoIP and western blot. The results demonstrated that the Oct4-Sox2 interaction (dimerization) was impaired by SUMOylation, in which both SUMOylated Sox2 and Oct4 showed a reduced protein-protein binding ability. Accordingly, we speculated that the stability of Sox2 and Oct4 binding to the <italic>Nanog</italic> promoter may be impaired by SUMOylation.</p>
      <p>E3 ligases contribute to SUMOylation substrate specificity and efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Maderbck1">[11]</xref>. Three main subtypes of SUMO E3 ligases have been identified: Pias proteins, RanBP2, and Pc2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Johnson1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-GeissFriedlander1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Cox1">[40]</xref>. In the present study, we found that SUMO E3 ligase Pias2 promoted SUMOylation of Sox2 and repressed <italic>Nanog</italic> transcription, while Pias3 enhanced SUMO modification of Oct4 and enhanced its transactivation. Hence, we hypothesize that when Sumo1 and Ubc9 are overexpressed in F9 EC cells, the SUMOylation of endogenous Sox2 is enhanced by specific E3 ligases such as Pias2, while the amount of SUMOylated Oct4 is much less than that of Sox2 because of the specificity of E3 ligases. Under such circumstances, Nanog expression is mainly regulated by SUMOylated Sox2, thus resulting in a decreased amount of Nanog.</p>
      <p>Nanog plays a crucial role in maintenance of the undifferentiated state of mouse ES cells, and downregulation of Nanog induces differentiation of human ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Hyslop1">[41]</xref>. Although no obvious phenotype change was observed when we overexpressed Sumo1 and Ubc9 in F9 EC cells, based on our studies, we believe it is possible to induce ES cell differentiation into specific cell types by combining SUMOylation modification with small molecule treatments.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that SUMOylation represses Nanog expression. On the one hand, SUMOylation of Sox2 inhibits its transcriptional activity and represses <italic>Nanog</italic> transcription, while SUMOylation also disturbs the protein-protein interaction between Oct4 and Sox2, resulting in decreased of Nanog expression. Additionally, previous studies showed that there are several other SUMO substrates that express specifically in ES cells, such as SALL1 and Klf4, SUMOylation modulates their transcriptional activity, and these genes are involved in regulating Nanog expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Snchez1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Du1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Chan1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039606-Karantzali1">[43]</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that SUMOylation of pluripotency factors may be an alternative mechanism to control the Nanog level <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, SUMO E3 ligases might be a potential regulator involved in the regulation of Nanog expression, and further experiments will be needed to investigate the gene expression patterns and substrate-specificity of SUMO E3 ligases in undifferentiated and differentiated ES cells. Identification of the expression difference and target specificity of SUMO E3 ligases will be helpful to further understand the role of the SUMOylation pathway in cell-fate determination of pluripotent cells.</p>
