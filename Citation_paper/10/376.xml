        <p>Trophoblast stem (TS) cells are ideal models to investigate trophectoderm differentiation and placental development. Herein, we describe the derivation of rabbit trophoblast stem cells from embryonic stem (ES) cells. Rabbit ES cells generated in our laboratory were induced to differentiate in the presence of BMP4 and TS-like cell colonies were isolated and expanded. These cells expressed the molecular markers of mouse TS cells, were able to invade, give rise to derivatives of TS cells, and chimerize placental tissues when injected into blastocysts. The rabbit TS-like cells maintained self-renewal in culture medium with serum but without growth factors or feeder cells, whilst their proliferation and identity were compromised by inhibitors of FGFs and TGF-β receptors. Taken together, our study demonstrated the derivation of rabbit TS cells and suggested the essential roles of FGF and TGF-β signalings in maintenance of rabbit TS cell self-renewal.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In most mammals, the trophectoderm is one of the first cell types to be specified in the blastocyst. It surrounds the inner cell mass (ICM) and is responsible for the initiation of implantation. A subset of trophectoderm cells (trophoblast stem cells) retain the capacities to proliferate and to differentiate, eventually producing the entire trophoblastic population of the mature placenta, an ephemeral organ essential for nutrient and waste exchange between the fetus and its mother <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Rossant1">[1]</xref>. Trophectoderm differentiation and trophoblast formation are highly dynamic and finely regulated. Abnormalities in trophoblast formation and function underlie many aspects of early pregnancy loss and pregnancy complications in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Norwitz1">[2]</xref>. Experimentally modeling the in vivo process of trophoblast formation is difficult and presents a big challenge. However, trophoblast stem (TS) cells can be used to model and study the trophoblast in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Douglas1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Trophoblasts display morphological, functional and molecular diversity within and across species. Although some knowledge has been obtained from the study of mouse TS cells, which can be easily isolated from blastocysts, much less is known regarding human trophoblast development. To study the human trophoblast, several human trophoblast cell lines were derived from placental tissue or through immortalization of trophoblast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-King1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Wang1">[5]</xref>. A recent study also reported the generation of cytotrophoblast stem cells from human ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Harun1">[6]</xref>. These cells, however, failed to recapitulate the early stage of trophoblast development.</p>
      <p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells and TS cells have distinct cell lineage fates and do not transdifferentiate in vivo or in vitro. However, recent studies demonstrated that genetic manipulation of the key players in trophoblastic lineage development, including forced repression of Oct4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Niwa1">[7]</xref> or over-expression of caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2) or Eomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Niwa2">[8]</xref>, can induce trophoblastic differentiation and permit the derivation of TS cells from ES cells. Moreover, ES cells cultured on embryonic feeder cells can be induced into trophoblastic differentiation by collagen IV or BMP4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-SchenkeLayland1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Xu1">[10]</xref>. These studies indicated that ES cells have the ability to differentiate into trophoblastic lineage if they are provided with the correct clues.</p>
      <p>Rabbit is a mating-induced ovulator. Its pregnancy can be precisely timed and the window of implantation can be readily defined by several biochemical markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Denker1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Winterhager1">[12]</xref>. In addition, at the points where the blastocysts attach to the uterine epithelium, the trophectoderm forms unique structures known as trophoblastic knobs, which are readily identifiable during early pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Hoffman1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Enders1">[14]</xref>. For these reasons, rabbits and their TS cells appear to be ideal models to study the processes of implantation and placentation. We have established one rabbit ES cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Wang2">[15]</xref>. Using this ES cell line, we herein report the derivation of rabbit TS cells from ES cells differentiated with BMP4, which induced human ES cell differentiation into trophoblast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Xu1">[10]</xref>. We also provide evidences suggesting the essential roles of FGFs and TGFβ signalings in maintaining stem cell self-renewal. Rabbit ES cells and human ES cells display morphological and molecular similarities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Wang2">[15]</xref>. We therefore expected that rabbit TS cells would resemble human TS cells, and the knowledge obtained from studying rabbit TS cells could shed light on the process of human placentation.</p>

        <title>Derivation of epithelial-like cells in embryoid bodies (EBs)</title>
        <p>Rabbit ES cells treated with BMP4 were induced to differentiate into epithelial-like cells in both EB and monolayer culture systems. In EB differentiation, cells displayed heterogeneity at the beginning of BMP4 treatment (day 0), with cuboidal epithelial-like cells surrounded by fibroblast-like cells at the edge. The epithelial-like cells proliferated faster than the fibroblast-like cells, leading to domination of the epithelial-like population at day 10–15 of differentiation. A few multinucleated cells were formed at this stage. There was no significant difference among the four groups of BMP4 treatment in term of differentiation rates (1, 5, 10 and 20 ng/ml). These epithelial-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and fibroblast-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) were expanded via limited dilution and individual cell clones were established from single cells. The epithelial-like cells were capable of self-renewal and have been passaged up to 60 times. The doubling time was 16.084±0.379 hours.</p>

        <p>In adherent differentiation, the epithelial-like cells appeared three days earlier in groups treated with high concentrations of BMP4 (10 or 20 ng/ml) when compared to those treated with lower concentrations (1 or 5 ng/ml) (3–4 days versus 6–7 days after treatment, respectively). Furthermore, the cells were homogeneous in morphology, without the formation of fibroblast-like cells (data not shown). However, these cells failed to sustain the morphological characteristics and eventually differentiated into multinucleated cells as well as giant nuclear cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Epithelial-like cells expressed genes characteristic of TS cells</title>
        <p>The epithelial-like cells maintained self-renewal during continuous passages, although some cells spontaneously differentiated into giant nuclear cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, arrow). These properties prompted us to examine if these cells are trophectodermal lineage stem cells. The mRNA expressions of Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 (three pluripotency genes), Cdx2, Esrrb, Eomes (three transcription factors characteristic of the trophectoderm in mouse and vole), Hand1 (known to promote the differentiation of giant trophoblast cells and is highly expressed in undifferentiated and differentiated mouse and vole TS cells), Gcm1 (syncytiotrophoblast marker) and Tpbpa (specific for spongiotrophoblast and ectoplacental cone) were examined by RT-PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Niwa1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Tanaka1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Grigoreva1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Chuykin1">[18]</xref>. As shown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017124.s003">Figure S1</xref>), the epithelial-like cells highly expressed the pluripotency marker Oct4 but not Nanog or Sox2 at passage 17. However, the expression level of Oct4 decreased dramatically at passage 40, as that of Gcm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), which might suggest stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Abell1">[19]</xref>. The trophoblastic lineage markers Cdx2, Eomes, Hand1 and Gcm1 were consistently detected in epithelial-like cells at passages 17 (P17) and 40 (P40). Tpbpa mRNAs were expressed in rabbit placenta but not in epithelial-like cells. Surprisingly, the transcription factor Esrrb, which is expressed in TS cells and placenta of both mouse and vole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Grigoreva1">[17]</xref>, was not detected in either rabbit placenta or epithelia-like cells. Further studies were needed to verify the expression of Esrrb in rabbit. In consistency with the mRNA expression data, immunofluorescent staining and western blotting detected the expression of cytokeratin-7 (epithelial marker), CDX2, and chorionic gonadotropin β subunit (CG-β, trophoblast marker) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Xu1">[10]</xref> in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g002">Figure 2A, 2C</xref>). The germ layer markers Vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), Nestin or Brachyury were not detected in these cells (data not shown). In accordance to the observation of spontaneous differentiation, Placental lactogen-I (PL-I), a specific marker for giant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Faria1">[20]</xref>, was occasionally detected in some cells after prolonged culture by immunofluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Taken together, these data suggested that these epithelial-like cells were TS-like cells.</p>

        <title>TS-like cells can differentiate into trophoblastic derivatives in vitro and in vivo</title>
        <p>To further clarify the identity of these TS-like cells, we went on to investigate if they have TS cell abilities to differentiate into trophoblast subtypes in vitro, and to chimerize placental tissues in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Watson1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Malassine1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-StaunRam1">[23]</xref>.

Similarly, time lapse microscopy revealed that adherent TS-like cells occasionally formed multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast when they met each other. Syncytiotrophoblasts were also formed through the fusion of mononucleated daughter cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017124.s005">Movie S1</xref>). In accordance with the morphological change, the expression of the genes specific to the differentiated syncytiotrophoblast increased under the drug treatment. As shown, addition of dbcAMP increased Gcm1 expression and decreased CDX2 expression as detected by semi quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The protein level of relaxin, a marker of rabbit placental syncytiotrophoblast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Lee1">[24]</xref>, was also elevated by dbcAMP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

In the invasive assay of monolayer TS-like cells, an average of 406.7±33.0 cells (n = 3) had invaded the transwell to reach the bottom of the membrane.

        <p>The above evidences prompted us to take the strictest test as if these TS-like cells were able to chimerize the placental tissues when injected into blastocysts. GFP transgenic TS-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) were injected into blastocysts to examine their ability to chimerize the placental tissues. At day 20 of gestation, placenta proper, but not embryo proper of the conceptus (4 out of 12) derived from the green TS like-cell injected blastocysts emitted intensive green fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g004">Figure 4B–D</xref>). In contrast, no green fluorescence was detected in placentas developed from uninjected control blastocysts (12 out of 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g004">Figure 4E–G</xref>), demonstrating the chimerization of TS-like cells.

        <title>FGF and TGFβ signalings are essential for TS-like cells self-renewal</title>
        <p>Previous studies reported the essential roles of FGF and TGF-β signaling in maintenance of mouse TS cell self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Tanaka1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Erlebacher1">[26]</xref>. In this study, rabbit TS-like cells were propagated in culture medium supplemented with FBS but without growth factors under the feeder-cell free condition. To clarify if TS-like cell proliferation was regulated by FGF and/or TGFβ signaling, we cultured TS-like cells in the presence or absence of FBS supplied with or without these growth factors. Cell proliferation was monitored by the change of DNA content. As shown, the proliferation rate of TS-like cells was attenuated after withdrawal of FBS. The attenuation could be partially reversed by addition of 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 or 25 ng/ml aFGF+25 ng/ml bFGF into serum-free medium. However, addition of growth factors in the presence of FBS did not affect the proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These data suggested that FGF and TGF-β signalings were beneficial to TS-like cell proliferation, and their activation could be triggered by serum. To further confirm the indispensable roles of FGF and TGF-β signalings in the maintenance of TS-like cells, we treated the cells with FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) inhibitor SU5402 or TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor SB431542 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Inman1">[27]</xref> to interrupt the signaling. In the absence of FBS, interfering either of the signaling pathways increased the population of cells at the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that the proliferation of the TS-like cells was dependent of the two signalings. Concordantly, in TS-like cells we detected the mRNA expression of some components of FGF pathway (FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, SOS1, PTPN11) and TGF-β pathway (Smad1, 2, 3, 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

        <p>To test if FGFs and TGF-β signalings are able to maintain TS-like cell identity, the mRNA expression level of the genes specific to trophoblastic lineage (Cdx2, Eomes, Gcm1, and Hand1) was compared before and after 48 hour of treatment. As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), in the presence of FBS TGF-β1 had no effect on Cdx2 expression. However, it increased the mRNA expression of Gcm1, Hand1, and Eomes (another TS cell specific transcription factor downstream of Cdx2). In the absence of serum, interference of the TGF-β signaling with SB431542 led to the decreases in mRNA expressions of Eomes, Gcm1, and Hand1. Similarly, the reduction in mRNA expressions of Cdx2, Eomes, Gcm1, and Hand1 was observed when the FGF signaling was interrupted with SU5402 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017124-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast to the changes in gene expression level, the morphological transformation of TS-like cells was not obvious during 48 hour treatment. However, prolonged blockage of TGF-β or FGF signaling for more than four days caused the differentiation of TS-like cells into giant cells and syncytiotrophoblast followed by catastrophic death of all cell types (data not shown). Taken together, these evidences demonstrated the essential roles of these signalings in rabbit TS-like cells self-renewal.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Trophoblast stem cells are ideal models to study the biology of trophoblast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Douglas1">[3]</xref>. In mouse, TS cells can be easily isolated from blastocysts. However, there has been no success in establishing human TS cells, albeit a study has reported derivation of stable, proliferating cytotrophoblast stem cells from human ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Harun1">[6]</xref>. In this study, we have shown that rabbit ES cells were induced to differentiate into epithelial-like cells by BMP4. These epithelial-like cells expressed TS cell markers, were able to proliferate while maintaining their identity, to differentiate into trophoblastic derivatives <italic>in vitro</italic>, and notably, to chimerize the placental tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, we demonstrated the establishment of rabbit TS cells from ES cells. Rabbit is phylogenetically closer to primates than mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Reyes1">[28]</xref>. Our previous studies showed that rabbit and human ES cells, which had similar morphology, expressed the same stem cell markers (SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81) and maintained self-renewal in the absence of LIF signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Wang2">[15]</xref>. These similarities suggested that rabbit TS cell could be a suitable tool to study the molecular events occurring during human implantation and placentation.</p>
      <p>Rabbit TS cells were derived from ES cells differentiated in EBs instead of in monolayer culture. Although differentiated cells in the monolayer culture system were more homogeneous in morphology than those derived in EBs, they lost proliferation capacity shortly after differentiation, as observed in human ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Xu1">[10]</xref>. We speculated that EBs were able to provide the correct signals for ES cells to differentiate into TS cells. Otherwise, we could not exclude the possibility that gelatin, used in the monolayer culture, was not ideal for inducing differentiation of rabbit ES cells into TS cells.</p>
      <p>The blastocyst is composed of two distinct cell lineages: inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). ES cells are derived from ICM, while TS cells come from TE. ICM and TE, and ES cells and TS cells, correspondingly, have distinct lineage fates and do not transdifferentiate. ICM as well as ES cells contribute exclusively to the embryo proper, whilst TE or TS cells contribute to the extraembryonic tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Martin1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Evans1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Iannaccone1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Thomson1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Thomson2">[33]</xref>. However, recent studies reported that ectopic manipulation of some genes or signaling pathways could divert ES cells from embryonic to trophoblastic fates. For instance, forced repression of Oct4 and Nanog or overexpression of Cdx2 and Hras could divert mouse ES cells toward trophoblastic fates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Niwa2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Tolkunova1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Hough1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Lu1">[36]</xref>. Collagen IV was also shown to induce mouse ES cells to differentiate into TS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-SchenkeLayland1">[9]</xref>. These reports altogether implicated ES cells as ideal models to investigate the molecular events governing the first cell fate determination during early embryogenesis. Rabbit ES cells were transdifferentiated into TS cells by treatment with BMP4, suggesting that BMP4 signaling plays key roles in the first cell lineage determination during rabbit embryogenesis. More studies are needed to confirm the existence and activation of BMP4 signaling in preimplantation embryos and to investigate its functions and the underlying molecular mechanisms in cell lineage determination.</p>
      <p>The requirements for successful derivation and maintenance of TS cells vary across the species. For instance, propagation of mouse TS cells strictly requires MEF feeder cells (or feeder cell conditioned medium), FGF4 and TGF-β growth factors in the culture medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Tanaka1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Erlebacher1">[26]</xref>. Proliferation of vole and rat TS cells is FGF4 independent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Grigoreva1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Chuykin1">[18]</xref>. In our study, rabbit TS cells do not require feeder cells to keep undifferentiated, but their self-renewal depends on the FGF and TGF-β signalings. TS cells of different species also express distinct stemness markers. Mouse and vole TS cells expressed Sox2 but not Oct4 or Nanog<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Grigoreva1">[17]</xref>. Rat TS cells expressed both Sox2 and Oct4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Chuykin1">[18]</xref>. Whereas rabbit TS cells expressed Oct4 but not Nanog or Sox2 in this study.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have demonstrated the establishment and maintenance of rabbit TS cells. These knowledges could shed light on our understanding of human implantation and placentation.</p>

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates in ES medium overnight followed by synchronization in serum-free (SF) medium for 24 hr. The cells were then cultured for 48 hour in the presence of growth factors or growth factor inhibitors. The growth factor treatments included: 1) control (SF medium); 2) 5 ng/ml recombinant TGF-β1 (Chemicon International Inc, Temecula, CA, USA); and 3) 25 ng/ml aFGF+25 ng/ml bFGF (Chemicon International). The inhibitor treatment groups were as followings: 1) control (SF medium); 2) inhibitor of TGF-β signaling, SB431542 (20 µM, Tocris Cookson Inc, Ellisville, USA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Inman1">[27]</xref>; 3) FGF receptor inhibitor, SU5402 (20 µM, Tocris Cookson Inc, Ellisville, USA). Following treatment, cells were harvested and fixed in pre-cooled 70% ethanol at 4°C for 2 hour before incubation with 50 µg/ml propidium iodide plus 100 µg/ml RNase A in PBS for 30 min at 37°C. The DNA content was analyzed with FACS vantage SE (BD Biosciences), and the data were obtained using Cell Quest Software (BD Biosciences).</p>

        <title>Lentiviral infection of rabbit TS-like cells</title>
        <p>TS-like cells were transfected with lentiviral vector expressing GFP. Briefly, Lentiviral vector FUGW constitutively expressing GFP (ubiquitin-C promoter–GFP) was generated as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Lois1">[38]</xref>. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with GFP expression vector and viral packaging vectors pCMV-dR8.91 and pCMV-VSV-G using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Lentiviral supernatants were collected 72 hour after transfection, and filtered through a 0.45 µm sterile filter. The viral particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000×g followed by reconstruction in PBS. Virus titre was determined immediately in HEK-293T cells (1×10<sup>7</sup> virus/µl). Rabbit epithelial-like cells were cultured in 500 µl of ES medium containing 10 µl lentivirus and 5 µg/ml polybrene at 37°C for 48 hour. Thereafter, cells were trypsinized and resuspended for FACS sorting (Becton Dickinson). GFP-positive TS-like cells were collected, expanded, and subjected to one more FACS sorting in order to purify the transgenic cell population.</p>

        <title>Injection of rabbit GFP transgenic TS-like cells</title>
        <p>Ten to twenty GFP transgenic TS-like cells in ES medium were injected into rabbit blastocysts. Uninjected blastocysts were used as negative control. The injected blastocysts were then transferred into uterine of pseudo-pregnant female rabbit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017124-Tanaka1">[16]</xref>. Each time six control and TS-like cell injected blastocysts were transferred back into opposite uterine horns of each pseudo-pregnant female rabbit, respectively. Placentas and embryos at gestation day 20 were dissected and photographed on a Leica MZ16A microscope. The experiments were repeated two times. All animal experiments were approved by the Institute's research animal resource committee.</p>
