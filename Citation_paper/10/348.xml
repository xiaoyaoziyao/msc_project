<abstract>
<p>The first step in developing regenerative medicine approaches to treat renal diseases using pluripotent stem cells must be the generation of intermediate mesoderm (IM), an embryonic germ layer that gives rise to kidneys. In order to achieve this goal, establishing an efficient, stable and low-cost method for differentiating IM cells using small molecules is required. In this study, we identified two retinoids, AM580 and TTNPB, as potent IM inducers by high-throughput chemical screening, and established rapid (five days) and efficient (80% induction rate) IM differentiation from human iPSCs using only two small molecules: a Wnt pathway activator, CHIR99021, combined with either AM580 or TTNPB. The resulting human IM cells showed the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types that constitute adult kidneys, and to form renal tubule-like structures. These small molecule differentiation methods can bypass the mesendoderm step, directly inducing IM cells by activating Wnt, retinoic acid (RA), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways. Such methods are powerful tools for studying kidney development and may potentially provide cell sources to generate renal lineage cells for regenerative therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a global public health problem. Increased prevalence of CKD has led to a rise in the number of dialysis patients, and is associated with elevated morbidity and mortality due to the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Coresh1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Matsushita1">[3]</xref>. Most patients with CKD never recover their renal function, and there is a worldwide shortage of donor kidneys for transplantation; therefore, it is important to develop kidney regeneration therapy using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Evans1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Thomson1">[6]</xref> or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Takahashi1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Yu1">[9]</xref>, which have unlimited self-renewal capabilities and the potential to differentiate into any cell type in the body. However, directed differentiation methods from human ESCs (hESCs) or iPSCs (hiPSCs) into kidney lineage cells have not been fully developed.</p>
<p>Kidneys are derived from an early embryonic germ layer, the intermediate mesoderm (IM). In vertebrates, the IM sequentially develops into three stages of kidneys; the pronephros, mesonephros and metanephros. The mammalian adult kidney (metanephros) is formed by a reciprocal interaction between two precursor tissues, the metanephric mesenchyme and the ureteric bud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Kobayashi1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Saxen1">[13]</xref>. Kidney regeneration methods that mimic normal development would first differentiate ESCs or iPSCs into IM, followed by formation of renal progenitors, such as the metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric bud, and eventually produce the various types of fully differentiated renal cells.</p>
<p>Previous research on kidney development in a mouse model showed that expression of a transcriptional regulator, <italic>Odd-skipped related 1</italic> (<italic>Osr1</italic>), starts early in the embryonic day (E) 7.5 IM from which the renal structures are derived <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Mugford1">[14]</xref>, and is maintained until kidney organogenesis occurs. <italic>Osr1</italic> knockout mice lack renal structures, due to the failure to form the IM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-James1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Wang1">[16]</xref>. Therefore, differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into <italic>Osr1</italic>-expressing IM cells is the first and crucial step toward the induction of renal lineage cells.</p>
<p>We recently established a highly efficient method for inducing the differentiation of IM cells from human iPSCs/ESCs (hiPSCs/ESCs), in which the combination of activin A and CHIR99021, a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor, is first used to generate mesendoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-DAmour1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Gadue1">[18]</xref>, followed by combined treatment with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7 and CHIR99021 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Mae1">[19]</xref>. This protocol induces development of hiPSCs into OSR1<sup>+</sup> IM cells at rate higher than 90%. The OSR1<sup>+</sup> IM cells can further differentiate into multiple cell types constituting IM-derived organs, such as the kidneys, adrenal cortex, and genitalia, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Mae1">[19]</xref>. Although this method efficiently generates IM cells, modifications are needed for clinical application in kidney regeneration therapy. Growth factors, such as activin A and BMP-7, are expensive, and their effects are inconsistent among different lots. Differentiation methods using low-molecular-weight compounds would be less expensive and more consistent. Small molecules can control cellular processes by modulating signal transduction pathways, gene expression, or metabolism. High-throughput screening has been previously used to identify novel small molecules that support the directed differentiation of mouse ESCs (mESCs) and hESCs into definitive endoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Borowiak1">[20]</xref>, pancreatic progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Chen1">[21]</xref>, and cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Wu1">[22]</xref>.</p>

However, the roles and mechanisms of RA signaling have remained unclear. Previous studies reported that the signaling pathways of BMP-2 or BMP-4 were involved in the regulation of mesoderm formation, including differentiation of the IM in chick embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-James2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-ObaraIshihara1">[33]</xref>, but little is known about the developmental mechanisms of IM formation, especially in mammals.</p>
<p>In the present study, we aimed to develop an efficient, stable and low-cost method for differentiating hiPSCs/ESCs into IM cells using small molecules. We performed high-throughput screening of approximately 1,800 chemical compounds and identified two retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonists, AM580 and TTNPB, that efficiently induce the differentiation of hiPSCs/ESCs into IM cells. Based on these results, we established a simple, rapid, and highly efficient differentiation method, using a combination of just two chemicals (CHIR99021 with TTNPB or AM580), to induce development of hiPSCs/ESCs into IM cells that have the potential to give rise to IM derivatives. We found that combined treatment with CHIR99021 and TTNPB or AM580 induces the differentiation of IM cells by activating the expression of BMP-4 through RAR. We further demonstrated that IM cells can be directly generated from hiPSCs/ESCs without the mesendoderm step, by activating the Wnt, RA, and BMP signaling pathways. The new differentiation method using small molecules provides less expensive and more consistent means of generating IM cells than the growth factor method. Therefore, this new method is useful for studying the mechanisms of mesoderm and kidney development and may provide a source of renal lineage cells for use in regenerative medicine to treat CKD.</p>

<p>The development of a well-defined method for differentiating PSCs would provide an excellent system that could be used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of IM differentiation. We therefore devised a serum-free differentiation method by replacing both fetal bovine serum (FBS) used in Stage 1 and KSR in Stage 2 of the small molecule method with B27 supplement. Moreover, Matrigel which coated dishes was replaced by Synthemax, xeno-free coating material. The induction efficiency of OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells in the refined protocol (Serum-free small molecule method, including Serum-free AM580 and TTNPB methods) was about 80% and comparable to the original small molecule method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that the human OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells induced by the small molecule method have an IM signature, we used RT-PCR analyses and immunocytochemistry to examine the expression of multiple IM marker genes.

<p>To further evaluate the multi-lineage differentiation potential, cellular aggregates were generated from the OSR1<sup>+</sup> IM cells, by culturing them in non-attachment dishes for an additional eight days with a ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, that increases the survival rate of dissociated hiPSCs/ESCs and the cells differentiated from them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Kajiwara1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Watanabe1">[43]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, lower middle panel).

<p>The ability of the hiPSC-derived OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells produced by the small molecule method to differentiate into three-dimensional renal structures was further examined by co-culturing them with mouse metanephric cells in an organ culture setting, as previously described using hiPSC-derived IM cells generated by the growth factor method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Mae1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Unbekandt1">[39]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, lower panel).

We examined 145 organ culture samples: 37 with hiPSC-derived OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells induced with AM580, 49 induced with TTNPB, and 59 controls with undifferentiated hiPSCs. Human LTL<sup>+</sup>/laminin<sup>+</sup> renal tubule-like structures originated from the OSR1<sup>+</sup> IM cells in 18 out of the 37 samples (48.6%) induced using AM580, and in 24 out of the 49 samples (49.0%) generated using TTNPB.

Induction of OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells when TTNPB or AM580 was replaced with adapalene (a RARβγ agonist) required concentrations greater than 10–75 nM, suggesting that the adapalene works mainly through RARβ or RARγ. Replacement of TTNPB or AM580 with CD1530, a selective RARγ agonist, required about 100 times higher concentration than adapalene to induce OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells, indicating that signals through RARγ might not play central roles in IM differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084881.s006">Table S1</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the IM cell differentiation from hiPSCs in the small molecule method is primarily mediated by RARβ signaling.</p>

<p>To further analyze the roles of RAR isotypes, we added RAR antagonists to the TTNPB method: a pan-RAR antagonist, BMS493; a selective RARβ antagonist, LE135; and a selective RARγ antagonist, MM11253 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Induction of OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells was reduced by adding BMS493 or LE135, but not by adding MM111235, confirming the involvement of RARβ signaling in IM cell differentiation.</p>
<p>We also examined the effects of small-interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting RARβ on the induction of IM cells in the TTNPB method. The addition of siRNA for RARβ, which silenced around 70% of <italic>RARβ</italic> expression, reduced <italic>OSR1</italic> gene expression by approximately 70%, compared to cells treated with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g004">Figures 4C and D</xref>). Consistent with these findings, flow cytometry analyses showed that induction of OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells decreased by approximately 40% after transfection of the siRNA for RARβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, signals through RARβ are essential for human IM cell differentiation by the small molecule method.</p>
<p>To elucidate the roles of RXR signals in the development of human IM cells, we examined effects of a pan-RXR agonist, SR11237, and a pan-RXR antagonist, UVI3003, on the TTNPB method. Addition of either compound did not significantly change the induction of OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). However, when SR11237 was used instead of TTNPB or AM580, the induction rate of OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells was less than 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). Therefore, IM differentiation from hiPSCs does not appear to be regulated by signaling through RXR receptors.</p>
<p>To determine which RAR agonists are most effective for inducing IM cell differentiation, we compared the efficacy of the three RAR agonists (ATRA, adapalene, and CD1530) with AM580 and TTNPB. As induction of OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells peaked at 150 nM to 2.5 M ATRA, 150 nM to 1.2 M adapalene, and 5–10 M CD1530, when those compounds replaced TTNPB or AM580 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), we used 1 M ATRA, adapalene, AM580, and TTNPB, and 5 M CD1530 for these experiments. The gene expression level of <italic>OSR1</italic>, analyzed by qRT-PCR, was higher following treatment with AM580 or TTNPB than with ATRA, adapalene, or CD1530 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Therefore, AM580 and TTNPB were most effective among the RAR agonists examined for inducing IM cells by the small molecule method.</p>

<title>Activation of the BMP-Smad1/5 Signaling Pathways during IM Cell Differentiation by the Small Molecule Method</title>
<p>To further examine the differentiation mechanisms involved in the generation of IM cells by the small molecule method, we examined the effects of 18 signaling pathway inhibitors added individually during Stage 2 of the TTNPB method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084881.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Three days of culture with inhibitors of the BMP and Smad1/5/8 signaling pathways, including noggin (a BMP antagonist), dorsomorphin (an ALK2/3/6 inhibitor), LDN193189 (an ALK2/3 inhibitor), and DMH1 (an ALK2 inhibitor), reduced induction of IM cells in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084881.s004">Figure S4</xref>). qRT-PCR analyses revealed that addition of noggin inhibited up-regulation of <italic>OSR1</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that BMP signaling pathways might be involved in differentiation of IM cells. To determine which BMP ligands are expressed during the induction process, we generated standard curves for the PCR products encoding five BMP ligands (BMP-2, 4, 5, 6, and 7), and analyzed the copy number of each ligand in cDNA samples of hiPSC-derived OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells on day 6. <italic>BMP-4</italic> was the most abundantly expressed, and <italic>BMP-5</italic> showed the second highest expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).

Interestingly, expression of <italic>BMP-4</italic> began to increase during Stage 1, around culture day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that the small molecule method with CHIR99021 and TTNPB activates <italic>BMP-4</italic> expression and Smad1/5/8 signaling pathways prior to day 3.</p>

<p>When noggin or DMH1 were added beginning on day 1 of the small molecule method, both OSR1<sup>+</sup> cell differentiation and <italic>OSR1</italic> gene expression decreased more than when these factors were added at Stage 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g005">Figures 5A, B, E and F</xref>). Immunoblot analyses detected high levels of Smad1/5 phosphorylation in cell lysates of hiPSC differentiation culture on day 6 of the small molecule method with CHIR99021 and AM580 or TTNPB. Phosphorylation levels were substantially attenuated by adding noggin or DMH1 to the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g005">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>
<p>We next assessed the efficacy of treatment with BMP-4 or BMP-5 alone for inducing OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells from hiPSCs. Induction was increased by approximately 45% after five days of treatment with 10 or 100 ng/ml BMP-4. In contrast, treatment with BMP-5 did not lead to any significant induction of OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells, and no synergistic effects of BMP-4 and BMP-5 were observed, although both BMP-4 and BMP-5 were abundantly expressed in the differentiation cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). These results indicate that BMP-4, but not BMP-5, plays a crucial role in IM differentiation from hiPSCs, and that the mechanisms underlying the small molecule method include activation of the Smad1/5 signaling pathways through increased BMP-4 expression.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the regulatory mechanisms involved in increasing BMP-4 expression, we used qRT-PCR analysis to examine the effects of adding noggin or DMH1 on the expression of <italic>BMP-4</italic>. We found that the expression levels of both <italic>BMP-4</italic> and <italic>OSR1</italic> were reduced by adding BMP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g005">Figures 5F and I</xref>), suggesting that expression of <italic>BMP-4</italic> is regulated not only by the treatment with CHIR99021 and AM580 or TTNPB, but also by BMP-4 that is secreted from the induced cells, in a positive feedback manner.</p>

<title>The Small Molecule Method Directly Generates IM Cells without the Mesendoderm Step</title>
<p>In the small molecule method, peak induction of OSR1<sup>+</sup> cells occurs around culture day 6, compared to day 10 in the growth factor method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Mae1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g002">Figures 2A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084881.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). We tested the hypothesis that treatment with CHIR99021 and TTNPB generates mesendoderm cells faster than treatment with CHIR99021 and activin A by examining differentiation of BRACHYURY<sup>+</sup> mesendoderm cells after 24, 48, 72, and 96 hrs of each treatment. Surprisingly, while treatment with CHIR99021 and activin A differentiated hiPSCs into BRACHYURY<sup>+</sup> cells at an induction rate &gt;80%, treatment with CHIR99021 and TTNPB resulted in a rate only around 6%, even at the peak time (48 hrs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

The expression levels induced by the TTNPB method were markedly lower than those induced by the growth factor method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that the small molecule method produces IM cells without going through the mesendoderm step.</p>

<p>Notably, we found that the induction of OSR1<sup>+</sup> IM cells by the growth factor method was significantly reduced by the addition of the RAR inhibitor, BMS493, without a concomitant reduction of BRACHYURY<sup>+</sup> cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g006">Figures 6C and D</xref>). Furthermore, expression of <italic>RARB</italic> was detected on day 4 or later in the growth factor method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), which indicates that the induced RA signaling plays an essential role in IM differentiation, not only by the small molecule method but also by the growth factor method. As both CHIR99021 and BMP-7 were used during Stage 2 of the growth factor method, the combination of Wnt, RA, and BMP pathways are involved in the IM differentiation by both methods.</p>
<p>Overall, the results suggest that IM cells can be induced through activation of the Wnt, RA, and BMP pathways, without the mesendoderm step, and that the delay of the RA signal activation might result in the delayed generation of IM cells by the growth factor method as compared to the small molecule method.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Regenerative medicine is associated with high costs and enormous time requirements, because generation of large numbers of targeted cell types is necessary for clinical applications, such as cell therapy, and the efficiency of cell differentiation is generally low. Therefore, rapid, efficient, and relatively low-cost methods for differentiating hiPSCs/ESCs into target cell types are highly desirable. Previous studies differentiated hiPSCs/ESCs into renal lineage cells by combined treatment with activin A, BMP, and RA, but did not report induction rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Batchelder1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Song1">[31]</xref>. We recently developed a method for quantifying the induction rate of IM cells by generating a reporter hiPSC line for OSR1, and subsequently developed a differentiation method for IM cells using growth factors, with an induction rate &gt;90% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Mae1">[19]</xref>. The goal of the present study was to identify small molecules that provide similarly high induction rates, but that are less expensive and more consistently effective than growth factors. We have identified two small molecules, AM580 and TTNPB, that are potent inducers of IM differentiation from hiPSCs, and developed a small molecule differentiation method, using just two chemicals, that is more rapid, more consistently effective, and less expensive than the growth factor method.</p>
<p>The IM cells generated using the small molecule method exhibited a developmental potential to further differentiate into cells of IM-derivative organs, such as the kidneys, adrenal cortex and genitalia both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and form three-dimensional renal tubular structures in an organ culture setting. These findings were similarly observed in the IM cells generated using the growth factor method; however, the frequency of tubular formation in the organ culture samples was much higher in the samples obtained using the small molecule method (approximately 50%) than in those obtained using the growth factor method (approximately 5%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Mae1">[19]</xref>. In addition, the small molecule method more robustly generated IM cells than the growth factor method in terms of the cell number yielded, which is advantageous for the development of regenerative medicine strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g002">Figures 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084881.s002">Figures S2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084881.s005">S5</xref>).</p>
<p>Mouse embryonic tissues at the gastrulation stage are capable of RA synthesis, which occurs preferentially in the node and primitive streak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Hogan1">[50]</xref>, suggesting that RA signaling pathways play some roles in early development. RA treatments have been used to induce pronephric tissues <italic>in vitro</italic> from an animal cap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Brennan1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Osafune2">[25]</xref>, and to induce renal lineage cells from mESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Nishikawa1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Ren1">[28]</xref> and hESCs/iPSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Batchelder1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Song1">[31]</xref>. A recent report has described the involvement of signaling through RAR, but not through RXR, in the mESC differentiation into IM cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Oeda1">[29]</xref>. However, the roles and mechanisms of RA signaling in the differentiation of renal lineage cells have not been fully elucidated, especially in human.</p>
<p>Results of the present study demonstrated that signals through RAR also play an essential role in human IM cell differentiation, that RARβ, one of the three RAR subtypes is involved in the induction process, and that one of the downstream players is the BMP-Smad1/5 pathway, which is known to regulate cell fate decisions of mesoderm tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-James2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-ObaraIshihara1">[33]</xref>. Furthermore, the BMP signaling inhibitors, noggin and DMH1, inhibited IM differentiation and <italic>BMP-4</italic> expression, suggesting that positive feedback mechanisms in the BMP signaling pathways are activated when IM is generated. We also showed that TTNPB and AM580 most efficiently induce IM cells among the retinoids we examined.</p>
<p>It has been reported that all mesoderm and endoderm tissues, including IM, are derived from a common mesendoderm precursor <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Kinder1">[51]</xref> and <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084881-Tada1">[52]</xref>. We first aimed to generate IM cells through the mesendoderm and confirmed that treatment with CHIR99021 alone can induce the differentiation of mesendoderm cells. However, we accidentally found that the addition of TTNPB to CHIR99021 in stage 1 blocked the differentiation of the cells into the mesendoderm. The resultant small molecule method directly induced the differentiation of IM cells without the mesendoderm step by activating the Wnt, RA and BMP signaling pathways. Furthermore, we confirmed that RA signaling plays an essential role in IM differentiation, but not mesendoderm differentiation, in the growth factor method, although the activation of the RA pathway was delayed compared to that observed in the small molecule method. Therefore, we reasoned that the generation of IM cells using the small molecule method requires less time than that performed using the growth factor method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084881-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084881.s002">Figures S2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084881.s005">S5</xref>). Our results also suggest that target cells, including IM cells, can be directly generated from hiPSCs when all of the factors required for differentiation are provided by chemical compounds.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The small molecule method can be used to rapidly, efficiently and consistently produce IM cells from multiple hiPSC/ESC lines without the mesendoderm step at a relatively low cost.
