<abstract>
<p>Population structure and relationship analysis is of great importance in the germplasm utilization and association mapping. Jute, comprised of white jute (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>capsularis</italic> L) and dark jute (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>olitorius</italic> L), is second to cotton in its commercial significance in the world. Here, we assessed the genetic structure and relationship in a panel of 159 jute accessions from 11 countries and regions using 63 SSRs. The structure analysis divided the 159 jute accessions from white and dark jute into Co and Cc group, further into Co1, Co2, Cc1 and Cc2 subgroups. Out of Cc1 subgroup, 81 accessions were from China and the remaining 10 accessions were from India (2), Japan (5), Thailand, Vietnam (2) and Pakistan (1). Out of Cc2 subgroup, 35 accessions were from China, and the remaining 3 accessions were from India, Pakistan and Thailand respectively. It can be inferred that the genetic background of these jute accessions was not always correlative with their geographical regions. Similar results were found in Co1 and Co2 subgroups. Analysis of molecular variance revealed 81% molecular variation between groups but it was low (19%) within subgroups, which further confirmed the genetic differentiation between the two groups. The genetic relationship analysis showed that the most diverse genotypes were Maliyeshengchangguo and Changguozhongyueyin in dark jute, BZ-2-2, Aidianyehuangma, Yangjuchiyuanguo, Zijinhuangma and Jute 179 in white jute, which could be used as the potential parents in breeding programs for jute improvement. These results would be very useful for association studies and breeding in jute.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Jute is a member of the <italic>Corchorus</italic> genus in the Tiliaceae family and is second to cotton in its commercial importance in the world. It is mainly distributed in China, India, Bangladesh and east-central Africa, where it has been grown for several thousand years for natural fiber production [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â€“<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since jute fiber is characterized as an environment-friendly, biodegradable and renewable cellulose fibre, it is called golden fiber.</p>
<p>Although there are nearly 60 species under the <italic>Corchorus</italic>, the commercially cultivated species are white jute (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>capsularis</italic>) and dark jute (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>olitorius</italic>), each of which is a diploid species (2n = 14) [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The origin center of white jute is said to be Indo-Burma while the one of dark jute is Africa using morphological traits [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recently, Kundu et al. (2013) suggested that the two cultivated species of jute originated in Africa using nuclear and chloroplast simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or microsatellites [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although it is not certain how the two cultivated species of jute originated, they are different in terms of growth habitat, disease resistance, and characteristics associated to flowering and silique shape [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, the silique shape of white jute is round, whereas the one of dark jute is long. In addition, the two cultivated species are cross-incompatible possibly due to the presence of a sexual incompatibility barrier [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, to improve jute fiber yield and quality using transgenic or cross-breeding methods, the divergent genotypes in the two cultivated species should be identified.</p>
<p>Currently, some studies on genetic diversity in jute have been carried out with morphological traits [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. But this method is subject to environmental variation and time-consuming. This limitation could be overcome by using molecular markers, which are not influenced by the environment. Among various molecular markers, SSRs have become established as a power tool for genetic diversity studies because SSRs have several desirable characteristics, such as high level of reproducibility, codominant nature and abundance [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â€“<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â€“<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, SSR markers have high level of cross-species transferability for the two different jute species [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, to date SSR markers have been utilized on genetic diversity in jute [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â€“<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â€“<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Huq et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] analyzed the genetic diversity in 16 jute genotypes using 27 SSRs and found that the alleles per locus of jute were 6.33. It was close to the finding of Ghosh et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] using 6 polymorphic SSRs with 63 jute genotypes, but higher than that report by Banerjee et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] involving 172 SSRs with 292 jute accessions. The difference of the alleles per locus among these previous studies may be caused by the differences of tested germplasms. Thereby, it can be seen that different germplasms might have different genetic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Although there were some genetic diversity studies carried out with SSR markers to assess the genetic variation in jute [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â€“<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â€“<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â€“<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], few previous studies involved in the jute accessions from China, especially the local accessions. In recent years, the total yield of jute fiber in China, one of the main producers in the world, has slightly increased from 2003 to 2012 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jute.org/statistics_07.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.jute.org/statistics_07.htm</ext-link>). And South China is said to be one of the origin centers of white jute [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The jute accessions from China had attracted attention because of their commercial importance and breeding value. Hence, additional research is imperative to conduct the genetic structure and relationship analysis of jute germplasm resources, especially involved in Chinese local accessions.</p>
<p>In the present study, we genotyped a panel of 159 jute accessions from 11 countries and regions, out of which originated from Chinese locations account for 81%, using 63 highly polymorphic SSR primers. The objectives of this research were to investigate the population structure and assess the genetic relationship among these jute germplasms.</p>

<p><xref rid="pone.0128195.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0128195.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show the population structure among the 159 jute accessions. Because a sharp peak of <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> appeared at k = 2 (<xref rid="pone.0128195.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), the 159 jute accessions were divided from white and dark jute into two distinct groups (<xref rid="pone.0128195.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), designated as Cc and Co respectively. Among the two distinct groups, the Cc group contained 129 white jute accessions, and the Co group contained 30 dark jute accessions. The classification of the 159 jute accessions from white and dark jute into Co and Cc group suggested that there was significant genetic variation between the two cultivated species of jute. Furthermore, the Cc and Co groups were subdivided into Cc1, Cc2, Co3 and Co4 subgroups respectively (<xref rid="pone.0128195.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The Cc1 subgroup contained 91 accessions. Out of Cc1 subgroup, 81 accessions were from China, and the remaining 10 accessions were from India (2), Japan (5), Thailand, Vietnam (2) and Pakistan (1). The Cc2 subgroup contained 38 accessions, 35 of which were from China, and the remaining 3 accessions were from India, Pakistan and Thailand respectively. The Co1 subgroup contained 3 accessions, 2 of which were accessions from China, and the remaining 1 accession was from Mali. The Co2 subgroup contained 27 accessions, 11 of which were from China, and the remaining 15 accessions were from India (2), Japan (1), Vietnam (2), Pakistan (4), Bangladesh (1), Africa (4) and North America (1). From the location of different genotypes within subgroups, it can be inferred that population structure among these jute accessions might not be affected by genotypes of a particular location.</p>

<p>A summary of the genetic diversity parameters for each group and subgroup are listed in <xref rid="pone.0128195.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The total of polymorphic bands was 211, with an average of 3.4 per primer. Although the sample size of Cc group was four times than that of Co group, there is no obvious difference between the alleles of Cc and Co, which were 198 and 172 respectively. The average locus diversity ranged from 0.037 to 0.770, and the average locus diversity is 0.46. The average polymorphism information content (PIC) value, which is a measure of heterozygosity in the test germplasms, was 0.33. The PIC value was relatively higher (0.35) in group Co than in group Cc (0.30) indicating the allelic diversity in dark jute was greater than that in white jute.</p>

According to the pedigree analysis, Kuanyechangguo is a pure cultivar selected from a cross between Bachang No. 4 and Guangfengchangguo. Out of 30 dark jute accessions, Maliyeshengchangguo is worth mentioning because the lowest average GSC was observed (0.594). The pair of the lowest GSC (0.48) is Maliyeshengchangguo and Cuilv. It indicated that these accessions, like Maliyeshengchangguo and Changguozhongyueyin (0.599), could be used as the potential parents in future breeding programs for dark jute improvement.</p>
<p>Out of Cc group, the GSC ranged from 0.511 to 0.932, with the average of 0.711 (<xref rid="pone.0128195.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0128195.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Among the all pairs of 129 white jute accessions, the GSC of some pairs was high. For example, the GSC of the pairs of Meifeng No. 1 and Meifeng No. 2, Yueyuan No. 2 and Yueyuan No. 4, Shaowuhuangma and C46 were above 0.90. According to the pedigree analysis, most of them are sister-lines. The GSCs of some pairs were low. The pairs, whose GSC were below 0.54, were BZ-2-2 and Yueyuan No. 6, BZ-2-2 and Wuma 1, Yangjuchiyuanguo and Wuma 1, Aidianyehuangma and Minhouhongpi, Jute 179 and Minhouhongpi, Zijinhuangma and Jinshanhuangma, and so on. Among them, BZ-2-2 is worthy to mention because the lowest average GSC was observed. All these results provide potential useful parents, like BZ-2-2, Aidianyehuangma, Yangjuchiyuanguo, Zijinhuangma and Jute 179, for white jute improvement.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since SSRs can be easily detected by PCR, SSRs have been widely used in the analysis of population structure and genetic diversity in jute [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the present study, we assessed the population structure of 159 genotypes using 63 SSRs, which evenly distributed linkage groups in jute. From their geographical regions for cultivation, 81 percent of the 159 jute accessions originated from Chinese location varieties, which is quite different from the previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â€“<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. On the basis of the structure analysis, the 159 accessions from white and dark jute were divided into two distinct groups (Co and Cc), which indicated that significant genetic variation existed in the two cultivated species of jute. This pattern of classification is in agreement with the results in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â€“<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The difference between the two cultivated species might be due to the different origin centers of each species. As reported by Xiong [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], dark jute possibly originated from Africa while white jute originated from the India and South China region. The fact of strong sexual incompatibility barrier between white and dark jute further confirmed it [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, it was also observed that a few accessions in each subgroup that are not in agreement with their geographical origins. That is, the genetic background of the 159 jute accessions was not always correlative with their geographical regions. This phenomenon might be due to germplasm exchange across boundaries. The above results suggest that it is very useful to conduct population structure analysis among a panel of 159 jute accessions, out of which originated from Chinese locations account for 81%.</p>
<p>The genetic diversity parameters for each group suggested that there is relatively much genetic differentiation between the two groups (Cc and Co). This was confirmed by AMOVA, where low level of estimated variation (21%) observed within subgroups compared to four fold (79%) higher variation within groups (<xref rid="pone.0128195.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). It also can be confirmed by the results of tree-based analysis and population structure separately (<xref rid="pone.0128195.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0128195.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). These data suggest that there is a higher level of genetic diversity in dark jute than in white jute. The results of genetic diversity in jute by Banerjee et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Ghosh et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] are in accord with this finding. A higher level of genetic diversity may indicate a higher level of natural outcrossing in plants. As reported by Xiong [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the percentage of natural cross pollination of dark jute (8â€“12%) is a relatively higher than of white jute (3â€“4%). However, the genetic diversity parameters for each subgroup suggested that there was relatively poor genetic difference among the genotypes of subgroup. It can be reflected by the estimates of variation coefficient of GSC. In white jute, coefficient variation of GSC in Cc1 was similar to that in Cc2. This might be a result of germplasm exchange between geographical regions for cultivation. Meanwhile, we observed that coefficient variation of GSC was much higher in Co1 than in Co2 in dark jute (<xref rid="pone.0128195.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) indicating that the genotypes in Co1 have a considerable amount of genetic diversity. This was possibly due to the lowest average GSC (0.594) of Maliyeshengchangguo which is originated from Mali in Africa.</p>
<p>As is known, parental accessions of obvious genetic background difference usually generates an elite variety in the cross-breeding program. Thus, understanding of genetic relationship is critically important for crop improvement [<xref rid="pone.0128195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128195.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The results of GSC (<xref rid="pone.0128195.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) showed that the coefficient of variation of GSC from Co1 (44.48%) was extraordinary diversified among the four different subgroups, that from Co2 (6.873%) was the least, and from Cc1 and Cc2 were placed in the middle (8.87% and 8.95% respectively). To broaden the genetic variation, it is essential to conduct inter-subgroup cross-breeding programs in jute. In this study, the most divergent genotypesâ€”namely, Maliyeshengchangguo and Changguozhongyueyin in dark jute and BZ-2-2, Aidianyehuangma, Yangjuchiyuanguo, Zijinhuangma and Jute 179 in white juteâ€”were identified in GSC analysis, which could be used in cross-breeding programs for jute improvement. Moreover, advanced technologies, such as somatic hybridization and genetic transformation, could be used to overcome the sexual incompatibility barrier between dark and white jute.</p>
