There are numerous examples of polyploidization in the plant kingdom, where chromosome fusions/fissions and rearrangements occurred following speciation. In fact, many modern day diploids are believed to have arisen from ancient polyploidization events (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Ma1">[1]</xref>). Polyploidization is responsible for the emergence of genotypic plasticity, providing polyploids with the ability to tolerate genomic variations better than their diploid progenitors. This dynamic process has been explored in cereal species, which share a monophyletic origin. Although phylogenetic and molecular studies demonstrated large differences in genome size between cereal species, gene number and synteny are conserved (reviewed in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Sandhu1">[2]</xref>). Comparisons at the genetic map level show high genome colinearity conservation between cereal species, occasionally disrupted by gross chromosomal translocations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Devos1">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Polyploid formation places the hybrid under a considerable amount of stress and/or genetic shock, which in turn can leads to a number of genetic and epigenetic modifications. Solely genetic changes include translocations and transpositions as well as sequence deletions and insertions, while epigenetic changes take into account non-additive gene regulation, transposon transcription, silencing or sub-funtionalization of homoeologous genes, and chromatin condensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Chen1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Viegas1">[6]</xref>. Previous studies on wild wheat polyploid relatives, such as <italic>Triticum</italic> and <italic>Aegilops</italic> spp., suggested that the genetic and epigenetic changes that occurred were not random, but rather directed and reproducible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Kashkush1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Shaked1">[11]</xref>. Directed and stable modifications have also been reported in <italic>Brassica</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Song1">[12]</xref> as well as in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Madlung1">[13]</xref>. In the allopolyploid <italic>A. suecica,</italic> a product of hybridization of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. arenosa</italic>, genetic changes involving the loss of one parental-specific rDNA <italic>locus</italic> were observed in both naturally occurring as well as synthetic polyploids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Pontes1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Pontes2">[15]</xref>. Genome rearrangements have also been extensively studied in triticale, a man-made wheat (<italic>Triticum</italic> ssp.)/rye (<italic>Secale cereale</italic> L.) allopolyploid (X <italic>Triticosecale</italic> Wittmack) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Gustafson1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Ma2">[17]</xref>. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses have established the occurrence of genetic and epigenetic modifications in triticale, mostly attributable to the rye parental genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Ma2">[17]</xref>. Moreover, most of the modifications revealed by AFLP occurred to a greater degree immediately after hybridization, especially concerning sequences from rye origin, compared to the continuous variation events that occurred at a very small rate following chromosome duplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Ma3">[18]</xref>. Using the same techniques on newly formed polyploids of <italic>Aegilops</italic> and <italic>Triticum</italic>, rapid alterations of chromosome- and genome-specific sequences were demonstrated, with the preferential loss of parental bands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Liu1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Ozkan1">[9]</xref>. It must be emphasized here that both AFLP and RFLP analyses were performed utilizing non-methylation and methylation sensitive restriction enzymes, thereby uncovering differences which cannot be attributable solely to sequence modifications.</p><p>The exact level of DNA sequence restructuring events involved in this important evolutionary process remains to be determined. In addition, precise information regarding the actual sequences involved is scarce. In order to better understand the genomic processes underlying polyploidization, microsatellite and retrotransposon PCR-based molecular marker techniques were utilized to evaluate exclusively genetic rearrangements in triticale. Microsatellites, or Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), are polymorphic <italic>loci</italic> present in nuclear DNA that consist of repeating units of 1–6 base pairs in length. They are typically neutral, co-dominant and widely spread throughout the genome. Retrotransposons are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, being the main constituent of large plant genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Vitte1">[19]</xref>. These transposable genetic elements require the action of reverse transcriptase on an RNA intermediate to integrate in the host genome by a ´copy and pasté method of transposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Kumar1">[20]</xref>. They are conventionally divided into groups, depending whether or not they possess long terminal repeats (LTRs). The LTR retrotransposons are further classified into the <italic>Ty1- copia</italic> and <italic>Ty3-gypsy</italic> families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001402-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Due to their dynamics and mobility, it is widely accepted that these elements generate molecular modifications and increase genome size, and therefore have an important role in genome evolution and speciation. Actually, an increase in Retrotransposon-related transcripts has been detected in both wheat and Arabidopsis synthetic polyploids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Kashkush1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Madlung1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Adams1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Kashkush2">[22]</xref>, although actual transposition of these elements has never been proved in newly synthesized polyploids.</p><fig id="pone-0001402-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001402.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structural features of <italic>copia</italic> and <italic>gypsy</italic> retrotransposons.</title><p>LTR, long terminal repeat; Gag, core structural protein genes; PR, protease; RT, reverse transcriptase; INT, integrase; PBS, primer binding site; PPT, polypurine tract; DR, direct repeat; IR, inverted repeat (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Kumar1">[20]</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001402.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>In this study, we demonstrate that Inter Retrotransposons Amplified Polymorphism (IRAP), Retrotransposons Microsatellite Amplified Polymorphism (REMAP), and Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) are powerful tools for polyploid analysis.

These techniques also permitted the isolation of restructured fragments for sequence analysis, unambiguously demonstrating that repetitive and coding sequences are involved in the evolutionary process mediated by polyploidization. FISH for chromosome mapping of sequences associated to the retrotransposon Nikita and/or to the microsatellite (CT)9G showed these to be widely distributed throughout all rye chromosomes, with preferential localization in major heterochromatic domains, suggesting that chromatin condensation plays an important role in polyploid evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>IRAP, REMAP and ISSR profiles enhance wheat and rye phylogenetic relationships</title><p>To test if the IRAP, REMAP and ISSR techniques constitute efficient tools to evaluate genomic rearrangements within allopolyploid triticale, we initially analyzed the banding profiles obtained with different primer combinations in wheat and rye parental plants. Seven primer combinations were tested with IRAP and REMAP using the primer for the LTR sequence of the barley retrotransposon Nikita by itself as well as combined with three LTR primers from additional barley retrotransposons (Sabrina, Sukkula, and Stowaway), and with three anchored microsatellite primers (GA)9C, (CT)9G, and (CA)9G (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001402-t001">Table 1</xref>). ISSR banding profiles were obtained for all three di-nucleotide repeats. In order to reduce the potential number of fragments amplified and obtain consistent, easily analyzable and reproducible banding patterns, a single LTR primer from each retrotransposon was utilized on all IRAP and REMAP combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001402-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The banding profiles yielded a considerable number of distinct and reproducible bands in all the lines and for all primer combinations analyzed. Only bands between 100 and 1650 bp were scored, as this gel region produced the highest quality profiles, allowing for discrimination of major bands against a low background. Qualitative differences between profiles and minor non-reproducible IRAP, REMAP and ISSR bands were not considered. Differences in intensities between bands were obvious within the same species for each primer combination but did not show any direct relation with the size of the amplified fragment.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0001402-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001402.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Primers used for PCR analysis.</title></caption><!--===== Grouping alternate versions of objects =====--><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0001402-t001-1" mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001402.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><table><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Primer</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Sequence</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>LTR</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Barley Retrotransposon</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">C0699</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Nikita</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CGCTCCAGCGGTACTGCC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">C0945</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Sabrina</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GCAAGCTTCCGTTTCCGC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">9900</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Sukkula</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GATAGGGTCGCATCTTGGGCGTGAC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Stowaway</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Stowaway</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CTTATATTTAGGAACGGAGGGAGT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>SSR</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">(GA)9C</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">5′-GAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">(CT)9G</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">5′-CTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">(CA)9G</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">5′-CACACACACACACACACAG</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><fig id="pone-0001402-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001402.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Principles of the IRAP, REMAP and ISSR procedures.</title><p>IRAP: LTR primers (white arrows) facing outward from the ends of LTRs will amplify intervening DNA from retrotransposons or loose LTRs in opposite orientations.

However, profiles resulting from combinations of primers did not necessarily result in additive profiles of reactions in which each primer is used alone. For instance, the entire banding pattern obtained with primer Nikita was not observed in the other IRAP and REMAP reactions where this primer was utilized in combination with other microsatellite or retrotransposon primer. Since the results obtained from three technical replicates for each PCR experiment were identical the amplification products obtained in each reaction seem therefore to represent a reproducible competition between the primer and its binding sites for each specific reaction mixture. Analyzing banding profiles of all the reactions tested resulted in the following maximum and minimum number of bands: (i) IRAP and REMAP bands observed in wheat and rye ranged between a minimum of four in wheat (primer combination Nikita/Stowaway) and a maximum of thirteen in rye (primer combination Nikita/Sukkula); (ii) the number of monomorphic bands ranged between zero (primer combination Nikita/(CT)9G) and seven (primer combinations Nikita/Sukkula and Nikita/(CA)9G); (iii) with ISSR, the number of bands observed in wheat and rye ranged between a minimum of four in rye (with primer (CA)9G) and a maximum of fourteen in rye (with primer (GA)9C), with the number of monomorphic bands ranging between zero (with primer (CA)9G) and seven (with primer (GA)9C).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Parental genomic rearrangements in triticale</title><p>Since the parental materials were strictly inbred over many years, any genomic changes revealed in the triticale should be directly related to genome responses to polyploidization. In fact, genomic rearrangements were observed as non-additive IRAP, REMAP and ISSR banding profiles in triticale compared to those of the wheat and rye parental species. All seven IRAP and REMAP and two of the three ISSR primer combinations showed the occurrence of rearrangements in triticale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001402-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001402-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001402-t003">3</xref>) which resulted from the loss of parental bands in triticale or, conversely, novel bands appearing in the allopolyploid that were not seen in the parental genomes. Moreover, the presence in the banding profile obtained with primer Nikita for the parental genome mixture (Supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001402.s002">Figure S2</xref>) of the triticale rearranged bands (lost parental bands), confirmed that the genome modifications revealed resulted from polyplidization. On the other hand, to evaluate if the restructuring events detected in the polyploid genotype were present in all plants analyzed, IRAP utilizing primer Nikita was performed with DNA extracted from three triticale plants (Supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001402.s001">Figure S1</xref>) .The individual banding profiles clearly demonstrated no differences between individuals, indicating that triticale plants are stable for the molecular markers selected.</p><p>To evaluate the frequency of genome rearrangements in triticale, the number of polymorphic wheat and rye bands was added to the number of monomorphic bands (a band present in both parental profiles was counted only once), and the result was compared with the number of bands observed in triticale profiles. These calculations demonstrated that only 73% (69 bands observed/94 expected) of the parental bands were conserved in triticale with IRAP and REMAP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001402-t002">Table 2</xref>), and 77% (37 bands observed /48 expected) with ISSR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001402-t003">Table 3</xref>). Out of the seven IRAP and REMAP primer combinations analyzed, a total of twenty-nine rearrangements were detected in triticale, representing the loss of five wheat origin bands (17%) and twenty rye origin bands (69%), as well as the appearance of four novel bands (14%) not seen in either parental species. The rearranged bands observed with the seven IRAP and REMAP experiments were as follows: (i) IRAP with primer Nikita resulted in the loss of one band from rye, the loss of one band from wheat and the appearance of one novel band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001402-g003">Figure 3c</xref>); (ii) primer combination Nikita/Sabrina resulted in the loss of four bands from rye and the loss of one band from wheat; (iii) with IRAP primer combination Nikita/Sukkula the loss of two bands from rye and the loss of one band from wheat was observed; (iv) IRAP utilizing primer combination Nikita/Stowaway resulted in the loss of three bands from rye and the loss of one band from wheat; (v) REMAP utilizing primer combination Nikita/(GA)9C resulted in the loss of two bands from rye and the appearance of one novel band; (vi) primer combination Nikita/(CT)9G revealed the loss of five bands from rye, the loss of one band from wheat and the appearance of two novel bands in triticale; and (vii) primer combination Nikita/(CA)9G indicated the loss of three rye origin bands in triticale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001402-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). Thirteen rearranged bands were identified in triticale with the three ISSR primers tested, corresponding to loss of one wheat origin band (8%) and from the loss of ten rye origin bands (77%) and the occurrence of two novel bands (15%) not present in either of the parental species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001402-t003">Table 3</xref>). The rearranged bands observed with the three ISSR experiments were as follows: (i) ISSR with primer (GA)9C resulted in the loss of six bands from rye and the appearance of one novel band; and (ii) primer (CT)9G indicated the loss of four bands from rye, one band from wheat and the appearance of one novel band in the triticale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001402-g003">Figure 3d</xref>).</p><p>Analyzing the total number of IRAP, REMAP and ISSR rearrangements clearly indicated that the loss of parental bands in triticale occurred much more frequently (43%) than the appearance of novel bands (7%), (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001402-t004">Table 4</xref>). Amongst triticale lost bands, most involved rye specific bands (10 from IRAP, 10 from REMAP and 10 from ISSR reactions), comparing to the loss of six wheat specific bands (4 from IRAP; 1 from REMAP and 1 from ISSR reactions). The loss of a monomorphic band (common to wheat and rye progenitors) was never observed in triticale. Conversely, a total of six novel bands were detected in the allopolyploid with the molecular markers used (1 with IRAP, 3 with REMAP and 2 with ISSR, respectively).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0001402-t004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001402.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Summary of rearrangements identified in triticale by IRAP, REMAP, and ISSR.</title></caption><!--===== Grouping alternate versions of objects =====--><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0001402-t004-4" mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001402.t004" xlink:type="simple"/><table><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Polymorphic bands observed</td><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Rearranged bands (% of observed)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Eliminated</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Novel</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">TOTAL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>IRAP</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">29</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">14 (48%)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1 (3%)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>15 (52%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>REMAP</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">24</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">11 (46%)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">3 (13%)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>14 (58%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>ISSR</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">30</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">11 (37%)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2 (7%)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>13 (43%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Total</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">83</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">36 (43%)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">6 (7%)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>42 (51%)</bold></td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sequences analysis of polyploid rearranged bands</title><p>Three rearranged fragments uncovered in triticale arising from IRAP and REMAP with three different primer combinations were gel-isolated, purified and cloned for sequence analysis.

In this study, large scale screening of retrotransposon and microsatellite rich genomic regions using IRAP, REMAP, and ISSR uncovered reproducible polyploidization induced DNA rearrangements, measured as the lack of additive parental banding profiles in triticale. Nine of the ten IRAP, REMAP and ISSR primer combinations tested disclosed rearranged fragments. Only ISSR with primer (CA)9G produced a completely additive banding profile. Taken together, IRAP and REMAP with seven primer combinations and ISSR with three di-nucleotide sequences resulted in a total of 83 bands in the polyploid genotype, and 42 DNA sequence rearrangement events (51%). Of these, 36 corresponded to the loss of parental bands and 6 to the emergence of novel ones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001402-t004">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, the intensities of monomorphic bands did not significantly differ between wheat and rye, suggesting that either the number of amplified <italic>loci</italic> or tandem repeats per <italic>locus</italic> are conserved between the two species. Using those markers we identified a higher proportion of rearrangements in triticale than the one observed in previous studies which is moreover exclusively associated with sequence modifications. Previous studies of polyploids using RFLP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Ozkan1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Ma2">[17]</xref> and AFLP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Ma2">[17]</xref> identified both genetic and epigenetic genome restructuring events, since cytosine methylation sensitive as well as non-sensitive restriction enzymes were used.</p><p>To our knowledge, IRAP and REMAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Baumel1">[25]</xref> and ISSR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Baumel2">[26]</xref> have only been used once for polyploid analysis, when it was shown that parental genomes were highly conserved in the natural allopolyploid <italic>Spartina anglica</italic>. However, these molecular marker techniques designed by Kalendar and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Kalendar1">[27]</xref> to characterize cultivars and varieties in several species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Kalendar1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Smykal1">[29]</xref>, not only provide an original approach to detect genetic rearrangements induced by polyploidization, but also contribute to a greater resolution of the specific sequences affected by polyploidy evolutionary process. The control experiment we designed with the wheat+rye test tube indeed reinforces that this technique is accurate in evaluating genomic restructuring events and detecting rearranged bands induced by polyplidization. Three rearranged fragments, representing the loss of a wheat parental band, loss of a rye parental band, and the appearance of a novel band in triticale were excised, purified and cloned for sequence analysis. The wheat-specific band (Mob-11-1200W) absent in triticale and obtained with IRAP showed significant homologies with sequences of <italic>T. monococcum</italic> (chromosome 7), <italic>T. aestivum</italic> cv Renan, <italic>copia</italic>-like retrotransposons previously identified in <italic>Triticum</italic>, namely <italic>Claudia</italic>, <italic>Barbara</italic>, <italic>T. monococcum</italic> 7Am (unnamed retrotransposon) and <italic>Ty1-copia</italic> from <italic>O. sativa</italic>. Alignment data further revealed this clone to be fragmented by the insertion of three different <italic>copia</italic>-like retrotransposons, and showed a 13 nucleotide polypurine-tract (PPT), which serves as a putative priming site for plus strand DNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Perlman1">[30]</xref>. A four nucleotide inverted repeat (TTGT) different to that of <italic>Ty1</italic>-<italic>copia</italic> and <italic>Barbara</italic> retrotransposons (TTGA) was identified immediately after the PPT region, indicating the presence of two classes of <italic>copia</italic> elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Berenyi1">[31]</xref>. This clone could therefore represent a partial sequence of a retrotransposon with similarity to other elements, suggesting the occurrence of recombination events between partial sequences of single or multiple retroelements and/or families of retrotransposons. The rearranged rye fragment (Mob-111-1000R) absent in triticale and obtained by REMAP revealed homology with hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP) from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>O. sativa</italic>. HRGP belong to a major family of inducible defence response proteins involved in the natural resistance of plants to injury, disease and various stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Corbin1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Wycoff1">[33]</xref>. Perhaps the absence of this sequence in triticale is somehow related to its lower level of hardiness when compared to rye. The third sequence, isolated by REMAP, representing a novel band in triticale was found to be mostly microsatellite related, suggesting that polyploidization affected the number of these types of repetitive sequences.</p><p>The sequencing data provided important insights into which genomic sequences are involved in polyploidization induced modifications and cereal speciation. Retrotransposon-related genome rearrangements disclosed in this work were not restricted to non-coding regions, supporting the model proposed by Vitte and Panaud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Vitte1">[19]</xref>, where the organization of large plant genomes includes extensive heterochromatin blocks mainly composed of retrotransposons interspersed with gene-rich regions. During polyploidization, there may be a directed and controlled loss of coding sequences, a process believed to be necessary to overcome gene redundancy and achieve genetic diploidization. Accordingly, Southern blotting with probes to different genes indicated gene loss in synthetic allopolyploids of <italic>Triticum</italic> and <italic>Aegilops</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Kashkush1">[7]</xref>.Our banding profiles and sequencing results with LTR- and/or microsatellite-associated sequences suggest a direct role of retrotransposons in gene loss events. Although transcriptional activation of retrotransposons has been previously reported in wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Kashkush1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Kashkush2">[22]</xref> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Madlung1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Adams1">[21]</xref>, transposition of these elements has never been shown in newly synthesized polyploids.</p><p>The vast majority of rearrangements uncovered in the polyploid genotype corresponded to the loss of parental bands (86%, 36 out of 42, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001402-t004">Table 4</xref>). This loss seems to have originated from sequence modification/elimination rather than a mutation in PCR primer binding sequences, since extensive sequencing of the LTR termini has shown that mutations are rare in these regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Suoniemi1">[34]</xref>. Moreover, studies on C values of various polyploids have indicated that genome downsizing might be a widespread phenomenon following polyploidy formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Leitch1">[35]</xref>, and recently a reduction in DNA content was observed in six newly synthesized wheat allopolyploids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Ozkan2">[10]</xref>. Our results suggest that the decrease of DNA content previously reported in the course of triticale breeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Boyko1">[36]</xref> can be attributed to significant loss of retrotransposon and/or microsatellite flanking sequences. Our data showing that the majority of the missing bands in triticale corresponded to rye-specific bands (30 out of 36 lost bands), confirms previous data about the preferential occurrence of restructuring events in this parental genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Ma2">[17]</xref>. This brings to mind the observed deletion of rye telomeric heterochromatin regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Merker1">[37]</xref> responsible for the meiotic pairing failure and cytological instability of triticale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Bennett1">[38]</xref>. Also reminiscent, albeit on another scale, is the preferential loss of 2R rye chromosome (the rye chromosome with greater DNA content) which usually results in more stable triticale plants with better agronomic characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Gustafson1">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Chromosome mapping with FISH on rye meristematic cells showed. REMAP products to be dispersed throughout the rye genome, but completely absent from centromeric domains and nucleolar organizing regions. Dot-like FISH signals clearly demonstrated that the labeled sequences were tandemly arranged and clustered, with marked accumulation in condensed sub-telomeric domains, suggesting their putative role in the establishment of terminal heterochromatin. The preferential disposition of FISH signals on telomeric domains is further enhanced by the Rabl organization of rye interphase nuclei, where major heterochromatic telomeric domains localize to one hemisphere. This disposition is similar to that observed for conserved domains of the <italic>Ty1-copia</italic>, <italic>Ty3-gypsy</italic> and <italic>LINE</italic> groups of retroelements on <italic>Ae. speltoides</italic>, and less obvious in <italic>H. spontaneum</italic>, probably due to the absence of telomeric heterochromatic domains in this species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Belyayev1">[39]</xref>.</p><p>Differences in genome size, genetic redundancy and chromatin organization patterns between wheat and rye certainly resulted in genomic conflicts in the newly formed polyploid. In the triticale nucleus, rye has a greater haploid DNA content when compared to that of each genome complement from the hexaploid wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Bennett2">[40]</xref>. Most likely, the preferential elimination of LTR and microsatellite-related sequences from rye played a role in homogenizing parental genomic DNA content. As previously mentioned, cytogenetic mapping of triticale showed dense heterochromatic domains in rye, with a high density of heterochromatin in sub-telomeric regions, that is not characteristic in wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Neves1">[41]</xref>. On the other hand, structural alterations in chromosome condensation often activate mechanisms such as DNA recombination and/or damage repair, leading to sequence excision/modification, as recently described in Drosophila mutant lines for genes coding chromatin remodeling enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001402-Peng1">[42]</xref>. Our molecular and cytogenetic results not only show the power of REMAP, IRAP and ISSR in uncovering polyploidization induced genetic restructuring events, but also allow for interesting interpretations regarding the genomic processes involved. It is tempting to speculate for instance that Retrotransposons -rich rye heterochromatic domains when present in triticale loose their capacity to remain condensed, allowing for the occurrence of changes in retrotransposon and microsattelite flanking sequences, essential for polyploid stability. The involvement of chromatin organization brings us back to the role of epigenetics on genetic adaptation and speciation. Future work will undoubtedly shed light into the complex interactions that occur between genetic and epigenetic events, and their role in molecular evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant material and DNA isolation</title><p>The following plant material was used: synthetic octaploid primary triticale, (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> ‘Chinese Spring’×<italic>Secale cereale</italic> ‘Imperial’; 2n = 8x, AABBDDRR) at least 35 generations old, and their exact progenitors, hexaploid wheat <italic>T. aestivum</italic> ‘Chinese Spring’ (2n = 6x, AABBDD), and diploid rye <italic>S. cereale</italic> ‘Imperial’ (2n = 2x, RR).
