<abstract>
<p>Embryogenesis in placental mammals is sustained by exquisite interplay between the embryo proper and placenta. <italic>UTF1</italic> is a developmentally regulated gene expressed in both cell lineages. Here, we analyzed the consequence of loss of the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene during mouse development. We found that homozygous <italic>UTF1</italic> mutant newborn mice were significantly smaller than wild-type or heterozygous mutant mice, suggesting that placental insufficiency caused by the loss of <italic>UTF1</italic> expression in extra-embryonic ectodermal cells at least in part contributed to this phenotype. We also found that the effects of loss of <italic>UTF1</italic> expression in embryonic stem cells on their pluripotency were very subtle. Genome structure and sequence comparisons revealed that the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene exists only in placental mammals. Our analyses of a family of genes with homology to UTF1 revealed a possible mechanism by which placental mammals have evolved the <italic>UTF1</italic> genes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During embryogenesis in placental (eutherian) mammals, cell division that gives rise to two cell lineages occurs around the formation of the blastocyst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Fleming1">[1]</xref>. One of these constituents, the inner cell mass (ICM), gives rise to the entire embryo proper and some portions of the extra-embryonic tissues, while the other constituent, trophectoderm, is exclusively involved in the generation of extra-embryonic tissues. The placenta, one of the major extra-embryonic tissues, is a complex tissue comprising the allantoic/chorionic mesoderm, parietal/visceral endoderm, and chorionic ectoderm that is one of the derivatives of trophectoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Rossant1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Rossant2">[4]</xref>. The placenta plays many important roles in nurturing the embryo, including the exchange of gases, nutrients and wastes between the embryo and its mother’s body. The placenta is also known to be an important source of hormones and growth factors involved in sustaining pregnancy.</p>
<p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are established from the ICM, and are capable of growing indefinitely in culture while preserving their pluripotency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Evans1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Martin1">[6]</xref>. Since their discovery, ESCs have contributed greatly to progressing our understanding of embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Evans2">[7]</xref>. As a result of defining transcription factors that play critical roles in preservation of pluripotency, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Takahashi1">[8]</xref>. However, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie development of the placenta. The <italic>Sox2</italic> gene encodes one of the reprogramming factors used to generate iPSCs, which is strongly expressed in pluripotent early embryonic cells and extra-embryonic ectodermal cells (the immediate precursor of chorionic ectoderm), as well as in neural stem/progenitor cells. Moreover, gene targeting analyses have revealed a cell-autonomous requirement for Sox2 to preserve the undifferentiated characteristics of all three cell lineages that express <italic>Sox2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Avilion1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Favaro1">[12]</xref>. The <italic>UTF1</italic> gene is widely recognized as one of the strict pluripotency marker genes, but its expression is not restricted to pluripotent embryonic cells. Similar to <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>UTF1</italic> is also expressed in extra-embryonic ectodermal cells but not in neural progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Okuda1">[13]</xref>. Recently, a new role of UTF1 in pluripotent cells has been uncovered, in which UTF1 limits bivalent gene silencing by preventing excessive PRC2 loading and H3K27 trimethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Jia1">[14]</xref>. However, the biological consequence of loss of <italic>UTF1</italic> in ESCs was not well defined in the previous study. Moreover, knockout mouse studies examining the roles of UTF1 in mouse development, including its role in other <italic>UTF1</italic>-expressing cells, i.e., extra-embryonic ectodermal cells, have not yet been performed.</p>
<p>Here, we used targeted disruption of the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene to examine its roles in mouse embryogenesis. We show that UTF1 is not essential for the entire process of embryogenesis. However, a <italic>UTF1</italic>-null background leads to a developmental delay in mid-gestation embryos and newborn mice. Our data suggest that placental insufficiency incurred by the loss of <italic>UTF1</italic> expression in extra-embryonic ectodermal cells at least in part contributes to this developmentally delayed phenotype. Genome sequence and structural analyses revealed that the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene exists only in placental mammals, and is not present even in the most closely related mammals (i.e. marsupials). Thus, we propose that <italic>UTF1</italic> has evolved to advance eutherian embryogenesis that strongly depends on placental function.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Construction of <italic>UTF1</italic>-targeting Vectors</title>
<p>Genomic clones carrying the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene were isolated from the mouse 129 SVJ λFixII library (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequence at the translation initiation site (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GG<underline>ATG</underline>C-3′</named-content>) was changed to provide a NcoI site (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CC<underline>ATG</underline>G-3′</named-content>) to facilitate subcloning. A targeting vector for the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene was designed to remove the region encoding from the 1<sup>st</sup> initiating methionine to the 168<sup>th</sup> amino acid to render the remaining region encoding from the 169<sup>th</sup> to 339<sup>th</sup> amino acid nonfunctional because of insertion of a drug resistance gene containing a stop codon, and a poly(A) addition signal preceded the remaining region. To construct targeting vectors, 5′ (2.9 kb BamHI-NcoI fragment) and 3′ (2.4 kb NotI-BglII fragment) homologous arms of the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene were cloned into a pBluescript (Stratagene)-based vector carrying the negative selection <italic>TK</italic> gene together with either the Neo-poly(A) cassette (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The targeting vectors bearing either Bsd-poly(A) or puro-poly(A) cassettes were also constructed for electroporation-mediated sequential disruption of UTF1 loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>ESC Culture, Transfection, and Screening</title>
<p>To generate <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant ESCs by gene targeting, E14 ESCs were first adapted to a feeder-free condition as described by Niwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Niwa1">[15]</xref>. Then, feeder-free cultured ESCs were transduced with the linearized targeting vector containing a blasticidin-resistance gene by electroporation, and then treated with 5 µg/ml blasticidin S. After selection of correctly targeted ESC clones, the linearized targeting vector containing a puromycin-resistance gene was transduced to disrupt the remaining wild-type allele of the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene. Southern blot and PCR analyses were performed using the probes and primers described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s002">Figure S2A</xref> to identify <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant clones among ESC clones that were resistant to both blasticidin S and puromycin. To generate <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutant ESCs for blastocyst injection, the linearized targeting vector containing a neomycin resistance gene was transduced into E14 ESCs cultured on mitomycin C-treated MEFs. Correctly targeted ESC clones were then selected among G418-resistant clones by Southern blot analyses using the probes shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s001">Figure S1A</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>In vitro Differentiation of ESCs</title>
<p>To examine the differentiation propensity, <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous and homozygous mutant ESCs were subjected to embryoid body formation as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Nishimoto1">[16]</xref>. RNAs were recovered from differentiation-induced or uninduced ESCs, reverse transcribed, and then analyzed by real-time PCR using Taqman probes according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>Immunostaining was performed using the following primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions: anti-UTF1 (1∶100) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Okuda1">[13]</xref>, anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) (1∶50) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Oct-4 (1∶400) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Nanog (1∶200) (ReproCell), anti-nestin (1∶400) (Beckton-Dickinson), and anti-TujI (1∶500) (Convance). These antibodies were used in combination with appropriate Alexa Fluor dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Cells were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma).</p>
<sec id="s2d1">
<title>Establishment of iPSCs from MEFs and ESCs from blastocysts</title>
<p>iPSC induction was performed as described by Takahashi and Yamanaka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Takahashi1">[8]</xref> and establishment of ESCs from blastocysts was conducted according to a method by Bryja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Bryja1">[17]</xref>, except under a feeder-free condition.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Generation of <italic>UTF1</italic> Homozygous Mutant Mice</title>
<p><italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutant ESCs were injected into blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Chimeras were bred to generate F1 heterozygous mutant mice that were backcrossed with wild-type female or male C57BL/6J mice over 10 generations before intercrossing between heterozygous mutant mice to generate <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant mice.</p>

<title>Chimeric Mouse Analyses of <italic>UTF1</italic> Homozygous Mutant ESCs</title>
<p><italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant ESCs generated from blastocysts obtained by intercrossing between <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutant mice were labeled with fluorescent Kusabira orange protein. The labeled ESCs were injected into blastocysts that were transferred into surrogate mice.

<title>Genomic DNA Data Analyses</title>
<p>All genomic DNA sequence data were collected from the Ensemble Genome Database and NCBI database. We noted that the opossum genome sequence data had two small gaps in the region subjected to our analyses, whereas the wallaby genome sequence lacked the entire portion. To fill in the two gaps present in the opossum assembly, oligonucleotide sets were designed to amplify these two gaps using available database information. These primers were used for PCR with the opossum genome as a template, and then the DNA sequences of the PCR products were determined. To obtain the wallaby sequence, BAC DNA (clone 411E1) bearing the <italic>KNDC1</italic> gene was pulled out from the Me_KBa (Arizona Genome Institute, USA) library panel using overgos designed for KNDC1 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GTTTACTGTGTGGCAGCCATACTG-3′</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-ATTTAGCTGCGGTCCACAG TATGG-3′</named-content>). After confirmation of the presence of the <italic>VENTX</italic> gene in the BAC DNA by PCR and chromosomal location by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization on wallaby metaphase chromosomes as described by Deakin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Deakin1">[18]</xref>, the entire DNA sequence was determined by shotgun sequencing. In this process, available opossum and wallaby genomic sequences were used as references for localization of the determined sequences. VISTA sequence alignment was performed using the VISTA program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-gsd.lbl.gov/vista" xlink:type="simple">http://www-gsd.lbl.gov/vista</ext-link>) based on the sequences obtained from the Ensemble Genome Database and NCBI database. For phylogenetic analyses, the sequences of <italic>UTF1</italic> (human, and mouse), <italic>ZCAN20</italic> (human, horse, elephant, cow, pig, opossum, and platypus), <italic>ZSCAN20-like</italic> (opossum, Tasmanian devil, and platypus) and <italic>ZSCAN29</italic> (human, and platypus) were aligned using Clustal W software with manual corrections. The number of nucleotide differences per site (<italic>p</italic>-distance) was then calculated using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Tamura1">[19]</xref> for evolution analysis. A neighbor-joining tree analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Saitou1">[20]</xref> was performed in MEGA using pairwise deletion for gaps/missing data.</p>

<title>Developmental Delay of the <italic>UTF1</italic> Knockout Embryo</title>
<p>To explore the role of the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene in development, we generated <italic>UTF1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s001">Figure S1</xref>). <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutant ESCs were used to produce chimeric mice. Heterozygous intercrosses yielded homozygous mutant embryos within the range of expected Mendelian ratios during gestational stages, suggesting that loss of UTF1 in mouse pluripotent cells does not eliminate their multi-lineage differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s008">Table S1</xref>). However, most of the <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant mice died within a day after birth and none survived for more than 2 days. Newborn <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant mice were significantly smaller than wild-type and heterozygous mutant mice at birth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s008">Table S1</xref>). Growth retardation of <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant mice became evident at the mid-gestational stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). However, a comparison between mutant embryos at different stages showed that they continued to increase in size, suggesting that this small phenotype does not reflect a blockade of development at specific embryonic stages, but is due to retardation of the developmental progression rate.</p>

<p>To detect any abnormality in the organs of <italic>UTF1</italic>-null mouse embryos, sections of wild-type and <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant embryos were prepared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We observed no abnormalities in any tissue, except for the heart at 14.5 dpc, which was covered with a myocardial layer that was significantly thinner than that of wild-type embryos. However, by 16.5 days, the thickness of the myocardial layer of mutant embryos became equivalent to that of the wild-type embryo at 14.5 dpc (data not shown), which was consistent with the delay in the development process of mutant mice. We also used Alizarin and Alcian blue staining to demonstrate a delay in the replacement of cartilaginous ribs with ossified ribs in mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This observation can be also explained by the developmental delay in mutant embryos.</p>

<title>Developmental Delay of the <italic>UTF1</italic> Homozygous Mutant Placenta</title>
<p><italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutations provoke a developmental delay that becomes apparent at the mid-gestational stage. However, expression of the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene is abruptly silenced during gastrulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Okuda1">[13]</xref>, and no <italic>UTF1</italic> expression is evident in mid-gestation embryos except for primordial germ cells (PGCs). We previously showed that <italic>UTF1</italic> is also expressed in extra-embryonic ectodermal cells as well as in pluripotent early embryonic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Okuda1">[13]</xref>. Here, we also found that <italic>UTF1</italic> expression was readily detectable in wild-type 12.5 dpc placentas by immunohistochemical analyses, but UTF1 was undetectable at 14.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, our data showed that UTF1 was expressed in trophoblast stem cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Because hypotrophy of the placenta is one of the major causes of intra-uterine growth restriction syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Yang1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Mari1">[22]</xref>, a general delay in growth and development of homozygous null embryos can be explained by placental insufficiency. Consistent with this possibility, we found that the <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant placenta was significantly smaller than the wild-type placenta at 14.5 dpc, but continuously enlarged and, therefore, size of <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant placenta at 16.5 dpc was comparable to wild-type at 14.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous null placenta was also less mitotically active as revealed by analyses of phosphorylated histone H3 that marks mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Detailed histological inspection revealed the glycogen trophoblast cell layer in 16.5 dpc (but not 14.5 dpc) <italic>UTF1</italic> mutant placentas, demonstrating their equivalent developmental stage to that of 14.5 dpc wild-type embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Pennisi1">[23]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

<title>Phenotypes of Homozygous <italic>UTF1</italic> Knockout Mice Depend on their Genetic Background</title>

We then used these <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutant mice with a C57BL/6J (25%) and ICR (75%) background to generate <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant mice. Surprisingly, we found that the <italic>UTF1</italic>-null mice generated after these procedures were viable and fertile, unlike <italic>UTF1</italic>-null mice generated from mice with a complete C57BL/6J background.

<title>Acquisition of Pluripotency with the <italic>UTF1</italic>-null Background</title>
<p>Generation of viable mouse pups with the <italic>UTF1</italic>-null background was rather unexpected because UTF1 has been demonstrated to play important roles in pluripotency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Jia1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-vandenBoom1">[26]</xref> by analyses of ESCs. To scrutinize the roles of UTF1 in ESCs, we first examined whether there is any bias in generating <italic>UTF1</italic>-null ESCs from <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutant ESCs rather than generating heterozygous mutants from wild-type ESCs by electroporation-mediated disruption of the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene with the targeting vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We found that at least no strong bias existed to disrupt the second <italic>UTF1</italic> allele compared with that of the first allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Nanog is one of the major pluripotency factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Chambers1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Mitsui1">[28]</xref>, and is dispensable for maintaining, but essential for acquiring pluripotency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Chambers2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Silva1">[30]</xref>. Therefore, we decided to explore the possibility of crucial involvement of <italic>UTF1</italic> in establishing pluripotency. To this end, we examined whether <italic>UTF1</italic>-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) can serve as somatic cells to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by transduction of defined transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Takahashi1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Takahashi2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Yu1">[32]</xref>.

Consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Jia1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-vandenBoom1">[26]</xref>, we found that the expression levels of Oct3/4 and Nanog in <italic>UTF1</italic>-null ESCs and iPSCs were comparable with those in wild-type ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, we confirmed the ability of <italic>UTF1</italic>-null iPSCs to generate teratomas with all three germ layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Acquisition of pluripotency by <italic>UTF1</italic>-knockout homozygotes.</title>
<p>(A) Comparison of the frequency between knockouts of first and second alleles in serial <italic>UTF1</italic> gene targeting. A <italic>UTF1-</italic>targeting vector carrying the puromycin resistance gene was introduced into wild-type and <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutant ESCs bearing the blasticidin resistance gene in one of the <italic>UTF1</italic> loci by electroporation, and were then selected with medium containing puromycin only or puromycin and blasticidin, respectively. Genomic DNAs were prepared from drug-resistant clones and used as templates for PCR to distinguish between homologous recombination and random integration of the vector. Frequencies of targeted disruption in wild-type and <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutant ESCs were 2.08% and 0.88%, respectively. Because the probability of targeted disruption in wild-type ESCs is considered to be twice as high as that in heterozygous mutant ESCs, we concluded that the second allele knockout in serial gene targeting of the <italic>UTF1</italic> loci is not a rare event compared with the first allele knockout.

<p>To determine whether <italic>UTF1</italic>-null ESCs can also be generated from <italic>UTF1</italic>-null blastocysts, we grew blastocysts obtained from <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutant intercrosses in ESC medium. Genotyping of 18 independent ESC clones revealed that five were null for <italic>UTF1</italic>, which was approximately the quarter of expected clones based on the Mendelian segregation ratio. The ESC status of these cells was again confirmed by the expression of Oct3/4 and Nanog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), and teratoma formation (data not shown). Thus, unlike the <italic>Nanog</italic> knockout, a <italic>UTF1</italic>-null knockout does not affect the establishment of ESCs or iPSCs. Examination of the differentiation propensity of <italic>UTF1</italic>-null ESCs confirmed the previous demonstration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Jia1">[14]</xref> of an alteration in the induction of differentiation due to the loss of UTF1, in which some differentiation marker genes became rather refractory to differentiation cues, while others underwent more extensive up-regulation compared with that in <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutant ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). However, we did not observe noticeable difference between <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous and homozygous mutant of 7.5 dpc embryos with respect to expression levels of early differentiation marker genes (<italic>brachyury</italic> and <italic>Cdx2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Also consistent with previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Jia1">[14]</xref>, we found that Arf tumor suppressor protein levels was elevated in <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant ESCs compared to <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Next, as a rigorous test of pluripotency, we performed chimeric analyses using <italic>UTF1</italic>-null ESCs for blastocyst injection. Although we obtained chimeric 9.5 dpc embryos in which fluorescent Kusabira orange-labeled <italic>UTF1</italic>-null ESCs populated entire portions of an embryo, we could only obtain chimeric embryos in which contribution of <italic>UTF1</italic>-null ESCs was much less than that from ICM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). These results were rather unexpected because intercrosses of <italic>UTF1</italic> heterozygous mutant mice gave rise to viable, albeit small, <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant mice. One possible explanation is that <italic>UTF1</italic>-null ESCs bear an essentially appreciable, but not completely intact, pluripotent property, in which the defect becomes clearly discernible by competition with ICM cells for distribution in the embryo.</p>

<title>UTF1 Gene was Generated in the Eutherian Radiation</title>
<p>The evolution of placental growth genes is of considerable interest because the longevity and complexity of the placenta in eutherians are the major characteristics that separate the sister groups of therian mammals.

No <italic>UTF1</italic> orthologues were found in fish, frog, lizard, bird, monotreme or marsupial genomes.</p>
<p>Next, we searched within these genomes for homologues of genes adjacent to <italic>UTF1</italic> in placental mammals.

<p><italic>UTF1</italic> was possibly generated by <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis, or transposition from another genomic region. To examine the possibility of transposition from the ancestral sequence that gave rise to <italic>UTF1</italic>, we conducted an extensive search for <italic>UTF1</italic> homologs in the opossum genome. Blastx analyses revealed that the second SANT domain of <italic>ZSCAN20-like</italic> showed significant similarity (∼36% amino acid identity) to <italic>UTF1</italic> with an expected value of 4×10<sup>–11</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) (A diagram of domain structure of ZSCAN20-like protein is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Furthermore, direct comparison of the <italic>UTF1</italic> sequence with that of the <italic>ZSCAN20-like</italic> gene revealed an additional region showing a similarity, which is located outside of the SANT domain, although it was not as strong as that found by the blastx analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

As a prerequisite step for those analyses, we generated a tree with respect to the amino acid sequences of all 96 different opossum proteins carrying the SANT domain, and found that ZSCAN2, 20, 20-like and 29 generated one cluster (data not shown). To further examine the relationship among them, a phylogenetic tree was generated with these four SANT domain-containing sequences, which showed that ZSCAN20 and ZSCAN20-like were tightly clustered as expected and ZSCAN29 was localized at the immediate outer-branch in the tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068119.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Therefore, using ZSCAN29 as an out group sequence, we conducted phylogenetic tree analyses of UTF1 together with ZSCAN20, and ZSCAN20-like from several species.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>UTF1 was originally identified as a transcriptional coactivator expressed in pluripotent early embryonic cells and extra-embryonic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Okuda1">[13]</xref>. Because of its strong expression in pluripotent cells such as ESCs and the abrupt silencing of <italic>UTF1</italic> expression in pluripotent cells upon induction of differentiation, most investigations of <italic>UTF1</italic> have focused on its expression in pluripotent cells. For example, it has been shown that <italic>UTF1</italic> expression-based selection effectively eliminates contaminating differentiated cells from human ESC lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Tan1">[34]</xref>. Pfannkuche et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Pfannkuche1">[35]</xref> used <italic>UTF1</italic> expression to improve the efficiency of obtaining genuine iPSCs with a pluripotency level equivalent to that of ESCs. Recently, new roles of UTF1 in pluripotent cells have been uncovered. UTF1 has been shown to prevent over-repression of bivalent genes by limiting surplus loading of the PRC2 complex, while UTF1 promotes degradation of mRNA transcribed from insufficiently repressed bivalent genes through recruitment of the mRNA decapping complex. UTF1 is also shown to be involved in ensuring a rapid growth rate by blocking Myc-Arf feedback control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Jia1">[14]</xref>. As described above, the roles of UTF1 in pluripotent cells are becoming more clearly depicted, but the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of UTF1 and the roles of UTF1 in extra-embryonic cells have not been investigated by knockout mouse studies so far.</p>
<p>Here, we report the establishment of homozygous <italic>UTF1</italic> mutant mice that survive at least up to birth. Thus, we showed that the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene is not absolutely essential for the multi-lineage differentiation potential of pluripotent cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. This observation may be the most significant result that we report here because numerous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Jia1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-vandenBoom1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Buganim1">[36]</xref> have implied that UTF1 plays an essential function in early embryos. Although apparently milder phenotypes associated with <italic>UTF1</italic> gene knockout mice than expected could be explained by UTF1 homolog-mediated compensation, we consider that this may not be the case mainly because UTF1 sequence is very unique and genes showing significantly similarity to UTF1 are apparently not present in the genome. From a different point of view, we consider that our data showing that the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene is not an essential regulator, but a modifier of pluripotency for advancing eutherian embryogenesis are reasonable because chicken ESCs, which are devoid of the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene in their genome, have been shown to have properties that meet all the criteria of pluripotency, including the ability to re-enter development and contribute to the full repertories of somatic and germ cells in a recipient embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Pain1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Petitte1">[38]</xref>. Although UTF1 is not essential for pluripotency, we found that <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutation <italic>in vivo</italic> resulted in a significant developmental delay of the embryo, which became apparent during the mid-gestational stage. The <italic>UTF1</italic> gene was expressed in the placenta, but not in the embryo proper except for PGCs at the mid-gestational stage. Moreover, the <italic>UTF1</italic>-null placenta showed a growth defect. It is therefore conceivable that placental insufficiency caused by the loss of <italic>UTF1</italic> expression at least in part contributed to the developmentally delayed phenotype of <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant mice, albeit we cannot completely eliminate the possibility that <italic>UTF1</italic> gene disruption-mediated epigenetic changes and/or other changes occurred during early developmental stages contribute to apparent developmental delay of mid-gestation embryos. At present, we do not know the molecular mechanism of UTF1-mediated placental cell growth. It is possible that UTF1 supports cell proliferation in the placenta through blockade of Myc-Arf feedback control by destabilizing Arf mRNA, as has been demonstrated with ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Jia1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Because of this developmental delay, newborn <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant mice with a C57BL/6J background did not survive for more than 2 days. However, we found that a mixed genetic background (C57BL/6J, 25%; ICR, 75%) completely eliminated this neonatal lethal phenotype, and the offspring, while small, were viable and even fertile. Although we do not know the basis for this effect of the genetic background, the normal yet small phenotype of <italic>UTF1</italic> homozygous mutant mice with the mixed genetic background further leads to the hypothesis that the <italic>UTF1</italic>-null genotype does not impose a specific detrimental abnormality, and only causes developmental delay.</p>
<p>Uterine nourishment is critical for embryogenesis in placental mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Rossant1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Carter1">[3]</xref>. Although marsupials also have a fully functional placenta, a prominent feature of eutherian embryogenesis discriminating it from that in marsupials is the long gestational period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-KanekoIshino1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Renfree1">[40]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene is required to support placenta-dependent embryogenesis for a prolonged period in placental mammals. The small size of the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene (the mouse <italic>UTF1</italic> gene contains 1117 nucleotides from the initiating ATG to the stop codon, including an intron) and its conspicuously high sequence divergence (the overall identity of amino acids between mouse and human UTF1 is only 62%) are consistent with the recent emergence of <italic>UTF1</italic> in genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Lipman1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Tautz1">[45]</xref>. Consistent with this hypothesis, our genome structure and sequence comparison analyses revealed that the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene is indeed specific to placental mammals. There are other examples of recently evolved genes with a role in placental development, such as <italic>PEG10</italic> and <italic>PEG11</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Ono1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Edwards1">[48]</xref>. Both of these genes are derived from an LTR-type retrotransposon; <italic>PEG10</italic> after the divergence of therian mammals which separates from monotremes and <italic>PEG11</italic> after the divergence separating from marsupials, although the ancestral retrotransposon from which it is derived is present in the marsupial genome.</p>
<p>Currently, the manner in which <italic>UTF1</italic> arose is unclear. Novel protein-coding genes arise either through sub-functionalization of pre-existing genes after gene duplication or by <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis from non-genic sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Tautz1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Carvunis1">[49]</xref>. Our comparative analyses demonstrated that the second SANT domain of opossum ZSCAN20-like has significant homology with UTF1. Direct comparison between these two proteins revealed additional region of human UTF1 showing similarity to opossum ZSCAN20-like protein. Consecutive localization of <italic>ZSCAN20</italic> and <italic>ZSCAN20-like</italic> genes was found in the genomes of opossum and platypus (data not shown), which strongly suggests that these genes were most probably generated by tandem duplication. We assume that some physiologically important roles were conferred on <italic>ZSCAN20</italic> gene because of the high sequence conservation between numerous species including eutherian mammals. In contrast, the sequence of <italic>ZSCAN20-like</italic> gene is much less conserved between opossum and platypus compared to that of <italic>ZSCAN20</italic> gene. These facts indicate that the <italic>ZSCAN20-like</italic> gene sequence was subjected to extensive mutation because strong pressure of evolutional conservation was not subjected to this gene due to the presence of <italic>ZSCAN20</italic> gene. Furthermore, in conjunction with the similarity between human UTF1 and opossum ZSCAN20-like, the fact that eutherian genomes bear the <italic>ZSCAN20</italic> gene but lack the <italic>ZSCAN20-like</italic> gene suggests that the prototype or ancestral UTF1 sequence might be the <italic>ZSCAN20-like</italic> gene present in a common ancestor of placental mammals and marsupials. Ultimately, placental mammals may have evolved the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene at the expense of the <italic>ZCAN20-like</italic> gene. This evolutionary occurrence is similar to the mechanism by which the Prader-Willi imprinted gene <italic>SNRPN</italic> was generated from a copy of <italic>SNRPB</italic> that exists in marsupials, but not monotreme genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068119-Rapkins1">[50]</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068119-g007">Figure 7D</xref> shows our proposed model of the evolution of the placental mammal-specific <italic>UTF1</italic> gene. It is tempting to speculate that the evolution of the <italic>UTF1</italic> gene was one of the genomic innovations for advancing embryogenesis in the eutherian-specific manner.</p>
