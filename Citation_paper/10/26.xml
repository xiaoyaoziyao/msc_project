<abstract>
<p>Jump height, defined as vertical displacement in the airborne phase, depends on vertical takeoff velocity. For centuries, researchers have speculated on how jump height is affected by body size and many have adhered to what has come to be known as Borelli’s law, which states that jump height does not depend on body size per se. The underlying assumption is that the amount of work produced per kg body mass during the push-off is independent of size. However, if a big body is isometrically downscaled to a small body, the latter requires higher joint angular velocities to achieve a given takeoff velocity and work production will be more impaired by the force-velocity relationship of muscle. In the present study, the effects of pure isometric scaling on vertical jumping performance were investigated using a biologically realistic model of the human musculoskeletal system. The input of the model, muscle stimulation over time, was optimized using jump height as criterion. It was found that when the human model was miniaturized to the size of a mouse lemur, with a mass of about one-thousandth that of a human, jump height dropped from 40 cm to only 6 cm, mainly because of the force-velocity relationship. In reality, mouse lemurs achieve jump heights of about 33 cm. By implication, the unfavourable effects of the small body size of mouse lemurs on jumping performance must be counteracted by favourable effects of morphological and physiological adaptations. The same holds true for other small jumping animals. The simulations for the first time expose and explain the sheer magnitude of the isolated effects of isometric downscaling on jumping performance, to be counteracted by morphological and physiological adaptations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Jumping is important for survival of many animals because it helps them to catch preys or escape from predators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-James1">[1]</xref>. Jump height (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), defined as vertical displacement of the centre of mass (CM) in the airborne phase, has been found to vary substantially among differently sized primate species. For example, <italic>h</italic> is about 0.33 m in a 100 g grey mouse lemur (<italic>Microcebus murinus</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Legreneur1">[2]</xref>, up to about 2 m in a 300 g bushbaby (<italic>Galago senegalensis</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Aerts1">[3]</xref>, up to 0.7 m in a 34 kg bonobo (<italic>Pan paniscus</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Scholz1">[4]</xref> and typically about 0.4 m in a 75 kg human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Lees1">[5]</xref>. From the perspective of functional morphology, it is interesting to compare jumping performance among species. <italic>Galago senegalensis</italic> seems to be <italic>hors catégorie</italic>, because it outperforms other mammals in both absolute and relative terms, but how does <italic>Microcebus murinus</italic> perform compared to humans? For centuries, the consensus in the literature has been that comparisons should be made in terms of absolute jump height, so <italic>Microcebus</italic> is not a good jumper compared to humans. However, in relation to body size <italic>Microcebus</italic> does a much more impressive job than humans. Is absolute jump height a fair measure to compare jumping performance of differently sized primate species?</p>
<p>In the literature, various propositions can be found on how body size affects jump height. The first proposition is that body size does not affect jump height at all. Perhaps most current scientists will not adhere to this proposition, but it has played a dominant role in history and hence is a good starting point here. The proposition has come to be known as Borelli’s law, because Borelli, in his book <italic>De Motu Animalium</italic> published in 1680 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Borelli1">[6]</xref>, was the first to suggest that takeoff speed should be the same regardless of animal size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Scholz2">[7]</xref>. A few years later, in 1687, Newton formulated the laws of classical mechanics in <italic>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Newton1">[8]</xref>, and many authors have used these laws to reason why isometrically scaled animals should have the same jump height (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Haldane1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Hill1">[11]</xref>, for specific formulations see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Scholz2">[7]</xref>). The reasoning is as follows. To jump to a given <italic>h</italic>, an animal must achieve a certain vertical takeoff velocity of CM (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), which corresponds to kinetic energy (<italic>E<sub>kin,to</sub></italic>) equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>m</italic> is body mass. Neglecting air resistance, <italic>E<sub>kin,to</sub></italic> is transformed during the airborne phase into potential energy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>g</italic> is the acceleration due to gravity, so:<disp-formula id="pone.0071209.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>For the remainder of this paper, it is helpful to write this as:<disp-formula id="pone.0071209.e006"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is <italic>E<sub>kin,to</sub></italic> expressed per kg body mass. If we assume that there is no difference among animals in the amount of work produced per kg of muscle, and no difference in the amount of muscle mass relative to body mass, then each animal should produce the same amount of work per kg body mass (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), leading to the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and hence to the same <italic>h</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0071209.e006">equation 2</xref>). According to this proposition, it is fair to compare jumping performance of differently sized primate species in terms of absolute jump height.</p>
<p>Recently, Scholz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Scholz2">[7]</xref> showed that if differently sized animals produced the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, small animals should actually be expected to jump higher than big animals. During the push-off, CM gains potential energy equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>s</italic> is the vertical displacement of CM from initial height to takeoff height. If big animal B is isometrically downscaled to small animal S by a factor <italic>L</italic>, <italic>s</italic> will scale by <italic>L</italic> too. Hence, if animal S and animal B produce the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, animal S will need a smaller fraction of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to raise CM to the takeoff height, has a greater fraction of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> available for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and hence achieves greater <italic>h</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0071209.e006">equation 2</xref>). Accordingly, under the assumption that all animals produce the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, comparing jumping performance in terms of <italic>h</italic> is unfair to big animals. This proposal will be referred to as the revised version of Borelli’s law. Note that the definition of jump height is crucial here. If jump height were defined as the vertical displacement of CM relative to the lowest height of CM during the jump, which is proportional to the total change in effective energy per kg body mass (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy due to the vertical velocity of CM), then Borelli’s law would still hold. In that case, however, simply standing up from a crouched position would qualify as a jump, which seems unacceptable.</p>
<p>Although the argumentation presented above is mechanically straightforward, there is reason to question that small animals should be able to jump higher than big animals. Motion of CM is the result of rotations of body segments. If the motion pattern were invariant (IMP), i.e. if differently sized animals produced the same segment rotational kinematics over time, <italic>v<sub>to</sub></italic> would simply be proportional to <italic>L</italic>, and <italic>h</italic> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0071209.e005">equation 1</xref>). It is known that when small animals jump, they produce higher accelerations than large animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-BennetClark1">[12]</xref>, and they could in principle achieve higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> than large animals. However, these higher accelerations in themselves require explanation, and they may not be sufficient to cause small animals to jump higher than big animals in absolute terms.</p>
<p>The revised version of Borelli’s law holds under the assumption that all animals produce the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> during the push-off. Bennet-Clark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-BennetClark1">[12]</xref> reasoned that under a different assumption, namely that all animals produce the same peak power per kg muscle mass, animal S will achieve smaller <italic>h</italic> than animal B. Bennet-Clark’s argument was as follows. Producing the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> during the push-off requires animal S to produce a higher peak power per kg body mass during the jump than animal B. After all, animal S has shorter limbs and smaller <italic>s</italic> for acceleration of CM (<italic>a</italic>) than animal B. Assuming that <italic>a</italic> is constant during the push-off, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>T</italic> is push-off duration, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, from which it that can be derived that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If <italic>a</italic> is constant, peak power occurs at takeoff and equals <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (note that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as defined by Bennet-Clark is actually the peak rate of change of kinetic energy due to vertical velocity of CM). Combining this with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0071209.e005">equation 1</xref> yields<disp-formula id="pone.0071209.e028"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e028" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per kg body mass. According to Bennet-Clark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-BennetClark1">[12]</xref> it is reasonable to assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is proportional to muscle mass, which in isometric scaling is proportional to <italic>m</italic>. Since <italic>s</italic> is proportional to <italic>L</italic>, <italic>h</italic> is proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> under this assumption. Bennet-Clark’s reasoning is another way of saying that if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the limiting factor, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, so that animal S should be expected to jump less high than animal B. Therefore, a comparison in terms of <italic>h</italic> is unfair to animal S.</p>
<p>Comparing jumping performance in terms of <italic>h</italic> may also be unfair to small animals for reasons related to muscle physiology, and this is the topic of the present paper. Firstly, to achieve a given <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, animal S needs higher segment angular velocities than animal B. After all, the velocity of CM is determined by the angular velocities of body segments, and if the segments are shorter the angular velocities need to be higher for the same absolute velocity of CM. This will require animal S to traverse the range of joint motion at higher angular velocities and, because muscle moment arms and muscle fibre lengths scale by <italic>L</italic>, contractile elements (CE) will shorten at higher relative velocities (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e. CE velocity expressed in optimum CE-lengths per second). At higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, CE will produce less relative force (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e. CE force as fraction of maximum isometric force) and less <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> because muscle force drops monotonically with shortening velocity according to the force-velocity relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Hill2">[13]</xref>. Secondly, it takes time to develop active state. Active state, which has been defined as the amount of Ca<sup>++</sup> bound to troponin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Ebashi1">[14]</xref>, affects the number of cross-bridges attached and hence <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If animal S traverses the range of motion at higher angular velocities and hence in less time than animal B, a relatively larger part of the range of CE-shortening will be travelled at submaximal active state and submaximal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in animal S, and this will also detract from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> produced during the push-off <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Bobbert1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-vanSoest1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The propositions on how body size affects jump height presented above are all based on simplifying assumptions, for example that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> over the push-off is independent of size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Alexander1">[10]</xref>, or that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> during the jump is proportional to body mass and hence independent of size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-BennetClark1">[12]</xref>. Moreover, although it will be clear from the reasoning presented above that both the force-velocity relationship and the rise time of active state present a disadvantage for small animals, the magnitude of the effects is difficult to predict. It would be helpful, therefore, to study the effects of isometric scaling using a biologically realistic musculoskeletal model. Alexander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Alexander2">[17]</xref> studied jumps of humans, bushbabies and locusts with a realistic musculoskeletal model that included series elastic structures and muscle forces depending on length and velocity. However, he made three separate models, each with species-specific morphological and physiological parameters, and from his simulation results it is impossible to tease apart the possible effects of pure isometric scaling from the effects of inter-species differences in morphology and physiology.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to quantify the effects of pure isometric scaling on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>h</italic> and other mechanical and physiological variables relevant for jumping, using a biologically realistic model of the human musculoskeletal system.</p>

<p>It might occur to the reader that humans and most animals tend to make countermovement jumps and not squat jumps. Making a countermovement has the advantage that active state and force can be built up during the downward motion of CM rather than during the push-off <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Bobbert1">[15]</xref>. However, this advantage becomes negligible when active state increases rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Bobbert1">[15]</xref>, and it can safely be said that the outcome of the present study would have been the same if countermovement jumps had been simulated.</p>

<title>Scaling of the Model</title>
<p>The author was interested in animals ranging in size from humans to <italic>Microcebus</italic>, with mass being used as the variable for scaling. The human musculoskeletal model, with a mass of 82 kg, served as reference model (<italic>L</italic> = 1). <italic>Microcebus</italic> has a mass of only 90–100 g <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Legreneur1">[2]</xref>, which is about one-thousandth of the reference mass. Therefore, <italic>L</italic> was chosen to run from 1 to 0.1 (i.e. 0.001<sup>1/3</sup>), in 30 steps. All body segment lengths, distances of segmental mass centres to segment ends, and muscle moment arms, were scaled by <italic>L</italic>, all masses by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and all moments of inertia for rotation about the segmental mass centre, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as unit, by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Lengths of CE, SEE and PEE were scaled by <italic>L</italic> and their forces, which depend on physiological cross-sectional areas, by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Note that for all scales, the maximum shortening velocity was 12.7 optimum CE lengths per second. Because muscle fibre length scaled by <italic>L</italic>, the maximum shortening velocity of muscle fibres in absolute terms, i.e. in m/s, also scaled by <italic>L</italic>. The specific tension of the muscles in the model was taken to be 0.25 MPa and the theoretical maximal power output 367 W per kg of muscle tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Umberger1">[22]</xref>, which gave the model a theoretical maximal CE power output of 60 W per kg of body mass independent of scale.</p>

Bennet-Clark’s estimation builds on a constant peak power per kg body mass (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0071209.e028">equation 3</xref>), but the actual peak <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reached during the jump decreased from 49 W/kg at <italic>L</italic> = 1 to about 25 W/kg at <italic>L</italic> = 0.1, even though the theoretical maximum power output of the muscles per kg body mass was kept constant across scales. The reader might point out that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is not equal to the power output of contractile elements (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) summed over all MTCs. On the one hand, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of an MTC may differ from the power output of the MTC as a whole (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) because of the presence of series elastic elements; for example, when muscle force drops during the final part of the push-off these elements recoil, causing MTC shortening velocities to be higher than muscle fibre shortening velocities, and hence causing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be higher than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Alexander3">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Bobbert3">[24]</xref>; this is known as ‘catapult action’. On the other hand the total <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the model will differ from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> because of power flow to non-effective terms, such as segment rotational power <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Bobbert4">[25]</xref>. Despite these caveats, however, the peak of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> summed over all MTCs, expressed per kg body mass, showed the same behaviour as peak <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, dropping from 48 W/kg at <italic>L</italic> = 1 to 24 W/kg at <italic>L</italic> = 0.1 (results not shown). As mentioned above, the ‘catapult action’ causes peak <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be higher than peak <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Alexander3">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Bobbert3">[24]</xref>. This action is very important for performance in jumping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Bobbert4">[25]</xref>, but it disqualifies peak power output as measure for the performance of muscle tissue. In the literature, comparisons among different animals are therefore also made in terms of mean power output over the push-off phase. During the push-off phase, the model produced a mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of 19 W/kg when human-sized, 13 W/kg when miniaturized to the size of a 300 g bushbaby, and 9 W/kg when miniaturized to the size of <italic>Microcebus</italic>.

<p>Force, velocity and active state of contractile elements (CE) of glutei and vasti have been plotted as function of normalised CE-length (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for models with isometric scale factor <italic>L</italic> equal to 1 (reference model) and 0.1. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is CE shortening velocity expressed in optimum CE-lengths (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) per second, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is CE force as fraction of maximum isometric force, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is CE power output as fraction of its maximum according to the force-velocity relationship.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to quantify the effects of pure isometric scaling on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>h</italic> and other mechanical and physiological variables relevant for jumping, using a biologically realistic model of the human musculoskeletal system. In the simulated jumps presented in this paper, angular and linear accelerations increased when a human model was isometrically downscaled. The increased angular accelerations led to higher angular velocities and, in relation to body size, downscaled models performed better than the reference model. However, in absolute terms <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and hence <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> dropped because <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> became less, rather than remaining constant as had been assumed by proponents of Borelli’s law (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Haldane1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Hill1">[11]</xref>). Bennet-Clark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-BennetClark1">[12]</xref> had already predicted that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would decrease with size under the assumption that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was proportional to body mass. However, the relationship between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and body size borne out by the present simulations was different from the one that Bennett-Clark had proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-BennetClark1">[12]</xref>. Although in the model the theoretical maximum power output of the muscles per kg body mass was kept constant across scales, the mean and peak values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (the rate of change of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) dropped substantially at small values of <italic>L</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Below, I will first explain these findings and then elaborate on their relevance for the study of functional morphology and evolution of jumping animals.</p>
<p>We have seen that with reduction of <italic>L</italic>, segment angular accelerations and linear accelerations increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g003">Figs. 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g004">4</xref>). The increased angular accelerations led to higher angular velocities and, in relation to body size, i.e. in terms of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the downscaled model performed better than the reference model; in other words, it performed better than under IMP, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g004">Fig. 4A–C</xref>, dash-dotted lines). Why did segment angular accelerations increase with miniaturization? Translation of CM occurs because muscle moments rotate body segments against gravitational moments. Maximal muscle moments at the joints are proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> because they are the product of muscle force proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and moment arms proportional to <italic>L</italic>. They act against moments due to gravity proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (the product of mass proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and moment arms relative to joints proportional to <italic>L</italic>) and cause angular accelerations of segments with moments of inertia proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This explains why angular accelerations, and the ensuing angular velocities, increase as size decreases. Clearly, as was already pointed out elsewhere in general terms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Demes1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Demes2">[28]</xref>, an isometrically downscaled animal is relatively strong and moves relatively fast. However, as revealed by the simulations in this study, these positive effects are counteracted by negative effects: compared to the muscles of the reference model, the muscles of an isometrically downscaled model have less time to build up active state and, more importantly, are hampered more in their force production by the force-velocity relationship, leading to a decrease in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and hence in <italic>h</italic> in absolute terms. In conclusion, a small animal that is an isometrically downscaled version of a big animal achieves lower <italic>h,</italic> and this is largely due to muscle dynamics. The simulations reveal the sheer magnitude of the effect of isometric scaling on <italic>h</italic>: the model jumped 40 cm when human-sized, and only 6 cm when miniaturized to the size of <italic>Microcebus</italic>. This puts the 33 cm jump height of <italic>Microcebus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Legreneur1">[2]</xref> in a different perspective: <italic>Microcebus</italic> is not performing poorly compared to humans, as Borelli and his followers would have concluded, but instead jumps to more than five times the height expected on the basis of isometrically downscaling a human body. The same is true for other small mammals such as rats, which also seem to be able to achieve jump heights of 50 cm or more <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Pousson1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>In a general sense, the results of the present study merely reiterate what had already been claimed by Bennet-Clark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-BennetClark1">[12]</xref>). However, Bennet-Clark’s predictions (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0071209.e028">equation 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) were purely based on the argumentation that a smaller animal has a smaller distance over which to accelerate CM and hence a smaller push-off time; they took into account neither the positive effect of isometric downscaling on relative strength explained above, nor the negative effects of the force-velocity relationship on actual peak power output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>) and work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>) during the jump. The present study quantified the effects of pure isometric scaling on jumping performance using forward dynamic simulations with a realistic musculoskeletal model. Here, it was not necessary to adopt Bennet-Clark’s assumption that the shapes of time-histories of force, velocity and hence power are consistent across scales, which they are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Even for current scientists who did not adhere to Borelli’s law in the first place and considered its role in the present paper as that of a straw man, the sheer magnitude of the effect of pure isometric scaling on <italic>h</italic> and other relevant variables, as borne out by the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), may still come as a surprise.</p>
<p>The simulation model used in this study is realistic in that it takes into account the fundamental properties of the components of the musculoskeletal system and in terms of parameter values represents a human musculoskeletal system. However, after miniaturization it obviously does not represent the musculoskeletal system of small primates. There are many morphological and physiological differences that may help small primates to jump higher than a downscaled human model. Let us address a few of these differences and their functional implications, armed with the insights gained from the simulations. First of all, small jumping primates may have relatively muscular legs; for example, the muscle mass contained in both legs together is about 25% of total body mass in <italic>Galago senegalensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Aerts1">[3]</xref> and only about 17% in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-KleinHorsman1">[30]</xref>. It will be obvious that this benefits <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and hence <italic>h</italic>. Second, small primates have relatively long leg segments, including an elongated metatarsal segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Alexander2">[17]</xref>), which benefits the transfer from joint angular velocities to vertical velocity of CM. Third, small primates have relatively short muscle moment arms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Demes2">[28]</xref>, which benefits the transfer from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to angular velocities. Having relatively long muscle fibres would tend to reduce <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071209.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> itself, but the author has not come across any comparisons of relative muscle fibre length among differently sized primates in the literature. Fourth, an important role has been claimed for compliant structures in series with muscle fibres in the vasti of <italic>Galago senegalensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Aerts1">[3]</xref>. It is possible that the ‘catapult action’ of these structures contributes more to jumping performance in small jumping primates than in humans. However, this action depends on precisely how moment arms vary with joint angles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Roberts1">[31]</xref>, and therefore its quantification requires simulations with detailed species-specific musculoskeletal models that, unfortunately, are currently not available. Fifth, small animals have equally long myosin filaments as large animals (1.60 µm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Walker1">[32]</xref>) but shorter actin-filaments (e.g., 1.04 µm in rats, 1.16 µm in Rhesus monkeys, 1.27 µm in humans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Walker1">[32]</xref>). Thus, in a small animal, a unit of muscle fibre length will have more sarcomeres in series and, at a given rate of sliding of actin relative to myosin, higher velocity and power output than in humans, all else remaining equal. Sixth, small jumping animals tend to have higher percentages of fast twitch fibres in important leg extensors such as vastus lateralis (more than 95% in <italic>Microcebus</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Petter1">[33]</xref>, and 100% in bushbabies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Edgerton1">[34]</xref>) than humans (less than 60%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Staron1">[35]</xref>), which obviously benefits the power output per kg muscle tissue. Seventh, the maximal shortening velocity of muscle fibres and the rate of force development are higher in small animals than in large animals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-James2">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Seow1">[39]</xref>) because of differences in intrinsic contractile properties and myofibrillar protein composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-James2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Seow1">[39]</xref>. The latter variations are referred to in the literature as ‘effects of scaling’ (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-James2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071209-Marx1">[37]</xref>), but this is confusing because isometric scaling does not affect these variables directly. Rather, isometric scaling directly affects potential performance, as clearly demonstrated in the current study, and morphological and physiological adaptations may occur that partly or completely counteract the variations caused by isometric scaling, thereby determining actual performance. For example, small animals may jump high despite the performance-limiting effects of being small revealed in this study, by virtue of adaptations causing their muscles to be very fast, and/or large animals may jump high by virtue of the performance-enhancing effects of being large revealed in this study, and therefore can afford adaptations causing their muscles to be slower and metabolically cheaper. We are still a long way from understanding the effects of morphological and physiological differences among different animals on locomotor performance, but the results of the current study indicate that they compensate for major effects of isometric scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071209-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Clearly, the effects of isometric scaling on jumping performance, as revealed here by simulations with a model that includes key aspects of muscle dynamics, should be taken into account in the study of functional morphology and evolution of jumping animals.</p>
