        <p>Ploidy varies tremendously within and between species, yet the factors that influence when or why ploidy variants are adaptive remains poorly understood. Our previous work found that diploid individuals repeatedly arose within ten replicate haploid populations of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and in each case we witnessed diploid takeover within <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>1800 asexual generations of batch culture evolution in the lab. The character that allowed diploids to rise in frequency within haploid populations remains unknown. Here we present a number of experiments conducted with the goal to determine what this trait (or traits) might have been. Experiments were conducted both by sampling a small number of colonies from the stocks frozen every two weeks (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>93 generations) during the original experiment, as well through sampling a larger number of colonies at the two time points where polymorphism for ploidy was most prevalent. Surprisingly, none of our fitness component measures (lag phase, growth rate, biomass production) indicated an advantage to diploidy. Similarly, competition assays against a common competitor and direct competition between haploid and diploid colonies isolated from the same time point failed to indicate a diploid advantage. Furthermore, we uncovered a tremendous amount of trait variation among colonies of the same ploidy level. Only late-appearing diploids showed a competitive advantage over haploids, indicating that the fitness advantage that allowed eventual takeover was not diploidy per se but an attribute of a subset of diploid lineages. Nevertheless, the initial rise in diploids to intermediate frequency cannot be explained by any of the fitness measures used; we suggest that the resolution to this mystery is negative frequency-dependent selection, which is ignored in the standard fitness measures used.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The study of adaptive evolution is in many ways the study of fitness. Having identified an interesting pattern in nature, we examine and compare fitness differences within contemporary populations to infer how evolution might have happened. This method has notoriously been criticized by one of the most widely cited papers in the field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Gould1">[1]</xref> because we traditionally lack the ability to perform direct experiments on the individuals that were actually present at the time when evolution occurred to determine which mutation provided an advantage (and why). Recently, experimental evolution with microbes has provided an approach whereby the entire process of evolutionary change can be studied and used to test adaptive processes directly, without inference about the populations and individuals involved.</p>
      <p>Experimental evolution allows researchers to conduct experiments forward in time. By maintaining freezer stock of samples taken from the population at multiple timepoints during evolution (generating a “fossil record”), researchers are able to ask questions about when an adaptation first arose, how rapidly it rose in frequency, and what enabled it to predominate over previous genotypes. Experimental evolution studies are typically initiated by starting many replicate populations of the same (ancestral) genotype; thus this approach has been a fruitful way to explore the range of paths that evolution can take, given the same starting material.</p>
      <p>Our previous work reported a surprising result that arose during an <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>1800 generation batch culture evolution experiment. We found that diploid individuals arose within haploid populations of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and eventually swept independently in ten lines, even though the lines were asexual (5/5 lines evolved in YPD &amp; 5/5 lines evolved in YPD+salt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Gerstein1">[2]</xref>). We proposed that historical contingency may be acting; as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is historically diploid, selection may have acted on rare diploid individuals that arise naturally at low frequency to regain this historical state. However, the true character on which selection was acting to allow diploids to take over remains unknown. Here, we present experiments conducted with the goal of determining what fitness component allowed diploids to repeatedly invade haploid populations.</p>
      <p>The question of why one ploidy level is able to outperform another over evolutionary time is of broad interest, as tremendous variation in ploidy is seen throughout the tree of life, even among closely related species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Parfrey1">[3]</xref>. All sexual species undergo a ploidy cycle over a generation, and some species maintain prominent haploid and diploid free-living stages (i.e., alternation of generations), while in other species ploidy differs between sexes (i.e., haplodiploidy, e.g., in Hymenoptera). Though ploidy variation is pervasive, we generally have a poor understanding of when or why ploidy variants are adaptive. As one example, a recent study that examined the link between ploidy and plant species worldwide found endangered plants were disproportionately diploid, while invasive species were more likely to be polyploid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Pandit1">[4]</xref>, yet the traits that underlie these correlations remain speculative.</p>
      <p>The species we focus on, <italic>Saccharomcyes cerevisiae</italic>, is itself known to display multiple ploidy levels in natural isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Ezov1">[5]</xref>. Ploidy variants of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are known to differ in a wide variety of aspects, even when isogenic. Cell size increases as ploidy increases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Galitski1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Mable1">[7]</xref>; as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells are prolate spheroids, increases in volume decreases the surface area to volume ratio, and thus diploids, which are typically larger than haploids, have a significantly lower surface area to volume ratio. Gene expression and protein levels also differ between isogenic individuals; deGodoy <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-deGodoy1">[8]</xref> found that 196 proteins changed more than 50% in abundance between haploids and diploids, while Wu <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Wu1">[9]</xref> recently observed that 65 genes differ in expression between haploid and tetraploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> isogenic individuals. Interestingly, it may be cell size rather than ploidy that influences gene expression, as Wu <italic>et al</italic>. also showed that genes with expression differences between haploids and tetraploids also differed in expression (in the same direction) when comparing wild type haploids with <italic>cln3</italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> haploids that are 185% the volume of wildtype haploids.</p>
      <p>Previous researchers have found mixed results when comparing haploid and diploid fitness under conditions similar to ours (isogenic haploids and diploids grown in rich medium at 30<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>C). Adams &amp; Hansche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Adams1">[10]</xref> and Temina <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Temina1">[11]</xref> found no difference in growth rate between haploids and diploids under these conditions, while Mable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Mable1">[7]</xref> found haploids grew significantly faster than diploids (though this was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons). Similarly, although Glazunov <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Glazunov1">[12]</xref> found diploids outcompeted haploids, Mable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Mable1">[7]</xref> found haploids and diploids competed equally well against a common haploid or diploid competitor in YPD at 30<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>C. Overall, previous work in our lab and others has failed to identify any distinct fitness advantage of diploids over haploids under the conditions of our long-term experiment.</p>
      <p>Here we set out specifically to determine why diploid individuals, when they arise by chance within haploid populations, were able to out perform haploids under our experimental conditions. To identify the character that might have allowed diploids to overtake haploids, we conducted a set of fitness assays on haploid and diploid individuals isolated at regular intervals throughout the time series of the original experiment (1767 generations). We can thus assess how different fitness components changed throughout the duration of the experiment. We also conducted competitive fitness assays by directly competing haploid and diploid individuals isolated from the same time point. We focus our attention on two time points in particular, where the diploids have recently risen to appreciable frequency (appreciable enough to be sampled), suggesting a recent selective advantage.</p>
      <p>We first assayed cell size and shape of haploid and diploid colonies isolated throughout the time series to gain a sense of the magnitude of phenotypic change. We then compared fitness between haploid and diploid genotypes in a variety of ways. It was important to assay many possible aspects of total fitness, as a previous study that acquired mutations through mutation accumulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> for 1012 generations found that mutations that altered one component of fitness generally had little effect on other components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Hall1">[13]</xref>. We thus assayed colonies for three fitness components that correlate to the three main phases of growth during batch culture, i.e., lag time upon entering fresh medium, growth rate during logarithmic growth, and biomass production (yield) after 24 hours of growth (transfer into fresh medium was done every 24 hours in our original experiment). We then conducted two types of competition assays: in the first we compete all individuals of interest against a common competitor (closely related to the ancestor), in the second we developed a novel assay that allowed us to directly compete haploid and diploid genotypes isolated from the same time point against each other. We found, surprisingly, that none of these assays indicate a clear diploid advantage that could explain how diploid genotypes were able to rise in frequency within the initially haploid populations. One possibility is that the initial rise in the frequency of diploidy was due to an aspect of fitness not measured by any of these metrics, and we suggest that frequency-dependence may be involved. We also observed significant variation among colonies of the same ploidy level isolated at the same time point. The eventual fixation of diploidy involved a strain that did exhibit a competitive advantage, suggesting that only a subset of diploids could rise to fixation. We conclude that although the end evolutionary result may be deterministic (i.e., that diploids repeatedly take over the population) the route to takeover appears to be largely stochastic, depending on the exact genotypes that arise.</p>

This past work reported a snapshot of genome size change, by assaying the ploidy level of only a single colony from each of the 10 lines every 93 generations up to generation 744, and a single colony from each line at generation 1767. These colonies were obtained from stocks frozen every two weeks in the original experiment (corresponding to Log<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>101*14 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 93 generations with daily 1∶101 dilutions in batch culture). Here we focus on only one line (“Line A”) that had been grown in YPD and showed complete diploid takeover by generation 1488 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026599.s001">Figure S1</xref>), but analyze multiple colonies from multiple time points to gain a more complete sense of the relative number and fitness of haploid and diploid individuals.</p>
        <p>We first isolated ploidy variants from throughout the time series. Freezer stock acquired during the initial evolution experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Gerstein1">[2]</xref> was streaked onto YPD plates and allowed to grow for 72 hours. 24 colonies from each time point were haphazardly picked, inoculated into 10 mL YPD and allowed to grow overnight. Flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Gerstein1">[2]</xref> to assay the ploidy of each colony. Culture from these isolated colonies of known ploidy were then frozen in 15<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> glycerol for use in all later experiments. We found extensive polymorphism for ploidy from generation 744 to generation 1302 (Results, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which allowed us to undertake the experiments described below.</p>

        <p>We designed a number of experiments to determine whether the ploidy of a sampled colony directly influenced different components of fitness. We first assayed a small number of colonies (two to four) from approximately every 93 generations over the entire 1767 generation time series. These data allowed us to ask whether the fitness measures changed over evolutionary time during the evolution experiment and whether haploid and diploid colonies responded differently. We then took a more in depth look at colonies from generation 1023 and generation 1302. These time points were chosen specifically, as these are the first and last timepoints where polymorphism for genome size was prevalent, and we believed that they would shed the most light on the relative fitness advantage that allowed diploids to invade. We randomly picked five haploid and five diploid colonies (of the 24 initial colonies assayed) from each of these time points and used these same twenty colonies (2 timepoints <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (5 haploid colonies+5 diploid colonies)) for all subsequent assays. We should note that we do not know whether multiple colonies isolated at the same time point are different genotypes, how many times diploid colonies independently arose, or whether colonies isolated at later generations are the direct descendants of colonies isolated earlier.</p>

        <title>Cell size and shape</title>
        <p>We first conducted an imaging experiment to measure the cell size and shape of haploid and diploid colonies isolated throughout the time series. As these parameters are known to differ between cells of different ploidy, they may directly contribute to fitness differences, as well as indicate the magnitude to which evolution acted within 1767 generations. We assayed colonies from across the entire time series and from twenty colonies isolated at generations 1023 and 1302. The imaging experiment was initiated by streaking colonies onto plates from freezer stock kept at −80<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>C and allowed to grow for 72 hours. One colony from each line of interest was then randomly picked, inoculated into 10 mL of YPD and grown shaking at 30<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>C for 24 hours. One slide was prepared from each culture using standard practices. A Zeiss Axioplan microscope with a digital camera attached was used to take at least three digital pictures of each slide (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026599.s002">Figure S2</xref> for representative haploid and diploid images). Fifteen individual cells were randomly chosen from across the pictures (any cell touching another cell or in the process of budding was excluded). Using the software ImageJ (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij" xlink:type="simple">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>; developed by Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), photos were enhanced and ellipses were manually drawn around the perimeter of each chosen cell to obtain a length measurement (major axis, L) and width measurement (minor axis, W). We calculated two cell size parameters using the appropriate equations for prolate spheroids, volume (V) and surface area (SA):<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e020" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e021" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula></p>
        <p>The equation for surface area depends on the measure of eccentricity (e), which we also used as a descriptor of cell shape:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e022" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula></p>
        <p>Lastly, we calculated the surface area to volume ratio (SA/V), which also describes a component of cell shape.</p>

        <title>Fitness components</title>
        <p>We first measured various fitness components to test whether there were consistent and significant differences over time and between haploid and diploid colonies. We picked three fitness assays that largely reflect the different phases of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> growth in YPD during the 24 hours between transfers in our primary experiment. A brief lag phase occurs after transfer into fresh medium, before cells begin growing, followed by a phase of exponential growth during which <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> rapidly grow and reproduce by fermenting glucose. A diauxic shift between glucose fermentation and ethanol respiration typically occurs around 20 hours for wildtype cells grown in YPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Stahl1">[14]</xref>. During this postdiauxic phase <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> grows much slower by respiring the ethanol that is a byproduct of glucose fermentation. As transfers are done every 24 hours we expect growth in this last phase to be under weaker selection (but such growth could contribute to biomass production measured at 24 hours).</p>

          <title>Lag phase</title>
          <p>To determine the growth lag, we measured the rate at which glucose was consumed by HPLC. We could not use automated optical density measures (OD, see below), because growth during lag phase occurred below the detection limit of our bioscreen machines. For HPLC, we measured two independently cultured replicates of the ancestral (“Gen0”) haploid, evolved diploid (“Gen1767”), and three haploid and three diploid colonies isolated from 1302 generations (these colonies were a subset of the haploid and diploid colonies isolated from this time point used in all other experiments). For each, a small amount of previously frozen culture was inoculated into 10 mL YPD and grown for 48 hours, shaking at 30<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>C.

          <title>Growth Rate</title>
          <p>Naively, one might expect that diploid mutants overtake haploids because diploids grow faster during log growth, which we tested in two sets of experiments, one which examined the small number of colonies isolated throughout the time series and a second that examined 20 colonies isolated from 1023 and 1302 generations. Growth rates were determined using the Bioscreen C Microbiological Workstation (Thermo Labsystems), which measures optical density (OD) in 100 well honeycomb plates, with constant shaking and temperature. Previous work had found growth rate can be variable across bioscreen runs (likely due to small differences in medium, A.C. Gerstein, unpublished results). As these two sets of experiments were not conducted at the same time we compare results only within a single bioscreen experiment. Plates were streaked from frozen stock and allowed to grow for 72 hours. An inoculation containing multiple colonies was allowed to grow overnight in 10 mL YPD. 100 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>L was transferred into 10 mL of fresh YPD, mixed well, and seven 150 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>L aliquots from each test tube were placed into different bioscreen wells.</p>

          <title>Biomass production and number of cells at 24 hours</title>
          <p>The ability to convert nutrients in the medium into cellular material may also differ over time or between haploids and diploids. We interpret the optical density (OD) at 24 hours as a measure of total biomass production between transfers. For each bioscreen well, we calculated the optical density at 24 hours minus the optical density at the start of the experiment. As haploid and diploid cells (and cells of different genotypes) may differ in cell size, differences in biomass production do not necessarily correlate to differences in absolute number of cells, and we avoid interpreting them as such. To obtain a measure of the number of cells present at 24 hours we conducted hemocytometer counts of ancestral (Gen0) and evolved (Gen1767) culture, as well as the five haploid and five diploid colonies isolated after 1023 and 1302 generations of evolution. We note that both growth rate and biomass production were measured in a different environment than the original experiment (100 well honeycomb plates versus large test tubes), and it is possible that a different result could have been obtained if we examined these parameters in the evolutionary environment. Experiments in our lab (unpublished results, A.C.G.) have found very little difference between the parameters measured in these different environments, though we did not specifically test the lines of specific interest for this project.</p>

We also started a second set of evolution tubes; 10 new tubes were started from 1302 generation culture as well as 20 replicate tubes spiked with cells from 1488 generations. Statistical analyses was conducted to account for a block (or length of experiment) effect. We first compared the two blocks of evolution started from culture isolated at 1302 generations (41 days evolution vs. 15 days of evolution). We then compared the replicates started with 1302 generation culture against those started with 1302+1488 generation culture. A Fishers' exact test was used to test whether there was a significant increase in diploidy for each experiment.

      <title>Results and Discussion</title>
      <p>We sought to determine why diploids were able to overtake haploids during an <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>1800 generation batch culture evolution experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Gerstein1">[2]</xref>. We have focused on one of five lines independently evolved in YPD (“Line A”) that showed this pattern. By isolating many haploid and diploid colonies from throughout the initial evolution experiment we were able to assay fitness of colonies of different ploidy that were present in the same population. We previously found the ancestral strain to be aneuploid for chromosome IX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Gerstein4">[19]</xref>; though we have not tracked this aneuploidy directly in the experiments presented here, we found no evidence of aneuploidy for any chromosome in 10 colonies (5 haploid and 5 diploid) isolated at 1302 generations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026599.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Variation for genome size was found by flow cytometry at several intermediate timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We used the kmeans function in the R Programming Language <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-R1">[15]</xref> to assign each colony to a cluster, with the number of clusters (k) set to 2 (k = 2 significantly decreased the within group sum of squares). As cluster assignments correspond to haploid and diploid genome sizes based on control samples, we refer to all colonies in the first cluster as haploids and colonies in the second cluster as diploids. The first diploid colony was sampled at 744 generations and the last haploid was sampled at 1302 generations, thus polymorphism for genome size was maintained for at least 558 generations.</p>
      <p>We found consistent differences in cell size and shape between haploid and diploid colonies. Haploid cells isolated at both 1023 and 1302 generations had significantly smaller volumes and surface areas than diploid cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026599-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>), as is commonly observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Mable1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Weiss1">[20]</xref>. As predicted based on the equations for cell shape, diploid cells were also more eccentric (i.e., less spherical) and had a significantly lower surface area to volume ratio than haploid cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026599-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-R1">[15]</xref>).

The only significant change for diploid colonies isolated at many time points was eccentricity; diploid cells became more elongated over time (eccentricity: F<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 5.58, <italic>p</italic> = 0.032; volume: F<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1.59, <italic>p</italic> = 0.23; surface area: F<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1.09, <italic>p</italic> = 0.31; surface area:volume: F<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1.78, <italic>p</italic> = 0.21). An adaptive increase in cell size has previously been found for <italic>E. coli</italic> when evolved in minimal medium for 2000 generations under similar batch culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Mongold1">[21]</xref>. As previously mentioned, cell volume alone may contribute to potential differences between cells of differing ploidy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Wu1">[9]</xref>. Cell volume is highly correlated with surface area, eccentricity and surface area:volume whether we compare across the time series or within Gen1023 or Gen1302 colonies (statistics are presented in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026599.s006">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026599.s007">S2</xref>). We thus focused only on cell volume as a potential correlate with growth phase components and fitness correlates of haploid and diploid colonies.</p>

      <p>Three different growth phase components were measured in an attempt to capture the primary phases of growth experienced by yeast cells in the 24 hours between transfers during the original experiment [?]. Surprisingly, we found that none of these component fitness measures indicated an advantage to diploidy, despite diploids overtaking haploids. To test whether the lag phase of growth differed between haploids and diploids, we used mass spectrometry to measure the percentage of glucose remaining in the medium every 2 hours until 8 hours after transfer for four populations initiated from colonies isolated at 0 (haploids), 1302 (haploids and diploids), and 1767 generations (diploids). We also measured the percentage of glucose remaining in the medium at 24 hours. If lag phase differs between haploids and diploids, we expect to find differences in the glucose remaining at the early time points. As the amount of glucose present initially is the same, any difference in lag phase would be recovered as a difference in the amount of glucose remaining in the medium due to differences in the rate of glucose metabolism. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g004">Figure 4</xref>, a two-way ANOVA indicated that although the percentage of glucose decreases in the medium as post-transfer time increases (F<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1359.8, <italic>p</italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.0001), no differences were detected between haploid and diploid colonies (F<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.82, <italic>p</italic> = 0.37), nor was there a significant interaction between generation and ploidy (F<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1.80, <italic>p</italic> = 0.19). Similarly, when we compared the four populations, ploidy did not significantly affect glucose % over the first eight hours of growth (t-test; 2 h: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 5.7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.7; 4 h: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = −1.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.2; 6 h: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = −1.1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.3; 8 h: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.69, <italic>p</italic> = 0.5). These results indicate that haploid and diploid colonies begin to grow and utilize glucose at similar rates, suggesting no difference in lag phase. Interestingly, after 24 hours diploid lines had significantly more glucose remaining in the medium than haploid lines (t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = −5.4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0007), suggesting that they are either less efficient at utilizing glucose for growth and biomass production or that they switch to metabolizing ethanol before glucose is used up.</p>

      <p>We then looked in greater depth at the populations from 1023 and 1302 generations. Diploid colonies had a lower growth rate than haploid colonies, significantly so at 1302 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g006">Figure 6</xref>; Welch's two-sample t-test; 1023: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.33, <italic>p</italic> = 0.75; 1302: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 3.41, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Biomass production also did not differ significantly between haploid and diploid colonies when they were isolated at the same time point (1023 generations: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = −0.491, <italic>p</italic> = 0.64; 1302 generations: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.95). Neither growth rate nor biomass production showed a significant correlation with cell volume for colonies isolated across the time series when we control for ploidy using a partial correlation (growth rate: <italic>p</italic> = 0.84; biomass production: <italic>p</italic> = 0.08) or when we examine colonies from 1023 and 1302 generations together (growth rate: <italic>p</italic> = 0.80; biomass production: <italic>p</italic> = 0.52). Although researchers typically assume that growth rate is the primary factor under selection in batch culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Dykhuizen1">[22]</xref>, our results do not support this. One caveat to this conclusion is that, because of the large number of colonies assayed in replicate, these parameters were measured in 100 well honeycomb plates rather than in the test tubes of the original experiment; it is possible that growth rate differences might have been apparent in a different environment.</p>

      <p>When we measure population size after 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we found that diploid genotypes produce significantly fewer individuals within a growth cycle than haploids. Population size correlated very strongly with cell volume (t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = −5.68, <italic>p</italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.0001), though this relationship is driven entirely by ploidy, as there is not a significant correlation when we use a partial correlation to control for ploidy (<italic>p</italic> = 0.301) The fact that glucose consumption appears to be equal between haploid and diploid populations despite fewer individual diploid cells indicates that the average diploid individual metabolizes glucose faster than the average haploid individual. The differences we found in cell size and shape likely explain how diploid cells (which are fewer in number, but larger) are able to consume glucose at the same overall rate as haploid cells.</p>
      <p>Selection may actually favour a slower growth rate if there is a tradeoff between growth rate and a second fitness component. For example, Blount <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Blount1">[23]</xref> found that mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> that have acquired the ability to metabolize citrate outcompete individuals that cannot; citrate mutants have a significantly slower growth rate and a longer lag phase than other individuals isolated at the same time, yet they reach much higher optical density. Novak <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Novak1">[24]</xref> explicitly tested for a tradeoff between growth rate and yield (biomass production) in 12 <italic>E. coli</italic> populations that had evolved for 20 000 generations. They did not find a significant tradeoff when comparing across the 12 populations with samples isolated at multiple time points. Interestingly, however, they do find evidence for significant tradeoffs when they look at many colonies isolated from the same population at one time point. We, however, do not find evidence for a negative tradeoff in our experiment, at least between growth rate and biomass production. When we compare across all timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g005">Figure 5</xref>), we find a significant positive correlation between growth rate and yield (t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 3.75, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0007, r = 0.55), yet this relationship is largely driven by the effect of ploidy. If we test for a correlation within haploid or diploid populations we find no significant correlation for either, but in both cases the correlation is positive (haploid: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.83, <italic>p</italic> = 0.42, r = 0.20; diploid: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.95, <italic>p</italic> = 0.36, r = 0.25). Our findings are similar to results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Adams2">[25]</xref> when examining <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> clones isolated during 260 generations of growth in a chemostat. Specifically, Adams <italic>et al.</italic> found that growth rates changed very little over the course of the experiment and that the growth rate of some of their later time point clones is lower than the initial clones. It thus seems that neither growth rate nor biomass production are able to explain why diploids overtook haploids in our evolution experiment.</p>
      <p>Fitness assays that examine population level parameters may not capture the dynamics that occur when different genotypes (or cells of differing ploidy) are in direct competition with each other, either because of interactions between individuals of different ploidy levels or because of unmeasured components of fitness in batch culture. For example, previous work on <italic>Candida albicans</italic> did not find a significant correlation between fitness measured by direct competition experiments and fitness measured on isolated populations (examining either growth rate or stationary phase density; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Cowen1">[26]</xref>). We thus turned our attention to competition assays that account for interactions between different ploidy types and that integrate fitness across the entire 24 hour batch culture cycle.</p>
      <p>We first determined the competitive ability of generation 0 haploid colonies and generation 1767 diploid colonies, as well as haploid and diploid colonies isolated at 1023 and 1302 generations, against a closely-related marked competitor (both our ancestor and the common competitor are derivatives of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain S288C). This assay was, however, also unable to explain why diploids were able to overtake haploid colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Altogether, we found that only the generation at which a colony was isolated significantly affected competitive ability (two-way ANOVA, time: F<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 22.9, <italic>p</italic> = 0.00013, ploidy: F<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 3.18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.091, time*ploidy: F<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 3.21, <italic>p</italic> = 0.089). When we look at the difference in competitive ability between colonies of different ploidy isolated at 1302 generations, we find that haploids compete significantly better than diploid colonies (two-way t-test: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 2.88, <italic>p</italic> = 0.039), although ploidy did not significantly affect competitive ability among the 1023 generation colonies (two-way t-test: t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.458, <italic>p</italic> = 0.666).</p>

      <p>Experiments that compete colonies against a common competitor (or the ancestor) also do not precisely mimic the original evolution experiment, however. If non-transitive fitness changes are occurring, comparing fitness against the ancestral type does not inform us about competitive ability against the actual genotypes that were present at any point in time. Such non-transitive fitness interactions have been shown to be important in some previous microbial experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Paquin1">[27]</xref>, but not others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-deVisser1">[28]</xref>. To control for this potentially important factor, the best fitness assay is one that directly competes colonies from the same time point together. We thus competed a population of 6 haploid colonies isolated at 1302 generations against single diploid colonies isolated at 1302 generation (for 12 individual diploid colonies), as well as against a pooled populations of 12 diploids colonies isolated from 1302 generations (“Gen1302 2N population”) and a pool of 24 diploid colonies isolated at 1488 generations, after diploids appeared to have fixed (“Gen1488 2N population”). As we are primarily interested in the ability of diploids to overtake haploids (as was observed in the original experiment), we conducted a one-way t-test to look for a significant increase in diploid frequency after 14 days of competition. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g008">Figure 8</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026599-t002">Table 2</xref>, only the population of diploids isolated at 1488 generations, i.e., the first generation where only diploid colonies were sampled, were significantly able to increase in diploid frequency.

      <p>In summary, none of our fitness assays predicts that diploid colonies isolated from either 1023 or 1302 generations would be able to overtake contemporaneous haploids present in the environment at the same time point during the original experiment. Rather, our results indicated that the fitness advantage that allowed eventual takeover by diploids arose in only a subset of diploid lineages, which predominated by 1488 generations. Recall, however, that growth rates were not significantly higher at the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g006">Figure 6</xref>, Gen1767), nor were they significantly higher at generation 1488 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026599.s005">Figure S5</xref>), leading us to conclude that growth rate measures fail to predict competitive advantage in these diploids.</p>
      <p>To further explore the population dynamics of the population isolated at 1302 generations, we re-evolved freezer culture that was acquired during the original experiment. Culture isolated after 1302 generations of evolution was re-evolved during two blocks, one that lasted for 41 days and one that lasted 15. There was no significant difference in the total change in diploid frequency between blocks (t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = −0.35, <italic>p</italic> = 0.73), thus we combine them for analysis. Across 30 replicate tubes initiated from a population sample taken from 1302 generation culture, there was no significant change in diploid frequency (t<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = −0.94, <italic>p</italic> = 0.35), with 14 tubes showing an increase in diploid frequency and 16 tubes showing a decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), with tremendous variation among replicates.

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>The experiments described above aimed to determine how diploid individuals were able to rise in frequency within the ancestral population of haploids. Our results failed to find any fitness advantage of early-arising diploids (generations 1023 and 1302) over haploids. How could the diploids have risen to intermediate frequency without a fitness advantage? Several possible explanations remain. The environments might have been slightly different than in the initial experiments. Alternatively, even though we sampled five diploid colonies at both of these two time points, perhaps we were unlucky and sampled particular unfit diploids. More likely, we note that none of these standard fitness assays would have revealed a fitness advantage if such an advantage is negative frequency dependent. Competition assays starting at different initial frequencies of diploids suggests that the diploids from generations 1023 and 1302 are able to spread when rare, but this competitive advantage declines with frequency (A.C.G., in prep). We hypothesize that this is why the standard fitness measures used here failed to explain the initial rise in diploid frequency.</p>
        <p>Our results indicate that there is not a fitness-related trait that uniformly differs between haploids and diploids and that allows diploids to overtake haploids whenever they appear. Rather, we conclude that only a subset of diploids, which predominated late in the experiment (generation 1488), are competitively superior and capable of fixing within the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Our direct competition assay and replicate evolution experiment both suggest that the diploids we sampled (specifically, diploids colonies isolated at 1302 generations) are unlikely to be the same exact diploid genotypes that overtook the haploid population during the initial experiment. Interestingly, fitness measures from later generations failed to show evidence of higher growth rates or biomass production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026599.s001">Figure S1</xref>), although diploids from these later generations exhibit competitive superiority (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g009">9</xref>). Current sequencing efforts aim to identify the causative mutations underlying the advantage of later generation diploids. We could then determine whether the mutation was accessible or beneficial to diploids alone, explaining the consistent conversion of haploid to diploid populations.</p>
        <p>The exact selective forces acting within our experiment remain largely unknown. It may be that organisms are adapting to an aspect of the medium (YPD), to the test tube environment (e.g., low oxygen), or to batch culture (i.e., repeated feast and famine). One clue, however, might be that the smaller haploid cells significantly increased in size (approximately 1% increase in volume over 1302 generations). An adaptive increase in cell size has also been found for <italic>E. coli</italic> when evolved in minimal medium under similar batch culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Mongold1">[21]</xref>. We hope that future experiments and sequencing efforts will help shed light on this question.</p>
        <p>We are left to conclude that the evolutionary dynamics of this system are more complicated than expected, and that none of the standard assays used to measure fitness demonstrate diploid superiority over haploidy across all diploid lines. The picture that emerges is that the ploidy level of any given colony isolated from a particular time point is not the determining factor in whether that individual has high fitness and will spread. We find tremendous trait variation among colonies of the same ploidy level for the majority of traits measured, and the variation among colonies of the same ploidy is often larger than the variation between ploidy levels (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026599-g005">Figure 5</xref>). If anything, haploid cells appear to have the higher fitness (for growth rate and biomass) at intermediate time points when both haploids and diploids are present. As Adams <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Adams2">[25]</xref> noted at the end of their paper examining a chemostat-evolved population of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> twenty five years ago:</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>
            <italic>“The emerging picture of adaptation in such populations, therefore, is that a number of different cell phenotypes may exhibit increased fitness and that the selection of any one of them is unpredictable, depending on the random nature of the mutational events involved. [We believe] a single optimal phenotype may not exist even for simple constant laboratory environments.”</italic>
          </p>
        </disp-quote>
        <p>Although the role of ploidy in our previous evolution experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Gerstein1">[2]</xref> seems to be deterministic in that diploids eventually outcompeted haploids in all ten of our replicate lines, ploidy is not the most important differentiating character among cells present in the population. These experiments demonstrate the utility of maintaining a fossil record during batch culture evolution, allowing us to reconstruct the history of selection.</p>

          <p><bold>Relative chromosome coverage.</bold> From generation 1302, genomic DNA from five haploid and five diploid strains was extracted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Gould1">[1]</xref> and sequenced in 100 bp single-end fragments using Illumina's HighSeq 2000. Library preps followed standard Illumina protocols (2011 Illumina, Inc., all rights reserved), with each strain individually barcoded. The resulting genomic sequence data were processed using Illumina's CASAVA-1.8.0. Specifically, configureBclToFastq.pl was used to convert to fastq and separate the sequences by barcode (allowing one mismatched basepair). configureAlignment.pl was then used to align each sequence to the yeast reference genome (scergenome.fasta downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database, http:<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Finally configureBuild.pl was used to obtain coverage data. Average coverage per mapped site was 69.9 across the strains (with a minimum coverage per site of 16.3 for strain colony 4 from 1302 generations). Plotted for each strain is the proportion of sequenced sites from each chromosome relative to the proportion of known mapped sites on that chromosome within the reference genome. Although differences in ploidy cannot be detected with this method, whole-chromosome aneuploids would lead to larger shifts than observed (e.g., an additional chromosome should lead to 2x coverage in haploids and 1.5x coverage in diploids). We conclude that these strains are not aneuploids for whole chromosomes, including the chromosome IX aneuploidy that characterized their founding strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026599-Gerstein1">[2]</xref>. (The excess coverage on chromosome XII was also observed in an independent sequencing analysis of two strains from the knock-out deletion set, suggesting a common indel of regions on this chromosome or a mapping artefact.)</p>
