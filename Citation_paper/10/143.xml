          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Adenosine is involved in several neurological and behavioral disorders including alcoholism. In cultured cell and animal studies, type 1 equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT1, <italic>slc29a1</italic>), which regulates adenosine levels, is known to regulate ethanol sensitivity and preference. Interestingly, in humans, the ENT1 (<italic>SLC29A1</italic>) gene contains a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (647 T/C; rs45573936) that might be involved in the functional change of ENT1.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Our functional analysis showed that prolonged ethanol exposure increased adenosine uptake activity of mutant cells (ENT1-216Thr) compared to wild-type (ENT1-216Ile) transfected cells, which might result in reduced extracellular adenosine levels. We found that mice lacking ENT1 displayed increased propensity to ethanol withdrawal seizures compared to wild-type littermates. We further investigated a possible association of the 647C variant with alcoholism and the history of alcohol withdrawal seizures in subjects of European ancestry recruited from two independent sites. Analyses of the combined data set showed an association of the 647C variant and alcohol dependence with withdrawal seizures at the nominally significant level.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Together with the functional data, our findings suggest a potential contribution of a genetic variant of ENT1 to the development of alcoholism with increased risk of alcohol withdrawal-induced seizures in humans.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Alcohol use disorders affect approximately 4–5% of the world population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Ezzati1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Robins1">[2]</xref> and impose major public health and social problems with substantial worldwide economic loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Harwood1">[3]</xref>. For the addicted individuals, the recovery process can be deterred by withdrawal symptoms such as alcohol withdrawal-induced seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Choi1">[4]</xref>. On a neurochemical level, the withdrawal symptoms are mainly attributed to an imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters. Alterations of GABA and glutamate levels have been demonstrated to be major contributors of withdrawal symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Liskow1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Tsai1">[6]</xref>. Recently, several lines of evidence indicated that adenosine promotes GABA release, but inhibits glutamate release in the central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Dunwiddie1">[7]</xref>. Consistently, adenosine is known to mediate some aspects of alcohol-induced behavior such as ataxia and hypolocomotion by depressing the neuronal firing activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Dar1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Dar2">[9]</xref>. Moreover, adenosine exerts anticonvulsant properties through adenosine receptors such as A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2A</sub> receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Boison1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Boison2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Dragunow1">[12]</xref>. Several preclinical and clinical trials have suggested that the regulation of adenosine levels might be effective in treating epileptic seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Kaplan1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Boison3">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Jacobson1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Nucleoside transporters regulate adenosine levels across the plasma membrane of neurons and glial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Dunwiddie1">[7]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrated that type 1 equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT1) encoded by <italic>Slc29a1</italic> gene is specifically inhibited by acute exposure to alcohol, leading to increased extracellular adenosine levels. However, ENT1 is no longer inhibited by alcohol after chronic alcohol treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Gordon1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Nagy1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Sapru1">[18]</xref>. Our previous studies showed that mice lacking ENT1 are less sensitive to the intoxicating effects of ethanol, and consume more alcohol compared to wild-type littermates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Choi2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Chen1">[20]</xref>. We also found increased glutamate neurotransmission in the striatum as a result of the deficit of presynaptic A<sub>1</sub> receptor function in the glutamatergic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Choi2">[19]</xref> or decreased glutamate uptake activity <italic>via</italic> excitatory amino acid transporter type 2 (EAAT2) in astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Wu1">[21]</xref>. ENT1 is an evolutionarily well-conserved membrane transporter that contains few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Leabman1">[22]</xref>. After sequencing 200 DNA samples from subjects with European ancestry, Osato et al. found only one nonsynonymous SNP in <italic>ENT1</italic>, 647C (ENT1-216Thr; rs45573936), with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.021 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Osato1">[23]</xref>. The function of human ENT1-216Thr in mammalian cells remained unknown. The association between ENT1-216Thr and human psychopathology including alcoholism has also not been studied. Here, we investigated the role of ENT1-216Thr by utilizing three approaches. First, since ENT1 is expressed in most cells, we investigated the pharmacological role of human ENT1-216Thr in primary cultured fibroblast cells derived from ENT1 null mice. Second, we examined ethanol withdrawal seizures in ENT1-null mice compared to wild type littermates. Finally, we tested for association of the ENT1-216Thr variant with alcohol dependence and alcoholism with withdrawal seizures.</p>

        <title>No Alterations in mRNA and Protein Expressions of ENT1-216Thr</title>
        <p>Since the 647C (ENT1-216Thr) is the only nonsynonymous SNP (rs45573936) located in transmembrane 6 of human ENT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which possibly alter the ENT1 function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Osato1">[23]</xref>, we decided to investigate the functional significance of the ENT1-216Thr. We first examined the mRNA and protein expression in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. We utilized MEF cells isolated from ENT1 null mice to eliminate the effects of the endogenous mouse ENT1. The MEF cells were transfected myc-tagged ENT1-216Ile and 216Thr constructs. In a realtime RT-PCR assay, the mRNA levels were similar between ENT1-216Ile and 216Thr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g001">Figure 1B, P</xref>&gt;0.05). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, protein levels were also similar between ENT1-216Ile and 216Thr (P&gt;0.05).</p>

        <p>Next we examined whether 216Thr alters protein expression in the plasma membrane. Since it was demonstrated that mutations in transmembrane domain 5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-SenGupta1">[24]</xref> and 8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Visser1">[25]</xref> of ENT1 may alter membrane expression of ENT1, we decided to examine whether amino acid changes from isoleucine to threonine in the transmembrane 6 of ENT1 alter membrane expression. Furthermore, the transmembrane 6 is directly linked to a large cytoplasmic domain of the ENT1 which contains several phosphorylation sites. To examine this possibility, we first added enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) to C-terminal part of ENT1-216Ile and 216Thr. We used sodium-potassium ATPase as a plasma membrane marker protein. We, however, found no significant difference of membrane expression between ENT1-216Ile and 216Thr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g001">Figure 1D, P</xref>&gt;0.05).</p>

        <p>We investigated pharmacological properties of ENT1-216Thr in transfected MEF cells using an ENT1-specific radioligand, [<sup>3</sup>H] NBMPR [S-(<italic>p</italic>-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine] as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Hammond1">[26]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, we found that the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<italic><sub>d</sub></italic>) of ENT1-216Thr (1.46±0.26 nM) was significantly higher compared to ENT1-216Ile (0.83±0.17 nM) (*P&lt;0.05), indicating that the substitution from isoleucine to threonine reduces the binding affinity to NBMPR. On the other hand, the maximal density of transporter sites (B<italic><sub>max</sub></italic>) was similar between ENT1-216Ile (4912±225.1 fmol/mg protein) and ENT1-216Thr (5008±213.2 fmol/mg protein) (P&gt;0.05), which is consistent with our Western and confocal microscope analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

        <p>Since mutation from Ile to Thr could change the hydrophobicity, we examined the hydrophilicity of transmembrane domain 6. This substitution increased hydrophilicity and likely altered the conformation of transmembrane domain 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), which might be account for the differential uptake activity in response to prolonged ethanol treatment. We also examined possible compensatory expression of other ENTs. The mRNA expression levels of ENT2, 3, and 4 were similar between ENT1 null mice and wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016331.s002">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that the point mutation from isoleucine to threonine in ENT1 increases uptake activity upon prolonged ethanol exposure, which might result in reduced extracellular nucleoside levels including adenosine.</p>

        <title>Increased Ethanol Withdrawal Seizure-like Phenotypes and Decreased Adenosine Levels in ENT1 Null Mice</title>
        <p>Previously, we found that a deficit of ENT1 in the mouse increases glutamate neurotransmission by decreasing adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated signaling in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Choi2">[19]</xref> or decreased glutamate uptake activity via excitatory amino acid transporter type 2 (EAAT2) in astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Wu1">[21]</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, ENT1 null mice showed a significant increased HIC compared to wild-type littermates [F(1,112) = 14.12, P&lt;0.001] and time [F(6,112) = 6.72, P&lt;0.001] effects, without a significant interaction between genotype and time. Further analysis of area under the curve also showed that ENT1 null mice are more susceptible to alcohol withdrawal seizures compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Since striatal adenosine receptors are implicated in ethanol-induced withdrawal seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Kaplan1">[13]</xref>, we measured total adenosine levels in the striatum using tandem mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with our electrophysiology data, we found that adenosine levels were significantly reduced in ENT1 null mice compared to wild-type littermates (P&lt;0.05).

        <title>Association of ENT1-216Thr with Alcoholism and the History of Alcohol Withdrawal Seizures</title>
        <p>We confirmed the presence of the 647C allele, which encodes the ENT1-216Thr variant by resequencing of PCR-amplificons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016331.s004">Table S1</xref>) from 50 alcoholic subjects. The other identified variants were located in non-coding regions, and none of the variants in the intron regions were located in putative sites for alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016331.s005">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016331.s003">Figure S2</xref>). We then genotyped the 647C (Ile216Thr) SNP in 140 additional DNA samples from alcohol-dependent subjects of European descent (total <italic>n</italic> = 190) recruited at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and 95 DNA samples from self-reported non-alcoholics of European descent available from the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ). A second sample of 351 alcohol-dependent subjects and 416 non-alcoholic controls from Munich, Germany was also genotyped for this SNP. Clinical characteristics of the study subjects are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016331.s006">Table S3</xref>. The ENT1 647T/C (Ile216Thr) SNP was successfully genotyped with a call rate of 100% for Mayo samples and 96% for Munich samples. There were no significant departures from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium in either sample (P&gt;0.05).</p>
        <p>Our functional study in cells with the 216Thr variant of ENT1 protein revealed that prolonged exposure to ethanol resulted in a statistically significant increase in the reuptake of adenosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g002">Figure 2</xref>), which might be a molecular basis of ethanol withdrawal seizures in humans because dysregulation of adenosine levels in the brain is implicated in seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Kaplan1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Boison3">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Jacobson1">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, we found that mice lacking ENT1 gene, which mimics the hypo-adenosine levels showed increased ethanol withdrawal seizures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the possibility of 647C SNP (216Thr) contributing predisposition to alcoholism characterized by alcohol withdrawal seizures. Among the total of 553 alcohol-dependent subjects included in this study, 79 subjects had a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures (Alc WS) without delirium tremens. Despite the relatively small number of these subjects, focusing on this phenotypically more homogeneous group may increase the power to detect relevant genetic effects.</p>
        <p>In the Mayo Clinic sample, the frequency of the ENT1-216Thr variant was twice as high in the group of alcohol-dependent subjects (MAF = 0.032) compared to the Coriell controls (MAF = 0.016), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.27) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0016331-t001">Table 1</xref>). Comparison between alcoholics with and without a history of seizures showed a trend of association of genotype with seizures [OR = 3.2, 95% CI = (0.8,13.8); P = 0.09] for Mayo subjects. However, there was no significant evidence of association for the Munich subjects (P = 0.70) or the combined group (P = 0.14), although a trend in the same direction was observed [OR = 1.3, 95% CI = (0.3,4.2) in the Munich sample and OR = 1.9, 95% CI = (0.8,4.6) in the combined analysis].</p>

Analysis of the combined Mayo Clinic and Munich samples suggest that the minor ENT1-216Thr allele is more common in alcoholics than in non-alcoholics, and even more common among alcohol dependent subjects with a history of withdrawal seizures, with an odds ratio of 2.51 [95% CI = (1.03, 6.12), P = 0.042] for alcoholism with withdrawal seizures.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study suggests that a functional variant of human ENT1 gene might contribute to alcoholism with with increased risk of alcohol withdrawal seizures. A recent human study of screening with 1350 variants in 130 genes demonstrated that one genetic variant (rs731780) located in an intron of ENT1 (<italic>SLC29A1</italic>) showed a significant association with heroin addiction in an African-American population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Levran1">[29]</xref>, attesting for clinical implication of ENT1 in alcohol use disorders and other substance addictions.</p>
      <p>Our functional studies using primary cultured cells with the 216Thr variant of ENT1 protein revealed that prolonged exposure to ethanol resulted in a statistically significant increase in the reuptake of adenosine. If the 647 T/C substitution displays the same effect in neuronal cells (increasing uptake activity upon prolonged alcohol exposure), it may cause reduced extracellular adenosine levels and subsequent increase of glutamate tone in the brain, which might be a molecular basis of ethanol withdrawal seizures in humans. Consistently, agonists of both adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Kaplan1">[13]</xref> and NMDA receptor antagonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Rossetti1">[28]</xref> are known to reduce ethanol-induced withdrawal seizures in mice. Previously, we observed decreased adenosine tones in ENT1-null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Choi2">[19]</xref>, which contribute to decreased levels of ethanol response and excessive alcohol consumption along with increased glutamate neurotransmission in the striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Choi2">[19]</xref>. Striatal glutamate signaling is known to be involved in ethanol withdrawal seizure-like phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Rossetti1">[28]</xref>. Interestingly, our results indicate that increased uptake function of ENT1-216Thr variant upon alcohol exposure could reduce extracellular or synaptic adenosine levels. Controversially, absence of ENT1 also appears to decrease extracellular adenosine levels in the brain. Since ENT1 is a bidirectional transporter for nucleosides including adenosine and inosine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Dunwiddie1">[7]</xref>, ablation of the ENT1 gene would significantly slow down dynamics of adenosine exchange across the plasma membrane, which may result in low levels of extracellular adenosine and reduced adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor's function in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Choi2">[19]</xref>. Paradoxically, therefore, increased uptake activity of ENT1 could have a similar consequence as in ENT1 null mice. Moreover, increased alcohol withdrawal seizures in ENT1 null mice extend the phenotypic similarity between ENT1 null mice model and the clinical presentation of alcohol dependence. A possible explanation of the relationships between decreased adenosine neurotransmission, increased alcohol consumption as well as susceptibility to alcohol withdrawal seizure, is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g004">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

      <p>The functional analysis of the ENT1-216Thr in yeast showed no significant differences in basal [<sup>3</sup>H] inosine uptake by nucleoside transporter inhibitors such as ribavirin, cytarabine, and gemcitabine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Osato1">[23]</xref>. Although the uptake activities were tested in yeast inactivated endogenous nucleoside transporter, <italic>FUI1</italic>, it has certain limitations to examine the role of mammalian plasma membrane transporter because of different membrane structure, intracellular kinases, and posttranslational modification such as glycosylation which could alter the transporting activity of ENT1. In our study, therefore, we examined the function of ENT1-216Thr in primary cultured fibroblast cells (MEF), which were isolated from ENT1 null mice to rule out possible complications of endogenous ENT1 expression. Moreover, mRNA expression levels of ENT2, 3, and 4, were similar in MEF cells derived from ENT1 null and wild type littermates, indicating that the result was not due to compensatory effects of other ENTs. Also, we found similar plasma membrane expression between ENT1-216Ile and 216Thr in MEF cells, suggesting that membrane trafficking is not the main factor for transporter activity.</p>
      <p>The ENT1-216Thr variant exhibited an increased K<italic><sub>d</sub></italic> value compared to that of the wild type ENT1-216Ile. This mutation may alter the folding of ENT1, thereby reducing the uptake and binding activity of the transporter. Also, the increased hydrophilicity in transmembrane domains 3 through 6 of ENT1 might alter nucleoside and its analog's transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-SenGupta1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Visser1">[25]</xref>. The increased hydrophilicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Hopp1">[30]</xref> and decreased hydrophobicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Kyte1">[31]</xref> values in the helical wheel projection of transmembrane 6 in ENT1 suggest that the substitution from isoleucine to threonine likely changes the conformation of transmembrane domain 6. Subsequently, the threonine residue in the transmembrane domain 6 could alter the third intracellular loop of ENT1, which contains several phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC), especially PKCδ or ε <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Coe1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Coe2">[33]</xref>, and casein kinase 2 (CK2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Bone1">[34]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed a down-regulation of PKCδ or ε decrease ENT1 dependent uptake activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Coe1">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, in cultured neural cells, chronic ethanol exposure increases levels of PKCδ or ε <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Messing1">[35]</xref>, suggesting that increased uptake activity of ENT1-216Thr in response to chronic ethanol exposure, in part, could be mediated by increased PKCδ or ε activity. Since recent findings demonstrated that mice lacking PKCε consume less alcohol and display increased sensitivity to acute intoxicating effects of alcohol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Choi3">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Hodge1">[37]</xref>, while PKCδ null mice show decreased sensitivity to alcohol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Choi4">[38]</xref>, it is possible that upregulation of PKCε might be responsible for increased uptake activity of ENT1-216Thr compared to that of ENT1-216Ile.</p>
      <p>Ethanol induced increased uptake activity both for [<sup>3</sup>H] adenosine and [<sup>3</sup>H] inosine in ENT1-216Thr, which suggests that ethanol may regulate ENT1 function specifically as demonstrated by several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Nagy1">[17]</xref>. Although we observed that an increase of inosine uptake (35.8%) is higher than adenosine uptake (13.8%), this difference might be due to the nucleoside stability since the half-life of adenosine is relatively short (10–30 sec) compared to other nucleosides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Ballarin1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Nagel1">[40]</xref>. In cultured cells, it has been known that acute ethanol exposure increases extracellular adenosine by inhibiting ENT1 uptake activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Nagy1">[17]</xref>, thereby mediating ataxic or sedative effects of ethanol through adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Dunwiddie1">[7]</xref>. However, chronic ethanol exposure desensitized the adenosine increase by ENT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Nagy2">[41]</xref>, which could contribute to ethanol tolerance. We found that the decreased adenosine activity observed in ENT1 null mice appears to be similar to that of chronic ethanol-induced increase of uptake activity in ENT1-216Thr. Consistently, ENT1 null mice and human alcohol-dependent subjects who carry ENT1-216Thr are able to consume higher amounts of alcohol and are susceptible to ethanol-induced withdrawal seizures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016331-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Deletion of the ENT1 gene in mice mimics the state of chronic ethanol exposure, showing decreased levels of ethanol response and excessive alcohol consumption along with decreased synaptic adenosine function and increased glutamate neurotransmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Choi2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Chen1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Alcoholism is a complex multifactorial disease with genetic and environmental components. Identification of contributing factors is challenging, as the effect size of each contribution is likely to be modest. It is expected that focusing on the most severe cases of alcoholism may increase the power to detect genetic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Schork1">[42]</xref>. Presence of seizures during alcohol withdrawal in mice is widely considered an indicator of severity of alcohol withdrawal and increased glutamate levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Tsai2">[43]</xref>. In humans, presence of seizures is also regarded as a sign of severe withdrawal and advanced stage of alcoholism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Duka1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Schmidt1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Schuckit1">[46]</xref>. Thus, selection of this phenotype is reasonable from both genetic and pathophysiological points of view. Consistent with our hypothesis, the 647C variant of the human ENT1 gene was found to be associated with alcoholism with the history of alcohol withdrawal seizures in our first human sample. This same trend was observed in the replication sample but not at a statistically significant level. We performed analysis of the combined data from the two sites using logistic regression with a “site” covariate. We also analyzed the data from the two samples using meta-analysis, which led to similar results with OR (95% CI) = 2.55 (0.97–6.67), P = 0.056.</p>
      <p>The human association component of our study is not free from limitations, which include retrospective data collection and reliance on self-report. The retrospective study design precluded us from matching alcoholic study groups on a number of potentially important parameters. Retrospective data collection also poses the risk that important clinical information may be misrepresented. However, among the many possible phenotypes in alcohol dependence, the withdrawal seizure is one of the most obvious and physically noticeable phenotypes for which patients' self-report can be used reliably. Although not perfect, retrospective data collection is commonly used in clinical and genetic studies focused on this phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016331-Schuckit1">[46]</xref>. In an effort to increase the reliability of our data we only included subjects who were able to describe the critically important components of the seizure episode (seizure activity with loss of consciousness) based on information provided by witnesses. Another limitation is the difference between study samples. Subjects recruited in Germany were younger and reported higher alcohol consumption (both on average and maximum per 24 h). In addition, screening for presence of the medical and/or neurological causes for seizures during index episode was performed for subjects recruited in the Mayo sample. These discrepancies between the two study samples might have diminished our ability to detect association between ENT1 647C variant and alcohol withdrawal seizures at a statistically significant level. Nevertheless, combined results from the two independent recruiting sites indicate that the ENT1-216Thr variant may contribute to the risk of alcoholism with withdrawal seizures in humans.</p>
      <p>In summary, our studies suggest that ENT1-216Thr appears to contribute to the genetic predisposition to alcoholism with an increased risk of withdrawal-related seizures. Considering the complexity of genetic and environmental contribution to alcohol dependence, this finding is a step towards understanding the genetic predisposition to alcohol-related phenotypes.</p>
