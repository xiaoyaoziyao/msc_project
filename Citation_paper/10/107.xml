Yet, numerous questions remain about the transferred genes, their function, quantity and frequency. The extent to which genetic transformation by exogenous DNA has occurred over evolutionary time was initially addressed by an <italic>in silico</italic> approach using the complete genome sequence of the <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> GMI1000 strain. Methods based on phylogenetic reconstruction of prokaryote homologous genes families detected 151 genes (13.3%) of foreign origin in the <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> genome and tentatively identified their bacterial origin. These putative transfers were analyzed in comparison to experimental transformation tests involving 18 different genomic DNA positions in the genome as sites for homologous or homeologous recombination. Significant transformation frequency differences were observed among these positions tested regardless of the overall genomic divergence of the <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> strains tested as recipients. The genomic positions containing the putative exogenous DNA were not systematically transformed at the highest frequencies. The two genomic “hot spots”, which contain <italic>recA</italic> and <italic>mutS</italic> genes, exhibited transformation frequencies from 2 to more than 4 orders of magnitude higher than positions associated with other genes depending on the recipient strain. These results support the notion that the bacterial cell is equipped with active mechanisms to modulate acquisition of new DNA in different genomic positions. Bio-informatics study correlated recombination “hot-spots” to the presence of Chi-like signature sequences with which recombination might be preferentially initiated. The fundamental role of HGT is certainly not limited to the critical impact that the very rare foreign genes acquired mainly by chance can have on the bacterial adaptation potential. The frequency to which HGT with homologous and homeologous DNA happens in the environment might have led the bacteria to hijack DNA repair mechanisms in order to generate genetic diversity without losing too much genomic stability.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded in part by the EU project TRANSBAC (QLK3-CT-2001-02242, 5th RTD Program) and in part by the ANR project PLOBEN (ANR-05-POGM-004-01).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fundamental impact of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in shaping the structure of bacterial genomes was only recently demonstrated by the analysis of numerous complete bacterial genome sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Nakamura1">[1]</xref>. The detection of relatively recently acquired genes is possible because the laterally transferred genes have compositional features that distinguish them from vertically inherited genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Lawrence1">[2]</xref>. However, finding a significant proportion of transferred genes in a bacterial genome does not mean that the entire gene transfer process that leads to the stable inheritance of new genes occurs frequently in the environment. Actually, the frequency of gene transfer between phylogenetically remote bacteria is expected to be low due to the requirement for several successive and rare events including colonization of the same environmental niche by donor and recipient bacteria, physical contact, compatibility for conjugation and transduction or DNA persistence and competence development when DNA is directly taken up by natural transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Paget1">[3]</xref>. Foreign DNA that has successfully penetrated a bacterial cell is integrated into the host genome by illegitimate recombination only if it escapes degradation by the restriction-modification systems (RM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Kobayashi1">[4]</xref> and the methyl-mismatch repair (MMR) system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Matic1">[5]</xref>. Due to these successive requirements, HGT with foreign DNA is unpredictable yet a single event occurring even once during bacterial evolution could fix a new trait in a bacterial lineage if the overall fitness is increased.</p><p>When donor DNA originates from an organism closely related to the recipient, recombination between similar or partially divergent (called homeologous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Humbert1">[6]</xref>) sequences is much more likely. These transfer events will ensure genetic coherence and slow diversification when occurring within a group of closely related bacteria and will also promote environmental adaptation by sharing point mutations or transposon- and IS- mediated genetic rearrangements among the bacterial population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Torsvik1">[7]</xref>. However, bioinformatics methods cannot easily detect this new genetic information (unless significant numbers of individuals from the same species were completely sequenced) due to a lack of compositional features differentiating the donated DNA and the recipient genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Ragan1">[8]</xref>. In this case, the frequency of DNA transfer, the differences in transfer potential of different genes, and the potential impact on population fitness can be addressed by experimental approaches.</p><p>In this paper, we combined <italic>in silico</italic> and experimental approaches to study differences between these two types of HGT in bacteria. We used <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> as a model because of the evidence indicating a fundamental role of HGT in this plant pathogen's evolution. More than 7% of the genome was found to be encompassed by regions in which codon usage differed significantly from codon usage in the rest of the genome. In addition, most of these regions exhibited a base composition differing significantly from the G+C content for the entire genome indicating a foreign origin for these sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Salanoubat1">[9]</xref>. Other authors using the Bayesian method estimated that about 16% of the genome was acquired by HGT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Nakamura1">[1]</xref>. Our first goal was to use alternate methods, including phylogenetic reconstruction of prokaryote homologous gene families and calculation of two codon usage indices to complete the list of genes acquired by HGT. These methods would be less biased than intrinsic codon usage-based approaches, which tend to overestimate the number of transferred genes, and in addition would identify putative donor microorganisms. These <italic>in silico</italic> studies were complemented by natural transformation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001055-g001">Figure 1</xref>) in order to determine if and how this bacterium regulates acquisition of the DNA, including the genes detected as recently acquired by the bioinformatics analyses, that originates from the same or very closely related strains. <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> seems particularly appropriate for addressing these evolutionary questions because it is a naturally transformable bacterium whose cells use natural transformation to exchange genes at significant frequencies under <italic>in planta</italic> conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Bertolla1">[10]</xref>. Our hypothesis is that <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> bacterial cells are subjected to a constant flux of more or less homologous DNA in the open environment and that this flux might have led to the adaptive use of (“spandrel”) of DNA acquisition regulation mechanisms in order to generate genetic diversity without losing too much genomic stability. The term “spandrel” refers to the adaptive use of a function selected for another purpose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Gould1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Metzgar1">[12]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0001055-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001055.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design to measure recombination rate at different positions of the <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> chromosome.</title><p>Target positions on the chromosome (TCP) and on the megaplasmid (TMP) were identified and amplified by PCR.

Interestingly, the DNA positions that were classified as “hot spots” with GMI1000 as recipient were also those for which transformation-recombination frequencies remained the highest and changed the least. Even with the least related strain (CFBP2957), transformation frequencies at the “hot spots” were only one order of magnitude lower than those for the homologous GMI1000, while frequencies decreased by 4 orders of magnitude for the DNA positions that transformed all strains at the lowest frequency.</p><p>Frequency differences are not apparently related to variable sizes of donor DNA fragments since transformation tests carried out with the plasmids (2kb in size) provided results consistent with those obtained with chromosomal fragments. PCR primers were designed to amplify a 2 kb long DNA fragment that was subsequently cloned into the plasmids. The resulting 1 kb long DNA fragments that flanked both sides of the marker gene were significantly longer than the minimal length necessary for efficient homologous recombination. Moreover, there was no theoretical limitation in the length of DNA fragments when chromosomal DNA with the marker gene inserted in the targeted position was used to transform the wild strain. Frequency variation could not be related to DNA physical or chemical parameters either. These results would indicate that differences in transfer frequency are only related to the nucleotide sequence of the DNA positions on which homologous recombination occurs. This would suggest that the genes present in a bacterial genome do not exhibit the same <italic>sensu stricto</italic> potential to be transferred even into a new isogenic host.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Involvement of Chi-like sequences</title><p>The sequences in the targeted genomic positions were analyzed and Chi-like (‘5-cGCCGAAc-3’) sequences were detected that might explain differences in homologous and homeologous recombination frequencies. The experimental results obtained with the four recipient strains were in general agreement, and thus, strengthened the hypothesis for the involvement of Chi-like sequences during recombination initiation. The highest transfer frequencies were found for fragments that contained more than two Chi-like sequences, thus, indicating that accumulation of these sequences could create “hot spots” for homologous recombination. Our results indicate that the Chi-like sequences are not distributed randomly in the <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> chromosome confirming what was already reported in other bacteria (e. g. <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> and <italic>Lactococcus lactis)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-ElKaroui1">[34]</xref>.

Therefore, the reduced differences found between the lowest and the highest transformation frequencies with genomic borne fragments could be explained by the involvement of Chi-like sequences at some unknown distance upstream.</p><p>In <italic>E. coli,</italic> Chi sequences are recombinational hotspots at which enzymes bind preferentially to repair DNA damaged by ionizing radiations or by the collapse of a replication fork when passing single-strand nicks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Kowalczykowski1">[35]</xref>. The ends of the broken DNA on double strands are processed by the multi-functional enzyme complex RecBCD involving successively a helicase activity to split the duplex into its component strands and a nuclease activity to digest them. At a Chi site, the nuclease activity is attenuated and the RecBCD loads RecA onto the 3′ tail of the DNA to initiate recombination.

By analogy to <italic>E. coli</italic>, damaged endogenous DNA reparation efficiency is certainly increased by presence of Chi-like sequences to initiate recombination. However, genomic stability of these positions could also benefit from their spread at high frequency among bacteria that reduces the risk of genetic drift by point mutations in separate lineages. In addition, a recombination “hot spot” in the <italic>mutS</italic> gene is in agreement with the hypothesis involving HGT as a mechanism for <italic>mutS</italic> negative mutators to re-acquire a functional <italic>mutS</italic> copy to return to a more stable wild type phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Brown1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Denamur1">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Surprisingly, the genomic positions containing mobile elements, such as insertion sequences, prophages and transposons that have developed specific mechanisms to displace from place to place within and among genomes exhibited a transformation potential significantly lower than the hot spots that carry <italic>mutS</italic> and <italic>recA</italic> genes.

These data would indicate that acquisition of foreign genes might not be regulated as could be <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> genes but would rather result from the combination of several events happening mainly by chance and at very low frequency including the uptake of exogenous DNA and its integration and/or by rearrangement in the genome post-HGT.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>The two sides of HGT in bacteria</title><p>According to bioinformatics analysis of genome sequences (this study) and inoculation experiments in plant tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Bertolla1">[10]</xref> <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> like other bacteria seems to use two complementary HGT-based strategies to optimize adaptation. The first one is based on acquisition at high frequency of DNA from more or less closely related cells. This type of HGT would permit on one hand to maintain stability and integrity in some important DNA positions, a constant DNA homogenization reducing the risk of genetic drift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Torsvik1">[7]</xref>, and on another hand to spread potentially beneficial mutations efficiently among the population. However, our data demonstrate that the various DNA positions are transferred at significantly different frequencies indicating a possible regulation mechanism. As for other functions in bacteria, the fundamental evolutionary question is whether this property might have been specifically selected to increase adaptation potential or if it might be the side effect of cellular mechanisms in charge of DNA repair. Whatever the response (about the evolutionary process), bacteria in the open environment are confronted with genes that do not transfer at the same frequency and thus with evolutionary implications that cannot yet be precisely evaluated. The high frequency with which the preferentially transferred DNA positions are transformed in other strains indicates that such HGT events must have a strong impact on genome evolution and must significantly contribute to the adaptation potential of the bacteria.</p><p>The second adaptive strategy of bacteria is to acquire genes from unrelated bacteria. The <italic>in silico</italic> analyses of the <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> genome sequence detected genes that were laterally transferred from a wide range of remotely related bacteria. Their fixation suggests that they also contributed to increase the adaptation potential of their new host. However, our experimental transformation results do not indicate that these laterally acquired DNA positions belong to the transformation-recombination “hot spots” detected for other typical <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> genes. This might mean that their acquisition resulted from a hypothetical contact with a donor bacteria and a successful integration by an extremely rare illegitimate recombination event. The likelihood that this was directly related to the active Chi-like sequences based mechanism, which leads to some other genes to be exchanged at high frequency, seems to be low. However, successful transfer to genomic “hot spots” and subsequent mobility to more stable genomic positions through mobile elements such as insertion sequences cannot be disproved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> strains</title><p>The four strains used in this study are classified in the <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> species complex and belong to phylotype I (GMI1000, CFBP2968), phylotype II (CFBP2957) and phylotype III (NCPPB332) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001055-Guidot1">[18]</xref>.
