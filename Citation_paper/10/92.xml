<title/>
<p>Tracking the evolution of thermostability in resurrected ancestors of a heat-tolerant extremophile protein and its less heat tolerant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> homologue shows how thermostability has probably explored different mechanisms of protein stabilization over evolutionary time.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Proteins from thermophiles are generally more thermostable than their mesophilic homologs, but little is known about the evolutionary process driving these differences. Here we attempt to understand how the diverse thermostabilities of bacterial ribonuclease H1 (RNH) proteins evolved. RNH proteins from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (ttRNH) and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ecRNH) share similar structures but differ in melting temperature (<italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>) by 20°C. ttRNH's greater stability is caused in part by the presence of residual structure in the unfolded state, which results in a low heat capacity of unfolding (<italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic>) relative to ecRNH. We first characterized RNH proteins from a variety of extant bacteria and found that <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> correlates with the species' growth temperatures, consistent with environmental selection for stability. We then used ancestral sequence reconstruction to statistically infer evolutionary intermediates along lineages leading to ecRNH and ttRNH from their common ancestor, which existed approximately 3 billion years ago. Finally, we synthesized and experimentally characterized these intermediates. The shared ancestor has a melting temperature between those of ttRNH and ecRNH; the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>s of intermediate ancestors along the ttRNH lineage increased gradually over time, while the ecRNH lineage exhibited an abrupt drop in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> followed by relatively little change. To determine whether the underlying mechanisms for thermostability correlate with the changes in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>, we measured the thermodynamic basis for stabilization—<italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> and other thermodynamic parameters—for each of the ancestors. We observed that, while the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> changes smoothly, the mechanistic basis for stability fluctuates over evolutionary time. Thus, even while overall stability appears to be strongly driven by selection, the proteins explored a wide variety of mechanisms of stabilization, a phenomenon we call “thermodynamic system drift.” This suggests that even on lineages with strong selection to increase stability, proteins have wide latitude to explore sequence space, generating biophysical diversity and potentially opening new evolutionary pathways.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The biophysical properties of proteins must adjust to accommodate environmental temperatures because of the narrow range over which any given protein sequence can remain folded and functional. We compared the evolution of homologous bacterial enzymes (ribonucleases H1) from two lineages: one from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which live at moderate temperatures, the other from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>, which live at extremely high temperatures. Our aim was to investigate how these structurally homologous proteins can have such different thermostabilities, unfolding at temperatures that are 20°C apart. We used bioinformatics to reconstruct the sequences of ancestral proteins along each lineage, synthesized the proteins in the lab, and experimentally traced the evolution of ribonuclease H1 stability. While thermostability appears to have been strongly shaped by selection, the biophysical mechanisms used to tune protein stability appear to have varied throughout evolutionary history; this suggests that proteins have wide latitude to explore different mechanisms of stabilization, generating biophysical diversity and opening up new evolutionary pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein thermostability is almost certainly tuned by natural selection. The fold of a protein is sensitive to denaturation at high temperatures: above the melting temperature (<italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>) proteins lose structure, function, and become prone to aggregation. In laboratory evolution experiments, selection for growth at elevated temperatures leads to increases in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Counago1">[1]</xref>. In natural systems, proteins from thermophilic organisms tend to have higher <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>s than homologs from their mesophilic counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Gromiha1">[2]</xref>. Finally, there are good theoretical reasons to believe that natural selection, but not neutral drift, can lead to a sustained increase in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>: because random amino acid substitutions tend to decrease protein stability, the final <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> of a protein is expected to be the result of a balance between selection to maintain adequate stability and mutational pressure that drives stability downward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Taverna1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Given the functional importance of thermostability, as well as its utility in protein engineering, many studies have characterized the mechanisms by which stability is achieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Kumar1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Razvi1">[5]</xref>. Detailed comparisons of mesophilic and thermophilic homologs have revealed many differences that increase <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>, such as novel interactions in the folded state and residual structure in the unfolded state. These underlying biophysical differences, and the sequence differences that encode them, are usually interpreted as the direct product of selection during adaption to high-temperature environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Razvi1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Kumar2">[6]</xref>. Such narratives regarding natural selection, however, are essentially “just-so” stories with little or no empirical justification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Gould1">[7]</xref>: many of the mechanistic differences between proteins could reflect pleiotropic association with other properties, neutral drift, or other evolutionary processes.</p>
<p>The extent to which <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> and the mechanisms that determine it are driven by the same selective pressures can be assessed by measuring the co-variation of these protein properties over evolutionary time. If they correlate, the simplest explanation is that the same selective pressure shapes both the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> and the mechanism of stabilization simultaneously. If, in contrast, the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> and mechanism of stabilization vary independently, then selection for stability need not imply selection for mechanism. This would, in turn, imply that proteins can explore alternate stabilization mechanisms by neutral drift or selection for some other phenotype while maintaining stability.</p>
<p>A strategy to measure this correlation is to trace and compare the historical evolution of thermostability in mesophilic and thermophilic homologs of the same protein. Such ancient evolutionary trajectories and trends can be studied using the technique of ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR), which uses the sequences and phylogenetic relationships of modern proteins to statistically infer the sequences of ancient proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Akanuma1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Risso1">[13]</xref>. The ancient proteins can then be synthesized and experimentally characterized, providing a set of “vertical” comparisons along an evolutionary trajectory, rather than purely “horizontal” comparisons between modern homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Harms1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we traced the evolutionary and mechanistic origins of the thermodynamic differences between mesophilic and thermophilic ribonuclease H1 (RNH) proteins. RNH is a nonspecific endonuclease that degrades RNA within RNA:DNA hybrids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Tadokoro1">[15]</xref>. It exhibits a broad taxonomic distribution and is highly amenable to phylogenetic investigation. Further, the energetic similarities and differences between the mesophile <italic>E. coli</italic> RNH (ecRNH) and its homolog from the thermophile <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> (ttRNH) have been studied extensively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Hollien1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Robic1">[19]</xref>. Here, we measured the stability of a wide variety of extant RNH proteins and demonstrated that their melting temperatures and global stabilities correlate with their organismal growth temperatures, consistent with selection to maintain sufficient stability at the organisms' growth temperatures. We then reconstructed ancestral proteins along the evolutionary lineages that connect ecRNH and ttRNH. We found that, while <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> exhibits a smooth trend along both lineages, the thermodynamic underpinnings of stability fluctuate across a large range of values. These results imply that the evolutionary processes that shape thermostability and the mechanism by which stability is achieved are uncoupled, even within a protein family.</p>

<title>The Stabilities of Extant RNH Proteins Correlate with Environmental Temperature</title>
<p>To characterize the relationship between RNH thermostability and environmental temperature (<italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic>), we measured the energetics of ten modern RNH proteins from organisms with a wide variety of optimal growth temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Tadokoro2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Ratcliff1">[21]</xref>. Growth temperatures were culled from the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Parte1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Iversen1">[23]</xref>, with the exception of two mesophiles for which laboratory culture temperatures were used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Darby1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Taghavi1">[25]</xref>. We determined the proteins' melting temperatures by carrying out thermally induced denaturation studies monitoring the circular dichroism (CD) signal at 222 nm (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s009">Table S1</xref>). We observe a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.84) between <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> and <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s009">Table S1</xref>), despite uncertainty in the exact values of environmental growth temperature. Overall, for every 10°C increase in growth temperature, the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> increases by about 7–8°C. This trend remains even after removing the most thermostable protein, which is from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>There is a strong correlation between the melting temperature of RNH and its host organism's growth temperature, suggesting thermostability is product of environmental selection. See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s009">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<p>We also measured the global stabilities (<italic>ΔG<sub>unf</sub></italic>)—the free energy of unfolding, which determines the ratio of unfolded and folded molecules at a given temperature—for a subset of these proteins over a range of temperatures. Unfolding free energies were measured by GdmCl-induced denaturation monitored by the change in CD signal at 222 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s009">Table S1</xref>) and fit using a two-state linear extrapolation model. We found that <italic>ΔG<sub>unf</sub></italic> was similar for all proteins at their environmental temperatures, ranging from 4.6–8.1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> (average 6.28±1.5 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>). Together, these results suggest that RNH stability has evolved to accommodate diverse environmental temperatures across bacterial taxa.</p>

<title>Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction along Two RNH Lineages</title>
<p>We then used ASR to trace the divergence of the mesophilic ecRNH and thermophilic ttRNH from their common ancestor. Using 409 representative bacterial RNH protein sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s001">Figure S1</xref>), we inferred the best-fit substitution model and maximum likelihood phylogeny. We then reconstructed the amino acid sequence at seven ancestral nodes along two lineages starting from their most recent common ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Anc1 represents the most recent common ancestor of ecRNH and ttRNH and is estimated to have existed approximately 3 billion years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Hedges1">[26]</xref>. The other resurrected sequences are evolutionary intermediates at successive phylogenetic nodes along the lineage from Anc1 to ecRNH (AncA through AncD) and from Anc1 to ttRNH (Anc2 and Anc3). Intermediate nodes were chosen for their strong statistical support and for being spaced similarly along the two lineages: Anc2 and AncA each share 92% identity with Anc1, whereas Anc3 and AncB are 77% and 70% identical to Anc1, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We performed the ASR using this unrooted bacterial phylogeny. To order the ancestral nodes in time, we rooted the tree by adding 45 archaeal RNH sequences to the bacterial alignment. The archaeal sequences formed a well-supported clade, providing an unambiguous root. The relative relationships of ecRNH, ttRNH, and their ancestors remained unchanged upon the addition of the archaeal sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s002">Figure S2A</xref>).</p>

<p>The inferred ancestral sequences are well supported, with mean posterior probabilities per site ranging from 0.86 to 0.98 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s010">Table S2</xref>). Most of the ambiguously reconstructed sites are in the C-terminus, which is poorly conserved among extant RNH proteins, varies in length, is largely unstructured or missing in crystal structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Yang1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Ishikawa1">[28]</xref>, and can be deleted from ecRNH without affecting function <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Haruki1">[29]</xref>. Most sites outside the C-terminus were reconstructed without ambiguity, and the handful of plausible alternative reconstructions (defined as those having posterior probability &gt;0.3) were virtually all chemically similar to the maximum likelihood reconstruction.</p>
<p>As with all ASR studies, the reconstructed ancestral sequences are statistical approximations rather than certainties: the total posterior probability that the ancestral sequences are precisely correct ranged from 2.6×10<sup>−9</sup> to 9.8×10<sup>−3</sup>. As discussed below, we addressed this uncertainty in two ways. First, we directly tested the impact of statistical uncertainty on our estimation of <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> by experimentally characterizing ten alternative reconstructions for the deepest node, Anc1. Second, by resurrecting numerous sequences along two diverging lineages and focusing on broad trends rather than the properties of a single ancestor, we minimized the likelihood that statistical error would account for our overall observations.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Resurrected RNH Proteins Are Folded and Functional</title>
<p>Our first goal was to verify that the reconstructed ancestral proteins behaved like members of the RNH family by characterizing their structural and functional properties. Using far-UV CD, we found that all ancestors are folded at 25°C and exhibit secondary structure consistent with extant RNHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We determined the crystal structure of one representative ancestor, AncC, at 1.3 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s011">Table S3</xref>) and found that it adopts the canonical RNH fold, superimposing with the ecRNH structure with average C<sub>α</sub> RMSD of 0.8 Å and with the ttRNH structure with an average C<sub>α</sub> RMSD of 1.3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, we assayed the reconstructed ancestral proteins for their ability to degrade RNA:DNA hybrids using a simple hyperchromic assay to follow RNA cleavage and nucleotide release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Keck1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Crooke1">[31]</xref>: all ancestors were active at 25°C, demonstrating that they are all functional ribonucleases H (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s003">Figure S3A</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>T. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> Lineages Exhibit Opposite Trends in Thermostability</title>
<p>Trends in protein stability over the two evolutionary lineages were determined by measuring the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>s of the ancestral proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Anc1 has a <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> of 77°C, which is intermediate between ecRNH (68°C) and ttRNH (88°C).

The temperature-induced unfolding of ancestors along the mesophilic lineage becomes irreversible starting with AncB and continuing through AncC, AncD, and ecRNH.

<p>To verify that these trends were robust to uncertainty in the ASR, we experimentally characterized ten alternate reconstructions of Anc1. We generated these sequences computationally by randomly sampling at each site in the sequence an amino acid from the posterior distribution of states at that site, excluding implausible states with posterior probabilities &lt;0.2. The resampled ancestors differed from each other and from the maximum likelihood sequence by two to 11 amino acids, with a mean of seven differences. We then synthesized coding DNAs, expressed the proteins, and measured the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> of each resampled ancestor. The <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> for the ten alternate versions of Anc1 ranged from 75.6°C to 80.5°C with a mean of 78.2°C, comparable to the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> for the maximum likelihood Anc1 of 76.8°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s009">Table S1</xref>).

<title>Analysis of the Global Stability Curve Reveals the Mechanism of Stabilization</title>
<p>Our previous work revealed that <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> of ttRNH is lower than that of ecRNH (1.9 versus 2.9 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>) because it retains residual structure in the unfolded state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-GuzmanCasado1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Robic2">[33]</xref>; this difference contributes 10.7°C to the observed difference in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> between the two proteins. This stabilization mechanism might be adaptive, allowing the protein to achieve a high <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> while maintaining conformational flexibility and a moderate <italic>ΔG</italic> at its growth temperature; residual structure in the unfolded state could also help minimize aggregation under unfolding conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Razvi1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Hollien2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Robic2">[33]</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that the evolution of residual structure in the unfolded state was the mechanism by which adaptive thermostability evolved along the thermophilic lineage.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis and elucidate the mechanisms by which stability was tuned along these lineages, we determined the global protein stability curve for each ancestor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This curve, a plot of <italic>ΔG<sub>unf</sub></italic> against temperature, can be determined by performing chemical denaturation experiments across a wide range of temperatures. It exhibits a characteristic parabolic shape that is described by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001994.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001994.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>This equation defines the temperature-dependent relationship between the global stability of a protein (<italic>ΔG<sub>unf</sub></italic>) and three key thermodynamic parameters: the temperature of maximum stability (<italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic>), the change in enthalpy upon unfolding at <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> (<italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic>), and the change in heat capacity upon unfolding (<italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic>). The <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>, or thermal melting temperature, is the right-most <italic>x</italic>-intercept of this curve. By fitting the parameters of the equation to our data, we can extract detailed thermodynamic and mechanistic information about each ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g004">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s013">Table S5</xref>), including evidence for residual structure in the denatured state. Then, by looking at trends in these parameters over evolutionary time, we can identify changes that led to the evolution of thermostability.</p>

<p>Modification of each of the three thermodynamic parameters corresponds to a specific mechanism of stabilization and can be understood graphically as altering the features of the curve to increase the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). First, increasing <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic> causes the curve to move upwards along the <italic>ΔG</italic> axis; this is easily achieved by adding favorable interactions in the folded state. Such changes in enthalpy are a common basis for change in stability upon mutation, as small changes in side-chain functional groups can result in large changes in native-state interactions. Second, depressing <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> broadens the stability curve, increasing <italic>ΔG</italic> at temperatures above or below <italic>T</italic><sub>s</sub>. <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> depends largely on the difference in protein-water interactions between the unfolded and folded states; a variant that creates residual structure in the unfolded state will decrease the difference in protein-water interactions between the unfolded and folded states and thereby decrease <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic>. Third, increasing <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> moves the curve to the right along the <italic>x-</italic>axis. <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> is relatively insensitive to mutations and is therefore not considered a common mechanism of stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Baldwin1">[34]</xref>.</p>

<title>Different Ancestors Use Different Mechanisms of Stabilization</title>
<p>All of the ancestors have <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic>s falling within a narrow range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). To test the hypothesis that changes in the heat capacity of unfolding caused the gradual increase of <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> along the thermophile lineage, we carried out two different analyses. First, we analyzed the results from our fits of the stability curve for each ancestor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s004">Figure S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s013">Table S5</xref>) to quantify the relative contribution of <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic>, <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic>, and <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic> to changes in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> relative to Anc1. We assessed the change in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> predicted when the measured parameters for each extant or ancestral RNH protein were individually substituted into the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation with all other parameters from Anc1. This analysis uses Anc1 as a reference state and assumes that the effects of each parameter can be assessed independently.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis predicts that <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> should decline consistently along the thermophilic lineage from Anc1 to ttRNH in a fashion correlated with the evolutionary increase in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>. As expected, <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> of ttRNH is lower than that of Anc1 (2.28±0.2 and 1.91±0.3 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>, respectively). The elevated <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> of ttRNH, however, is caused not only by changes in <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> but also by substantial changes in <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> and <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic>; whereas changes in <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> caused an increase in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> of 5.4°C, changes in <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic> and <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> caused additional increases of 3.6°C and 3.4°C, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>Contrary to our prediction, however, the observed trends in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> are not mirrored by trends in <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), and the underpinnings of the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> of each ancestor are different. The <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> of ttRNH is 12°C above Anc1's because of contributions from <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> (+5.4°C), <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic> (+3.6°C), and <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> (+3.4°C). In contrast, although the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> of Anc3 is 8°C higher than Anc1, <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> makes no contribution at all to its elevated thermostability, which is instead driven by <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic> (+5.5°C) and <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> (+3.5°C). Anc2 exhibits yet another pattern: its <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> is 1°C higher than Anc1 due to a strong contribution by <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> (3.7°C), which offsets a destabilizing effect of <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> (−2.7°C), while <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic> makes virtually no contribution. Thus, although <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> consistently increases along the thermophilic lineage, our analysis suggests that different stabilizing mechanisms are utilized between each ancestor.</p>
<p>The mechanisms altering thermostability fluctuate along the mesophilic lineage, as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> of the modern mesophilic ecRNH is 11°C lower than that of Anc1. This reflects major unfavorable contributions from <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic> (−6.1°C) and <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> (−6.2°C), with a minor stabilizing effect by <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> (+1.1°C). As with the thermophilic lineage, however, the contributions of changes in <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic>, <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic>, and <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> fluctuate over evolutionary time. AncC and AncD have nearly identical thermostabilities, with <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>s ∼7°C lower than Anc1 because of unfavorable changes in <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic> (−4.4°C) and <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> (−4.3°C) and a favorable change in <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> (+1.2°C). In contrast, the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> of AncA is 5°C lower than Anc1, but <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> (−4.2°C) and <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> (+1.9°C) have now switched roles, with <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic> (−3.3°C) continuing to be destabilizing.</p>
<p>We statistically analyzed whether the apparent fluctuations in the mechanistic underpinnings of stability over evolutionary time were robust to uncertainty in the estimates of the parameters of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. We used a bootstrap and refitting approach to identify for each ancestor a cloud of plausible parameter values that are consistent with the experimental data (Figures S6 and S7). We found that the thermodynamic underpinnings of the ancestral proteins' stabilities are indeed distinct from each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s007">Figure S7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s014">Table S6</xref>). We then asked about the possible evolutionary trajectories along phylogenetic lineages given uncertainty in the parameter estimates. We discretized the parameter space for each ancestral protein and calculated from the refitted bootstrap parameter estimates the probability that the ancestral protein was in each region of this parameter space (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We then calculated the probability of each possible pathway through this space that could be taken by lineages of successive ancestors on the phylogenetic tree, given the bootstrap-derived probability that each ancestor's parameters were in each parameter region. We found that, along both lineages, the most probable path was circuitous, with values of <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> and <italic>ΔC<sub>p</sub></italic> in particular fluctuating across the evolutionary intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). This stands in contrast with the value of <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>, which increases smoothly on the thermophile lineage and, after an early drop, remains essentially constant along the mesophilic lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We also investigated the distribution of alternative possible paths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Paths within the 95% confidence interval had lengths between 75% and 230% of the length of the most probable path. Even the shortest plausible path, at the very edge of the confidence interval, still exhibited dramatic fluctuations over evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Thus, our observed experimental data and the bootstrapped refitting both indicate that the mechanistic underpinnings of stability did not follow the smooth evolutionary trajectories followed by stability itself but instead fluctuated dramatically during the evolution of thermophilic and mesophilic RNH proteins. The parameter that appears to be most consistently associated with changes in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> along both lineages is <italic>ΔH<sub>s</sub></italic>, with the noted exception of ttRNH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

<title>Implications for Inferences of Ancient Environmental Temperature</title>
<p>Our findings concerning trends in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>s bear on recent efforts to infer long-term changes in global environmental temperature based on studies of resurrected ancestral proteins.

These results differ from studies of several other proteins, which observed monotonic increases in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> as one goes back in time and interpreted this result as evidence for an ancient, global trend from higher to lower environmental temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Akanuma1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Gaucher2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-PerezJimenez1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Risso1">[13]</xref>. Our oldest ancestor, Anc1, has a <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> 10°C higher than extant mesophiles and 10°C lower than extant thermophiles, in contrast to similarly aged thioredoxins and β-lactamases, which were found to have <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>s 25–30°C higher than both their mesophilic and thermophilic descendants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-PerezJimenez1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Risso1">[13]</xref>. Our findings are more similar to those of a study showing that ancestral EF-Tu proteins have thermostabilities between those of extant thermophiles and mesophiles, a result interpreted as providing evidence for a relatively hot ancient global environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Gaucher1">[9]</xref>. By tracing changes in <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> along multiple taxonomic lineages, we found patterns that are inconsistent with any gradual, long-term trend in global environmental temperatures: for example, Anc2, which is estimated to have existed approximately 2 billion years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Hedges1">[26]</xref>, has a melting temperature only 2°C higher than that of present-day mesophilic ecRNH. Taken together, our observations suggest that particular proteins in particular lineages undergo their own paths to accommodate the local environments they colonize and the functions they perform. This view is consistent with the wide variety of temperature niches populated by both ancient and modern bacteria. It is also consistent with recent findings that thermophilicity evolved in parallel numerous times over a period of just 3 million years in a family of enzymes involved in leucine biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Hobbs1">[11]</xref>.

<title>RNH Exhibits Thermodynamic Systems Drift</title>
<p>Our work reveals that RNH thermostability is evolving in a regime analogous to “developmental systems drift” (DSD). In DSD, a developmental process or outcome is conserved by selection, but the underlying genetic or molecular mechanisms shift during evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-True1">[36]</xref>. By analogy, RNH exhibits thermodynamic systems drift, in which the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> is under selection, but the mechanisms by which it is achieved vary over evolutionary time. “Drift,” in this usage, does not refer to the evolutionary process of neutral drift, but rather to changes in mechanism uncorrelated with changes in phenotype.</p>
<p>Although our data do not directly reveal the evolutionary forces that shape the mechanism of stabilization, the most parsimonious explanation of our observations is a neutral evolutionary process. A protein's stability must be above a given threshold to maintain protein function and prevent the accumulation of misfolded protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Gong1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Taverna2">[38]</xref>, but there is little evidence that selection can “sense” the underlying mechanism of stabilization, implying that neutral evolution would be free to alter stabilization mechanisms while maintaining the required stability. Further, invoking selection to explain the fluctuations we observed in the thermodynamic parameters that determine stability requires that the each ancestor experienced a unique selective regime and that this regime was different from that driving stability itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001994-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We believe that this scenario, although formally possible, is very unlikely.</p>
<p>Thermodynamic systems drift has some important implications. First, it highlights the pitfalls of proposing an adaptive trajectory based on comparisons of modern proteins. Almost all studies of thermostability have compared mesophilic and thermophilic homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Razvi1">[5]</xref>; our work indicates that mechanistic differences between any two such proteins—even those that strongly correlate with stability—may reflect exploration of alternate stabilization mechanisms rather than the initial adaptive stabilization mechanism. A second implication is that studying multiple thermophilic homologs—or an evolutionary lineage leading to a thermophilic protein—has the capacity to reveal multiple methods of stabilization for a given protein, thus providing insight for engineers trying to identify stabilizing mutations by studying protein diversity. Finally, thermodynamic systems drift implies that evolving proteins can efficiently explore sequence space, even when selection establishes a threshold for stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Wagner1">[39]</xref>. As proteins explore sequence space, their evolutionary potential changes, opening and closing pathways to new functions or properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Wagner1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Harms2">[42]</xref>.</p>

Only solubly expressed proteins were purified for further analysis. Lysate was purified first over a HiTrap Heparin column (GE Healthcare) at pH 8. Peak fractions were pooled and diluted 2-fold with doubly deionized water. Then the pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.5 using dilute NaOAc, and the sample was purified over a HiTrap S column (GE Healthcare). Protein was then concentrated and dialyzed against either ammonium bicarbonate for subsequent freeze-drying and storage or appropriate buffer conditions for immediate use. Each protein's purity and molecular weight were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry. Protein concentrations were determined in Edelhoch buffer using extinction coefficients calculated based on the number of tryptophan and tyrosine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Edelhoch1">[52]</xref>.</p>

<title>Activity Assay</title>
<p>RNH activity was assayed in 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM TCEP at 25°C. Substrate concentration is given in internucletotide bonds, due to the heterogeneous nature of the substrate, using ε<sub>260</sub> = 8250 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> and 330 g/mol for the average nucleotide molecular weight. Substrate was prepared by mixing equal parts dT<sub>20</sub> oligomers (IDT) and poly-rA (Sigma), heating to 95°C for 5 minutes, then slowly cooling to room temperature for 1 hour before storing at 4°C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme and monitored at 260 nm using a Cary UV spectrophotometer. Increasing absorbance at 260 nm indicates the release of nucleotides as they are hydrolyzed.</p>

<title>Denaturant-Induced and Thermal Denaturation</title>
<p>Thermal and chemical denaturation melts were performed by monitoring the CD signal at 222. CD melts were carried out in a 1-cm pathlength cuvette (50 µg/ml protein, 20 mM NaOAc [pH 5.5], 50 mM KCl, and 1 mM TCEP). Samples were prepared individually, equilibrated overnight or longer for temperatures below 25°C, and allowed to stir in the instrument for 1–2 minutes before data collection. For higher temperatures, proteins were equilibrated overnight only if solubility was not compromised. Otherwise, shorter equilibration times were used, typically 2–3 hours for melts performed manually and 5–15 minutes for melts performed using an automated titrator. Data from titration experiments were only used if the measured <italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic> was within 0.1 M of the value collected manually at the same temperature.</p>
<p>To measure CD signal at 222 nm as a function of temperature, samples were allowed to equilibrate for five minutes at each temperature and data were collected every 3°C. Spectra were taken at 25°C before and after the thermal melt to test for reversibility. Reversibility was defined as recovery of 80% of CD signal at 222 nm. Temperature melts were fit to a two-state model using the Gibbs-Helmholtz relationship (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio.1001994.e001">Equation 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Denaturation and Stability Curve Data Analysis</title>
<p>To generate stability curves, global stabilities derived from GdmCl-induced denaturation melts were plotted as a function of temperature. <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>s extracted from thermal denaturation experiments were used as single points at <italic>ΔG</italic> = 0 for ttRNH, AncA, Anc1, Anc2, and Anc3, which all unfold reversibly. Only data collected at temperatures above 15°C were included in fits due to deviation from two-state behavior at lower temperatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Data were fit to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation to extract all thermodynamic parameters (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio.1001994.e001">Equation 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To characterize the uncertainty in our estimates of the thermodynamic parameters, we generated 10,000 bootstrap pseudo-datasets for each protein—sampling three times with replacement from the measured <italic>ΔG</italic> values at each temperature—and then refit our model to each dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001994.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This generated a distribution of parameter values consistent with the experimental measurements taken for each protein. To characterize uncertainty in the trends that parameters followed along phylogenetic lineages, we sampled possible pathways between the bootstrapped parameter values of successive ancestors along the tree and then characterized the lengths and probabilities of these pathways. We first placed all three parameters on the same scale by normalizing their values to the interval (0, 1). Next, we discretized the parameter space into a 15×15×15 grid, reducing the 10,000 unique parameter estimates for each protein to ∼35 unique estimates. We calculated the relative probability of each grid cell, given our experimental data, as the proportion of all pseudo-datasets with parameter estimates in that cell. Finally, we exhaustively sampled trajectories among successive ancestral proteins through this parameter space. For each trajectory, we calculated the path length (the sum of Euclidean distances between successive ancestor's parameter values) and its probability (determined by multiplying the probabilities of each bin in the path). Statistical analyses were done in the R 3.1.0 statistical environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-R1">[59]</xref>. Fittings was done using the L-BFGS-B algorithm as implemented in the optim function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001994-Fletcher1">[60]</xref>.</p>
