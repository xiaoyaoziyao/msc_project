        <p>Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key component of the signaling system that integrates plant adaptive responses to abiotic stress. Overexpression of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> molybdenum cofactor sulfurase gene (<italic>LOS5</italic>) in maize markedly enhanced the expression of <italic>ZmAO</italic> and aldehyde oxidase (AO) activity, leading to ABA accumulation and increased drought tolerance. Transgenic maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) exhibited the expected reductions in stomatal aperture, which led to decreased water loss and maintenance of higher relative water content (RWC) and leaf water potential. Also, transgenic maize subjected to drought treatment exhibited lower leaf wilting, electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content, and higher activities of antioxidative enzymes and proline content compared to wild-type (WT) maize. Moreover, overexpression of <italic>LOS5</italic> enhanced the expression of stress-regulated genes such as <italic>Rad 17</italic>, <italic>NCED1</italic>, <italic>CAT1</italic>, and <italic>ZmP5CS1</italic> under drought stress conditions, and increased root system development and biomass yield after re-watering. The increased drought tolerance in transgenic plants was associated with ABA accumulation via activated AO and expression of stress-related gene via ABA induction, which sequentially induced a set of favorable stress-related physiological and biochemical responses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Drought stress is one major environmental stress that adversely affects crop growth and productivity worldwide. Developing drought-tolerant crops would be the most promising and effective approach to improving agricultural productivity and water use efficiency against drought and water shortage. Drought tolerance in plant involves perception of stress signals and subsequent signal transduction, resulting in activation of various physiological and metabolic responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Zhu1">[1]</xref>. Up to date, hundreds of genes and their related signaling pathways have been identified as important for drought tolerance, and genetic engineering using some of these genes has increased plant drought tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Tung1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiao1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>ABA is a key component of the signaling system that integrates the adaptive response of plants to abiotic stress including drought and salinity. It is involved in plant responses to regulation of growth and development, including shoot and root growth, and leaf transpiration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Zhu1">[1]</xref>. ABA accumulation in plant cells occurs quickly as plants respond to drought stress, which promotes expression of ABA-inducible genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-YamaguchiShinozaki1">[4]</xref> and stomatal closure to reduce transpirational water loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Schroeder1">[5]</xref>. To some extent, putative high ABA content induced stomatal closure, which is important for plant tolerance of water stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiong1">[6]</xref>. Accordingly, an important strategy for plant drought tolerance is regulation of stomatal movement by ABA actions.</p>
      <p>ABA <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis occurs in leaves, stems, and roots of most plant species primarily in plastids, but the last two steps occur in the cytoplasm where xanthoxin is converted to ABA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Tan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Seo1">[8]</xref>. The 9-<italic>cis</italic>-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (<italic>NCED</italic>) is a rate-limiting enzyme in ABA biosynthesis which catalyses the cleavage of 9-<italic>cis</italic>-violaxanthin and/or 9-<italic>cis</italic>-neoxanthin to produce xanthoxin in plastids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Chernys1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Iuchi1">[10]</xref>. Xanthoxin is converted to abscisic aldehyde by dehydrogenase/reductase in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-GonzalezGuzman1">[11]</xref>. Abscisic aldehyde is oxidized to ABA by aldehyde oxidase (AO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Seo2">[12]</xref>. AO needs the sulphurylated form of a molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) for its activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Bittner1">[13]</xref>, and the <italic>LOS5</italic> gene encodes the MoCo sulfurase involved in regulation of ABA biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiong2">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The aforementioned steps show the molecular mechanism of ABA biosynthesis, and genetic engineering using some of these genes has improved plant drought tolerance. For example, <italic>AtZEP</italic>-overexpressing transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed smaller stomatal aperture, enhanced <italic>de novo</italic> ABA biosynthesis, and higher tolerance of osmotic stress than WT <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Park1">[15]</xref>. Overexpression of <italic>NCED</italic> may increase endogenous ABA levels, trigger stomatal closure, and lead to higher drought tolerance in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Iuchi1">[10]</xref>, tobacco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Qin1">[16]</xref>, creeping bentgrass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Aswath1">[17]</xref> and transgenic tomato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Tung1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Thompson1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Thompson2">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>LOS5</italic> is an important gene that regulates the last step of ABA biosynthesis and enhanced expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is induced by drought, salt, and ABA treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiong2">[14]</xref>. Overexpression of <italic>LOS5</italic> in rice under field conditions resulted in more spikelet fertility and yield than for non-transgenic plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiao1">[3]</xref>. Our early work showed that overexpression of <italic>LOS5</italic> in tobacco improved drought tolerance via reducing water loss and increasing antioxidant systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Yue1">[20]</xref>. Maize is grown on more than 30 million ha annually in China, especially in China's semi-arid and arid regions where water shortage limits irrigation. However, maize is especially sensitive to water stress because of its relatively sparse root system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Laboski1">[21]</xref>, and this sensitivity to water stress can lead to dramatic fluctuations in yield due to frequent drought and poor irrigation management, as often the case in China. With the functions of stress-inducible genes well recognized, genetic manipulation is an effective approach for the enhancement of stress tolerance in crops.</p>
      <p>The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effect of overexpression of <italic>Arabidopsis LOS5</italic> in maize subjected to drought stress. The study also aimed to explore the difference in stress–resistance mechanism between transgenic <italic>LOS5</italic> and WT maize, including their physiological and morphological responses under drought stress. Also, regulatory networks influenced by <italic>LOS5</italic> gene expression in maize were monitored by quantifying the expression of known stress-related genes.</p>

        <p>The vector pCAMBIA1300-<italic>LOS5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) was introduced into maize via <italic>Agrobacterium tumefacians</italic>-mediated transformation. The primary transformed plants were designated as T0 plants, and seeds from self-fertilization of T0 plants were used to raise T1 progeny. A total of 16 independent maize transgenic lines were generated, and the transformations were confirmed by PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Two dominant lines, M-6 and M-8, were selected and homozygous T4 transgenic plants were used for drought-tolerance analysis.</p>

      <p>A feasible strategy for increasing abiotic stress tolerance in plants is through applied plant biotechnology, which relies on expression of genes involved in signaling and regulatory pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Shinozaki1">[22]</xref>, or genes encoding proteins conferring stress tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Wang1">[23]</xref>, or enzymes present in pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Park2">[24]</xref>. Genetic engineering is intensively explored to enhance plant stress tolerance, and several engineered plants have improved stress resistance phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiao1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Thompson1">[18]</xref>. To test whether this strategy could improve maize performance under drought conditions, transgenic maize that overexpressed the <italic>Arabidopsis LOS5</italic> gene was generated. When exposed to drought stress, the expression of <italic>LOS5</italic> was greatly upregulated in transgenic M-6 or M-8 maize although transcription of the transgene was driven by the constitutive super promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g001">Figure 1C, D</xref>). This phenomenon was also observed in rice expressing <italic>SaVHAC1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Baisakh1">[25]</xref>, transgenic <italic>betA</italic> gene in wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-He1">[26]</xref>, cotton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Lv1">[27]</xref> and maize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Wei1">[28]</xref>. Several studies have reported that transgene transcript of constitutive expression of a stress response gene in homologous or heterologous systems is induced by environmental stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Iuchi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Baisakh1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Wei1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Yang1">[29]</xref>. The expression of genes at the cellular level is involved in transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, and posttranscriptional control of transcript accumulation is an important mechanism for gene regulation under stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Cohen1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Shi1">[31]</xref>. The results in this study suggested that a posttranscriptional regulation mechanism might be involved in controlling the stability of <italic>LOS5</italic> transcript. These results were in consistent with the observations that the ABA level in transgenic plants increased much more than that in WT plants after drought stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Map-based cloning revealed that <italic>LOS5</italic> encoded a molybdenum cofactor sulphurase, and sulphurase catalyzed production of a sulfurylated molybdenum cofactor required by aldehyde oxidase (AO), which functions in the last step of ABA biosynthesis and functioned indirectly in ABA biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiong2">[14]</xref>. In our research with maize, overexpressing <italic>LOS5</italic> evidently increased the AO activity under two drought stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Then, ABA accumulation was markedly enhanced in M-6 or M-8 transgenic maize subjected to drought stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These observations are supported by the model for stress induction of ABA biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiong3">[32]</xref>, whereby an initial increase in ABA from overexpression of one ABA biosynthetic gene, such as <italic>LOS5/ABA3</italic>, could result in increased expression of other ABA biosynthetic genes, <italic>AAO3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Seo3">[33]</xref> and <italic>LOS6/ABA1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiong3">[32]</xref>. Collectively, these genes would lead to a sustained increase in <italic>de novo</italic> ABA biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Thompson1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiong3">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have shown that it was possible to reliably generate transgenic maize with high ABA content by manipulating a single key ABA biosynthetic gene under drought stress. Overexpressing <italic>LOS5</italic> did not enhance the expression of <italic>ZmABA3</italic> compared to WT maize under well-watered or drought conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), but markedly increased the expression of <italic>ZmAO1</italic> and AO activity which led to ABA accumulation in maize leaves under drought stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g002">Figure 2</xref>). However, under well-watered conditions, the expression of <italic>ZmAO1</italic> and ABA contents in <italic>LOS5</italic> transgenic maize were very similar to those of WT maize, which was inconsistent to overexpression of <italic>NCED</italic> in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Tung1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Iuchi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Thompson2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Parent1">[34]</xref>. <italic>NCED</italic> catalyzes the first specific step in ABA biosynthesis and affects ABA production when overexpressed or underexprssed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Parent1">[34]</xref>, whereas the <italic>LOS5</italic> gene is stress-induced, and its transcript increased in response to drought, ABA, NaCl, and PEG treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiong2">[14]</xref>. Otherwise, MoCo sulfurase (<italic>LOS5</italic>) convertion of di-oxygenated MoCo to mono-oxygenated MoCo is required to activate ABA aldehyde oxidase and indole-3-acetaldehyde oxidase, which are involved in ABA and IAA biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Porch1">[35]</xref>. These observations suggested that constitutive expression of <italic>LOS5</italic> in maize could not promote ABA accumulation under well-watered or re-watering conditions, and might regulate indole-3-acetaldehyde oxidase involving IAA biosynthesis. The effect of <italic>LOS5</italic> overexpression on regulating auxin biosynthesis requires further investigation.</p>
      <p>ABA is a key component of the signaling system that integrates the adaptive response of plants to drought and osmotic stress. Under drought stress, ABA accumulation was critical for stomatal closure that led to reduced transpirational water loss and induced expression of drought- and desiccation-tolerant genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Zhu1">[1]</xref>. Under drought stress, overexpression of <italic>LOS5</italic> in maize induced much higher ABA concentrations than non-transgenic plants. Transgenic lines had smaller stomatal apertures than WT maize, which led to less water loss in transgenic plants under drought conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Overexpression of <italic>LOS5</italic> in maize showed markedly lower transpiration rates than WT plants, which led to reduce wilting in transgenic lines under drought conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Otherwise, overexpression of <italic>LOS5</italic> in maize leaves under drought stress resulted in higher RWC and lower leaf water potential than WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g004">Figure 4</xref>), which was an important strategy for transgenic plants to conserve water capability to reduce wilting. Our results were consistent with overexpression of <italic>NCED</italic> that led to increased ABA production and reduced leaf transpiration under drought conditions, which consequently increased the drought tolerance of transgenic plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Tung1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Iuchi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Thompson2">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Overexpression of <italic>LOS5</italic> under drought stress altered the expression of ABA-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The maize ABA responsive gene <italic>Rab17</italic> is induced by water deficit, ABA, and desiccation in embryo and vegetative tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Kizis1">[36]</xref>. Expression of <italic>Rab 17</italic> under drought stress in <italic>LOS5-</italic>overexpressing lines was 2.1- to 3.5-fold higher than in WT maize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). ABA is synthesized from C<sub>40</sub>-carotenoids, in which the oxidative cleavage of <italic>cis</italic>-epoxycarotenoids by <italic>NCED</italic> is the rate-limiting step of ABA biosynthesis in higher plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Nambara1">[37]</xref>. Expression of <italic>NCED</italic> is induced by drought and salt stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Qin1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Tan2">[38]</xref>. Under drought stress, lines M-6 and M-8 overexpressing <italic>LOS5</italic> markedly enhanced the expression of <italic>NCED1</italic> compared to WT maize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). These results suggested that overexpressing <italic>LOS5</italic> promoted ABA accumulation thereby regulating expression of ABA responsive and biosynthetic genes.</p>
      <p>Stress-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common metabolic response to environmental stress in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Mittler1">[39]</xref>. ROS are signaling molecules that regulate plant-protective stress responses including ABA-induced activation of stomatal closure and induction of defense gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Desikan1">[40]</xref>. Water-stress-induced ABA accumulation regulated ABA-stress-responsive gene expression including ROS network genes such as SOD, APX and CAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-YamaguchiShinozaki1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Jiang1">[41]</xref>. Overexpressing <italic>LOS5</italic> in maize greatly increased expression of <italic>CAT1</italic> compared to WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), and the activity of CAT under drought stress in <italic>LOS5</italic> -expressing maize was higher than in WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), which resulted in reduced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and cytoplasmic damage as detected by electrolyte leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
      <p><italic>LOS5</italic>-expressing maize under drought stress promoted accumulation of proline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), and the expression of <italic>ZmP5SC1</italic> was increased 2- to 3-fold compared to WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Stress-induced <italic>P5CS1</italic> (a key enzyme in proline biosynthesis) gene expression under osmotic stress required ABA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiong2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Strizhov1">[42]</xref>. It is possible that <italic>LOS5</italic>-overexpressing plants under drought stress could accumulate proline by overproducing ABA. Our results clearly indicate that overexpression of <italic>LOS5</italic> enabled maize to detoxify ROS efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052126-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and to enhance drought stress tolerance via mobilizing ROS-scavenging enzymes and activating signaling molecules that regulate ROS-scavenging genes. In this context, plants with a putative high ABA level might be most tolerant to stressful conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Xiong1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, overexpression of <italic>LOS5</italic> in maize subjected to drought stress increased drought tolerance by regulating AO activity to promote ABA accumulation. ABA accumulation in transgenic maize exposed to drought stress reduced water loss, and activated expression of stress-regulated genes that alleviated membrane damage. These data provide important insights into application of an ABA-related biosynthesis gene and significantly furthers our understanding of stress gene regulation and stress tolerance.</p>

        <p>Drought experiments also were conducted with WT and T4 transgenic maize grown in the pots as described above. Plants were watered to capacity daily by providing about 400 ml water per pot. After 21 d of growth with normal water supply, uniform plants were divided into four groups: well-watered group, moderate drought group (D1, 60% normal water supply), severe drought group (D2, 40% normal water supply), and re-watered group (re-watered after D2 treatments). For the drought treatments, D1 and D2 irrigations were done with 180 ml and 120 ml water per pot daily, for 5 d. Then, the re-watered group following D2 treatment was supplied with normal water regime for 2 d and some plants were further cultured for another 5 d for biomass analysis. At each harvest, the plant was separated into shoots and roots. Shoots were cut at the cotyledon node, and fresh weight determined. Roots were measured by pulling pots from the ground and soaking the root mass in water, then manually stirring and pouring into a sieve (0.25 mm<sup>2</sup> mesh). The sieve was suspended in a large water bath and shaken continuously until roots were washed free of soil. Soil materials remaining on the sieve were removed manually. The separated root fractions were collected to determine fresh weight. Then all samples were cured at 105°C for 30 min and dried at 70°C to determine the shoot and root dry weight. Fresh samples of all treatments were used for immediate assays or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for physiological and biochemical analysis (see below).</p>

        <p>T4 transgenic and WT maize were grown in pots under well-watered conditions for 21 d and then drought stress was imposed for 5 d as described above. Leaves of maize were cut and transpirational water loss was measured as described by Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Chen1">[47]</xref>. The uppermost fully expanded leaves of WT and T4 transgenic maize under drought treatments were used in the experiments. Stomatal bioassay was performed as described by Pei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052126-Pei1">[48]</xref> with slight modifications. Leaves were carefully cut into 10-mm long and 5-mm wide strips, and the strips were immediately incubated in FAA fixative liquid (38% formaldehyde, acetic acid and 50% alcohol, 5∶5∶90). Stomata were observed under a scanning electron microscope (S-570; Hitachi, Japan), and the width and length of stomatal apertures were measured using image analysis computer software (Scion Image; Scion Corp., Frederick, MD; and National lnstitutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For each independent measurement, five stomata were selected to measure stomatal aperture<bold>s</bold> on each randomly selected digitized image from six sections of the abaxial surface.</p>
