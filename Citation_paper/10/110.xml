<abstract>
<p>Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) is an important virulence factor of pneumococci and has been investigated as a primary component of a capsular serotype-independent pneumococcal vaccine. Thus, we sought to determine the genetic diversity of PspA to explore its potential as a vaccine candidate. Among the 190 invasive pneumococcal isolates collected from Korean children between 1991 and 2016, two (1.1%) isolates were found to have no pspA by multiple polymerase chain reactions. The full length <italic>pspA</italic> genes from 185 pneumococcal isolates were sequenced. The length of <italic>pspA</italic> varied, ranging from 1,719 to 2,301 base pairs with 55.7–100% nucleotide identity. Based on the sequences of the clade-defining regions, 68.7% and 49.7% were in PspA family 2 and clade 3/family 2, respectively. PspA clade types were correlated with genotypes using multilocus sequence typing and divided into several subclades based on diversity analysis of the N-terminal α-helical regions, which showed nucleotide sequence identities of 45.7–100% and amino acid sequence identities of 23.1–100%. Putative antigenicity plots were also diverse among individual clades and subclades. The differences in antigenicity patterns were concentrated within the N-terminal 120 amino acids. In conclusion, the N-terminal α-helical domain, which is known to be the major immunogenic portion of PspA, is genetically variable and should be further evaluated for antigenic differences and cross-reactivity between various PspA types from pneumococcal isolates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a major cause of community-acquired infectious diseases such as otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis in children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref001">1</xref>]. Pneumococcus consists of more than 94 different serotypes that are determined by the polysaccharide capsule, which is the target of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) currently in use. The introduction of a 7-valent PCV (PCV7, Prevenar<sup>®</sup>, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) in the early 2000s followed by the extended-valency PCVs, namely, a 10-valent PCV (PCV10, Synflorix<sup>®</sup>, GlaxoSmithKline) and a 13-valent PCV (PCV13, Prevenar13<sup>®</sup>, Pfizer), in the late 2000s has led to a reduction of invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) and carriage due to the serotypes included in the PCVs; however, medically relevant replacement by non-vaccine serotypes (NVTs) has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>The low serotype coverage and the high cost of PCVs have hampered their implementation, especially in developing countries; therefore, the development of a serotype-independent vaccine has been suggested. Many pneumococcal proteins have been investigated as vaccine candidates, such as pneumolysin (Ply), pneumococcal histidine triad protein D (PhtD), and pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>PspA is an important virulence factor that interferes with complement deposition on the pneumococcal surface and is detected on almost all pneumococci. PspA has a complex mosaic structure comprising five domains, which includes a signal peptide, an α-helical charged domain that includes a clade-defining region, a proline-rich domain, a choline-binding domain consisting of ten 20-amino-acid repeats, and a C-terminal 17-amino-acid tail. Classification by family and clade is based on the amino acid identity of the clade-defining region. The α-helical domain of PspA is exposed on the surface and is therefore able to interact with the human host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>PspA is known to be highly immunogenic and induces cross-reactive immunity among different genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref009">9</xref>]. However, the genetic diversity of PspA should be fully explored prior to its implementation as a vaccine candidate. Although the molecular epidemiology of PspA has been analyzed in some countries, the numbers of pneumococcal isolates and collection periods remain limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref012">12</xref>]. The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic diversity of PspA, one of the most promising antigens for a protein vaccine, in a large collection of invasive pneumococcal isolates obtained from children between 1991 and 2016.</p>

<title>Strains</title>
<p>A total of 190 invasive pneumococcal isolates were obtained from children &lt;18 years of age at the SNUCH between 1991 and 2016. An ‘invasive isolate’ was defined as an isolate obtained from a normally sterile body fluid, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, ascites, or joint fluid. Each isolate was identified using standard microbiological techniques, including observations of colony morphology, hemolysis patterns, and optochin susceptibility tests. Additionally, all of the study isolates were confirmed as pneumococci by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of pneumolysin as described in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref006">6</xref>]. Serotypes were determined using the Quellung reaction and multiplex PCR followed by sequencing of the capsular genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref013">13</xref>]. For conventional clade typing, six additional PspA sequences (BG9739, Rx1, EF3296, BG7561, ATCC6303, and BG6380) in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref007">7</xref>] were retrieved from the GenBank database and were used as the reference sequences for PspA clades 1 to 6, respectively.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Detection and sequencing of PspA</title>
<p>Extraction and purification of DNA from pneumococcal colonies were performed using a QIAamp kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To obtain the entire sequence of <italic>pspA</italic>, multiple sets of new primers in addition to primers from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref007">7</xref>] were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183968.t001">Table 1</xref>). PCR was performed in 20 μL volumes, with each reaction mixture containing the following: 2.0 μL of 10× Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 8.3, Mg<sup>2+</sup> free), 1.6 μL of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 1.4 μL of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 μL of 5.0 U/μL Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), and 4.0 μM of each primer. Thermal cycling was performed in a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler DNA engine (MJ Research, Watertown, MA) under the following conditions: 95°C for 5 min followed by 35 amplification cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 90 sec, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.</p>

<p>An isolate was designated negative for <italic>pspA</italic> if no gene product was amplified using any of the primers, including LSM12 and SKH2, which are thought to amplify all known <italic>pspA</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref014">14</xref>]. Sequence analyses of the <italic>pspA</italic> genes were performed for 185 (97.4%) invasive pneumococcal isolates harboring <italic>pspA</italic>. Sequence data from the <italic>pspA</italic> fragments obtained from each strain were assembled and edited using Sequencher (Gene Codes Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). Further editing, alignment, and additional analyses were performed using CLC Main Workbench ver. 6.6.5 software (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). All sequences generated in this study have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KY446182 to KY446366.</p>

<title>PspA clade and family typing</title>
<p>The amino acid sequence was translated from each nucleotide sequence. The clade and family types were determined from the amino acid sequences of the PspA clade-defining region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref007">7</xref>]. The sequences of 185 pneumococcal isolates and the reference strains for each clade were grouped based on diversity. Clade type was established when the sequences shared a common branch with the corresponding reference strain on the dendrogram. Clades 1 and 2 were placed into family 1, clades 3–5 to family 2, and clade 6 to family 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref007">7</xref>]. The prevalence and distribution of the family and clade types from different study periods, serotypes, and genotypes were analyzed. The diversities of the PspA clades by serotype including more than two isolates were estimated using Simpson’s index of diversity D as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Analysis of genetic diversity of the α-helical domain</title>
<p>The entire N-terminal α-helical domain, including the clade-defining region, was extracted from the full sequence of PspA according to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref007">7</xref>]. To investigate the inter- and intra-clade sequence diversities of the α-helical domain, alignments of amino acid sequences were performed using the pairwise comparison method, and dendrograms were constructed using the maximum likelihood reconstruction method with the WAG substitution model. The percentages of replicate trees in which the associated sequences clustered together in the bootstrap test (1,000 replicates) are reported as the bootstrap values on the main internal nodes of the tree. Additionally, we assigned subclades alphabetically to each clade type based on the dendrogram. A subclade was defined as a group of sequences sharing a common branch divided from the main internal nodes. All of these analyses were performed using CLC Main Workbench ver. 6.6.5 software.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Putative antigenicity plots</title>
<p>The antigenic patterns of the α-helical domain were predicted using CLC Main Workbench ver. 6.6.5 software for all 185 PspAs. The amino acid sequences of the most recent isolates in each PspA subclade were converted to the corresponding antigenicity plot. This conversion was accomplished by assigning a hydrophobicity value to each amino acid and then calculating a moving average of these values along the peptide chain. The point of the highest local average hydrophobicity was invariably located in or immediately adjacent to an antigenic determinant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref016">16</xref>]. Antigenicity values were calculated, and the relevant diagrams were constructed. Antigenicity plots with different amplitudes or numbers of peak hydrophobicity points were defined as having ‘different antigenicity’.</p>

<p>A total of 190 invasive pneumococcal isolates were obtained from Korean children at a single center over 26 years. Among them, 78.4% (n = 149) were isolated from blood, 9.5% (n = 18) from cerebrospinal fluid, 5.8% (n = 11) from lung tissue or pleural fluid, 4.7% (n = 9) from bone tissue or joint fluid, and 1.6% (n = 3) from ascites. Twenty-four (12.6%) isolates were collected from 1991–1995, 54 (28.3%) isolates from 1996–2000, 47 (24.6%) isolates from 2001–2005, 40 (20.9%) isolates from 2006–2010, and 26 (13.6%) isolates from 2011–2016. A total of 30 serotypes were identified; the most common serotype was 19A (n = 32, 16.8%), followed by 23F (n = 25, 13.2%), 6B (n = 17, 8.9%), and 14 (n = 16, 8.4%). Eighty-five (44.7%) isolates were PCV7 types (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F), 52 (27.4%) isolates were PCV13 additional types (serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A), and the remaining 53 (27.9%) isolates were NVTs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, a total of 185 full PspA sequences were acquired from invasive pneumococcal isolates from children. PspA clade 3 and family 2 have been prevalent for 26 years in Korea. Using various molecular biology analyses, we identified that the N-terminal α-helical domain, which is located on the surface of the bacteria and is the major immunogenic portion of PspA, is highly genetically variable among clade types.</p>
<p>The development of a serotype-independent vaccine has been encouraged, and interest has shifted toward surface protein components as vaccine candidates. During the past decade, the immunogenicity and protective capacity of several pneumococcal proteins has been reviewed, and several candidates have been thoroughly investigated, while a few have proceeded to phase I and II clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref018">18</xref>]. PspA has been shown to be highly immunogenic and is a potential candidate for a pneumococcal vaccine. A vaccine composed of PspA is hypothesized to protect against invasive disease and to eliminate the carriage state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>A full exploration of the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of PspA in the community is important for its successful implementation as a vaccine candidate. Based on our inferred protein sequences of PspA from 185 strains, 68.7% were PspA family 2, and 49.7% were clade 3/family 2. These findings are in discordance with those of most previous reports on invasive pneumococcal strains, in which PspA family 1 and 2 were detected at similar frequencies; however, these strains were primarily from adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref022">22</xref>]. Additionally, in studies of children, the two PspA families were similarly detected or family 1 predominated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref023">23</xref>]. However, previous Korean data showed PspA family 1 in 22.5% and family 2 in 66.4% of 89 pneumococcal isolates from children between 1996 and 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref024">24</xref>]. In the current study, PspA family 2 was the predominant family during all study periods. In addition, PspA family 2 was found in 71.0% of 69 pneumococcal isolates collected from healthy Malaysian children in 2010 compared to PspA family 1, which was found in 24.6% of the isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref010">10</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that Asian pneumococcal strains have a predominance of PspA family 2.</p>
<p>PspA clade type was shown to be correlated to the genotype rather than the serotype of the pneumococci strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref025">25</xref>]. Although certain PspA types could be dominant in a specific serotype, this correlation might be due to the genotype within the serotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref026">26</xref>]. In this study, most serotypes expressed one or two PspA clades, and the isolates of some serotypes were segregated in a particular clade. However, upon comparison of PspA types in several serotypes including their MLST data, we confirmed that the PspA clade type was correlated with the genotype and not the serotype. In addition, the proportion and prevalence of PspA clade types did not change significantly after the use of PCVs in this study, though the prevalence of vaccine serotypes in invasive pneumococcal infections decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref028">28</xref>], which could be a reason for developing a universal vaccine with a pneumococcal protein such as PspA.</p>
<p>PspA is known to be genetically variable between the different family types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref009">9</xref>]. To establish the possible use of PspA as a vaccine candidate antigen, it is crucial to know the total array and full span of PspAs expressed in pneumococcal strains. We found that 188 (98.9%) of 190 isolates of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> carried a <italic>pspA</italic> gene whose size ranged from 1,719 to 2,301 bps. The entire span of the <italic>pspA</italic> genes showed 55.7–100% nucleotide identity and 31.3–100% amino acid identity. Although intra-clade sequence identities were higher than the overall identity, they were also more diverse than other pneumococcal protein vaccine candidates such as Ply and PhtD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, PspA is composed of five domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref007">7</xref>]. Among them, the N-terminal α-helical domain is exposed on the surface, and protection-eliciting epitopes of PspA appear to be spread throughout this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref029">29</xref>]. The induction of antibody production against conformational epitopes present at this region may be important for the promotion of broad protection against pneumococci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref030">30</xref>]. A previous study of 40 pneumococcal meningitis isolates from German children showed that the amino acid sequence identity of the α-helical and proline-rich domains were as low as 32% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref012">12</xref>]. In the current study, the amino acid sequences in the α-helical domain were much more diverse, and the minimum sequence identity in all pneumococcal isolates was 23.1%.</p>
<p>The grouping of PspA by dendrogram of α-helical domains was different from conventional clade typing based on clade-defining regions. Moreover, the putative antigenicity plots from the α-helical domains were also variable among the PspA clades and subclades. Our previous study showed that Ply and PhtD had nearly identical and very similar putative antigenicity patterns between allele types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref006">6</xref>]. However, PspA showed many different positions and peaks on the plot, even in the same clade type, especially in clades 1, 2, and 5. These intra-clade differences in plots were usually located within the N-terminal 120 amino acids. In previous studies, actual immunogenic epitopes of PspA were mapped to regions covering the first 100–115 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref032">32</xref>]. In addition, the α-helical domains of clades 2, 4, and 5 showed higher plots than the other clades, so they may be more hydrophobic and immunogenic. Thus, whether the major epitopes of PspA, especially those in the first 120 amino acids of the N-terminal α-helical domain, are conserved and cross-reactive among the various pneumococcal isolates, despite the sequence and antigenic diversities, remains to be confirmed.</p>
<p>In previous studies, the choline-binding domain of PspA was usually not sequenced, as it is known to be relatively invariant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref012">12</xref>]. However, the entire span of <italic>pspA</italic> was sequenced in this study so that we could explore the diversity of the choline-binding domain. As a result, we found that the 20-amino-acid block in the choline-binding domain was variably repeated 4–15 times. Previous work indicated that the choline-binding domain had 10 repeats of 20 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref011">11</xref>], but a strain with 9 repeats in the domain was reviously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0183968.ref029">29</xref>]. In this study, which used a large number of pneumococcal strains, we identified that 10 repeats were the most common, followed by 9 and 11 repeats.</p>
<p>In this study, we explored the genetic and antigenic identities of PspA by analyzing its full sequence, specifically focusing on the N-terminal α-helical domain, from 185 pneumococcal isolates. The PspA clade type was correlated with genotype using MLST and was further divided into several subclades. PspA showed variable sequences and antigenic patterns, especially in the immunogenic α-helical domain. As sequence conservation and antigenic epitope stability are necessary requirements for a universal vaccine candidate, further evaluation of the antigenic differences and cross-reactivities between various PspA types is needed, with a particular focus on the genetic diversity of the N-terminal region of PspA.</p>
