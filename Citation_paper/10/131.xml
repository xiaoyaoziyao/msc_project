      <abstract>
        <p>Peptide immunotherapy using T-cell epitopes is expected to be an effective treatment for allergic diseases such as Japanese cedar (<italic>Cryptomeria japonica</italic>; Cj) pollinosis. To develop a treatment for pollen allergy by inducing oral tolerance, we generated genetically manipulated (GM) chickens by retroviral gene transduction, to produce a fusion protein of chicken egg white lysozyme and a peptide derived from seven dominant human T-cell epitopes of Japanese cedar pollen allergens (cLys-7crp). The transgene sequence was detected in all chickens transduced with the retroviral vector. Transduction efficiency in blood cells correlated to transgene expression. Western blot analysis revealed that cLys-7crp was expressed in the egg white of GM hens. Mice induced to develop allergic rhinitis by Cj pollinosis were fed with cLys-7crp-containing egg white produced by GM chickens. Total and Cj allergen (Cry j 1)-specific IgE levels were significantly decreased in allergic mice fed with cLys-7crp-containing egg white compared with allergic mice fed with normal egg white. These results suggest that oral administration of T-cell epitope-containing egg white derived from GM chickens is effective for the induction of immune tolerance as an allergy therapy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Japanese cedar (<italic>Cryptomeria japonica</italic>; Cj) pollinosis is a serious type I allergic disease in Japan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Okuda1">[1]</xref>. More than 25% of Japanese citizens suffer from Cj pollinosis and the number of patients has constantly increased over the years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Okamoto1">[2]</xref>. Type I allergic diseases, including Cj pollinosis, are characterized by the elevation of immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and mast cell degranulation, followed by the release of histamine and other chemical mediators of allergy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Rosenwasser1">[3]</xref>. The main strategy for treating allergic diseases is based on pharmacological therapy, where inflammatory responses mediated by chemical mediators such as histamine and leukotriene, are inhibited using anti-inflammatory agents. A periodic recurrence of pollinosis is observed in patients since the therapeutic approach represents a symptomatic treatment only.</p>
      <p>Hyposensitization therapy has been used as a conventional allergen-specific immunotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Ishii1">[4]</xref> to try and cure patients completely. A stepwise subcutaneous administration of an escalating dose of the specific crude allergen extracts has been used for the treatment for allergies. However, this therapy has some disadvantages, such as the requirement of long-term administration of allergens under the control of physicians and the possibility of triggering an adverse reaction such as acute anaphylaxis by allergen administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Hashimoto1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Akdis1">[6]</xref>. Thus, it is highly desirable to establish a more convenient and curative immunotherapy.</p>
      <p>Immunotherapy using allergen-specific T-cell epitopes is thought to be a safe and effective treatment for the control of IgE-mediated allergic diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Moldaver1">[7]</xref>. In Cj pollinosis, two cedar pollen proteins, Cry j 1 (40–45 kDa) and Cry j 2 (37 kDa), were identified as major pollen allergens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Sakaguchi1">[8]</xref>. After the complementary DNA (cDNA) clones encoding Cry j 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Sone1">[9]</xref> and Cry j 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Komiyama1">[10]</xref> were isolated and sequenced, the dominant human T-cell epitopes were identified from proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from many patients with Cj pollinosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Saito1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Hirahara1">[12]</xref>. Among them, seven major human T-cell epitopes derived from Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 were selected to construct an artificial protein (7crp) used for vaccination. Takaiwa and co-workers reported an oral immunotherapy regime using the T-cell epitope peptides and 7crp, using a transgenic rice-based allergy vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Takagi1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Takagi2">[14]</xref>. Oral administration of allergens induces a state of systemic unresponsiveness against the administered allergens, although the mechanisms underlying oral tolerance are still not well understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Tsuji1">[15]</xref>. Oral administration of transgenic rice containing the major mouse T-cell epitopes derived from Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Takagi1">[13]</xref> or 7crp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Takagi2">[14]</xref> resulted in inhibition of the allergy-associated Th2 reactions such as decreased total and allergen-specific IgE levels, change in cytokine production profiles, and a reduction in sneezing. Although this strategy used only T-cell epitope peptides, fusion proteins containing T-cell epitopes have also been used as immunogens for effective hyposensitization therapy of allergy. For example, T-cell epitopes fused with an invariant chain to promote the processing of epitope peptides into the MHC class II loading pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Toda1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Sakaguchi2">[17]</xref>, and an allergen protein fused with an Fc region derived from immunoglobulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Zhu1">[18]</xref> for improved stability in the bloodstream, were used for vaccination. In order to produce such complicated artificial proteins containing T-cell epitopes to induce a more effective oral tolerance, the selection of host cells may be important in terms of proper protein folding and post-translation modifications such as glycosylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Houdebine1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Transgenic avian species such as chicken and quail have attracted much attention as “living bioreactors” for the next generation platform of biopharmaceutical protein production. Compared with other mammalian bioreactors such as the goat and cow, chickens have several advantages, such as rapid sexual maturity, small space requirement for breeding, high protein yield of eggs, and a similarity of <italic>N</italic>-linked oligosaccharide structures to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Song1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Kues1">[21]</xref>. We previously generated genetically manipulated (GM) chickens and quails using retroviral vectors for gene transfer and succeeded in producing recombinant proteins such as antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Kamihira1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Kamihira2">[24]</xref> and human erythropoietin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Kodama1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Penno1">[26]</xref> in eggs and serum of GM avian species.</p>
      <p>This study aims to investigate whether oral tolerance against Cj pollinosis can be induced using egg white containing T-cell epitopes produced by GM chickens. First, GM chickens producing 7crp fused with chicken egg white lysozyme (cLys-7crp) were generated using a retroviral vector. Then, the cLys-7crp-containing egg white was orally administered to Cj pollinosis model mice to investigate its therapeutic effects. The present study demonstrates that peptide immunotherapy through oral administration of epitope peptide-containing egg white produced by GM chickens is a promising approach for allergy therapy.</p>

        <p>A schematic representation of the retroviral vector used in this study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. The retroviral vector plasmid (pQMSCV), designed for the production of retroviral vectors based on a mouse stem cell virus (MSCV), was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Hotta1">[27]</xref>. A chicken egg white lysozyme (cLys) gene was amplified by PCR from chicken oviduct cDNA, using the primers, 5′-CCG <underline>CTC GAG</underline> AAC ATG AGG TCT TTG CTA ATC TTG G-3′ and 5′-ATT <underline>CCA TGG</underline> CCA GCC GGC AGC CTC TG-3′, to append <italic>Xho</italic>I and <italic>Nco</italic>I digestion sites (underlined) onto either end of the PCR product. The PCR was initiated using <italic>Thermococcus kodakaraensis</italic> (KOD) plus polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of amplification at 94°C for 15 s, 57°C for 30 s and 68°C for 45 s. The PCR product was digested with the respective restriction enzymes and ligated into <italic>Xho</italic>I- and <italic>Nco</italic>I-digested pETBlue-2 (Novagen, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) to generate pET/cLys. A double stranded DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the sequence of 7crp, an artificial protein comprising of seven human T-cell epitopes derived from Cry j 1 (212–224, 235–247, 312–330) and Cry j 2 (74-89, 96–107, 192–204, 356–367) was chemically synthesized according to the chicken codon usage and introduced into the pBluescript KS (−) (Toyobo) to generate pBlue/7crp. The 7crp gene was amplified by PCR from pBlue/7crp using the following primers, 5′-ACG C<underline>CC ATG G</underline>CA AGG TGG ACG GCA T-3′ and 5′-CGG GCT GCA G<underline>GA ATT C</underline>G-3′ to append <italic>Nco</italic>I and <italic>Eco</italic>RI digestion sites (underlined) onto either end of the PCR product.

The PCR product was digested with the respective restriction enzymes and ligated into <italic>Nco</italic>I- and <italic>Eco</italic>RI-digested pET28a (Novagen) to generate pET28a/7crp. The DNA fragment encoding the cLys gene prepared from pET/cLys was ligated into pQMSCV/CMVHBD3/IRES/EGFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Ito1">[28]</xref> together with the DNA fragment encoding the 7crp gene prepared from pET28a/7crp to generate pQMSCV/cLys-7crp/IRES/EGFP. The constitutive chicken β-actin promoter (ΔA) prepared from pMSCV/GΔAscFv-Fc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Kamihira1">[22]</xref> was ligated into pQMSCV/cLys-7crp/IRES/EGFP to generate pQMSCV/ΔAcLys-7crp/IRES/EGFP (7659 bp), in which the cLys-7crp gene was expressed under the control of chicken β-actin promoter and the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene was bicistronically expressed using an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) derived from the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV).

        <title>Generation of GM chickens producing cLys-7crp</title>
        <p>A 7crp gene was chemically synthesized using codons optimized based on the four most abundant egg white protein genes (ovalbumin, lysozyme, ovomucoid, and ovotransferrin). In the preliminary experiment, we constructed a retroviral vector plasmid (pQMSCV/GΔA7crp), in which an expression unit of the 7crp gene including a cLys-derived secretion signal sequence under the control of chicken β-actin promoter was encoded. However, a viral solution with a titer high enough for efficient delivery into embryonic cells could not be prepared using the plasmid. We assumed that the artificial protein comprised of the seven epitopes might have a cytotoxic effect on the viral producer cells. Thus, to reduce the cytotoxic effect, 7crp was produced as a fusion protein with cLys, a major component of egg white proteins. We constructed a retroviral vector plasmid, pQMSCV/ΔALys-7crp/IRES/EGFP, encoding a bicistronic expression cassette of cLys-7crp and EGFP mediated by IRES under the control of chicken β-actin promoter. By changing the production format, the titer of retroviral vector increased to ≥10<sup>8</sup> IU/ml after ultracentrifugation. The concentrated viral solution was injected into the heart of developing chicken embryos after 55 h incubation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Kamihira1">[22]</xref>. A total of 74 chicken embryos in four experiments were injected with the retroviral solution (2.0–4.0 μl). After the viral injection, the chicken embryos were cultured to hatch. The hatchability of the embryos was in the range of 20–44%, and 31% on average (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048512-t001">Table 1</xref>). The hatched birds grew normally to maturity and female chickens produced eggs after sexual maturation.</p>

The PCR analysis revealed that all chickens were transduced with the retroviral vector containing the transgene. Transgene transduction was also detected in various tissues and organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, spleen, kidney, muscle, oviduct and gonads (data not shown). To further examine the transgene copy number in the blood cells of GM chickens, genomic DNA was subjected to real-time PCR.

In this study, cLys-7crp and EGFP genes were co-expressed bicistronically mediated by IRES under the control of the ubiquitous chicken β-actin promoter. Therefore, transgene expression was visually detectable by fluorescence microscopy based on the EGFP expression in the blood cells of GM chickens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g002">Fig. 2B, 2D</xref>). Chicken red blood cells are nucleated, and EGFP-positive cells were observed in both red and white blood cells. The population and expression level of EGFP-positive cells were higher for white blood cells than those for red blood cells. From the FACS analysis, 4–27% of blood cells were EGFP-positive in the GM chickens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The frequency of EGFP-positive cells correlated to the transgene copy number of the GM chickens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), although the values were not consistent each other. Moreover, EGFP expression was detected throughout the GM chicken body such as the eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), beak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>) and skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p>

According to the band density of western blot analysis, cLys-7crp was produced in the egg white from GM chickens with a concentration of 1.0–1.6 μg/ml-egg white. The cLys-7crp expression in the yolk was negligible (data not shown). However, cLys-7crp expression was not detected in the serum, tissues and organs of GM chickens despite the transgene being expressed under the control of the ubiquitous β-actin promoter (data not shown). RT-PCR analysis was performed to examine the expression of cLys-7crp transcripts in various tissues from a GM chicken, and the transcript was detected in all the tissues tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

        <p>A murine Cj pollinosis model was developed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of oral administration of cLys-7crp produced in the egg white of a GM hen.

        <p>To investigate whether oral administration of cLys-7crp-containing egg white would have efficacy in a mouse model of Cj pollinosis, egg white derived from a GM hen or normal egg white derived from a non-GM hen as the control, were orally administered to Cj pollinosis-induced mice. Following the intranasal challenge of Cj allergen after a series of oral administration of egg white (the first term of oral administration), the number of sneezes was slightly decreased for the mice treated with cLys-7crp-containing egg white compared with controls. Following intranasal challenge after a second round of treatment, the number of sneezes was further decreased for the mice fed with cLys-7crp-containing egg white compared with the controls fed with normal egg white (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since the oral administration of cLys-7crp-containing egg white exhibited a therapeutic effect in Cj pollinosis mice, we measured the total IgE content in the serum of each mouse before and after the administration of cLys-7crp-containing or normal egg white (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). The total IgE levels for three of four mice administered with normal egg white were unchanged, although one mouse showed a decrease in total IgE levels (closed diamond). However, there was a significant reduction in total IgE in five out of seven mice (71.4%) treated with cLys-7crp-containing egg white, and in one mouse the total IgE levels (open circle) decreased similar to naïve mice. Moreover, Cry j 1-specific IgE levels in the serum after the second term of oral administration were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Cry j 1-specific IgE levels were reduced in the same cLys-7crp-fed mice that showed a significantly reduced total IgE (open circles, open triangles and open squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
        <p>We examined cellular infiltration by inflammatory response in lungs of the treated mice. Lung tissues harvested from the mice were applied for histological analyses. To assess inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, H&amp;E staining sections of the lung tissues were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g005">Fig. 5A, 5C, 5E, 5G, 5I</xref>). No inflammatory cells were observed in the lung of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), while the lung tissue sections from Cj pollinosis mice fed with normal egg white showed obvious peribronchial inflammatory infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g005">Fig. 5C, 5E</xref>). The pathological feature was significantly diminished in the lung specimens from Cj pollinosis mice fed with cLys-7crp-containing egg white (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g005">Fig. 5G, 5I</xref>). The lung tissue sections were also evaluated for mucus production in the airway epithelium by PAS staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g005">Fig. 5B, 5D, 5F, 5H, 5J</xref>). Although some PAS-positive cells were observed in the peribronchial region of cellular infiltration, notable mucus production in bronchial lumens was not observed in the lung tissues for the mice fed with normal egg white (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g005">Fig. 5D, 5F</xref>). On the other hand, no PAS-positive cells were detected for the mice fed with cLys-7crp-containing egg white (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g005">Fig. 5H, 5J</xref>). Thus, cellular infiltration in lungs of the Cj pollinosis model mice fed with cLys-7crp-containing egg white was significantly reduced compared with the mice fed with normal egg white. These results suggested that oral administration of cLys-7crp-containing egg white might be an effective method to induce mucosal tolerance to the Cj allergen.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We generated GM chickens expressing T-cell epitope peptides for the Cj allergen as a fused protein with cLys. The direct oral feeding of egg white containing T-cell epitopes for Cj pollinosis could inhibit the symptoms of pollen allergy in Cj pollinosis model mice. To date, many recombinant proteins such as antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Kamihira2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Zhu2">[36]</xref> and cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Kodama1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Penno1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Lillico1">[37]</xref> have been produced by GM chickens. Generally, such therapeutic proteins should be purified prior to their use. In this study, we attempted to use the eggs containing the therapeutic proteins produced by GM chickens as a therapeutic food. To generate 7crp-producing GM chickens, we first constructed a retroviral vector plasmid expressing 7crp. However, retroviral vector production was impaired using the plasmid. Therefore, the production format of 7crp was changed to a fusion protein with cLys, which allowed the production of high titers of retroviral solution. The GM chickens generated using the retroviral vector stably produced cLys-7crp in egg white for over a year (data not shown), but the production level was not high (1.3±0.2 μg/ml) compared with our previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Kamihira2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Penno1">[26]</xref>. cLys-7crp was not produced in the serum and other organs of GM chickens although RNA transcripts were detected in various tissues and organs of the GM chicken. T-cell epitopes are usually composed from hydrophobic amino acids that fit the peptide-binding groove of an MHC molecule. 7crp was identified as a hydrophobic protein having the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity value of –0.22 (hydrophobic) as determined by the method of Hopp and Woods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Hopp1">[38]</xref>. Thus, cLys-7crp might be sequestered at the cell membrane during the secretion pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi, and might be processed through the degradation pathway in the cells. However, in oviduct cells, cLys-7crp may be secreted because of the highly alkaline condition of egg white. However, the detailed mechanism requires further elucidation. cLys-7crp production may be improved by changing the production format, including the epitope order and fusion partner.</p>
      <p>There are several routes for administration of allergens for immunotherapy, such as subcutaneous, intralymphatic, transcutaneous, sublingual and oral administrations. Among them, the side effects of sublingual and oral hyposensitization therapy are generally mild, and the procedure is simple. Thus, the sublingual and oral administration of allergens has been considered more beneficial for treatment of Cj pollinosis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Sakaguchi2">[17]</xref>. Moreover, T-cell epitope peptides of allergens have been used for hyposensitization immunotherapy against allergenic diseases such as cedar pollen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Hirahara1">[12]</xref>, cat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Worm1">[39]</xref> and peanut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Prickett1">[40]</xref> allergies. Thus, induction of oral tolerance by peptide immunotherapy may be a useful strategy for radical treatment and/or the prevention of allergic diseases if gut immunity can be effectively activated, and with a low risk of side effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Takagi1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Takagi2">[14]</xref> when compared with using whole allergen. In recent years, the mechanisms of oral tolerance through the gut have been gradually elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-duPr1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Weiner1">[43]</xref>. After ingested antigen and food proteins are absorbed through microfold cells and intestinal epithelial cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, mucosal microenvironmental factors such as transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-10 promote the differentiation of adaptive regulatory T-cells that subsequently induce antigen-specific suppressive responses. Various antigen-presenting intestinal dendritic cells are also required to induce the adequate differentiation of T cells in Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes by delivering immunosuppressive signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Tsuji1">[15]</xref>. Thus, the complex network between immune cells results in the formation of an antigen-specific immunosuppressive microenvironment in the gut, leading to the induction of oral tolerance to target proteins. In this study, direct oral feeding of cLys-7crp-containing egg white to Cj pollinosis mice might induce suppressive immune responses against the cedar pollen allergens establishing oral tolerance.</p>
      <p>B10.S mice were used to generate the Cj pollinosis mouse model, because major T-cell epitopes identified in Cry j 1-sensitized B10.S mice coincided with the most prevalent epitopes in human patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Tsunematsu1">[30]</xref>. Oral administration of cLys-7crp-containing egg white to Cj pollinosis mice caused the down-regulation of total and specific IgE in the serum although the difference of total IgE amounts between unprimed and allergy model mice was not as high compared with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Ishii1">[4]</xref>. The total IgE levels were not significantly decreased in two mice treated with cLys-7crp-containing egg white (open diamond and open inverted triangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048512-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). For these two mice, the seven dominant T-cell epitopes selected in this study might not completely induce immunological tolerance, because the cedar pollen extract used to sensitize the mice contains other antigens apart from Cry j 1 and Cry j 2. Nevertheless, these results suggest that the cedar pollen allergy symptoms of Cj pollinosis model mice were moderated by the oral feeding of cLys-7crp-containing egg white produced by GM chickens.</p>
      <p>In the present study, although oral administration of cLys-7crp to the Cj pollinosis mice induced immunotolerance based on hyposensitization, the cLys-7crp dose and feeding plan (frequency and interval, 0.3 μg of cLys-7crp fed to mice for 5 days a week, repeated for 4 weeks in one term) were not optimized. Since the cLys-7crp production level in egg white was not high, the maximum single dose was limited by the volume (0.3 ml) of egg white injectable to a mouse using the feeding needle. In the study using 7crp-containing transgenic rice, 560 μg of 7crp was fed daily to Cj pollinosis mice for 32 days to induce oral immunotolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Takagi2">[14]</xref>. Thus, the daily dose of cLys-7crp-containing egg white was approximately 1,800-fold less than that of the previous study. Since chicken egg white proteins such as lysozyme and ovalbumin are relatively immunogenic, the chicken lysozyme region of cLys-7crp and egg white itself may act as an adjuvant. Interestingly, a higher efficiency of oral tolerance was induced when transgenic rice containing a fusion protein of cholera toxin B subunit with allergen-specific T-cell epitopes was orally administered to mice, compared with the administration of transgenic rice containing only allergen-specific T-cell epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048512-Takagi3">[44]</xref>. Thus, to achieve a stronger induction of immunotolerance, an elevated dose of cLys-7crp and/or a change in the feeding plan may be a feasible approach. However, to increase a single dose treatment, it would be necessary to enhance the expression level of cLys-7crp in egg white or to concentrate cLys-7crp by rough purification. Therapeutic effects on moderation of the allergic symptoms for the oral administration of cLys-7crp-containing egg white to Cj pollinosis model mice were observed for other sets of therapeutic experiments, in which feeding schedule of cLys-7crp-containing egg white was changed (data not shown).</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we generated GM chickens producing cLys-7crp in egg white. When the egg white containing cLys-7crp was orally administered to Cj pollinosis-sensitized mice, sneezing was suppressed upon allergen challenge concurrent with a significant reduction of total and Cry j 1-specific IgE levels in the serum of mice. Of particular note, specific IgE levels in the serum were decreased to that of unprimed mice. These results indicate that eggs derived from GM chickens can be used as edible pharmaceuticals.</p>
