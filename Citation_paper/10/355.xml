      <abstract>
        <p>Stem cells in the developing embryo proliferate and differentiate while maintaining genomic integrity, failure of which may lead to accumulation of mutations and subsequent damage to the embryo. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the <italic>in vitro</italic> counterpart of embryo stem cells are highly sensitive to genotoxic stress. Defective ESCs undergo either efficient DNA damage repair or apoptosis, thus maintaining genomic integrity. However, the genotoxicity- and apoptosis-related processes in germ-line derived pluripotent cells, multipotent adult germ-line stem cells (maGSCs), are currently unknown. Here, we analyzed the expression of apoptosis-related genes using OligoGEArray in undifferentiated maGSCs and ESCs and identified a similar set of genes expressed in both cell types. We detected the expression of intrinsic, but not extrinsic, apoptotic pathway genes in both cell types. Further, we found that apoptosis-related gene expression patterns of differentiated ESCs and maGSCs are identical to each other. Comparative analysis revealed that several pro- and anti-apoptotic genes are expressed specifically in pluripotent cells, but markedly downregulated in the differentiated counterparts of these cells. Activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway cause approximately âˆ¼35% of both ESCs and maGSCs to adopt an early-apoptotic phenotype. Moreover, we performed transcriptome studies using early-apoptotic cells to identify novel pluripotency- and apoptosis-related genes. From these transcriptome studies, we selected <italic>Fgf4</italic> (Fibroblast growth factor 4) and <italic>Mnda</italic> (Myeloid cell nuclear differentiating antigen), which are highly downregulated in early-apoptotic cells, as novel candidates and analyzed their roles in apoptosis and genotoxicity responses in ESCs. Collectively, our results show the existence of common molecular mechanisms for maintaining the pristine stem cell pool of both ESCs and maGSCs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from mouse pre-implantation blastocysts are pluripotent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Evans1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Martin1">[2]</xref> and have the ability to differentiate into all three germ layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Chambers1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Geijsen1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-OShea1">[5]</xref>. During embryogenesis, stem cells proliferate and differentiate, while maintaining the genomic integrity to avoid the accumulation of mutations, which may subsequently damage the embryo. In line with this view, it has been proposed that ESCs might have evolved with mechanisms to protect against genotoxic stress by employing either very efficient DNA repair machinery or by inducing apoptosis when even low levels of DNA damage are encountered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Aladjem1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Fluckiger1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Hong1">[8]</xref>. Moreover, mutation frequencies and mitotic recombination events in ESCs were shown to be 100-fold lower than in somatic cells, thus supporting the existence of efficient mechanisms against genotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Cervantes1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Stambrook1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>ESCs are highly proliferative and display a distinct, short cell cycle (10â€“12 h) with a very brief G1 phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Aladjem1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Chuykin1">[11]</xref>. Unlike somatic cells, ESCs were shown to contain DNA strand breaks (DSBs) marked by Î³H2A.X but do not activate the DNA repair system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Chuykin1">[11]</xref>, suggesting their tolerance to DSBs. Moreover, ESCs do not undergo G1 arrest upon DNA damage partly due to the inactivation of p53 and low levels of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21/Waf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Aladjem1">[6]</xref>. Consistent with these data, it has been reported that in ESCs the checkpoint kinase, Chk2, does not phosphorylate its substrates, such as p53 and Cdc25A, leading to the lack of G1 arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Hong2">[12]</xref>. In contrast to the expected general function of p53 in DNA damage response, it has been reported that p53 mediates the repression of pluripotency gene <italic>Nanog</italic> upon DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Lin1">[13]</xref>. Repression of this core pluripotency factor therefore allows the differentiation of damaged cells and subsequent elimination through p53-mediated mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Lin1">[13]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Multipotent adult germline stem cells (maGSCs) derived from spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) of adult mouse testis are another example of pluripotent stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Guan1">[14]</xref>. These maGSCs are able to differentiate into all the germ layers <italic>in vitro</italic> and can contribute to chimeras with germ-line transmission. Previously, to further investigate the pluripotency-related properties of maGSCs, we have examined the microRNA expression, global gene expression and proteomics analysis and have found similarities with ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Dihazi1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Meyer1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Zovoilis1">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, analysis of the epigenetic features of maGSCs by global and gene-specific DNA methylation and histone modification profiling also demonstrated the similarity of both pluripotent cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Khromov1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Zechner1">[19]</xref>. The successful generation of human maGSCs might provide an alternative to ESCs in regenerative medicine applications, as the use of maGSCs can bypass both ethical and immunological issues.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we analyzed apoptosis-related gene expression in maGSCs and found the expression pattern to be comparable to that of ESCs. We found the expression of intrinsic, but not extrinsic, apoptotic pathway genes in both cell types. We identified the exclusive expression of several pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in both pluripotent cell types, but not in their differentiated counterparts. Activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway cause approximately âˆ¼35% of both ESCs and maGSCs to adopt an early-apoptotic phenotype, demonstrating a strong similarity between these cell types. We performed gene expression profiling on early-apoptotic ESCs and maGSCs and identified two candidate genes, namely <italic>Fibroblast growth factor 4</italic> (<italic>Fgf4</italic>) and <italic>Myeloid cell nuclear differentiating antigen</italic> (<italic>Mnda</italic>), which are highly downregulated upon induction of apoptosis. Further experiments revealed that <italic>Fgf4</italic>-knock-out (<italic>Fgf4</italic>-KO) cells are partially protected against induced genotoxicity.</p>

        <title>Oligonucleotide Microarray for Detection of Apoptosis-specific Gene Expression</title>
        <p>Expression of apoptosis-specific genes in undifferentiated or differentiated maGSCs and ESCs was examined using Mouse Apoptosis OligoGEArray following the manufacturerâ€™s protocol (SABiosciences). Briefly, total RNA extracted from maGSCs and ESCs was used to prepare cDNA followed by biotin 16-dUTP labelling using a GEArray True Amp Labelling kit (SABiosciences). The Mouse Apoptosis OligoGEArray membranes were then hybridized overnight with biotin-labelled cDNA. Signals were detected using a CDP-Star chemiluminescence kit (SABiosciences). Data were analyzed using the GEArray Expression Analysis Suite 2.0 (SABiosciences). For fold differences, an arbitrary threshold of 2 was chosen to signify a substantial fold change in either direction. All experiments were done with two independent biological samples.</p>

        <p>To induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, maGSCs and ESCs were cultured in medium containing citrinin (CTN) (Sigma) or DMSO (Sigma) (as a control) for either 12 or 24 h. To verify and quantify CTN-induced apoptosis in maGSCs and ESCs, annexin-V and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) staining was performed using an Annexin V-PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences). After staining, flow cytometric measurements were performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with CellQuestPro software (BD Biosciences). Early-apoptotic cells were sorted using a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). All experiments were done in three or more independent biological replicates.</p>

        <title>Apoptosis-related Gene Expression Profiling of ESCs and maGSCs</title>
        <p>Genotoxic stress leads to the activation of p53-dependent mechanisms to either repair DNA damage or undergo apoptosis. The high sensitivity of ESCs to genotoxic stress is presumed to be due to their particular expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes. To compare the apoptosis-related gene expression profiles of ESCs and maGSCs, we used OligoGEArray consisting of 112 genes implicated in the process of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The comparison between undifferentiated ESCs and maGSCs of the 129Sv genetic background revealed similar gene expression patterns without any cell type-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The majority of the expressed genes are involved in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (intrinsic) and included no genes, such as <italic>Fas</italic> and <italic>Fadd</italic>, which are implicated in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Among all the analyzed caspases, only <italic>Casp-2</italic> was expressed at detectable level in both cell types. Quantification of the signal intensities using the OligoGEArray suite and scatterplot analysis revealed that, although many genes are equally expressed (below the fold difference threshold of 2) in ESCs and maGSCs, the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>Bok</italic> and three anti-apoptotic/tumor suppressor genes (<italic>p53</italic>, <italic>Birc2</italic>, and <italic>Birc5</italic>) showed significant upregulation in maGSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). We verified the expression of apoptosis and anti-apoptosis genes in our previous global transcriptome comparison of undifferentiated ESCs and maGSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Meyer1">[16]</xref>, and found the upregulation of <italic>Birc5</italic>, but not other genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>, E). Next, we compared the apoptosis-related gene expression profile of ESCs and maGSCs generated from Stra8-EGFP transgenic mice, hereafter referred as ESCs-Stra8 and maGSCs-Stra8, respectively. The gene expression profile of ESCs-Stra8 and maGSCs-Stra8 is identical to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) and is also similar to those of ESCs and maGSCs of the 129Sv background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The quantification and subsequent scatterplot analysis showed the slight downregulation of pro-apoptotic genes, <italic>Bnip3</italic>, <italic>Tnfrsf12a</italic>, and <italic>p53</italic> in maGSCs-Stra8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). The opposing expression pattern of <italic>p53</italic> between two different genetic backgrounds of maGSCs (maGSCs-129Sv and maGSCs-Stra8) prompted us to verify these differences by more sensitive method, qRT-PCR. The qPCR analysis of <italic>p53</italic> as well as two other differentially expressed genes (<italic>Bax</italic> and <italic>Nfkb1</italic>), and two equally expressed control genes (<italic>Atf5</italic> and <italic>Bok</italic>) revealed no significant differences between maGSCs and ESCs of different backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also analyzed the expression profile of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes in ESCs and maGSCs that have been induced to differentiate for 20 days with retinoic acid (RA). The expression pattern of apoptosis-related genes is quite similar in both differentiated cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and is markedly distinct from the expression pattern of undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g001">Fig. 1Bâ€“E</xref>). The scatterplot analysis revealed the upregulation of <italic>Nfkb1</italic> and the downregulation of <italic>Pycard</italic> and <italic>Bnip3</italic> genes in differentiated maGSCs in comparison to differentiated ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). To verify these results, we analysed the global transcriptome data of differentiated ESCs and maGSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Meyer1">[16]</xref>, and found no obvious differences in the expression of apoptosis and anti-apoptosis genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>, F). To highlight the differences between undifferentiated and differentiated cells and also to identify the genes that are specifically expressed in undifferentiated ESCs and maGSCs; we generated a heatmap of all OligoArray data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). All undifferentiated cells possessed similar gene expression patterns and are clustered together, whereas differentiated cells possessed an expression pattern that is quite distinct and are clustered separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Further analysis of the heatmap revealed strong and specific expression of <italic>Mcl1</italic>, <italic>Bax</italic>, <italic>Hells</italic>, and <italic>Nfkb1</italic> genes in undifferentiated ESCs and maGSCs, whereas the expression of these genes was highly downregulated or absent in their differentiated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>â€²). The expression of <italic>p53</italic>, <italic>Api5</italic>, <italic>Birc2</italic>, <italic>Cradd</italic>, and <italic>Bid</italic> genes was moderately high in undifferentiated pluripotent cells compared to RA-differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>â€²). In agreement with these results, we found a significant downregulation of <italic>Hells</italic>, <italic>Nfkb1</italic>, and <italic>p53</italic> in our previous transcriptome data of differentiated ESCs and maGSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Meyer1">[16]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>, D and G, H). In contrast to OligoGEArray results, we found few apoptotic as well as anti-apoptotic genes (<italic>Dapk1</italic>, <italic>Ltbr</italic>, <italic>Xiap</italic>, and <italic>Bcl2l1</italic>) to be upregulated in the transcriptome data of differentiated ESCs and maGSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>, D and G, H). However, these upregulated genes were not detectable in our OligoGEArray studies, suggesting their possible low expression levels which are difficult to detect using OligoGEArray.</p>

        <title>Citrinin-induced Apoptosis and Transcriptome Analysis of Early-apoptotic ESCs and maGSCs</title>
        <p>The particular expression pattern of intrinsic apoptotic pathway-related genes led us to evaluate how both ESCs-129Sv and maGSCs-129Sv (hereafter referred as ESCs and maGSCs, respectively) react to the induction of apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway. Citrinin (CTN), a mycotoxin, is known to induce apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway in ESCs and to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause DNA damage and subsequent p53- induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Chan1">[25]</xref>. Because of these facts, CTN is a suitable compound to study mitochondrial as well as p53-mediated apoptosis. In this context, we induced apoptosis in ESCs and maGSCs with CTN (200 ÂµM) for 24 h and analyzed the percentage of apoptotic cells by annexin-V and 7-AAD staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>â€², Bâ€²). After 24 h of CTN treatment, both ESCs and maGSCs had lost the characteristic colony morphology and appeared as typical apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis after annexin-V and 7-AAD staining revealed a substantial presence of early-apoptotic cells (âˆ¼35% of the total cell population, annexin-V<sup>+ve</sup>/7-AAD<sup>âˆ’ve</sup>) in CTN-treated ESCs and maGSCs, but only âˆ¼8â€“15% of un-treated and DMSO control cells displayed an early-apoptotic phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>â€², Bâ€²). The percentage of late apoptotic (annexin-V<sup>+ve</sup>/7-AAD<sup>+ve</sup>) and viable (annexin-V<sup>âˆ’ve</sup>/7-AAD<sup>âˆ’ve</sup>) cells were also significantly similar between CTN-treated ESCs and maGSCs. Overall, these results indicate that maGSCs, like ESCs, are reactive to CTN and undergo apoptosis at a similar rate.</p>
        <p>The intrinsic-pathway related gene expression pattern seen in our OligoArray suggests that this pathway is constitutively active in pluripotent cells and might play a role in resistance to genotoxicity. Because, CTN is also known to induce DNA damage through the generation of ROS and the subsequent activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, we performed transcriptome analysis using early-apoptotic cells as outlined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) to identify the factors that are responsible for maintaining genomic integrity. Transcriptome analysis of early-apoptotic ESCs and maGSCs revealed that the majority of genes were equally expressed in both cell types (âˆ¼94% similarity), but 1257 (âˆ¼6%) genes were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Several of the pluripotency marker genes expression was slightly downregulated in early-apoptotic cells transcriptome compared to our previously described transcriptome of undifferentiated ESCs and maGSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Meyer1">[16]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s011">Table S2</xref>). Similar analysis for differentiation marker genes of three germ layers revealed no overt changes in their expression, except for downregulation of <italic>Vimentin</italic>, a mesodermal marker gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s012">Table S3</xref>). Comparison of early-apoptotic ESCs transcriptome with transcriptome of undifferentiated ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Meyer1">[16]</xref> showed âˆ¼80% similarity, indicating that only âˆ¼20% genes are differentially regulated in early-apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>). Similarly, early-apoptotic maGSCs showed âˆ¼67% similarity to their undifferentiated counterparts and âˆ¼33% differentially regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>). Further comparison of differentially regulated genes in early-apoptotic ESCs and maGSCs showed âˆ¼44% of commonly upregulated and âˆ¼55% commonly downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s003">Fig. S3C</xref>, D, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s013">Tables S4</xref> &amp; S5). The functional gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that genes associated with several biological processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle processes, response to stress, DNA damage, and DNA repair are upregulated in early-apoptotic cells compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048869-t001">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, genes associated with biological processes such as regulation of transcription, oxidation reduction, intracellular signalling cascade, cell proliferation, cell death, cell adhesion are downregulated in early-apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048869-t002">Table 2</xref>). The principle component analysis (PCA) of the transcriptome of early-apoptotic cells and previously described transcriptomes of undifferentiated and differentiated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Meyer1">[16]</xref> clearly showed the clustering of early-apoptotic ESCs and maGSCs, which are quite distant from their undifferentiated and differentiated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed the transcriptome data using a hierarchical clustering model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s004">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Identification of New Pluripotent Cell-specific and Apoptosis-related Candidate Genes</title>
        <p>The transcriptome analysis of early-apoptotic ESCs and maGSCs facilitated the identification of new candidate genes that might be specifically expressed in pluripotent cells and might play a role in genotoxicity-triggered cell death. We focused on genes with either direct or indirect role in apoptosis and are highly modulated in early-apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s013">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s014">S5</xref>), to characterize their role in response to genotoxicity. Further, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for the selected candidate genes and found downregulated candidate genes, <italic>Matrix metalloproteinase-10</italic> (<italic>Mmp10</italic>) and <italic>Fibroblast growth factor 4</italic> (<italic>Fgf4</italic>) to be specifically expressed in pluripotent cells but not in any of the analyzed adult mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Another downregulated candidate gene that we selected is <italic>Myeloid cell nuclear differentiating agent</italic> (<italic>Mnda</italic>) which bears a death domain with an unknown function. Although <italic>Mnda</italic> is expressed in heart and liver, apart from pluripotent cells, it is expressed in no other mouse tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Expression analysis of other downregulated candidate genes (<italic>Adm</italic>, <italic>Fbln2</italic>, and <italic>Hist1h1b</italic>) revealed ubiquitous expression (data not shown), hence omitted from further analysis. Similarly, we have validated the upregulation of three upregulated candidate genes (<italic>Hist2h2be</italic>, <italic>Hspa1</italic>, and <italic>Mia2</italic>) using qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s005">Fig. S5</xref>), however, these genes showed ubiquitous tissue expression (data not shown).

        <p>To study the role of <italic>Fgf4</italic> in response to induced genotoxicity and apoptosis, we generated an ESC line with stable <italic>Fgf4</italic> overexpression (<italic>Fgf4</italic>-OE) that expressed <italic>Fgf4</italic> at levels approximately 15-fold higher than those found in control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s006">Fig. S6A</xref>) and also used a previously described <italic>Fgf4<sup>âˆ’/âˆ’</sup></italic> ESC line (<italic>Fgf4</italic>-KO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Wilder1">[20]</xref>. Both <italic>Fgf4</italic>-OE and <italic>Fgf4</italic>-KO cell lines showed normal colony morphology and proliferation under standard ESC culture conditions (data not shown). Moreover, when induced to differentiate for 12 days with RA treatment, both cell types demonstrated differentiation potential comparable to control cells, as assessed by qPCR of pluripotency and differentiation marker genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s007">Fig. S7A and B</xref>). Previously, <italic>Fgf4</italic>-KO cells were shown to differentiate into all three germ layers in teratoma formation assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Wilder1">[20]</xref>. We tested the teratoma formation potential of <italic>Fgf4</italic>-OE cells and found cell types from all three germ layers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s007">Fig. S7C</xref>), suggesting that the alteration of <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression has no overt effect on their differentiation potential. We challenged both <italic>Fgf4</italic>-KO and <italic>Fgf4</italic>-OE cells with CTN for 12 h and 24 h, and assayed for survival with annexin-V and 7-AAD staining. Analysis of these results indicated that both <italic>Fgf4</italic>-OE and <italic>Fgf4</italic>-KO cells responded to CTN in a similar manner with no noticeable differences from the wild-type cells response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g004">Fig. 4Dâ€“F</xref>).</p>
        <p>To analyze the DNA damage response in <italic>Fgf4</italic>-OE and <italic>Fgf4</italic>-KO, we induced DNA damage with neocarzinostatin (NCS), a known, potent inducer of DSBs, similar to Î³-irradiation, in various cell types. Currently, there are no reports of NCS treatment on ESCs or other pluripotent cell lines. To verify the DSBs induction in ESCs, we stained the control and NCS treated ESCs with Î³-H2A.X, a marker for DSBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). Analysis of these results indicated the presence of a weak but significant amount of Î³-H2A.X staining in control cells and higher signal intensities in NCS-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s008">Fig. S8</xref>).

Treatment of maGSCs with NCS revealed DNA damage induction and repair with similar pattern like ESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s008">Fig. S8</xref>), suggesting the existence of similar DNA damage response mechanisms in both cell types.

        <title>Role of Mnda in Response to Apoptosis and Genotoxicity Induction</title>
        <p>To study the role of <italic>Mnda</italic> in response to genotoxicity- and apoptosis-inducing stimuli, we generated a stable <italic>Mnda</italic>-overexpressing cell line (<italic>Mnda</italic>-OE), in which <italic>Mnda</italic> is expressed at levels âˆ¼3-fold higher than in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s006">Fig. S6B</xref>). We also generated a cell line (<italic>Mnda</italic>-DN), in which <italic>Mnda</italic> is downregulated through stable expression of shRNA against <italic>Mnda</italic>, resulting in approximately 90% downregulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s006">Fig. S6B</xref>). These two cell lines displayed normal colony morphology and proliferation under standard ESC culture conditions (data not shown) and also differentiated to all three germ layers when treated with either RA or assayed for teratoma formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s007">Fig. S7A</xref>â€“C). We challenged <italic>Mnda</italic>-DN and <italic>Mnda</italic>-OE cells with CTN for 12 h and 24 h, and analyzed for the survival rate. No overt differences in cell survival rates were observed between control, <italic>Mnda</italic>-OE, and <italic>Mnda</italic>-DN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g004">Fig. 4D, G, H</xref>).</p>
        <p>Additionally, we treated <italic>Mnda</italic>-OE and <italic>Mnda</italic>-DN cells with NCS and analyzed the cell cycle parameters at various time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048869-g005">Fig. 5Aâ€“F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048869.s009">Fig. S9</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Several studies have reported that multipotent germline stem cells (mGSCs) that are morphologically and functionally similar to ESCs can be generated from SSCs of neonatal and adult mouse testis, suggesting that SSCs have the ability to give rise to pluripotent cells <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Guan1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Izadyar1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-KanatsuShinohara1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-KanatsuShinohara2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Ko1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Seandel1">[32]</xref>. mGSCs from adult mouse testis, termed multipotent adult germline stem cells (maGSCs), were first generated and described in 2006 by our group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Guan1">[14]</xref>. To further evaluate the pluripotent cell characteristics of maGSCs, we extensively studied maGSCs alongside ESCs and demonstrated the similarities between these two cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Dihazi1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Meyer1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Zovoilis1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Khromov1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Zechner1">[19]</xref>. In the present study, we investigated the apoptosis-related gene expression profiles and also the cellular responses to apoptosis induction. Further, we selected two candidate genes, namely <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Mnda</italic>, and analyzed their roles in apoptosis or genotoxicity responses in pluripotent cells.</p>
      <p>ESCs are characterized by self-renewal, a high rate of proliferation, a characteristic short cell cycle, and the potential to differentiate into all cell lineages of the organism. It is essential to understand how ESCs maintain genome stability and integrity during this rapid proliferation. It has been suggested that ESCs might have evolved with conserved and precise mechanisms to prevent the accumulation of mutations. The existence of such protective mechanisms is further supported by the following evidence: (1) the mutation and somatic recombination frequencies of mouse ESCs are 100-fold lower than in adult somatic cells (fibroblasts) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Cervantes1">[9]</xref>, (2) human and mouse ESCs bear a very efficient antioxidant defense against DNA damage mediated by ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Saretzki1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Saretzki2">[34]</xref>, and (3) ESCs are hypersensitive to genotoxicity and can undergo apoptosis without the activation of cell cycle checkpoints, leading to the effective elimination of defective cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Aladjem1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To evaluate the pluripotent cell-specific, apoptosis-related properties of maGSCs, we analyzed the expression of apoptosis-related genes and found an expression profile similar to ESCs. Both cell types displayed the expression of genes involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, suggesting a strong similarity between undifferentiated ESCs and maGSCs. Interestingly, we could not detect the expression of genes involved in extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (death receptors and their ligands) suggesting the inactivity or weak activity of this pathway in both pluripotent cell types. Consistent with this data, an earlier study showed the expression of <italic>Fas</italic> receptor only after inducing apoptosis through O6-methylguanine (O6 MeG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Roos1">[35]</xref>. Further, we compared the gene expression profile in RA-differentiated ESCs and maGSCs to evaluate the patterns and similarities of apoptotic genes during differentiation. In agreement with our previous findings from gene expression analysis of RA-differentiated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Meyer1">[16]</xref>, both differentiated ESCs and maGSCs possessed an apoptosis-related gene expression profile similar to each other but in sharp contrast to that of undifferentiated cells. The expression of many anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic genes are downregulated in RA-differentiated cells, indicating that expression of these genes is specific to pluripotent cells. As ESCs are known to be highly sensitive to genotoxic stress and effectively eliminate damaged cells through apoptosis, the specific expression of these anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic genes may suggest a role in the elimination of defective cells.</p>
      <p>The transcriptome analysis of early-apoptotic cells led to the identification of <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Mnda</italic> as highly downregulated genes that might play a role in mitochondrial or p53-mediated apoptotic response. Fgf4 belongs to the FGF superfamily of proteins and is involved in various stages of embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Kosaka1">[36]</xref>. Although <italic>Fgf4</italic> is highly expressed in ESCs relative to differentiated cells, alteration of its expression in undifferentiated ESCs has only slight effects on survival and morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Wilder1">[20]</xref>. <italic>Fgf4</italic>-deficient ESCs show reduced survival of differentiated cells and this could be reversed by the addition of Fgf4 to the culture medium, suggesting that Fgf4 plays an essential role in differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Wilder1">[20]</xref>. Because the role of Fgf4 during induced apoptosis or genotoxicity in undifferentiated ESCs had not yet been explored, we induced apoptosis or genotoxicity in <italic>Fgf4</italic>-overexpressing and knock-out (<italic>Fgf4</italic>-OE and <italic>Fgf4</italic>-KO, respectively) ESCs. Interestingly, <italic>Fgf4</italic>-KO cells appeared to be partially protected against DNA damage-induced apoptosis, whereas <italic>Fgf4</italic>-OE cells did not display any abnormalities. These results are in contrast to previous findings, which showed that induced expression of Fgf4 functions as an anti-apoptotic factor of male germ cells and protects them from hyperthermia-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Hirai1">[26]</xref>. These contrasting results could partly be due to different cell types or due to the resistance of <italic>Fgf4</italic>-KO cells to differentiation. It has been reported that ESCs with DNA damage can induce differentiation by p53-dependent suppression of <italic>Nanog</italic> that leads to the effective elimination of those differentiated (Nanog negative) cells by p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Lin1">[13]</xref>. It is interesting to note that the deficiency of Fgf4 blocks differentiation and increases cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Kunath1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Westerman1">[38]</xref>. Hence, we suggest that <italic>Fgf4</italic>-KO cells might be resistant to DNA damage-induced differentiation (note: not a RA induced differentiation) and subsequent apoptosis by p53-dependent mechanisms. These results are in parallel with the observed downregulation of <italic>Fgf4</italic> during early-apoptosis, possibly to maintain their survival. It has been reported that the inhibition of Fgf/Erk signalling pathways can contribute to the derivation and maintenance of â€˜naÃ¯veâ€™ pluripotent stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Lanner1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Ying1">[40]</xref>. In wake of our observations, it remains to be investigated that whether <italic>Fgf4</italic> deficient/blocked pluripotent cells carry more DNA damage burden and chromosomal aberrations or have efficient DNA damage repair machinery to maintain the pluripotency.</p>
      <p>Mnda is a member of the interferon (IFN)-regulated 200 family of proteins that contain a partially conserved 220-amino acid domain, and is thought to interact specifically with other transcriptional regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Johnstone1">[41]</xref>. The members of this family also contain a pyrin domain at the amino-terminus, which is proposed to function in programmed cell death and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Stehlik1">[42]</xref>. Moreover, several proteins of this family, including human MNDA (hMNDA), were shown to promote programmed cell death in several experimental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Aglipay1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Briggs1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-DSouza1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-FotouhiArdakani1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Wen1">[47]</xref>. Until now, the expression of <italic>hMNDA</italic> was reported only in hematopoietic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Briggs1">[44]</xref>. Moreover, the expression of <italic>hMNDA</italic> is most significantly downregulated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in which elevated levels of apoptosis are detected in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048869-Pradhan1">[27]</xref>. Since the expression pattern and the role of mouse Mnda is not yet known and it is highly downregulated during CTN-induced apoptosis, we sought to analyze the function of this protein in responses to genotoxicity. Unfortunately, we did not observe any significant differences in protection or sensitivity to apoptosis between control and either <italic>Mnda</italic>-OE or <italic>Mnda</italic>-DN cells when apoptosis was induced through CTN. On the other hand, induction of DNA damage in <italic>Mnda</italic>-OE and <italic>Mnda</italic>-DN cells exhibited prolonged G2/M arrest. These results indicate that the expression level of <italic>Mnda</italic> in ESCs is critical to respond against DNA damage. The detection of similar apoptosis levels at 48 h between <italic>Mnda</italic>-altered cells and control cells is elusive and remains to be investigated.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the functional GO analysis of differentially expressed genes in early-apoptotic cells revealed the activation of stress response and DNA damage repair pathways, and downregulation of cell death pathways, suggesting the activation of cell survival mechanisms during early-apoptotic events. Taken together, the detected significant differences after DNA damage induction, but not during apoptosis induction, in ESCs with altered expression of <italic>Fgf4</italic> or <italic>Mnda</italic>, suggest that these genes play an essential role in maintaining genomic integrity and regulating cell survival in the very early-stages of induced apoptosis before the cascade of the intrinsic pathway becomes activated.</p>
