<abstract>
<p><italic>Salicornia brachiata</italic> is an extreme halophyte that grows luxuriantly in coastal marshes. Previously, we have reported isolation and characterization of ESTs from <italic>Salicornia</italic> with large number of novel/unknown salt-responsive gene sequences. In this study, we have selected a novel salt-inducible gene <italic>SbSI-2</italic> (<italic><underline>S</underline>alicornia <underline>b</underline>rachiata <underline>s</underline>alt-<underline>i</underline>nducible-2</italic>) for functional characterization. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SbSI-2 protein has predicted nuclear localization signals and a strong protein-protein interaction domain. Transient expression of the RFP:SbSI2 fusion protein confirmed that SbSI-2 is a nuclear-localized protein. Genomic organization study showed that <italic>SbSI-2</italic> is intronless and has a single copy in <italic>Salicornia</italic> genome. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed higher <italic>SbSI-2</italic> expression under salt stress and desiccation conditions. The <italic>SbSI-2</italic> gene was transformed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and tobacco for functional characterization. pET28a-SbSI-2 recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic> cells showed higher tolerance to desiccation and salinity compared to vector alone. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing <italic>SbSI-2</italic> have improved salt- and osmotic tolerance, accompanied by better growth parameters, higher relative water content, elevated accumulation of compatible osmolytes, lower Na<sup>+</sup> and ROS accumulation and lesser electrolyte leakage than the wild-type. Overexpression of the <italic>SbSI-2</italic> also enhanced transcript levels of ROS-scavenging genes and some stress-related transcription factors under salt and osmotic stresses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that <italic>SbSI-2</italic> might play an important positive modulation role in abiotic stress tolerance. This identifies <italic>SbSI-2</italic> as a novel determinant of salt/osmotic tolerance and suggests that it could be a potential bioresource for engineering abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The world population is increasing rapidly and may reach 6 to 9.3 billion by the year 2050, whereas crop production is decreasing rapidly because of the negative impact of various environmental stresses; therefore, it is now very important to develop stress tolerant varieties to cope with this upcoming problem of food security <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Mahajan1">[1]</xref>. Major abiotic stresses includes high salinity, drought, temperature extremes, water logging, high light intensity, and mineral deficiencies. Abiotic stresses reduce plant growth and development, causing poor productivity or plant death in extreme conditions. Abiotic stresses are the primary causes of crop loss worldwide, reducing average yields of major crop plants by more than 50% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Vinocur1">[2]</xref>. Plants adapt to environmental stresses via a plethora of responses, including the activation of molecular networks that regulate stress perception, signal transduction and the expression of both stress-related genes and metabolites. Plants have stress-specific adaptive responses as well as responses which protect the plants from more than one environmental stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Huang1">[3]</xref>. Various genes induced by abiotic stresses are grouped under two categories, namely functional genes and regulatory genes. The first category of genes generally facilitates production of important enzymes and metabolic proteins, which include osmolytes, transporters/channel proteins, antioxidative enzymes, lipid biosynthesis genes, polyamines and sugars. The second category of genes consists of regulatory proteins, such as Transcription factors (TFs) belonging to the bZIP, DREB, MYC/MYB, and NAC families, which control expression of many downstream stress tolerance genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-YamaguchiShinozaki1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Hadiarto1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Nakashima1">[6]</xref>. A number of abiotic stress-related genes, as well as some transcription factors and regulatory sequences in plant promoters have been characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-YamaguchiShinozaki1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Agarwal1">[7]</xref>. Whole genome sequencing and microarray analysis have provided valuable insight towards the understanding of molecular mechanism of abiotic stress tolerance involving a number of functional and regulatory genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Agarwal1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Seki1">[8]</xref>. Transcription factors modulate expression of specific groups of genes through sequence specific DNA binding and protein-protein interaction. They can act as activators or repressors of gene expression, leading to specific cellular responses. Abiotic stress related TFs follow ABA dependent and independent pathways. Identification of key regulatory TFs and their regulatory activators and repressors, their target genes and protein partners is essential to understand the regulatory complex networks. Studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> indicated that a number of <italic>cis</italic>-elements and their corresponding binding proteins, i.e. TFs, are involved in plant stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-YamaguchiShinozaki1">[4]</xref>. It has been reported that transgenic plants overexpressing genes encoding key transcription factors showed enhanced tolerance to various abiotic stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Nakashima1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Dubouzet1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Xiang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Li1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Hao1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-He1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Halophytes are useful organisms to study salt tolerance mechanisms because they are well adapted to salinity and can overcome this problem more efficiently than glycophytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Gong1">[14]</xref>. Halophytes have a unique genetic makeup allowing them to grow and survive under salt stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Agarwal2">[15]</xref>. Experimental studies in our laboratory have concentrated on an extreme halophyte, <italic>Salicornia brachiata</italic> Roxb., in an effort to identify and characterize novel/unknown genes that enable salt tolerance. <italic>S. brachiata</italic> (<italic>Amaranthaceae</italic>), a leafless succulent annual halophyte, commonly grows in the salt marshes of Gujarat coast in India. <italic>Salicornia</italic> can grow in a wide range of salt concentrations (0.1–2.0 M) and can accumulate quantities of salt as high as 40% of its dry weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Agarwal2">[15]</xref>. This unique characteristic provides an advantage for the study of salt tolerance mechanisms. Therefore, this plant may serve as a potential bioresource for salt-responsive genes study.</p>
<p>Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) analysis is a rapid and powerful method for elucidating information regarding gene expression and also provides an opportunity to identify new genes involved in biological functions. EST databases have been developed in many glycophytic plant species in response to different stresses like cold, desiccation, high salinity and ABA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Vinocur1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Amtmann1">[16]</xref> and also in some halophytes. In addition to known functional genes, unknown and hypothetical genes provide a good candidate pool to find novel stress tolerance genes. A large number of unknown genes, which lack similarity with known genes in the NCBI database, have been reported. It can be envisaged that these unknown genes constitute the unique genetic make-up of the plant helping it to sustain itself under stress condition. EST databases of different halophytic plants show a large percentage of unknown genes like <italic>Sueda salsa</italic> (22%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Zhang1">[17]</xref>), <italic>Mesembryanthum crystallinum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Koreeda1">[18]</xref>, <italic>Thellungiella halophilla</italic> (32%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Wang1">[19]</xref>), <italic>Avicennia marina</italic> (30%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Mehta1">[20]</xref>), <italic>Limonium sinense</italic> (37%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Chen1">[21]</xref>), <italic>Aleuropus littoralis</italic> (20%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Zouri1">[22]</xref>), <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> (13%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Baisakh1">[23]</xref>), <italic>Macrotyloma uniflorum</italic> (30%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Reddy1">[24]</xref>), <italic>S. brachiata</italic> (29%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Jha1">[25]</xref>), <italic>Tamarix hispida</italic> (21%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Li2">[26]</xref>), Alfalfa (22%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Jin1">[27]</xref>) and <italic>Chenopodium album</italic> (42%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Gu1">[28]</xref>). Previously, we have identified approximately 1000 ESTs in response to salt stress from <italic>S. brachiata</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Jha1">[25]</xref> and also characterized some important abiotic stress tolerant genes (<italic>SbGST</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Jha2">[29]</xref>; <italic>SbMAPKK</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Agarwal2">[15]</xref>; <italic>SbDREB2A</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Gupta1">[30]</xref>; <italic>SbNHX1</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Jha3">[31]</xref>; <italic>SbASR1</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Jha4">[32]</xref>; <italic>SbSOS1</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Yadav1">[33]</xref>; <italic>SbSI-1</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Yadav2">[34]</xref>). The <italic>S. brachiata</italic> EST database contains large number of novel/unknown/hypothetical genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Jha1">[25]</xref>. These genes might be playing an important role in providing salinity stress adaptation to <italic>Salicornia</italic>, and therefore can serve as a valuable bioresource for engineering abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants. With this aim we have characterized a novel salt-inducible gene <italic>SbSI-2</italic> in response to salt and osmotic stress, through its heterologous expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> and tobacco.</p>

<p><italic>Salicornia brachiata</italic> seeds were harvested from dried plants collected from the coastal area near Bhavnagar (Latitude 21° 45′N, Longitude 72° 14′E), Gujarat, India. The seeds were germinated in plastic pots containing garden soil and the plants were grown in natural conditions. One-month-old seedlings were carefully uprooted and transferred to hydroponic culture (½ major and minor MS stock, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Murashige1">[35]</xref>) in a culture room with a dark/light cycle of 8/16 h at 25°C for one month. The nutrient solution was renewed twice in a week. Plants were given different stress treatments like salt stress (250 mM NaCl) and desiccation by wrapping in tissue paper for 0, 6, 12 and 24 h. Upon completion of the treatments, shoot tissues were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.</p>

<p>To study the effect of salt stress on germination, WT and transgenic lines seeds (L11, L17 and L22) were germinated in MS medium supplemented with 0 or 200 mM NaCl.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Abiotic stress reduces plant growth and survival. Plants survive various stresses by controlling responses at both cellular and molecular level. Plant adaptation to abiotic stress involves a plethora of genes related to ion homeostasis, compatible osmolytes synthesis, ROS-scavenging and antioxidant defence mechanism. Characterization of unknown genes is an important and challenging task in deciphering their role in stress tolerance. In our previous study we have identified 270 unknown/hypothetical genes and 12 miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Jha1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Singh1">[52]</xref>. Out of 270 unknown/hypothetical genes 90 unknown genes confirmed their role in salt stress by reverse Northern analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Jha1">[25]</xref>. The <italic>SbSI-2</italic> cDNA fragment spanning the entire open reading frame (ORF) was cloned and sequenced (Gen-Bank accession number JX872273). Amino acid sequence analysis of SbSI-2 by different <italic>in silico</italic> tools revealed important features like three distinct regions, nuclear localization signals (NLS), leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES), strong protein-protein interaction domain and phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101926.s002">Figs. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101926.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101926.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101926.s005">S5</xref>). Transient expression of the RFP:SbSI2 fusion protein also showed that SbSI-2 is a nuclear-localized protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting that SbSI-2 may function in the nucleus. Nuclear localization is an integral part of abiotic stress response. Many stress-associated proteins, like some TFs (bZIP, DREB, MYC/MYB, NAC, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein Msn2P), some kinase gene and a number of functional proteins belong to a subset of cellular proteins that localize to the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Li1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Hao1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Gorner1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Knowlton1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Boudsocq1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Li3">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Kong1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Yang1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Zhang2">[59]</xref>.

Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of a single copy of <italic>SbSI-2</italic> in the <italic>S. brachiata</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>SbSI-2</italic> showed the increased mRNA expression by salt stress and desiccation, signifying that <italic>SbSI-2</italic> plays an important role in abiotic stress tolerance. Heterologous expression of <italic>SbSI-2</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells demonstrated that pET28a-SbSI-2 recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic> cells showed better tolerance to desiccation and salinity compared to vector alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Similar to our study, a few earlier publications have also reported better growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells by overexpression of other plant stress-associated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Gupta1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Yadav2">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Liu1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Chaurasia1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Hong1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Reddy2">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Jinlong1">[65]</xref>.

To further understand the function of <italic>SbSI-2</italic> under abiotic stress, we developed <italic>SbSI-2</italic>-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants. Testing for a range of physiological parameters it was found that tobacco plants overexpressing <italic>SbSI-2</italic> have improved salt and osmotic tolerance, accompanied by better growth, higher seed germination, better water status, and higher photosynthetic rate as compared to WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g004">Figs. 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g005">5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g006">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g007">7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g009">9</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g010">10</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g011">11A</xref>). The better water status in transgenic plants, indicate that SbSI-2 helps in water retention during NaCl and osmotic stress.</p>
<p>The relative abundance of proline and total soluble sugar are important biochemical indicators of salinity and drought stress in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Ashraf1">[66]</xref>. It has been reported that increased proline content under various environmental stresses significantly improved plant stress tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Abraham1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Verbruggen1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Cvikrov1">[69]</xref>. Proline protects the plants in response to salt and drought stresses by osmoprotection and ROS-scavenging, which contributes to membrane stability and mitigates the disruptive effect of stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Szekely1">[70]</xref>. Transgenic plants overexpressing <italic>SbSI-2</italic> accumulate higher proline relative to WT plants during salt and osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g007">Figs. 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g011">11C</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, transgenic plants facing salt and osmotic stress exhibited low electrolyte leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g007">Figs. 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g011">11B</xref>). Plants experiencing abiotic stress often exhibit symptoms of oxidative stress as evidenced by elevated accumulation of ROS and MDA contents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Verslues1">[71]</xref>. It has been reported that plants maintain their ROS pools at low levels in order to minimize cellular damage caused by oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Harb1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Foyer1">[73]</xref>. ROS accumulation depends on the balance between production and contemporaneous scavenging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Pitzschke1">[74]</xref>. Plant cells have a complex antioxidant defence system for ROS-detoxification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Miller1">[75]</xref>. The overexpression of <italic>SbSI-2</italic> reduced accumulation of ROS in response to salt and osmotic stresses, which indicates a reduced oxidative damage resulting from stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g007">Figs. 7D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g011">11D, E</xref>).</p>
<p>Salinity stress leads to increase in cellular Na<sup>+</sup> and decrease in K<sup>+</sup>, which causes an ion-toxic effect in cells, physiological drought, and lack of nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Zhu1">[76]</xref>. Therefore, maintenance of a low intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration or a high cytosolic K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio is crucial for salt tolerance in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Lynch1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Maathuis1">[78]</xref>. Studies have shown that, among glycophytes such as wheat, Na<sup>+</sup> efflux and high K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio are the key mechanisms involved in salt tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-Munns1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101926-RodrguezNavarro1">[80]</xref>. To decipher the mechanism by which <italic>SbSI-2</italic> overexpression improves salt tolerance, ion contents analysis were carried out in transgenic and WT plants under non-stress and salt-stress conditions. <italic>SbSI-2</italic>-overexpressing transgenic tobacco seedlings accumulated lower Na<sup>+</sup> and higher K<sup>+</sup> content after salt stress, with improved K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g008">Fig. 8</xref>), suggesting that <italic>SbSI-2</italic> overexpression ensures better physiological activities and imparts salt tolerance by increasing the K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio. On the basis of these physiological and biochemical analysis, we can speculate that improved salt and osmotic tolerance in the <italic>SbSI-2</italic>-overexpressing transgenic lines is correlated with high water retention capacity, higher accumulation of osmolytes, high K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio, reduced electrolyte leakage and less accumulation of ROS.</p>
<p>To gain further insight into enhanced abiotic stress tolerance in <italic>SbSI-2</italic>-overexpressing transgenic tobacco at the molecular level, the expression levels of ROS-scavenging genes (<italic>NtSOD</italic>, <italic>NtAPX</italic> and <italic>NtCAT</italic>) and some stress-associated TFs (<italic>NtDREB2</italic> and <italic>AP2</italic>-domains containing TF) were evaluated in transgenic and WT plants. <italic>SbSI-2</italic>-overexpressing lines showed higher expression of genes encoding ROS-scavenging enzymes (SOD, APX and CAT) under salt or osmotic stress, which was consistent with the lower levels of ROS in transgenic seedlings relative to WT seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101926-g012">Fig. 12</xref>). In present study, the bioinformatics analysis and transient expression assays of the RFP:SbSI2 fusion protein showed that SbSI-2 is a nuclear-localized protein and has a strong protein-protein interaction domain which possibly interact with transcription factors that regulate the expression of the abiotic stress-responsive genes. To further investigate, we have carried out expression analysis of two stress-associated TFs <italic>DREB2</italic> and <italic>AP2</italic>-domains containing TF in transgenic lines and WT plants. <italic>SbSI-2</italic>-overexpressing plants showed up-regulated expression of <italic>DREB2</italic> and <italic>AP2</italic>-domains containing TF, which in turn enhanced the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes. These results demonstrate that <italic>SbSI-2</italic> might play vital positive regulatory role in abiotic stress tolerance. Taken together, we propose that the improved salt and osmotic tolerance in <italic>SbSI-2</italic>-overexpressing transgenic plants might be achieved by elevated expression of stress-associated TFs, which in turn up-regulate the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes. However, further study is needed to confirm this.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have cloned and characterized a novel salt-inducible gene <italic>SbSI-2</italic> from the extreme halophyte <italic>Salicornia brachiata</italic>. The <italic>SbSI-2</italic> gene showed up-regulation by different abiotic stresses. Subcellular localization study indicated that the SbSI-2 protein is nuclear-localized. The <italic>SbSI-2</italic> gene was transformed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and tobacco for functional characterization. pET28a-SbSI-2 recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic> cells showed higher tolerance to desiccation and salinity compared to vector alone. Further, overexpression of the <italic>SbSI-2</italic> gene in tobacco conferred salt- and osmotic tolerance by promoted seed germination, improved growth parameters, higher relative water content, higher K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio, higher chlorophyll and elevated accumulation of of compatible osmolytes as compared to control plants. Transgenic plants exhibited reduction in electrolyte leakage and ROS in response to salt and osmotic stresses. Overexpression of <italic>SbSI-2</italic> also enhanced the transcript levels of ROS-scavenging genes and some stress-responsive TFs under salt and osmotic stresses. The present study demonstrates that <italic>SbSI-2</italic> might play an important positive modulation role in abiotic stress tolerance and suggests that it could be a potential bioresource for bioengineering abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants.</p>
