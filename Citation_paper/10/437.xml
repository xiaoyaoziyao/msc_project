<abstract>
<p>Heterosis is associated with differential gene expression between hybrids and their parental lines, and the genes involved in cell proliferation played important roles. <italic>AtARF2</italic> is a general cell proliferation repressor in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In our previous study, two homologues (<italic>ZmARF10 and ZmARF25</italic>) of <italic>AtARF2</italic> were identified in maize, but their relationship with heterosis was not elucidated. Here, the expression patterns of <italic>ZmARF10 and ZmARF25</italic> in seedling leaves of maize hybrids and their parental lines were analyzed. The results of qRT-PCR exhibited that <italic>ZmARF25</italic> was down-regulated in leaf basal region of hybrids. Moreover, overexpression of <italic>ZmARF25</italic> led to reduced organ size in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which was mainly due to the decrease in cell number, not cell size. In addition, the cell proliferation related genes <italic>AtANT, AtGIF1</italic> and <italic>AtGRF5</italic> were down-regulated in 35S::<italic>ZmARF25</italic> transgenic lines. Collectively, we proposed that the down-regulation of <italic>ZmARF25</italic> in maize hybrid may accelerate cell proliferation and promote leaf development, which, in turn, contributes to the observed leaf size heterosis in maize.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heterosis is defined as advantageous quantitative and qualitative traits of offspring over their parents, and the utilization of heterosis principles has been a major practice for increasing productivity of plants and animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Budak1">[1]</xref>. In spite of its importance and successful application, the underlying molecular mechanism for heterosis is still needs to be elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Lippman1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Birchler2">[5]</xref>. Studies on plant form evolution suggest that phenotype evolution often proceeds through changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Doebley1">[6]</xref>. Theoretically, all the genes in hybrid are inherited from its two parental lines, but hybrid performance or phenotype can be quite different from its parents, thereby, demonstrating heterosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Romagnoli1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Sun1">[8]</xref>. Therefore, the alteration of gene expression in hybrids may be responsible for hybrid vigor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Chen1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Sun1">[8]</xref>. Up to date, genome wide gene expression profiles of different organs or tissues between hybrids and their parents in plants have been analyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Huang1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Li1">[15]</xref>, and all possible modes of gene action were observed, including additivity, high- and low-parent dominance, underdominance, and overdominance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Huang1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Li1">[15]</xref>. To gain further insight into the possible roles of differentially expressed genes between hybrid and its parental lines in plant development and heterosis, the functions of some differentially expressed genes have been characterized, and some of which may contribute to the observed heterosis. For example, overexpression of wheat hybrid up-regulated gene (<italic>ADP-ribosylation factor</italic>, <italic>TaARF</italic>) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> displayed increased growth rates during the seedling and adult stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Yao1">[16]</xref>. Overexpression of Larix hybrid up-regulated gene <italic>LaAP2L1</italic>, a member of the AP2/EREBP transcription factor family, led to markedly enlarged organs and heterosis-like traits in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Li2">[17]</xref>. Expression of an up-regulated protein ZmACT2 in dry embryos of maize hybrid in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> partially complemented the low germination phenotype in the <italic>Atact7</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Guo1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Heterosis affects nearly any trait in nearly every hybrid, hence one of the major challenges for expression analysis is deciding which tissue to be analyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Li3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-FlintGarcia1">[20]</xref>. It was proposed that seedling leaves can be used as a model system to investigate the molecular basis of maize heterosis, because it is commonly observed that hybrids produce larger leaf areas than their corresponding parental lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-FlintGarcia1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Uchimiya1">[24]</xref>. At the cellular level, a crucial effect of leaf size heterosis is manifested by primarily increases in cell number, not cell size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-PavLrKovA1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Kiesselbach1">[27]</xref>. Recent study provided molecular evidence for the relationship between cell proliferation and heterotic maize growth. For example, the expression level of maize <italic>CNR</italic> gene, ortholog of <italic>fruit weight 2.2</italic> (<italic>fw2.2</italic>) in tomato, was founded to be negatively correlated with growth activity and hybrid vigor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Guo2">[28]</xref>. Collectively, it reveals that the study of cell number control is eminently important to understanding the underlying mechanism for leaf size heterosis.</p>
<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, auxin signaling plays a vital role in leaf growth and development processes and some key genes, including <italic>AtARF2</italic>, <italic>AtARF7 and AtARF19</italic>, have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Schruff1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Krizek1">[31]</xref>. In our previous study, 31 maize genes that encode ARFs (Auxin Response Factors) were identified in maize genome, and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that two of them, <italic>ZmARF10</italic> and <italic>ZmARF25</italic>, were homologous to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth repressor <italic>AtARF2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Xing1">[32]</xref>. In this study, the expression patterns of <italic>ZmARF10</italic> and <italic>ZmARF25</italic> in seedling leaves of maize hybrids and their parental lines were investigated and the function of hybrid down-regulated gene <italic>ZmARF25</italic> was characterized. Our data showed that ectopic expression of <italic>ZmARF25</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> led to reduced organ size, indicating that the alteration of auxin signaling pathway might play an important role in maize leaf size heterosis.</p>

<title>Plant Materials and Growth Conditions</title>
<p>Maize inbred lines Mo17, B73, Zong3, 87-1 and their hybrids Mo17/B73, B73/Mo17, Zong3/87-1, 87-1/Zong3, B73/Zong3, Zong3/B73, B73/87-1 and 87-1/B73 were used for this study. Maize seeds were imbibed at 28°C in the dark, and the seeds after germination were selected with the same length of coleoptile (2.0 cm) to grow in hydroponic culture on a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle, at a temperature of 29°C and 25°C for the light and dark cycle, respectively. In maize leaf, the mature zone is composed of fully differentiated cells and cell division is restricted to the growing zone composed of immature cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Li3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Palmer1">[33]</xref>. Therefore, thirty millimeters from the base of the third leaves and twenty millimeters from the tip of the same leaf of a seedling 5 days after germination (DAG) were dissected and harvested for RNA extractions.</p>
<p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Col-0) seeds were sterilized by a 60 s 70% ethanol treatment followed by 1% NaClO within 10 min, four washes in distilled water, and chilled at 4°C for 3 days. Seeds were sown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates with 3% sucrose and 0.8% agar in a culture room at 22°C under a 16/8 light/dark cycle. After germination, 10-day-old <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings were transplanted and grown at a density of four plants per pot containing a mixture of soil and vermiculite (2∶1) at 22°C under a 16/8 light/dark cycle with 70% relative humidity.</p>

<title>Leaf Area Measurements</title>
<p>Leaves were scanned using ImageScanner (GE Healthcare, USA), and measured with a public domain image analysis software (ImageJ version 1.32; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). For maize leaf area measurements, the third leaves were harvested in the morning (10∶00–10∶30 am) and experiments were done in three biological replicates and 10 plants of each genotype were analyzed for each replicate. The <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine the significance of the differences in leaf areas between hybrid and the corresponding mid-parental value. The mid-parent heterosis (MPH) was calculated using the following formula: MPH = (F<sub>1</sub>−mid-parental value)/mid-parental value in %, where F<sub>1</sub> is the average value of hybrid, and the mid-parental value is the average value of the two parents.</p>
<p>Ten 30-day-old <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants of each transgenic line and wild-type were selected randomly for the fully expanded fifth leaf area measurements. The <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine the significance of the differences in leaf area between transgenic plants and wild-type plants.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Histological Analysis</title>
<p>After the area measurements, the fully expanded fifth leaves of the ten 30-day-old <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants of each transgenic line and wild-type were used for epidermal cell size measurements. Leaves were first boiled in water for 10 min to kill the cells, and then immersed in 95% ethyl alcohol, after decolorized, they were transferred to hot (96°C) 85% lactic acid for 8 min. Finally, the leaves were transferred to room temperature lactic acid and examined using a Nikon Stereo Microscope. The number of epidermal cells was determined in an area of 0.58 mm<sup>2</sup> in the middle region of the fifth leaf blade. The average cell size was measured by dividing 0.58 mm<sup>2</sup> by the number of epidermal. The total number of cells per leaf was calculated by dividing the leaf area by the average cell size. Statistical calculations were performed with Microsoft EXCEL.</p>

<title>Isolation of DNA and Total RNA</title>
<p>Total DNA was extracted by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-SaghaiMaroof1">[34]</xref> with minor modifications. Total RNA was extracted using a standard Trizol RNA isolation protocol (Invitrogen, USA), and then treated with RNase-free DNaseI (Promega, USA) to remove genomic DNA. The amount and quality of the total RNA were verified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. The concentration of RNA was measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND- 1000; NanoDrop Technologies). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 2 µg of DNase digested total RNA with oligodT15 primer according to the manufacturer’s protocol for RT-PCR first-strand synthesis (TaKaRa, Japan).</p>

<title>Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis</title>
<p>Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using SYBR Green PCR master mix (TaKaRa, Japan) was performed using CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA). Specific primers for qRT-PCR analysis were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094830.s002">Table S1</xref>. The PCR efficiency of all primer pairs was determined from standard curve experiments. PCR conditions consisted of an initial step at 95°C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, followed by 60°C for 15 s, and then 72°C for 30 s. For amplification product specificity, a melting curve was generated at the end of each run, and verified by agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products. All reactions were run in triplicate, and each reaction was completed with a melting curve and amplification curve analysis to confirm the amplification specificity. Ct values were determined using the CFX96 software with default settings. Differences between the Ct values of target gene and <italic>Actin</italic> were calculated as ΔCt = Ct<sub>target gene</sub>−Ct<italic><sub>Actin</sub></italic>, and the relative expression levels of target genes were determined as 2<sup>−ΔCt</sup>. For each sample, PCR was performed on three biological replicates. The average values of 2<sup>−ΔCt</sup> were used to determine difference in gene expression. <italic>Actin</italic> was amplified as an endogenous control. Statistical analysis of the difference in the relative expression levels of target genes was performed by using <italic>t</italic>-test.</p>

<title>Gene Cloning and Sequence Analysis</title>
<p>PCR was performed using the ZmARF25-F/R primer pair from the first-strand cDNA from the B73 seedling leaves. PCR conditions consisted of an initial step at 94°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 25 s, 58°C for 25 s, and 72°C for 2 m 45 s; and then a final step at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were confirmed by visualization of the samples by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel and stained by Ethidium bromide.

<title>Comparison of Maize Leaf Area between Hybrids and their Parental Lines</title>
<p>Previous studies revealed that maize hybrid exhibited heterosis in leaf size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Uchimiya1">[24]</xref>. In this study, dynamic growth patterns of maize hybrid Mo17/B73 and its inbred parental lines were investigated in terms of the third leaf area and mid-parent heterosis (MPH) was calculated. The results exhibited that leaf areas of hybrid Mo17/B73 were significantly larger than its parental lines at 8, 10 and 12 DAG. Remarkably, MPH (72.00%) at 8 DAG was much higher than that of 10 and 12 DAG (60.50% and 58.26%) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094830.s001">Figure S1</xref>]. Thus, the third leaf areas of eight hybrids and their parental lines at 8 DAG were further measured and compared. It can be seen that the leaf areas of all hybrids were significantly larger than those of their parental lines at 8 DAG [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094830-g001">Figure 1A</xref>].</p>

<title>Identification of a Hybrid Down-regulated Gene <italic>ZmARF25</italic> in Maize Seedling Leaves</title>
<p>To gain insight into the relationship of <italic>ZmARF10</italic> and <italic>ZmARF25</italic> with leaf size heterosis, expression patterns of these two genes in the third leaves of hybrids Mo17/B73 and B73/Mo17 and their parental lines. Considering of the time lag between differential gene expression and the observed heterosis of leaf size at 8 DAG, the third leaves at 5 DAG were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094830-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, the relative expression levels of <italic>ZmARF25</italic> in the basal region of Mo17/B73 and B73/Mo17 hybrids were significantly lower than the levels observed in parental lines, whereas no significant differences in the expression patterns of <italic>ZmARF10</italic> were observed in these hybrids. Most notably, no obvious expression alterations were detected for <italic>ZmARF10</italic> and <italic>ZmARF25</italic> in the leaf tip regions of the hybrids and their parental lines [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094830-g001">Figure 1C</xref>]. Furthermore, the expression patterns of <italic>ZmARF25</italic> between other hybrids and their parental lines were also investigated and we observed that <italic>ZmARF25</italic> was down-regulated in the leaf basal regions of Zong3/87-1, 87-1/Zong3, B73/87-1, 87-1/B73 and Zong3/B73, but not B73/Zong3 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094830-g001">Figure 1D</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>ZmARF25</italic> was selected for further investigation.</p>
<p>To obtain the cDNA with complete open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to <italic>ZmARF25</italic>, cDNAs from B73 seedling leaves were amplified with ZmARF25-F/R primer pair and one unique PCR fragment of about 2500 bp was produced (data not shown). The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T and three clones were sequenced. One 2552 bp fragment was obtained and no nucleotide polymorphisms were detected for all sequenced clones. Sequence analysis revealed that the PCR product contains a complete ORF, which encodes a polypeptide of 801 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 89.79 kD and isoelectric point of 6.09, which was consistent with our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Xing1">[32]</xref>. Structure analysis exhibited that ZmARF25 has a typical ARF-type structure with a conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) that consists of a plant-specific B3-type subdomain and an ARF subdomain required for efficient <italic>in vitro</italic> binding to the auxin response elements (AuxREs) in the N-terminus, a typical carboxy-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) with both III and IV subdomains and a middle region (MR) that might function as a repression domain (RD) since it is enriched in serine (S) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094830-g002">Figure 2</xref>] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Ulmasov1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Guilfoyle1">[39]</xref>.</p>

<title><italic>ZmARF25</italic> Repressed Organ Size by Decreasing Cell Numbers in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
<p>Auxin response factors (ARFs) are transcription factors that bind with specificity to TGTCTC-containing AuxREs found in promoters of primary/early auxin response genes and mediate responses to the plant hormone auxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Ulmasov1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Guilfoyle1">[39]</xref>.

Most ARFs contain a conserved N-terminal DBD, a variable MR and a typical CTD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Ulmasov1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Ulmasov2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Wang1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Ha1">[49]</xref>. The DBD specifically binds to the conserved AuXRE, the CTD is modular with amino acid sequence related to domains III and IV in Aux/IAA proteins, making it function as a dimerization domain among the ARFs or with several Aux/IAA proteins. The structure of MR determines whether the ARF acts as an activator or repressor. Activation domain (AD) of ARFs is usually enriched in glutamine (Q), serine (S) and leucine (L), while repression domain (RD) is enriched in either S, L and proline (P); S, L and/or glycine (G) or S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Xing1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Guilfoyle1">[39]</xref>. In this study, one hybrid down-regulated gene <italic>ZmARF25</italic> that encoded a typical ARF-type protein was identified in maize. Most notably, ZmARF25 has a MR enriched in S, indicating that it might act as a repressor. Our previous study indicated that ZmARF25 was homologous to AtARF2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and OsARF4 in rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Xing1">[32]</xref>. <italic>AtARF2</italic> has been identified as a general repressor of cell division, one aspect of many biological processes regulated by auxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Schruff1">[29]</xref>. However, our knowledge about the functions and regulations of <italic>ZmARF25</italic> gene is quite limited. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>ZmARF25</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> resulted in significant size reduction of plant organs. Although the results of <italic>ZmARF25</italic> overexpression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> may not fully reflect its precise functions in maize, it is reasonable to assume that <italic>ZmARF25</italic> may be involved in maize growth and development process, which deserves for further investigation.</p>
<p>At the cellular level, organ size is determined by two developmental forces,cell proliferation and cell expansion, which partially overlap in time and are assumed to be coordinated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Mizukami2">[50]</xref>. Nevertheless, larger organ tends to be composed of more cells rather than bigger cells in different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Niklas1">[51]</xref>. In present study, we noted that overexpression of <italic>ZmARF25</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> significantly decreased the cell number, resulting in smaller organs in 35S<italic>::ZmARF25</italic> transgenic plants when compared to wild-type. Recently, some regulatory genes that affect leaf development have been identified and characterized at the molecular level. For example, loss of <italic>AtANT</italic> function reduces the size of all lateral shoot organs by decreasing cell number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Mizukami1">[41]</xref>. <italic>AtGIF</italic> and <italic>AtGRF5</italic> act together and are required for the development of appropriate leaf size and shape by promoting and/or maintaining of cell proliferation activity in leaf primordial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Horiguchi1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Kim1">[43]</xref>. On the other hand, expansins are thought to function in the control of plant cell growth, and leaf size was substantially reduced in antisense lines with suppressed <italic>AtEXP10</italic> expression, whereas overexpression of <italic>AtEXP10</italic> resulted in plants with somewhat larger leaves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Cho1">[44]</xref>. Remarkably, overexpression of <italic>ZmARF25</italic> repressed the expression levels of <italic>AtANT</italic>, <italic>AtGRF5</italic> and <italic>AtGIF1</italic>, whereas no significant alteration in <italic>AtEXP10</italic> expression was detected. Collectively, we speculate that <italic>ZmARF25</italic> regulates the process of cell proliferation by altering the expression of <italic>AtANT</italic>, <italic>AtGRF5</italic> and <italic>AtGIF1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>

<title>Down-regulation of <italic>ZmARF25</italic> in Hybrids may Contribute to the Observed Heterosis for Leaf Size</title>
<p>Enlarged organ size, such as the increased leaf area, is an important feature of heterosis and also has a close relationship with the crop yield [12, 28 and 57]. A key observation made in maize heterosis was that the greater plant size is primarily (90%) due to increases in cell number, not cell size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-PavLrKovA1">[25]</xref>. Recently study reported that transgenic over-expression of <italic>Zea mays ARGOS1 (ZAR1)</italic> enhanced maize organ growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094830-Guo4">[58]</xref>.
