      <abstract>
        <p>Enterohemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EHEC) employs a type III secretion system (TTSS) to export the translocator and effector proteins required for mucosal colonization. As an important bacterial effector protein in locus of enterocyte effacement four, the EspF protein causes F-actin filament aggregations to form attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions, and induces the destruction of brush-border microvilli and cytoskeletal rearrangements to form pedestals. However, the molecular pathogenesis of A/E lesions due to EHEC O157:H7 infection is unclear. In this study, we constructed an <italic>espF</italic>-deficient mutant (Δ<italic>espF</italic>) with a 162-bp deletion in the N-terminal domain by using overlap extension PCR. The results showed that EHEC EspF translocated into intestinal epithelial cells, targeted mitochondria and induced apoptosis. The Δ<italic>espF</italic> mutant, compared to EHEC prototype Guangzhou strain, had lower cell attachment and effacement abilities, lower caspase-9/3 and lactate dehydrogenase levels, lower bacterial adhesion, weaker mitochondria apoptosis, and a higher mouse survival rate. Our results demonstrate the probable function of the EspF N-terminal domain, which targets mitochondria and binds mitochondria heat shock protein 70 to induce cell apoptosis via A/E lesions. These findings may be invaluable in clarifying the molecular pathogenesis of EspF of EHEC O157:H7.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Enterohemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 are important food-borne causative agents that cause sporadic outbreaks of illness such as diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis (HC), haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thromobocytopenic porpura (TTP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Kaper1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Rangel1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Riley1">[3]</xref>. The outbreaks and dissemination of EHEC O157:H7 persist, posing a great threat to human health and posing a global public health challenge.</p>
      <p>EHEC employs a type III secretion system (TTSS) to export the translocator and effector proteins required for mucosal colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Lodato1">[4]</xref>. The TTSS is encoded in a pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE, 35–43 kb), consisting of LEE1 - LEE5 and several transcriptional units, encoded a type III secretion system (TTSS) which exports the translocator and effector proteins responsible for mucosal colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Berdichevsky1">[5]</xref>. EHEC O157:H7 adheres to the brush border of epithelial cells of the host’s large intestine; subsequently, TTSS translocates effectors such as Tir, Map, EspG, EspF, and EspH into host cells. Such translocation results in F-actin filaments aggregating to form attaching and effacing (A/E) intestinal lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Garmendia1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Nataro1">[7]</xref>, inducing the destruction of brush-border microvilli and cytoskeletal rearrangements to form pedestals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Dean1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>EspF is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that contains a transiently α-helical N-terminus and dynamic C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Aitio1">[9]</xref>. The <italic>espF</italic> gene (747 bp, GenBank ID: 960871) locates between nt 4,658,240 to 4,658,986 in the terminal of LEE4. EspF harbors three proline-rich repeats (PRR) in enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EPEC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-McNamara1">[10]</xref>, four PRR in EHEC, and five PRR in <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Viswanathan1">[11]</xref>. Each PRR comprises two putative overlapping Src homology 3 (SH3) binding domains with the consensus PxxP motif, mediating binding to the well-characterized SH3 domain, and contains a functional neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (N-WASP) binding motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Alto1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Mayer1">[13]</xref>. EspF is thought to be able to destroy the barrier of intestinal epithelial cells, and even to target mitochondria through the mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) area in the N terminal domain, initiating a process of early apoptosis in host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Dean1">[8]</xref>. According to recent studies, EspF can bind to some host cell proteins by the SH3 and EVH1 domains, which can result in interference with signal transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Dean2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Nagai1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Nougayrede1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, according to some studies, EspF employs SNX9 to induce the formation of membrane tubules in cytosol during the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells by EPEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Alto1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Marches1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Weflen1">[18]</xref>. Additionally, the putative N-WASP binding motif of each PRR mediates the direct interaction of EspF with the Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding (CRIB) domain of N-WASP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Alto1">[12]</xref>. Subsequently, EspF binds to and activates N-WASP to induce multiple actin polymerization which are regulated by Cdc42 normally and binds cytokeratin 18 to facilitate the collapse of intermediate filament (IF) network of epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Alto1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Campellone1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Viswanathan2">[20]</xref>. In EPEC, EspF cooperates with the effectors Map, Tir, EspG, and NleA to mediate rapid tight junction (TJ) disruption. EspF is therefore distinctly multifunctional with many overlapping functions such as targeting mitochondria, disrupting tight junctions, effacing microvilli, inhibiting the water transporter SGLT-1 and inhibiting phagocytosis in EPEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Nougayrede1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Kenny1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-McNamara2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Dean3">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Dean4">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Quitard1">[25]</xref>. Thus EspF becomes an emerging feature of effector proteins essential for intimate attachment in EPEC and ruling as a bacterial pathogen’s Swiss army knife <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Aitio1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Holmes1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Kenny2">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Previous studies in EPEC have demonstrated that EspF acts as a bacterial effector protein. Nevertheless, the molecular pathogenesis of A/E lesions during EHEC O157:H7 infection is still in deciphering. In this study, we show that EHEC EspF translocates into intestinal epithelial cells, targets mitochondria, and induces apoptosis. Compared to the EHEC prototype O157:H7 Guangzhou strain, the EHEC <italic>espF</italic>-deficient mutant (Δ<italic>espF</italic>) we constructed previously had obvious lower bacteria adhesion, lower caspase-9/3 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, lower cell attachment and effacement abilities, weaker mitochondria apoptosis, and a higher mouse survival rate.</p>

        <title>Construction of Δ<italic>espF</italic> Mutants of EHEC O157:H7</title>
        <p>An <italic>espF</italic>-deficient mutant in N-terminal domain was constructed by using overlap extension PCR (OL-PCR). The segments A (865 bp) and B (897 bp) of gene <italic>espF</italic> were amplified with two pairs of primers (primers A1, A2 and primers B1, B2, respectively) designed according to the sequence of <italic>espF</italic> and its upstream and downstream ends, respectively. The segment Δ<italic>espF</italic> (1762 bp), harboring the 162 bp knock-out gene, was cloned into a pCVD442 suicide vector resulting in pCVD442-Δ<italic>espF</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic> SM10λπ. Subsequently, the pCVD442-Δ<italic>espF</italic> was transformed from <italic>E. coli</italic> SM10λπ into wildtype EHEC O157:H7. All EHEC strains were cultured in Luria broth (LB) media supplemented with appropriate antibiotics, nalidixic acid, and ampicillin at 37°C for routine passage. The Nal<sup>R</sup> and Amp<sup>S</sup> strains of EHEC O157:H7 (Δ<italic>espF</italic>) were screened by PCR amplification with primers A1 and B2, which resulted in only one band (nearly 2000 bp), whereas two bands were amplified in the EHEC O157:H7 Nal strain (pCVD442-Δ<italic>espF</italic>) by PCR (data not shown). It was also found via DNA sequencing that the Δ<italic>espF</italic> mutant lost 162 bp. The genome location of the deletion was at nt 4659104–4659265, which was within the N-terminal domain of EspF.</p>

        <title>The Δ<italic>espF</italic> Strain had Weaker Adhesive Ability to <italic>Lovo</italic> Cells</title>
        <p><italic>Lovo</italic> cells were infected separately with EHEC O157:H7 wild type (WT), EHEC O157:H7 <italic>espF</italic> mutant (Δ<italic>espF</italic>), or <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α (DH5α) strains to determinate their bacteria adhesion rates. The membrane of <italic>Lovo</italic> cells was observed via electronic microscopy 3 h post infection with WT, Δ<italic>espF</italic>, and DH5α. Compared with the WT strain’s adhesion rate (18.128±3.159‰), the Δ<italic>espF</italic> strain’s adhesion rate on the cells surface (6.756±1.297‰) was three-fold lower. The average adhesion rate of the DH5α strain was 0.043±0.015‰, resulting in few bacteria on the cell membrane surface. Neither the Δ<italic>espF</italic> nor the DH5α control group infections cause cell membrane damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The lower adhesion rate of the Δ<italic>espF</italic> mutant strain indicated that <italic>espF</italic> gene deletion reduced EHEC adhesive capability.</p>

        <p>Cysteine-requiring aspartate protease (caspase) is a protease family that plays an important role in the process of cell apoptosis. Caspase-9 is an upstream protease in the process of the cell apoptosis signal transduction, which is activated and regulated by phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Allan1">[28]</xref>. Caspase-9 activates the key enzyme caspase-3 during cell apoptosis in order to promote follow-up cell apoptosis signals. Caspase-3 is one of the key executioner molecules in cell apoptosis and cleaves several substrates that indicate apoptotic death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Zou1">[29]</xref>. Using antibodies that recognize caspase-9/3, we performed western blotting to detect procaspase-9/3 expression of <italic>Lovo</italic> cells’ post infection with WT and Δ<italic>espF</italic> strains. Three hours post infection, equal amount of cells were lysed and SDS-PAGE was performed to screen the proteins. Tubulin was used as an internal protein control. Cells treated with actinomycin D (Act-D) were as a positive control. The results showed that little caspase-9/3 was detected in non-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). A trace amount of caspase-9/3 was found in the Δ<italic>espF</italic> infected group, whereas the WT infected group had a higher caspase-9/3 expression level. The results showed that EHEC EspF influenced in the expression of caspase-9/3, indicating an association with the cell apoptosis pathway.</p>
        <p>The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay involves fluorescein labeled dUTP staining of fragmented DNA 3′-OH ends of apoptotic cells identified by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Because of the sparseness of DNA fragments and lack of 3′-OH in healthy cells, there is no fluorescent signal emitted when labeling by fluorescein dUTP. Since EspF can initiate the apoptosis pathway, we used TUNEL staining and DAPI counterstaining to visualize <italic>Lovo</italic> cell apoptosis post infection with EHEC WT, Δ<italic>espF</italic>, and Act-D, separately. Observations were made via fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). In the DAPI group, we noted that the non-infected cells group emitted blue fluorescence, but no green fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g002">Fig. 2D:</xref> a). In the TUNEL group, cells infected by EHEC WT and Act-D emitted numerous green fluorescent signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g002">Fig. 2D:</xref> e and h); however, cells infected by Δ<italic>espF</italic> emitted few green fluorescent signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g002">Fig. 2D:</xref> k). In the merged groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g002">Fig. 2D:</xref> c, f, i, l), cells infected by EHEC WT and Act-D distinctly emitted green fluorescence, indicating the presence of marked cell apoptosis. On the contrary, cells infected by Δ<italic>espF</italic> revealed less green fluorescence, indicating less cell apoptosis. The TUNEL assay results allowed determination of the amount of TUNEL-positive cells: 49.60±6.804 cells in the EHEC WT group, similar to the 55.00±4.848 cells in the Act-D group. The Δ<italic>espF</italic> group had the fewest cells (31.20±6.760) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). A least significant difference (LSD) method analysis revealed a significant difference (<italic>F</italic> = 20.220, <italic>P = </italic>0.000&lt;0.001) among these groups. In summary, the WT and Act-D groups had more apoptosis, as indicated by larger amounts of green fluorescence, than that in the Δ<italic>espF</italic> group. The mild green fluorescent signals in the Δ<italic>espF</italic> group indicated that Δ<italic>espF</italic> strain has a deficient capability to induce host cell apoptosis.</p>

        <title>EspF Targets Host Cellular Mitochondria via TTSS</title>
        <p>The DAPI is known to form blue fluorescent complexes with natural double-stranded DNA, showing fluorescence specificity for A-T regions of DNA. When DAPI binds to DNA, the blue fluorescence is enhanced greatly. Thus, cell nucleus staining with DAPI serves to provide a cell localization function. Mitochondria heat shock protein 70 (mtHsp70) is located in the matrix of mitochondria, and we used it to show indirectly the location of mitochondria. For localization study, anti-EspF, marked with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and emitting a green fluorescent signal, and anti-mtHsp70, marked with Rhodamine and emitting a red fluorescent signal were used.</p>
        <p>The MOCK cells and cells infected with WT and Δ<italic>espF</italic> strains were stained and visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). For the EHEC O157:H7 WT group, both the green fluorescent signal from EspF protein and the red fluorescent signal from mtHsp70 were strong at corresponding locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), indicating a positive correlation between the locations and the two proteins. However, for the Δ<italic>espF</italic> mutant, in which the EspF protein green fluorescent signal is weak, the mtHsp70 red fluorescent signal was either strong or weak in corresponding locations; that is, there was no location correlation between the two proteins. Moreover, there was no green fluorescence in the non-infected cells group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g003">Fig. 3A:</xref> c3 and d3). This shows that the ability of EspF to target mitochondria was reduced in the Δ<italic>espF</italic> mutant.</p>

        <title>The Δ<italic>espF</italic> Mutant has a Weaker Ability to Induce Mitochondrial Apoptosis</title>
        <p>As the results shown above, EspF targeted host mitochondria, but they do not show the mitochondrial apoptosis path. The cationic, lipid fluorescent dye 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) was used to detect the potential across a mitochondrial membrane. There are two types of JC-1 in stained mitochondrial plasma, one is a monomer, which emits green fluorescence in a low JC-1 concentration area, and the other is a polymer, which emits red fluorescence in a high JC-1 concentration area. Depending on the potential (Δψ) of the mitochondrial membrane, JC-1 transfers into the mitochondria, which results in a high JC-1 concentration with a red fluorescence. When cells undergo apoptosis, due to mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, JC-1 is released from mitochondria, which leads to a low JC-1 concentration and a green fluorescence. Changes in mitochondria membrane potential and fluorescent signals in <italic>Lovo</italic> cells were observed at 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 h post infection with EHEC WT and Δ<italic>espF</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In the WT group, at 1.5 h post infection, red fluorescent signals reduced and green fluorescent signals increased. At 2.5 h post infection, red fluorescent signals had almost disappeared and green fluorescent signals were greatly enhanced. In the Δ<italic>espF</italic>-infected group, at 0.5 h, there were stronger red fluorescent signals and weaker green fluorescent signals compared with the WT group. At 1.5 h, there was little change in either of the fluorescent signals, while at 2.5 h, there were fewer red fluorescent signals remaining but stronger green fluorescent signals. Overall, the results indicated that cell apoptosis is more obvious in WT-infected group than in Δ<italic>espF</italic>-infected group at 0.5 h, while at 2.5 h there is more deterioration of apoptotic cells in a WT-infected group than that in a Δ<italic>espF</italic>-infected group. Above all, the Δ<italic>espF</italic> mutant strain has a weaker ability to induce mitochondrial apoptosis.</p>

        <p>Post-infection with EHEC O157:H7, mice exhibited a series of symptoms such as anorexia, lethargy, hind limb atony, quadriplegia, and even death. Mice were divided into three groups and were treated with WT EHEC, Δ<italic>espF</italic> and LB (control), respectively.

From days 6–7 post-infection, all mice began to recover gradually. In the WT group, mice had diarrhea at days 2–3 post-infection; however, mice in the Δ<italic>espF</italic> group had no significant diarrheal symptoms.

        <p>BALB/c mice infected with EHEC WT, Δ<italic>espF</italic> strains and, LB were executed at day 7 post-infection. Sections of colon 5-cm distal from the rectum were collected. Typical pathological features of the colon sections were observed. The sections were weighed and the numbers of adhesive bacteria were counted before the sections were frozen. Colon sections from the WT group exhibited typical, edematous and inflammatory, intestinal colitis with a few solidified feces. However, sections from the Δ<italic>espF</italic> group appeared healthier with solidified feces, but some portions appeared slightly swollen. In the LB control group, the colon sections were healthy with solidified feces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g005">Fig. 5B: a, b and c</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition, other parts of the colon sections of mice infected with WT and Δ<italic>espF</italic> strains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and frozen. Colonic mucosal adhesive bacteria within the frozen sections were immunostained with anti-EHEC O157 antibody. As well, the actin of the colonic epithelial cells were counterstained with Rhodamine-phalloidin and observed through fluorescent microscopy. Stained sections from the LB control group revealed no green fluorescence whereas the Δ<italic>espF</italic> group sections revealed little fluorescence; however, strong fluorescent signals appeared over the epithelial surfaces, even in intestinal crypts, in the WT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g005">Fig. 5C: a, d, g</xref>).

        <p>The above experimental results showed that the Δ<italic>espF</italic> mutant has a weaker virulence and induces milder A/E lesions than WT EHEC.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>As has been reported, once adhered to intestinal epithelial cells via intimin, EHEC and EPEC inject secretion effectors, such as Tir, Map, EspG, EspF, and EspH, into host cells through the TTSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Garmendia1">[6]</xref>. This results in disrupting the epithelial barrier, effacing microvilli, remodelling host membranes, and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Dean1">[8]</xref>. In this study, we constructed an EHEC O157:H7 <italic>espF</italic>-deficient (Δ<italic>espF</italic>) strain with a 162 bp (4659104–4659265) deletion in the N-terminal domain, by using OL-PCR. Subsequently, we compared <italic>Lovo</italic> cell apoptosis, colonic epithelia A/E lesion processes and also mice infections between WT and mutant strains. The results indicated the influences of <italic>espF</italic> N-terminal deficiency on cell attachment and effacement abilities, caspase-9/3 and lactate dehydrogenase levels, mitochondria apoptosis, and mouse survival rate.</p>
      <p>It has been demonstrated that EspF is multifunctional in many cellular processes. EspF bonds with mitochondria, N-WASP, SNX9, Abcf2, CK18, SGLT-1, and NHE3 to disrupt the epithelial TJ, efface microvilli, modulate the cytoskeleton, induce actin polymerization, recruit the pedestal, and finally lead to apoptosis and A/E lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Holmes1">[26]</xref>. During infection, EspF rapidly accumulates in mitochondria with such accumulation dependent on a functional mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Nagai1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Nougayrede1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Kenny1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Previous studies showed that the N-terminal domain of EspF in EPEC can target mitochondria in infected host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Nagai1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Nougayrede1">[16]</xref>. Corresponding to the structure of EspF, the mitochondria binding region (1–101aa before the N-terminal) contains an MTS consisting of an α-helix, a hydrophobic part, and a hydrophilic part, that recognizes the outer membrane’s Tom20, which orientates EspF to the mitochondria. After EPEC adhesion to host cells, EspF first targets mitochondria through the TTSS, then gathers in the cell nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Dean2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Nagai1">[15]</xref>. In our study, strong EspF green and mtHsp70 red fluorescent signals indicated co-orientation of those two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055164-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). However, our results displayed a strong green fluorescent signal for the EspF protein and a weak mtHsp70 red fluorescent signal in the Δ<italic>espF</italic> group, indicating no orientation correlation and a reduced mitochondrial binding affinity in the Δ<italic>espF</italic> strain. The non-infected control group did not display any green fluorescence signal. We scanned a straight line of the EspF green and the mtHsp70 red fluorescent signals of each group and a consistent fluorescent signal strength curve was detected in the WT group. The presence of an uncorrelated fluorescent signal strength curve in the Δ<italic>espF</italic> group indicated that EHEC EspF targets mitochondria. Thus, the deletion of N-terminal domain of <italic>espF</italic> gene reduces the mitochondrial binding affinity of EHEC.</p>
      <p>The reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential initiates cell apoptosis. In <italic>Lovo</italic> cells infected for 0.5 h with WT a reduced red fluorescent signal and an intensive green fluorescent signal revealed an intensive fluorescent change. In contrast, <italic>Lovo</italic> cells infected for 0.5 h with Δ<italic>espF</italic> displayed a strong red fluorescent signal and a weaker green fluorescent signal. At 1.5 h post-infection, the red fluorescence reduced gradually and green fluorescence strengthened gradually in the WT group, whereas both fluorescent signals changed mildly in the Δ<italic>espF</italic> group. At 2.5 h post-infection, red fluorescence in WT almost disappeared while green fluorescence enhanced intensively. And the retention of the red fluorescent signals in Δ<italic>espF</italic> at 2.5 h indicated a milder apoptosis than in WT EHEC, which showed a reduced virulence of the Δ<italic>espF</italic> strain. All of these results showed that the N-terminal deficiency of EspF induces weaker mitochondria apoptosis.</p>
      <p>Caspase is a protease family that has an important role in cell apoptosis and it has activity sites, which specifically cleave the procaspase polypeptide of aspartic acid residues. Caspase cleaves some proteins selectively, which induces cell apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Yuan1">[31]</xref>. Foreign protein signals cleave and activate the initiator caspases and the executioner caspases subsequently. The executioner proteolysed caspases lead to the morphological and biochemical characteristics of apoptosis. Caspase-9 is the initiator caspase in the “intrinsic” or mitochondrial caspase pathway and is activated in response to cytochrome c release from the mitochondria of pre-apoptotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Zou1">[29]</xref>. Activated caspase-9 cleaves and activates the apoptosis executioner caspase-3, which promotes the subsequent apoptosis signal. Serving as an important index of apoptosis, caspase-3 is one of the key executioners of cell apoptosis that cleaves many key proteins. Our results from <italic>Lovo</italic> cells infected with EHEC WT and Δ<italic>espF</italic> showed that both WT and Δ<italic>espF</italic> leaded to caspase-9/3 expression, with WT expressing more caspase-9/3 than expressed by Δ<italic>espF.</italic> This suggests that Δ<italic>espF</italic> has a lower virulence and is able to reduce the level of apoptotic proteins. In each group, caspase-3 was expressed more than caspase-9, indicated a late stage of apoptosis. Compared with our negative control, caspase-9/3 release in the Δ<italic>espF</italic> strain was slightly more than that in a natural release, indicating that the Δ<italic>espF</italic> mutant retained some virulence.</p>
      <p>Mice are ideal animal models for use in EHEC O157:H7 pathogenesis research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Ni1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Wadolkowski1">[33]</xref>. Vallance <italic>et al.</italic> inoculated mice orally with wild type <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> (CR) to research the pathogenesis of A/E bacteria and found that CR infections vary among different mouse strains; for example, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice were more susceptible to bacteria invasion and colonization than other strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Vallance1">[34]</xref>. The study of Fujii <italic>et al.</italic> verified that some mice were able to live following administration of 10<sup>10</sup> EHEC O157:H7 bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-Fujii1">[30]</xref>. However, given an intraperitoneal injection of MMC and fed streptomycin water during bacterial inoculation can increase the susceptibility of mice. MMC induces a decrease in white blood cells and platelets, which is similar to the results of cyclophosphamide treatment. In addition, streptomycin restrains the normal intestinal flora, which can result in EHEC O157:H7 being the dominant member of the flora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-alJumaili1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055164-MacLeod1">[36]</xref>, thus, enhancing the EHEC O157:H7 susceptibility of mice. So, in this study, BALB/c mice were selected as the model and injected with MMC intraperitoneally and fed with nalidixic acid water during the period of infection with EHEC O157:H7. The results showed that the Δ<italic>espF</italic> strain had weakened EHEC virulence, bacterial infection, and pathogenicity toward mice. The immunofluorescence observations of colon epithelial cell damage showed typical colitis symptoms (colon edema, sparse feces, and little obvious granular dung) in the EHEC WT group. However, HC symptoms were not observed, indicating that A/E lesions were present, but not very serious. This lack of hemorrhagic symptoms may correlate to the susceptibility of the mice and the virulence of the bacteria. In the Δ<italic>espF</italic> and the LB groups, colons remained healthy throughout the infections with no edema and granular feces, demonstrating that an <italic>espF</italic> gene deficiency weakens EHEC lesions and adhesion.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, as shown in the results, an <italic>espF</italic>-deficient mutant of EHEC O157:H7 is characterized by a low bacterial virulence, reduced adhesive capability and mitochondrial apoptosis, and milder A/E lesions. In contrast to its actions in EPEC, EspF of EHEC targets mitochondria with no evidence of its aggregation in cell nuclei. Furthermore, we showed that the EspF N-terminal domain of EHEC O157:H7 induces cell apoptosis. Our results revealed that the EspF protein in EHEC O157:H7 induces host cell apoptosis and leads to A/E lesions in intestinal epithelial cells. These findings have important scientific significance to further the elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of EHEC O157:H7.</p>

        <p>Two New Zealand white rabbits (each weighing 1.5–2.5 kg) were selected for the collection of venous blood (2 mL) from the auricular margin before infection. Venous serum was obtained and kept in −20°C as a control. Antigen protein was dissolved by normal saline to immunize the rabbits at days 1, 28, 42, and 66 at 1 mg per rabbit. Initially, antigen protein was emulsified in an equal volume of Freund’s complete adjuvant. Each rabbit was subcutaneously injected with 2 mL of antigen at multiple points along the back and shoulder. As an immunization boost, antigen protein emulsified with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant was intramuscularly injected as 2 mL of antigen at the shoulders and legs of each rabbit. Post-boost, venous blood (1 mL) from the auricular margin was collected for antibody valence testing by ELISA. Ten days post-boost, cardiac whole blood was collected and antibody valence in the serum was determined by ELISA. Antiserum specificity was tested by western blot. Subsequently, polyclonal antiserum was purified by caprylic acid-ammonium sulfate precipitation and its purity was detected by SDS-PAGE.</p>
