      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been established from mammalian blastocysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Evans1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Martin1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Thomson1">[3]</xref>. ESCs have the ability to proliferate vigorously and differentiate into various cell types. Therefore, they are attractive sources for cell transplantation therapy and basic research. ESCs have been used for functional analyses of numerous genes and differentiation processes. Recently, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were derived from mouse and human somatic cells that have similar differentiation potential to ESCs, and can overcome the ethical problems and immune rejection associated with ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Takahashi1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Takahashi2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Yu1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying the pluripotency and proliferation of ESCs and iPSCs are still unclear. In mouse ESCs, pluripotency can be maintained by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and several transcription factors. LIF activates Stat3 signaling and its downstream cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Matsuda1">[7]</xref> that are involved in pluripotency. Oct4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Niwa1">[8]</xref>, Sox2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Avilion1">[9]</xref> and Nanog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Mitsui1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Chambers1">[11]</xref> are also pivotal regulators, and maintain the undifferentiated state of ESCs. Klf4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Jiang1">[12]</xref> is also an important factor for the maintenance of ESCs. The Kluppel-like factor (Klf) family, involving Klf4, Klf2 and Klf5, regulates the self-renewal of ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Jiang1">[12]</xref>. Therefore, pluripotency is maintained by the regulatory networks of many transcription and other factors.</p>
      <p>To identify new genes involved in the molecular network of pluripotency, we have previously performed a digital differential display analysis (DDD) of the expressed sequence tag libraries among various mouse tissues and cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Mitsui1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Tokuzawa1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Takahashi3">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Maruyama1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Amano1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Tsubooka1">[17]</xref>. Candidates were selected based on their specific expression in ESCs, and included many well-known pluripotency related genes, such as Oct4 and Nanog, as well as a variety of novel genes which we designated the “ECATs” for ES cell-associated transcripts. We have shown that ECAT4 encodes the transcription factor Nanog, which plays critical roles in pluripotency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Mitsui1">[10]</xref>, whereas ECAT5 encodes Eras, which promotes the proliferation of mouse ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Takahashi3">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we evaluated the expression and function of another ECAT, ECAT11, also known as L1ltd1. Wegenerated ECAT11 knock-outmice and ES cells by inserting the enhanced green fluorescent gene (EGFP) cDNA into the ECAT11 locus. Our study showed that ECAT11 is dispensable for the development and maintenance of pluriptotency, despite its specific expression pattern. We also found that ECAT11 is rapidly activated by Oct3/4, Sox2 and Klf4 in fibroblasts, but is dispensable for the generation of iPSCs.</p>

        <title>ECAT11 expression, protein structure and localization in mouse ESCs</title>
        <p>We identified ECAT11 by a digital differential display analysis of expressed sequence tag (EST) databases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Mitsui1">[10]</xref> as a novel transcript enriched in mouse ESCs. The predicted ECAT11 open reading frame encodes 848 amino acids, showing a similarity to ORF-1, one of the two protein components of the L1 transposable element (L1). L1 is a non-LTR type of retrotransposon, which can move within the genome as a transcribed RNA intermediate. There are &gt;599,000 copies of L1 that occupy 19% of the mouse genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Waterston1">[18]</xref>. L1 encodes two proteins, ORF1 and ORF2. ORF1 has a Transposase_22 motif, which is responsible for the RNA binding activity of ORF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Martin2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Wallace1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Kroutter1">[21]</xref>. ORF2 encodes a protein with an endonuclease and reverse-transcriptase activity. ORF1 is mainly localized inthe cytoplasm as an RNA-protein particle, together with ORF2, and supportsthe L1 transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Doucet1">[22]</xref>. In the C-terminus of ECAT11, we found high homology with the C-terminus ofthe ORF of L1 T<sub>Fspa</sub>, a subtype of L1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Januszyk1">[23]</xref>. The identity of the protein sequence in this region was 33% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g001">Figure 1A</xref> motif2). The N-terminus of ECAT11 also showed homology with Transposase_22, withan identity of 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g001">Figure 1A</xref> motif1).</p>

        <p>ECAT11 paralogs can be identified in humans, rhesus macaques, rats and dogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The overall identity of these proteins to mouse ECAT11 is relatively low (∼23.1%), but the second ORF1-like domain showed 45.8% identity with the mouse protein. The identity of the first ORF1-like domain is 43.4%, excluding dog ECAT11, which lacks this region. However, two arginine residues (R297 and R298) of the L1 T<sub>Fspa</sub> ORF1, which are critical for its RNA binding and chaperone activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Martin3">[24]</xref>, are not conserved in ECAT11. Therefore, it was unclear whether ECAT11 hadRNA binding and chaperone activity.</p>
        <p>An RT-PCR analysis confirmed that ECAT11 is abundantly expressed in mouse ESCs and is suppressed upon differentiation induced by retinoic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The expression was undetectable in most of adult somatic tissues, however, weak expression was observed in the testes, ovaries, and brain. In humans, ECAT11 transcripts were identified in ESCs, an embryonic tumor cell line, testes, ovaries, spleen, and placenta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As a result, the expression pattern of ECAT11 seems to be similar between mice and humans.</p>

        <title>Generation of ECAT11-EGFP knock-in mice and ESCs</title>
        <p>To elucidate the effect of ECAT11disruption and pursue its expression, we generated an ECAT11-EGFP knock-in construct on a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector. We first replaced the protein cording region of ECAT11 with anEGFP-IRES-Puro cassetteby enzyme-mediated recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The manipulated BAC was then introduced into ESCs by electroporation. After drug selection, we obtained 750 drug resistant colonies. We first screened for the recombination by genomic PCR and then confirmed the recombination by Southern hybridization, in which the wild-type and targeted locus gave rise to bands of 17.2 kbp and 14.5 kbp, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that one out of the 750 clones had the correct homologous recombination. The ECAT11<sup>WT/EGFP</sup> ESCs were positive for GFP fluorescence, but became negative when differentiation was induced by retinoic acid treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), thus suggesting that our reporter recapitulated the endogenous expression. By introducing the ESC clone into blastocysts, we established chimeric, and subsequently ECAT11 knock-in, heterozygous mice.</p>

        <p>To study the expression of ECAT11 during mouse development, we observed the developmental process from egg to embryonic day (E) 15.5 embryos using ECAT11-EGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). While EGFP fluorescence was not observed until themorula stage, an obvious expression was noted in the whole blastocyst from the blastula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g002">Figure 2D (i)–(vi)</xref>).

        <title>The effects of ECAT11 disruption in the entire mouse and ESCs</title>
        <p>To elucidate the effects of ECAT11 disruption, we compared the ECAT11<sup>EGFP/EGFP</sup> and WT mice. The interbred ECAT11 <sup>WT/EGFP</sup> mice yield F1 pups, including ECAT11 null mice, according to the Mendelian rule (Wild-type∶ECAT11<sup>WT/EGFP</sup>∶ECAT11<sup>EGFP/EGFP</sup> = 43∶74∶46). ECAT11-null mutant mice were normal in gross appearance and by the X-ray analyses(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020461.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and were found to be fertile. Therefore, ECAT11<sup>EGFP/EGFP</sup> is dispensable in mouse development and fertilization.</p>
        <p>To investigate the functions ofECAT11 in ESCs, we obtained 25 blastocysts from intercrosses of ECAT11<sup>WT/EGFP</sup> heterozygous mice and established 14 ESC lines. Among them, two lines were wild type, nine were ECAT11<sup>WT/EGFP</sup>, and 3 were ECAT11<sup>EGFP/EGFP</sup>. We usedonewildtype line (#6202), two ECAT11<sup>WT/EGFP</sup> lines (#7491 and #7061), and three ECAT11<sup>EGFP/EGFP</sup> lines (#6206, #7571 and #7572), as well as the RF8 parental ESC line, in the subsequent analyses. A Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of ECAT11 expression in the ECAT11<sup>EGFP/EGFP</sup> ESC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Immunostaining also confirmed the absence of the ECAT11 protein in ECAT11<sup>EGFP/EGFP</sup> ESC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In wild-type ES cells, immunofluorescent microscopy using an anti-ECAT11 antibody detected ECAT11 in the cytoplasmin a spotty pattern, which is similar to that of the L1ORF1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020461-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Doucet1">[22]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we generated ECAT11-EGFP knock-in/-out mice and studied the expression and functions of ECAT11. We confirmed that ECAT11 is expressed in early mouse embryos and undifferentiated ES cells. We also found that ECAT11 is rapidly activated during iPSC generation. Despite this specific expression, ECAT11-deficient ES cells were normally self-renewed and remained pluripotent. We were able to generate iPSCs from ECAT11-null fibroblasts. These data demonstrated that ECAT11 is dispensable for the induction and maintenance of pluripotency, despite its specific expression.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that a lot of truncated sequences derived from L1 are dispersed in the mouse genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Naas1">[25]</xref>, indicating that these fragments might work as complementary factors for ECAT11. Indeed, some dispersed L1 sequences are still active in several types of somatic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Branciforte1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Benihoud1">[27]</xref> and germ cells at various developmental stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Trelogan1">[28]</xref>. L1 expression was also observed in the blastocyst, from which ESCs are derived <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Packer1">[29]</xref>. The L1ORF1 protein binds to RNA in a sequence non-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Martin4">[30]</xref>. In addition, other putative proteins containing Transposase_22 are interspersed in the mouse genome (EMBL-EBI: IPR004244 Transposase_22: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR004244" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR004244</ext-link>). Therefore, these related proteins might compensate for a loss of function of the ECAT11 protein.</p>
      <p>The expression of ECAT11-EGFP in MEFs was effectively promoted by the forced expression of three factors, Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4. This induction was further enhanced by c-Myc. Previous reports of studies using chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays showed that the promoter region of ECAT11 is occupied by Klf4 and c-Myc in mouse ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Ouyang1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Chen1">[32]</xref>. Oct4 and Sox2 have been shown to regulate the transcriptional activity of target genes through the interaction with their recognition sequences, octamer- and SRY-binding sites, respectively. The database analysis of transcription factor binding sites using TFSEARCH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html</ext-link>) identified multiple octamer- and SRY-binding sites in the 5′- flanking region of the mouse ECAT11 gene. However, genome wide mapping of Sox2 and Oct4 binding sites by ChIP-seq could not detect their interaction in these regions in ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020461-Chen1">[32]</xref>. It therefore remains to be determined whether Oct3/4 and Sox2 directly activate the transcription of ECAT11.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have herein demonstrated that ECAT11 disruption does not affect the function of ESCs, mouse development or fertility. By using a reporter mouse, we found that the ECAT11 promoter is rapidly activated by ectopic expression of Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4. Nevertheless, iPSCs can be generated from ECAT11-null fibroblasts. Therefore, ECAT11/L1ltd1 is considered to be dispensable for the induction and maintenanance of plutipotency, despite its specific expression.</p>

By using the RED/ET recombination technique (Gene Bridges), we replaced from the translation initiation site to exon 5 that contained the ECAT11 coding region with an EGFP-IRES-Puro cassette and inserted a diphtheria toxin A cassette 8.7 kbp upstream of the 5′ arm. After linearization with BspTI, the modified targeting vectors were introduced into RF8 ESCs by electroporation. Genomic DNA isolated from puromicin-resistant colonies was screened for homologous recombination by PCR, and correct targeting was confirmed by a Southern blot analysis of BspHI-digested DNA with a specific probe.

        <title>Generation of ECAT11-deficient mice and ESCs</title>
        <p>The ECAT11 disrupted (ECAT11<sup>WT/EGFP</sup>) heterozygous ESCs were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and implanted into pseudopregnantJcl:ICR females to obtain chimeric mice. The chimeric founders were mated with each other or C57BL/6 mice to generate heterozygous ECAT11<sup>WT/EGFP</sup> mice, which were then intercrossed to produce homozygous ECAT11<sup>EGFP/EGFP</sup> mice. All of the phenotype analyses were performed with littermates on a mixed 129/Sv and C57BL/6 background.</p>
        <p>To establish ECAT11<sup>EGFP/EGFP</sup> ESCs, ECAT11<sup>WT/EGFP</sup> or ECAT11<sup>EGFP/EGFP</sup> female mice were injected with 10 µg of tamoxifen (Sigma) and 1 mg of depo-provera (Sigma) subcutaneously on the third day after mating. Four days later, pregnant mice were sacrificed, and embryos in diapause were flushed out of the uterus by PBS supplemented with 10% FBS. These blastocysts were cultured on SNL feeder cells in four-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1 mM non-essential aminoacids, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.11mM 2-mercaptoethanol. After 6 days, the central mass of each explant was harvested, rinsed in PBS, and placed in a drop of trypsin for 5 minutes. The cell mass was collected with a finely drawn-out Pasteur pipette preloaded with medium, ensuring minimal carryover of the trypsin. The cells were gently transferred into a fresh well with medium containing 20% FBS. The resulting primary ESC colonies were individually passaged into the wells of four-well plates containing SNL feeder cell layers. Thereafter, cells were expanded by trypsinization of the entire culture. Genotypes of established clones were confirmed by genotyping PCR (For primers, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0020461-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

The PCR product was subcloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen), and was transferred into pDEST17 (Invitrogen) by LR recombination. After introduction of the resulting expression vector, pDEST17- mECAT11-275360, into BL21-AI <italic>E. coli</italic> (Invitrogen), recombinant protein production was induced according to the manufacturer's protocol. Histidine-tagged ECAT11 was purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions in the presence of 8 M urea. After dialysis against 6 M urea, the recombinant proteins were consigned to SCRUM Inc. to generate anti-ECAT11 rabbit polyclonal antibodies.</p>
