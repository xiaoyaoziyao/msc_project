        <p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer great promise in regenerative medicine and disease modeling due to their unlimited self-renewal and broad differentiation capacity. There is evidence that the growth properties and critical signaling pathways differ between murine and human ESCs; therefore, it is essential to perform functional studies to test the putatively conserved mechanisms of pluripotent stem cell self-renewal between species. Previously, we identified the transcription factor Zfx as a key regulator of self-renewal in murine ESCs. Here we extend those findings to human ESCs. ZFX knockdown in hESCs hindered clonal growth and decreased colony size after serial replating. ZFX overexpression enhanced clone formation in the presence of Y-27632, increased colony size at low density and decreased expression of differentiation-related genes in human ESCs. ZFX-overexpressing hESCs resisted spontaneous differentiation but could be directed to differentiate into endodermal and neural cell fates when provided with the appropriate cues. Thus, ZFX acts as a molecular rheostat regulating the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in hESCs, revealing the close evolutionary conservation of the self-renewal mechanisms in murine and human ESCs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and the related induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are unique cells capable of giving rise to all tissues of the adult organism. These pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can be exponentially expanded in culture while retaining their differentiation potential. The traits of pluripotency and continuous self-renewal underlie the value of PSCs as a potential source for cell replacement therapies and disease modeling, as well as a tool to study normal human development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Evans1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Thomson1">[3]</xref>. The pluripotency of both mouse and human ESCs is regulated by a network of ESC-specific transcription factors including Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and their binding partners and targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Chambers1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Do1">[5]</xref>. These factors promote the undifferentiated state by positively regulating expression of pluripotency related genes while repressing lineage-specific gene expression and maintaining the unique permissive chromatin structure of ESCs. In addition to ESC-specific transcription factors, additional sets of regulators appear essential for the self-renewal of undifferentiated ESCs and/or iPSCs, including Klf family members, c-Myc and Lin28 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Takahashi1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Yu1">[7]</xref>. Understanding the exact role and mechanism of action of these and other regulators in ESC self-renewal is an important goal in developmental biology and will aid the practical use of PSCs.</p>
      <p>Although ESCs from different species share the same key properties of pluripotency and self-renewal, major differences were found between murine (mESCs) and human ESCs (hESCs) including expression of different sets surface markers and distinct growth factor requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Rossant1">[8]</xref>. Compared to mouse ESCs, hESCs display a characteristic flattened colony morphology, relatively slow growth and inefficient clonal propagation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Thomson1">[3]</xref>. These properties resemble mouse epiblast-derived stem cells (EpiSC – referred to as “primed” hereafter), and indeed the gene expression profile of hESCs is closer to that of mouse EpiSC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Brons1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Tesar1">[10]</xref>. Thus, current evidence suggests that hESCs are derived from a later developmental stage (primed) relative to the stage from which mouse ESCs are derived (naïve). Some progress has been made to push human ESCs toward the naïve state through genetic manipulation or by altering culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Hanna1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Xu1">[12]</xref>, but much work remains in order to unravel the differences between pluripotent state and species differences. While the “primed” model of hESCs might reconcile some of the differences between murine and human ESCs, it opens a fundamental question about the similarity of the transcriptional circuitry between the two ESC types.</p>
      <p>Previously, we demonstrated a role for the transcription factor Zfx in the self-renewal of mESC and adult hematopoietic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-GalanCaridad1">[13]</xref>. Zfx is encoded on the mammalian X chromosome and contains a transcription activation domain and a zinc finger domain for sequence-specific DNA binding. A highly homologous protein called Zfy is encoded on the Y chromosome and is expressed in human but not in murine male somatic cells. ZFX/ZFY genes are highly conserved in vertebrates, with ∼97% amino acid identity between murine and human ZFX in the DNA binding domain. The deletion of Zfx in mESC impairs self-renewal but does not affect differentiation capacity. Conversely, Zfx overexpression enhanced mESC self-renewal under suboptimal conditions and opposed both spontaneous and directed differentiation. Zfx directly activated functionally relevant mESC-specific target genes such as Tbx3 and Tcl1. Subsequent work has implicated Zfx in a common genetic pathway with Myc and Klf4, the two transcription factors controlling mESC self-renewal and iPSC reprogramming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Chen1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Ouyang1">[16]</xref>. Thus, Zfx emerged as an essential and specific regulator of self-renewal in mESC, warranting the investigation of its role in the human system.</p>
      <p>Here, we used a genetic approach to analyze the role of ZFX in hESC self-renewal and differentiation. Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of ZFX impaired self-renewal of hESCs. A novel bacterial artifical chromosome (BAC) transgenic strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Placantonakis1">[17]</xref> was adapted to overexpress human ZFX in hESC under its native regulatory elements. Such gene dosage analysis showed that ZFX overexpression increased colony formation from single cells, a hallmark of improved hESC self-renewal. Furthermore, ZFX overexpression prevented spontaneous hESC differentiation under suboptimal conditions. Array analysis showed that ZFX overexpression decreased a number of genes characteristic of differentiated cells. These data establish an important role for ZFX in the regulation of hESC, confirming the conservation of self-renewal mechanisms in murine and human ESC.</p>

        <title>ZFX Knockdown Human ESCs</title>
        <p>H9 (WA-09) hESCs were maintained on MEFs (GlobalStem, Inc., Rockville, MD) before feeder-free expansion on Matrigel with conditioned media and 10 ng/ml FGF2 (3–5 days). To prepare cells for transduction, hESCs were exposed to Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA) to create a single-celled suspension before plating at 18,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in the presence of 10 µM Y-27632. The following day, cells were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 1 and 0.1. For each knockdown, phenotypes were observed at both multiplicities relative to the scrambled control. Puromycin selection began two days after transduction and no mock transduced cells remained two days after selection began. At this time, 5,000 puromycin resistant cells were replated per condition and were expanded in conditioned media +10 ng/ml FGF2 for seven days before crystal violet staining.</p>

        <p>Cells were transduced at a multiplicity of ∼0.1 as described above and puromycin selection was applied as described. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes before rinsing four times with PBS. Fixed cells were blocked/permeabilized with 1× Perm/wash buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 20 minutes before exposure to ZFX primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The next day, cells were washed three times in Perm/wash buffer before exposure to secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 and Hoechst 33258. Cells were washed three times after the hour, and PBS was added to the cells for imaging.</p>
        <p>Imaging was performed on an Operetta High Content Screening System. The Hoechst was exposed for 20 mSec and the Alexa 488 signal was captured by a 300 mSec exposure using 50% intensity from the light source. Harmony software version 3.0 was used to identify cell nuclei (Hoechst signal) and quantitated the Alexa 488 pixel intensity (ZFX protein) for each cell nucleus. The mean pixel intensity from 50 cell fields per sample were imaged from 3 independent experiments for quantitation. All knockdowns were significantly different from the scrambled control (p&lt;0.0001 for pairwise t-tests). 11,803 (Scr), 10,296 (Z2), 4,765 (Z3) and 6,905 (Z4) nuclei were measured in these experiments.</p>

        <title>ZFX Knockdown in Human ESCs</title>
        <p>Zfx is essential for the self-renewal of mouse ESCs and hematopoietic stem cells. To test whether ZFX is required in human ESCs, we used a lentiviral vector system to efficiently and stably knockdown (KD) ZFX in hESCs. To characterize the extent of ZFX knockdown, initial experiments were performed in leukemia cell lines where three of the five shRNAs tested caused a strong knockdown of ZFX expression levels and a concomitant growth impairment (data not shown). H9 hESCs cells were transduced with these 3 ZFX knockdown viruses before puromycin selection. All 3 of the vetted ZFX knockdowns caused a marked decrease in the number and size of colonies relative to the scrambled shRNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). We confirmed that ZFX RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) levels were reduced. This data suggests that ZFX expression is required for the efficient self-renewal of hESCs similar to its role in mESCs. We next turned to ZFX overexpression since the ZFX knockdown cells could not be readily expanded, confounding analysis.</p>

        <title>Production of ZFX Overexpressing Human ESCs</title>
        <p>Similar to many transcription factors, the overexpression of ZFX cDNA from a heterologous promoter is toxic to cells (B.R., unpublished data). To overexpress murine Zfx under its native regulation, the entire genomic Zfx locus has been introduced into mESC as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-GalanCaridad1">[13]</xref>. We have developed a method for stable BAC introduction into hESC to serve as reporter transgenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Placantonakis1">[17]</xref>. We adapted this approach to introduce additional copies of the human ZFX locus as BAC transgene in the H9 hESC. Several nucleofected H9 clones showed increased ZFX mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We chose two clones (ZFX<sup>Over1</sup> and ZFX<sup>Over2</sup>) with the highest ZFX expression levels and compared them to the parental H9 line, a control clone (ZFX<sup>Normal</sup>) with normal ZFX expression levels from the same experiment, as well as independent H9 GFP and YFP-expressing BAC transgenic reporter lines from our earlier studies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0042302-t001">Table 1</xref> for a comprehensive description of controls used in this study) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Placantonakis1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-James1">[20]</xref>. We verified that the BAC reporter control clones expressed normal amounts of ZFX (data not shown).</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, ZFX<sup>Over</sup> clones expressed more ZFX protein than the parental hESC line (H9) or ZFX<sup>Normal</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that the ZFX<sup>Over</sup> clones harbored multiple copies of the BAC integrated at a single site while ZFX<sup>Norma</sup>l lacked detectable ZFX BAC DNA despite being drug resistant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042302.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

        <title>Reduced Spontaneous Differentiation in ZFX<sup>Over</sup> cells</title>
        <p>Next we tested the growth of ZFX<sup>Over</sup> clones under conditions suboptimal for hESC self-renewal. ZFX<sup>Over</sup> and control hESC lines were cultured in the absence of conditioned media or feeder cells to promote spontaneous differentiation, and the percentage of cells expressing SSEA-3 and SSEA-1 was measured to quantify the ratio of undifferentiated versus differentiated cells, respectively. In control experiments, there was no statistical difference in marker expression when conditioned media was used to expand cells without feeders (data not shown). However, in suboptimal conditions, H9 and the control clones showed strong signs of differentiation while the ZFX<sup>Over</sup> cells resisted spontaneous differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g004">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042302.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

        <p>Reciprocally, H9 and control clones expressed high levels of SSEA-1, a marker of differentiated cells (combined mean 80.05±1.14% SEM, n = 13; p&lt;0.0001) compared to ZFX<sup>Over1</sup> (32.50±8.98 AU SEM, n = 3; p&lt;0.0001) and ZFX<sup>Over2</sup> (39.23±11.33 AU SEM, n = 3; p&lt;0.0001). The mean fluorescent intensity of SSEA-1 expression was also significantly higher in controls (11,326±1008 AU SEM, n = 13) compared to ZFX<sup>Over1</sup> (760.7±188 AU SEM, n = 3; p = 0.002) and ZFX<sup>Over2</sup> (772.7±211.2 AU SEM, n = 3; p = 0.0002).

        <p>To test whether higher ZFX levels globally prohibit ESC differentiation, ZFX<sup>Over</sup> clones, two BAC transgenic control clones (ID1::YFPc2 and Dll1::GFPc277) and H9 were directed into endoderm or neural tissue and we examined lineage marker expression during differentiation using quantitative RT-PCR. We detected no significant difference in the loss of Nanog expression or gain in CXCR4 expression in ZFX<sup>Over</sup> clones during endodermal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g005">Figure 5</xref>). During neural differentiation, ZFX<sup>Over</sup> clones showed delayed Nanog downregulation and Pax6 induction on day 3 but no difference at later time points.

        <title>Gene Expression Profile of ZFX<sup>Over</sup> cells</title>
        <p>To gain insight into the genome-wide expression changes due to ZFX overexpression, we performed microarray analysis in ZFX<sup>Over</sup> hESCs. In order to avoid any systematic bias in the gene expression analysis due to varying levels of spontaneous differentiation in ZFX<sup>Over</sup> versus controls, we isolated the most undifferentiated (Tra1-81<sup>HI</sup>/SSEA-3<sup>HI</sup>) hESCs from each line. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the microarray data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) showed that the ZFX<sup>Normal</sup> clone was most distinct from other hESC, possibly as a result of nucleofection/selection procedure. Nevertheless, principal component analysis identified genes changing in the two ZFX<sup>Over</sup> clones compared to both ZFX<sup>Normal</sup> and the parental H9 cells. Similar results were obtained when ZFX<sup>Normal</sup> was excluded from the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The genes overexpressed in ZFX<sup>Over</sup> cells included <italic>ZFX</italic> itself, thus validating the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The differential expression of select genes was confirmed by qPCR on independent samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042302-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Notably, many genes reduced in ZFX<sup>Over</sup> cells represent canonical markers of differentiation, such as NODAL, EOMES and VIMENTIN. Thus, ZFX<sup>Over</sup> hESC show reduced baseline expression of lineage differentiation markers, compatible with the hypothesis that ZFX overexpression stabilizes the undifferentiated state of hESC.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the current study we demonstrate a role for the transcription factor ZFX in modulating the self-renewal of hESC using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. ZFX reduction caused a loss of self-renewal while BAC-mediated ZFX overexpression increased the clonogenicity and decreased spontaneous differentiation of hESCs. Importantly, ZFX-overexpressing clones retained their ability to undergo differentiation in response to appropriate stimuli. The use of BAC transgenesis was critical to circumvent general toxic effects of ZFX overexpression observed using heterologous promoters. Gene expression driven by the endogenous gene locus in a BAC provides advantages over heterologous promoters, such as native gene regulation, reduced position effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Lee1">[23]</xref> and copy number-dependent expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Yang1">[24]</xref>. Until now, BACs were used to direct reporter gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Placantonakis1">[17]</xref> or as vehicles for homologous recombination in hESC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Song1">[25]</xref>. We believe this study is the first to demonstrate their utility as vectors for functional gene expression in hESCs.</p>
      <p>Because the extrinsic self-renewal signals, morphology and clonogenicity differ between human and mouse ESCs, it is critical to identify the self-renewal regulators that are conserved between the two species. Here we provide evidence for the functional conservation of ZFX, a critical member of the self-renewal transcriptional network. Our gain-of-function studies in hESCs are compatible with our previous work in mESCs demonstrating enhanced self-renewal and reduced spontaneous differentiation in both murine and human ESC. However, ZFX-overexpressing hESC underwent normal lineage-specific differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, while forced differentiation in Zfx-overexpressing murine ESC led to a severely impaired differentiation response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-GalanCaridad1">[13]</xref>. While we currently do not know the reason for these differences between mouse and human ESCs, we cannot rule out that they simply reflect different levels of overexpression (∼3-fold overexpression in hESC compared to &gt;8-fold in the examined clones of murine ESC). Interestingly, the genes affected by Zfx overexpression in murine ESC (S.H., unpublished) and human ESC (this study) show little overlap. This may reflect the differences in the experimental approaches and microarray platforms used, and/or highlight the species-specific gene expression profiles of undifferentiated ESC. In any case, our data highlight the conserved cell-intrinsic molecular control of ESC self-renewal by ZFX, despite the differences in extrinsic signals.</p>
      <p>The enhanced self-renewal observed in ZFX-overexpressing clones could reflect a reduction in the baseline heterogeneity of cultured ESC. This hypothesis is supported by the increased plating efficiency of ZFX<sup>Over</sup> clones and by a small but reproducible increase in the percentage of cells expressing undifferentiated hESC markers (data not shown). It is possible that high ZFX levels stabilize a chromatin conformation that favors self-renewal over differentiation. This ‘locked’ state could also explain the kinetic delay in neural differentiation observed in ZFX-overexpressing hESC. Alternatively, ZFX overexpression may convert hESC from their primed state into a less differentiated, naïve state characteristic of murine ESC. Indeed, many of the genes downregulated in ZFX<sup>Over</sup> clones are expressed in mouse epiblast stem cells isolated from the postimplantation embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Brons1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042302-Tesar1">[10]</xref>. However, clonal replating experiments without the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 showed poor clonal replating despite ZFX overexpression (data not shown), arguing against a truly naïve state. Nevertheless, it is possible that pluripotency is a continuum between the naïve and primed states, and that ZFX overexpression has moved the primed human ESCs toward a naïve state. If true, our data on ZFX overexpression may aid in defining a currently elusive, mouse ESC-like, pluripotent state in hESCs. The functional characterization of the potential ZFX target genes in hESCs reported here may contribute to the identification of key evolutionarily conserved components of the ESC self-renewal machinery.</p>
