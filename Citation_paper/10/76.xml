<p>Since synaptic plasticity is regarded as a potential mechanism for memory formation and learning, there is growing interest in the study of its underlying mechanisms. Recently several evolutionary models of cellular development have been presented, but none have been shown to be able to evolve a range of biological synaptic plasticity regimes. In this paper we present a biologically plausible evolutionary cellular development model and test its ability to evolve different biological synaptic plasticity regimes. The core of the model is a genomic and proteomic regulation network which controls cells and their neurites in a 2D environment. The model has previously been shown to successfully evolve behaving organisms, enable gene related phenomena, and produce biological neural mechanisms such as temporal representations. Several experiments are described in which the model evolves different synaptic plasticity regimes using a direct fitness function. Other experiments examine the ability of the model to evolve simple plasticity regimes in a task -based fitness function environment. These results suggest that such evolutionary cellular development models have the potential to be used as a research tool for investigating the evolutionary aspects of synaptic plasticity and at the same time can serve as the basis for novel artificial computational systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Much recent effort has been directed towards understanding the mechanisms that underlie neural system development and plasticity by simulating biological processes at a time- scale of individual development. Intensive attempts are also under way to develop models that evolve artificial neural networks. However, most models evolving neural systems either lack the flexibility to handle a wide range of biological phenomena or do not have the requisite foundation to be considered biologically plausible.</p>
<p>The most common encoding used to evolve neural networks from genotypes is known as “direct encoding” where the phenotype information is directly encoded in the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Montana1">[1]</xref>. Other methods include parameterized encoding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Harp1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Rust2">[4]</xref>, which is usually restricted to predefined architectures, and non- modularity and grammar encoding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Kitano1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Sims2">[7]</xref>, where the genome encodes a set of grammar rules that are used to build the phenotype.</p>
<p>Recently, several artificial evolutionary systems that incorporate a developmental phase have been presented. Various names have been suggested for such systems, including Artificial Ontogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Bongard1">[8]</xref>, Computational Embryogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Bentley1">[9]</xref>, Cellular Encoding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Gruau1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Belew1">[11]</xref>, Morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Jakobi1">[12]</xref>, and Artificial Embryogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Stanley1">[13]</xref>. Some of these computational models enable evolving neural networks by simulating metabolic and cellular development processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Astor1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Kitano2">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Reil1">[18]</xref>, an artificial genome entirely based on template matching in a nucleotide-like sequence was presented and used to study the dynamics of gene expression. In this model, as in the model presented in this paper, genes activate or inhibit other genes by producing products that bind to their regulatory sequences. However, this model has not been used for examining phenomena on a larger scale, such as at the tissue or neural level.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Dellaert2">[19]</xref>, a simulation of complex biologically- inspired development was shown to be possible by evolving an organism through many cycles of cell division, differentiation and axonal growth. However, hand- written genetic instructions were used to control the organism's development.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Gruau1">[10]</xref>, grammatical rules were used to build the phenotype, but unlike grammar encoding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Kitano1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Sims2">[7]</xref>, the grammatical rules were applied to a neural cell rather than a matrix. Each cell had a copy of the genome, which directly encoded a grammar tree. Each cell reads the grammar tree at a different position. Depending on what the cell reads, it can divide, change its internal parameters, and take on its final form as a neuron.</p>
<p>A similar grammar-based model for generating a neural phenotype was presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Belew2">[20]</xref>. The development starts with a germ cell that is represented by the start symbol of the grammar. However, these grammar based and cellular based encodings lack the ability to deal with complex interactions among the different developmental phenomena.</p>
<p>A model of neural network biological development based on a regulatory genome was presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Cangelosi1">[21]</xref>. The NN was evolved as the controller of a virtual foraging organism.. In this model, an organism's NN development starts with a single cell that has 23 ‘proteins’. Some of these are extra-cellular signaling receptors, whereas others are responsible for the execution of developmental events, and still others are regulatory elements for the modulation of gene expression.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Dellaert2">[19]</xref>, organisms evolve through many cycles of cell division, differentiation, and axonal growth. This study shows that a simulation of complex biologically inspired development is possible and can be successful. However, many of the genetic instructions to control the organism's development were hand-written.</p>
<p>A computational model of neurogenesis based on metabolitic processes was tested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Kitano2">[17]</xref>. The model could evolve large neural networks. Another system for evolving 3D organisms using gene expression mechanisms was presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Eggenberger1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, the drawback of all the encodings presented above is that they are either not based on biological processes, or lack the multiple interactions among different developmental phenomena that result in the emergence of biologically plausible models. Thus, despite promising progress, none of these models has succeeded in replicating a wide range of biological phenomena, including ones that demonstrate synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>It has been argued elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Ruppin1">[22]</xref>, that success in finding an efficient indirect biological encoding model should provide us with simulation tools that can teach us a great deal about the organization and functioning of biological systems.</p>
<p>Synaptic plasticity has long been regarded as a potential mechanism for memory formation and learning. The most famous synaptic plasticity principle is known as Hebbian learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Hebb1">[23]</xref>, where modifications in synaptic transmission efficacy are driven by correlations in the firing activity of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 years, a large body of experimental results on synaptic plasticity has been accumulated. The long- lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission, Long Term Potentiation (LTP) first reported in 1973 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Bliss1">[24]</xref>, along with its counterpart Long-Term Depression (LTD), has been the focus of an enormous amount of investigation. Several experiments on various neuronal systems have found that synaptic plasticity may also depend on accurate spike timing; Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Debanne1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Bi1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>The field of evolutionary robotics provides interesting approaches to evolving synaptic plasticity. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Floreano1">[30]</xref> a model that genetically encodes rules of synaptic plasticity with rules of neural morphogenesis was shown to be feasible.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Federici1">[31]</xref> an evolutionary model combines an integrate and fire neuron with a correlation-based synaptic plasticity model and developmental encoding. The results on a simple robot navigation task indicate that such a system may allow for the efficient evolution of large networks.</p>
<p>However, these models are usually not designed to be based on biological specifics either at the gene to protein transcription functionality level or at the level of neural mechanisms and are usually restricted to correlation based plasticity regimes alone. To this day no evolutionary biological model has been shown to have the ability to evolve different biological synaptic plasticity rules.</p>
<p>In our previous papers, we presented an indirect encoding framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Yerushalmi1">[32]</xref> capable of evolving behaving organisms with regulated mitosis and differentiated cells. We showed that the model is capable of evolving behaviors based on neural control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Yerushalmi1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Yerushalmi2">[33]</xref>. The same model has been shown to evolve gene- related phenomena such as functional gene clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Yerushalmi3">[34]</xref>, and produce biological neural mechanisms such as temporal representations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Yerushalmi2">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this paper we examine the model's ability to evolve simple virtual organisms with different biological synaptic plasticity rules, and show that the model can evolve various plasticity regimes observed in nature.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In the next sections we present an evolutionary simulation model. The first section describes the chromosome model that is based on DNA and protein-like sequences. Two such chromosomes can reproduce an offspring chromosome, as detailed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref> section. The translation model for chromosomes to gene-protein networks and the gene-network dynamic system model is detailed later, preceding sections describing the way the cellular dynamics are translated into organism and cellular functionality. After presenting the model we report the results of several experiments. The first experiments use fitness functions that were directly designed to develop various synaptic plasticity regimes. The final, more complex, experiment uses a fitness function based on behavior.</p>
<p>More information about the framework, together with biological rationale for the model, can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Yerushalmi1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Yerushalmi3">[34]</xref>.</p>

<title>Chromosome</title>
<p>Each organism in the model expresses a phenotype derived from a chromosome structured according to biological conventions. Each chromosome includes a sequence of genes, in which each gene starts with a promoter sequence followed by a messenger RNA sequence.</p>
<p>Each promoter sequence has 1–3 cis-regulatory elements which are used as binding sites that regulate the expression of the gene, and a parameter block that includes the gene parameters. The parameter block of a gene/protein represents the properties derived specifically from its spatial structure. The use of gene and protein parameters in building the network is detailed later. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003697-t001">Table 1</xref> presents a list of all the parameters. Each mRNA sequence starts with a cis-regulatory element which is used as binding site that regulates the activation of the protein, followed by a parameter sequence, which in turn is followed by a trans-acting element which binds to other cis-regulatory elements to control their expression and activation; all represent the translated protein. All the cis-regulatory elements, trans-acting elements and parameter sequences are represented as sequences of real numbers, with the chromosome composed of a long sequence of real numbers <italic>r<sub>1…</sub>r<sub>n</sub></italic>. The chromosome is translated into a gene-protein network as detailed in the following sections.</p>

<p>In the model, the field induced by a node <italic>j</italic> on node <italic>i</italic> is the product its dynamic activity level <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, its concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, its static activity factor <italic>α<sub>j</sub></italic>, and the connection between the nodes <italic>w<sub>ij</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>To enable the model to separate the activation dynamics and the production dynamics, for example to affect a protein's concentration without affecting its spatial structure and vice versa, each gene/protein possesses different slopes <italic>β</italic><sup>•</sup>, thresholds <italic>θ</italic><sup>•</sup>, and time constants <italic>τ</italic><sup>•</sup>: <italic>β<sup>a</sup></italic>, <italic>θ<sup>a</sup></italic>, <italic>τ<sup>a</sup></italic> to control the dynamics of activation and <italic>θ<sup>p</sup></italic>, <italic>β<sup>p</sup></italic>, <italic>τ<sup>p</sup></italic> to control the dynamics of protein production.</p>
<p>The model enables the external concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of each protein to play a role in the network dynamics by incorporating the expression <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the equations above. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is either the internal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or external concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, according to the values of x and b, which makes the model capable of evolving receptor-ligand relationships, based on the Boolean parameter b.</p>
<p>In order to permit tissue related dynamics, the external concentration equation contains a diffusion expression. <italic>k<sub>i</sub></italic> is the diffusion coefficient of <italic>i</italic>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, so that the expression <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the contribution of diffusion to the change in external concentration, according to the diffusion equation <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<p>In this paper the term ‘organism’ refers to the group of all cells that are repeated-mitosis results of the same zygote cell. Since during mitosis the gene-protein network is copied from the parent cell, all organism cells are controlled by the same network structure, but since each cell is situated in a different location, it may possess different internal and external protein concentrations.</p>
<p>To control dendrites and axons separately from their soma, we needed a mechanism to separate the dynamic values of the cell's soma from those of a neurite. Therefore, another basic parameter (P<sub>11</sub>) was added to control the protein's ability to diffuse between a cell's soma and neurite. Based on this diffusion parameter, the system decides whether a given protein in a neurite will have the same dynamic properties as the soma's and be presented by the same node in the regulatory network, or whether it will have separate properties based on a different node connected to the same regulatory network. A simple example of synapsogenesis is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003697-g002">Figure 2</xref>. In the experiments, the weight value of a synapse connecting axon A to dendrite B is the sum of the axon's and dendrite's synapse weight functions <italic>ω<sub>axon</sub></italic> and <italic>ω<sub>dendrite</sub></italic> as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003697-t002">Table 2:</xref><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

<title>Synapsogenesis scheme example.</title>
<p>A) The basic building plan for the cellular tissue is the chromosome. B) The chromosome is translated into a zygote controlled by a regulatory network. C) A mitosis event splits the zygote into two separate cells, where each cell has its own instance of the same regulatory network template. D) Neurite sprouting events occur in both cells. An axon is branched from the left cell, and a dendrite – from the right cell. Proteins a and b are marked in P11 as ones that cannot diffuse from neurite to soma. Therefore, their instances are separated into neurites with the same connectivity. E) After the axon is guided by external protein concentrations towards the right cell's dendrite, a ‘synapsogenesis’ event occurs. A synapse is formed, allowing proteins marked as synapse-diffusible (in their ktype parameter) to move from one cell to another.</p>

<title>Organism development</title>
<p>Each organism is initially made up of a single cell that has no initial external or internal concentrations. The initial cell's genes can produce proteins that change its internal and external concentrations and may cause some functional events such as mitosis or cell migration. The cells can repeat mitosis events, so eventually the organism can consist of several cells, where each cell is controlled by the same chromosome and has the same controlling regulatory network, but may have different internal and external concentrations. The internal and external concentrations are changed dynamically by the regulation network and diffusion rules presented above. The cells are represented as circles on a two- dimensional grid and can move to continuous position values. In a cell division event, the daughter cell is adjacently located on an axis according to the “Soma Migration Directional Marker” (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003697-t002">Table 2</xref>) of the mother cell. When a “Sprout axon/dendrite Messenger” is triggered, a neurite is sprouted from the soma. All cell elements (soma, axon and dendrite) can migrate on the grid according to their migration speed and directional marker (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003697-t002">Table 2</xref>). When an “Axon Target Select Marker” event is triggered in an axon, and the axon has a dendrite at a distance of less than one cell radius, the axon synapses to the nearby dendrites that have the same flag are turned on.</p>
<p>The organism has a certain period of time in which it has to stop mitosis; only then will the organism be an adult that may reproduce. If the organism does not stop mitosis during the predefined period, it is regarded as a cancerous tissue and removed from the environment without reproduction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003697-g003">Figure 3</xref> illustrates an organism developed in the direct fitness function experiments presented in this paper. An example of an organism that can develop in the behavior- based experiments is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003697-g004">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

<p>Finally, eight sessions were run in an attempt to evolve a more complicated form of synaptic plasticity which was time-dependent (STDP).

<title>Behavior Based Experiments</title>
<p>We next examined whether any of the plasticity regimes could evolve in an environment where the evolutionary pressure was based on the organism's behavior.</p>
<p>In this experiment, each virtual organism was randomly set to be a male or a female, and could move in the environment by using its sensor neurons (that cannot have dendrites), motor neurons (that cannot have axons) and hidden neurons (that can have both dendrites and neurons) as detailed later. In order to encourage the virtual organisms to develop neural networks, they were given a life span proportional to the different cellular types they developed: a sensory neuron, a motor neuron, a hidden neuron, a dendrite, an axon, and a synapse. Hence, a maximal time span was assigned to every virtual organism that possessed a “basic” neural network, which was defined as having at least one instance of each of the six elements mentioned above. Since the system was defined as having only dendrite-to-axon synapses, the “basic” network can also be seen as a network that included at least a motor, a hidden, and a sensory neuron and one synapse. The virtual organisms were removed from the environment after completing their life span period.</p>
<p>The population size was restricted to a predefined range by removing the eldest virtual organisms from the environment when the number of virtual organisms reached the upper bound (due to crowding), and by randomly choosing two parents from the environment and producing their offspring as a new individual in the environment when the number of virtual organisms reached the lower bound.</p>
<p>Each virtual organism in the behavioral based experiments was developed on a two-dimensional 20×20 cellular grid. The physical environment included action molecules <italic>m</italic> as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003697-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003697-t003">3</xref>.</p>
<p>The lower and upper bounds of the population size were set to 90 and 110. Unlike previous evolutionary sessions, in this session a specific fitness function was not set and therefore a roulette wheel selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003697-Goldberg1">[42]</xref> was not used. The evolutionary pressure was set only by including the life-span period in the environment as a function of the neural network structure, and introducing a “mating rule” (see below).

<title>The Evolutionary Session</title>
<p>In order to evolve neural based behavior, a “mating rule” was introduced in the environment, where two virtual organisms that contacted each other produced offspring according to the reproduction equation presented in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section. Hence we expected the virtual organisms to develop neural mechanisms that would maximize their contacts with virtual organisms of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>As a first step, we tested for changes in the virtual organisms' behavior along generations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003697-g016">Figure 16</xref>, the percentage of reproduction resulting from virtual organism contact rose over generations, which cannot be ascribed to a change in the population size (which, as detailed earlier, was always between 90 and 110).</p>

<p>In order to examine whether any of the synaptic plasticity regimes evolved in the behavioral experiment, every 0.5 generations (where the population generation was calculated as the average generation of the individuals in the population) an organism was randomly chosen from the population and tested to see whether it included (1) synapses, where the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was negative at P&lt;0.05.

We did not control for STDP synapses in this experiment.</p>
<p>For each of the four synapse types above we examined whether there was an increase in the proportion of virtual organisms with the specific synapse type in the first 1000 generations compared to the second 1000 generation. There was an increase in the proportion of virtual organisms that had at least one Non-Hebbian pre-synaptic LTP synapse (P&lt;9×10<sup>−10</sup>, T-test). No such findings were observed for the other synaptic plasticity types (P&gt;0.1, T-test).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2m">
<title>Non-Hebbian pre-synaptic LTP synapse as a memory mechanism</title>
<p>This finding could be explained by (1) the tendency of the evolution to use Non-Hebbian pre-synaptic LTP synapses in this early stage for mating functionality or (2) some unrelated mechanism preferring such organisms in the latter period, such as a tendency of the organisms to include more synapses, which would increase their likelihood of including at least one instance of a specific synapse type.</p>
<p>A manual examination of the virtual organisms that included a Non-Hebbian pre-synaptic LTP synapse gave us a clue to the use of these synapses. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003697-g017">Figure 17</xref>, in some of the cases the Non-Hebbian pre-synaptic LTP synapse was in a path connecting asensors sensitive to a “mate” odor to a motor neuron. This caused the organism to turn around, resulting in a behavior where the synapse “remembered” that there had just been a potential mate nearby, causing the organism to remain in its vicinity and hence increasing the probability of encountering the previously sensed mate.</p>

<title>An organism with a simple memory mechanism of sensed potential mates.</title>
<p>One of the developed organisms included a sensory neuron A that was sensitive to mate odors, synapsing a hidden neuron B, synapsing using a Non-Hebbian pre-synaptic LTP synapse S, a hidden neuron C, synapsing a motor neuron D. Neuron B firing at a high rate as a result of a proximal mate potentiates synapse S and immediately raises the firing rate of D , causing the organism to turn around and stay in the same area.</p>

<p>We tested the mutual information between synapse potentiation and the existence of a mate nearby. If the synapses function as a memory mechanism for “remembering” whether there are mates the virtual organism just sensed, we should observe higher mutual information values in cases of synapses recognized as Non-Hebbian pre-synaptic LTP synapses compared to randomly chosen synapses. We compared 250 virtual organisms with a Non-Hebbian pre-synaptic LTP synapse (group B) to 250 randomly chosen virtual organisms (group A). Each virtual organism was placed in an environment and we sampled 1000 instances of:</p>

</list-item></list>
<p>For each organism the <italic>d<sub>t</sub></italic>, <italic>w<sub>t</sub></italic> values were converted to Boolean values <italic>D = {d<sup>1</sup>,d<sup>2</sup>}</italic> and <italic>W = {w<sup>1</sup>, w<sup>2</sup>}</italic>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003697.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003697-g018">Figure 18</xref>, there was a significant difference in mutual information <italic>I(D;W)</italic> between Group A and Group B.(T-test P&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The experiments presented in this paper were designed to examine the ability of an evolutionary cellular development model to evolve various synaptic plasticity regimes. The approach described in this paper is based on a model that is both feasible in terms of running relatively complex evolutionary simulations and includes a biologically plausible gene-protein regulation functionality with an integrate-and-fire neural mechanism.</p>
<p>By applying different fitness functions to the model in separate evolutionary sessions, different synaptic plasticity rules could be evolved by the system: Hebbian- like LTP plasticity, Anti-Hebbian-like LTD plasticity, Non-Hebbian LTP pre- and post- synaptic plasticity and Hebbian- like STDP. We also showed how Non-Hebbian LTP pre- synaptic plasticity can evolve in an evolutionary system that has no direct fitness function, but is based on behavior selection, and how this plasticity can serve as a simple memory mechanism.</p>
<p>According to the fitness curves in the direct fitness function experiments, anti-Hebbian like plasticity regimes converge for most runs quite well, especially compared to the fitness curves of the other plasticity types, and therefore might have a selectional advantage in the last experiment.</p>
<p>Although in this paper we focused on the model's ability to evolve various synaptic plasticity regimes, we also examined the model as a whole and did not derive the specific features in the model that enable evolving synaptic plasticity. For example, even though the diffusion functionality does not seem to be related to the abilities of the model as presented in this paper, our attempts to evolve the simplest plasticity regime without diffusion did not succeed, suggesting that the ability to regulate protein diffusion between neurites and soma is essential. We believe that future studies should examine the ability of simplified models to evolve various synaptic plasticity regimes to discover new essential components of complex mechanisms.</p>
<p>The ability of the model to evolve various biological plasticity regimes, together with its ability to present genomic and neuronal phenomena suggest that this simulation approach can serve as a tool for investigating evolutionary aspects of synaptic plasticity. One example for such future examination is related to the connection between the time when STDP emerges on the biological phylogenetic tree and the number of generations needed to evolve it in the model. The fact that some synaptic plasticity rules such as time dependent plasticity evolved much more slowly than others as seen in the results presented here can be ascribed to unsuitable fitness functions.</p>
<p>A different conclusion relates to synaptic plasticity as a mechanism for memory formation and learning. The fact that the model is capable of evolving a biological synaptic plasticity rule as a pre- synaptic LTP synapse in an environment where selection is based on behavior and not directly designed to evolve this specific plasticity should encourage the computational applications of such an approach. We believe that future experiments using this and similar models can shed more light on other synaptic plasticity rules and their relationship to memory and learning, both for future artificial intelligence systems, and as a research tool to account for existing neural systems. Nevertheless, the fact that some synaptic plasticity rules, such as time dependent plasticity, evolved in the direct fitness experiments much more slowly than others, implies possible computation power difficulties in larger and more complex models. We believe that statistical examination of the artificial mechanisms that lead to the creation of more complex synaptic regimes in an evolutionary environment with behavior based selection has the potential to better understand synaptic plasticity both as a biological and computational research tool.</p>
