Neural cells can be derived from hESCs either by direct enrichment, or by isolating specific growth factor-responsive and expandable populations of human neural stem cells (hNSCs). Studies have indicated that the direct enrichment method generates a heterogeneous population of cells that may contain residual undifferentiated stem cells that could lead to tumor formation in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Principal Findings</title><p>We isolated an expandable and homogenous population of hNSCs (named SD56) from hESCs using a defined media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and leukemia inhibitory growth factor (LIF). These hNSCs grew as an adherent monolayer culture. They were fully neuralized and uniformly expressed molecular features of NSCs, including nestin, vimentin and radial glial markers. These hNSCs did not express the pluripotency markers Oct4 or Nanog, nor did they express markers for the mesoderm or endoderm lineages. The self-renewal property of the hNSCs was characterized by a predominant symmetrical mode of cell division. The SD56 hNSCs differentiated into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes throughout multiple passages in vitro, as well as after transplantation. Together, these criteria confirm the definitive NSC identity of the SD56 cell line. Importantly, they exhibited no chromosome abnormalities and did not form tumors after implantation into rat ischemic brains and into naïve nude rat brains and flanks. Furthermore, hNSCs isolated under these conditions migrated toward the ischemia-injured adult brain parenchyma and improved the independent use of the stroke-impaired forelimb two months post-transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The SD56 human neural stem cells derived under the reported conditions are stable, do not form tumors in vivo and enable functional recovery after stroke. These properties indicate that this hNSC line may offer a renewable, homogenous source of neural cells that will be valuable for basic and translational research.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by Russell and Elizabeth Siegelman, Bernard and Ronni Lacroute, the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, John and Dodie Rosekrans, the Edward E.

After 3 days in vitro (DIV), there was selective survival and growth of cells that aggregated in clusters or spheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001644-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These primary spheres were harvested and replated in fresh media. During the following week, the spheres attached to the flask and a fibroblast-like cell population began to migrate out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001644-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Secondary spheres (2° spheres) were generated from these cultures and lifted off by the end of the week leaving a hollow in the middle of the attached cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001644-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The floating 2° spheres were collected and replated in fresh growth medium for 2 weeks.

At the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> passages, spheres were dissociated into a single-cell suspension using trypsin-EDTA.

Primary neurospheres (B) were isolated and replated to eliminate other non-neural cells. The selectively harvested secondary neurospheres (arrow in C), left behind hollow cores in the surface area (star in D) where they attached earlier. They were perpetuated for an additional 5 passages (E). These 2° spheres were then passaged using a single cell dissociation protocol (F). Arrow in F shows an example of a focus of proliferating cells. (G, H) The hNSCs were passaged every 5–7 days, as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section. Starting from an initial population of 1 million cells, the cumulative cell number was calculated at each passage as the fold of increase×the total cell number and plotted as logarithm with base 2 in function of time (G). The cell perpetuation (G) and population doubling (H) analysis demonstrated the continuous and stable growth of the hNSCs.

To determine if the hNSCs divide symmetrically, we pulsed cultures with the thymidine analog, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), after plating and looked for the expression of nestin in the progeny. Cultures were fixed after 1, 2 or 3 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001644-g001">Figure 1N–P</xref>). After 2 days, plated single cells first underwent a symmetric cell division and gave rise to daughter cells that were both positive for BrdU and nestin. The clone of cells continued to grow over the 3 DIV and all the progeny expressed nestin. BrdU labeling demonstrated that it was rare for only one daughter cell to inherit the BrdU and thus had undergone asymmetric segregation of the chromatids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001644.s002">Figure S2</xref>). G-band karyotyping of these hNSCs confirmed the normal, non-transformed nature of cells after 12 passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001644-g001">Figure 1J</xref>).

The population doubling at each passage averaged at 1.4±0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001644-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). The viability of hNSCs at each passage was consistent at the approximate value of 98%. The projected cumulative cell numbers demonstrated that trillions of cells could be generated over a period of 5 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001644-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). We expanded the isolated hNSCs lines for over 20 passages with a stable phenotype. An initial cell bank of 75 vials containing 2 to 5 million cells each was generated and cryopreserved.</p><p>Upon removal of the mitogenic factors and plating on a coverslip pre-coated with poly-L-ornithine (PLO) substrate, the hNSCs spontaneously differentiated into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, a property that is consistent with normal multipotent hNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001644-g002">Figure 2</xref>). After 2 DIV, hNSCs expressed transcripts for the neural-specific genes nestin, Notch1 and neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001644-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and for the lineage specific markers β-tubulin class III, medium-size neurofilament (NF-M) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) for neurons, GFAP for astrocytes and myelin basic protein (MBP) for oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001644-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Transcripts for the GABAergic cell marker glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were expressed, but transcripts for the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker for dopaminergic neurons, were undetectable.

The isolated hNSCs are normal and do not form tumors in normal nude rats</title><p>The self-renewal and pluripotent abilities of the hESCs are also associated with tumorigenic properties. Therefore, the first critical step toward developing therapeutic hNSCs is to verify that they are non-tumorigenic. The monolayer culture of SD56 hNSCs clearly demonstrated contact inhibition of growth, a normal karyotype and did not express the pluripotency transcripts Oct-4 and Nanog. Removal of mitogenic factors and continued culture on plastic resulted in cell senescence that is characteristic of non-transformed cells. To determine whether SD56 hNSCs form tumors in vivo, we transplanted them at high density (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) into the forebrain and subcutaneously into the flank of nude rats. The animals were kept for a two-month post-transplant survival period. To label mitotically active cells in vivo during S-phase, the rats were injected IP with BrdU (50 mg/kg) every 8 hours during the last 24 hours before euthanasia. The transit amplifying endogenous precursors located in the subventricular zone (SVZ) were labeled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001644.s003">Figure S3</xref>); however, we were unable to detect grafted SD56 hNSCs co-localizing the human-specific nuclear marker hNuc and BrdU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001644.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

Animals were euthanized two months later and the brains processed for histo-pathology and immunocytochemistry. Grafted SD56 hNSCs, identified with hNuc, demonstrated a 37.0±15.8% survival rate and a remarkable dispersion toward the stroke-damaged tissue with no sign of overgrowth or tumorigenesis. The majority of grafted cells (61.2±4.7%) migrated at least 200 µm away from the injection site and penetrated an average distance of 806.4±49.3 µm into the stroke-damaged tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001644-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>).

A recent study has reported that a murine ESC-derived NSC line (LC1) is propagated as an adherent homogenous culture with a dominant mode of symmetrical self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001644-Conti1">[21]</xref>. A combination of EGF and FGF2 was sufficient to propagate these NSCs as an adherent monolayer. However, the SD56 hNSC line described here required the combination of EGF, bFGF and LIF for self-maintenance. Although there are morphological and molecular similarities between our hNSCs and the NSCs previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001644-Conti1">[21]</xref>, the methods of isolation and growth are different. In addition to the different combination of growth factors used, the hNSC line we have isolated did not go through the rosette-structure stage. The in vitro analysis of BrdU incorporation and nestin expression indicated that our hNSCs divide predominantly symmetrically. This type of growth pattern is characteristic of primitive normal stem cells undergoing mostly symmetric cell division to increase the stem cell pool at the early stage of development or during tissue regeneration after injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001644-Morrison1">[23]</xref>. RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry analysis demonstrated that these undifferentiated SD56 cells did not express any pluripotency, endodermal or mesodermal markers. Furthermore, the SD56 hNSCs described here exhibited the multipotential characteristic to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes both in vitro and upon transplantation. Together these findings suggest that the hNSC line we isolated are appropriately programmed and share similar characteristics with the definitive NSCs of the developing brain.</p><p>The SD56 hNSCs demonstrated a remarkable ability to migrate toward the stroke-damaged parenchyma of the adult rat brain.

The transplantation of hNSCs significantly enhanced the independent use of the impaired contralateral forelimb 8 weeks post transplantation. This is the first report demonstrating that the transplantation of hNSCs derived from hESCs can improve neurologic behavior after experimental stroke. Together, these findings are encouraging and suggest that these cells are promising for future development.

The cell culture media consisted of a 1∶1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and F12 nutrient, 20% serum replacement (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 µg/ml heparin and 4 ng/ml bFGF (R&amp;D Systems). To generate the NSCs, dissociated hESCs were cultured in a chemically defined medium composed of DMEM/F12 (1∶1) including glucose (0.6%), glutamine (2 mM), sodium bicarbonate (3 mM), and HEPES buffer (5 mM) [all from Sigma except glutamine (Invitrogen)]. A defined hormone mix and salt mixture (Sigma), including insulin (25 mg/ml), transferrin (100 mg/ml), progesterone (20 nM), putrescine (60 mM), and selenium chloride (30 nM) was used in place of serum. The medium was supplemented with EGF (20 ng/ml), bFGF (10 ng/ml) and LIF (10 ng/ml). Dissociated hNSCs were plated at a density of 100,000 cell/ml in Corning T75 (Invitrogen) culture flasks in the defined media together with the growth factors. After 5–7 DIV, the adherent culture was incubated in 0.025%trypsin/0.01% EDTA (w/v) for 1 min followed by the addition of trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen) then gently triturated to achieve single cell suspension. The cells were then washed twice with fresh medium and reseeded in fresh growth factor-containing media at 100,000 cells/ml. This procedure was performed for 21 passages and the fold of increase and population doubling were calculated at each passage. For clonal analysis, single spheres or confluent hNSC cultures were single cell dissociated and serially diluted to yield 1–2 cell/10 µl. A 10-µl-cell suspension was then added to each of 96 or 24 well plates containing 200–300 µl of growth media. Wells containing one viable cell were marked the next day and re-scored 5 to 7 days later for cell proliferation.

Thereafter oral cyclosporine was used at 210 µg/ml in drinking water until euthanasia. Undifferentiated SD56 hNSCs from passages between P9 and P13 were single cell dissociated using trypsin-EDTA in preparation for cell transplantation. One week after the stroke lesion, 2 µl of the hNSCs, at a concentration of 50,000 cell/µl, were stereotaxically transplanted into 4 sites within the lesioned striatum (n = 10) at the following coordinates: AP: +1.0 mm, ML: +3.2 mm, DV: −5.0; AP: +0.5 mm, ML: +3.0 mm, DV: −5.0; AP: −0.5 mm, ML: +3.0 mm, DV: −5.0; AP: −1.0 mm, ML: +3.5 mm, DV: −5.0 mm with the incisor bar set at 3.4 mm.

A computer-assisted image analysis system was performed using Stereo Investigator software (MicroBrightField, Inc.). The rostral and caudal limits of the reference volume were determined by first and last frontal sections containing grafted cells. The striatum and cortex were accurately outlined at low magnification (2.5× objective). The optical fractionator probe was selected to perform systematic sampling of the immunoreactive cell population distributed within the serial sections to estimate the population number in the volume of tissue. The counting frame of the optical fractionator was defined at 50×50 µm squares and the systematic sampling was performed by translating a grid with 200×200 µm squares onto the sections of interest using the Stereo Investigator software. The sample sites were systematically and automatically generated by the computer and examined using a 60× objective of a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 microscope. The counting frame displayed inclusion and exclusion lines and only immunoreactive cell bodies falling within the counting frame with no contact with the exclusion lines were counted. The cell dispersion was measured by counting the number of cells within 200 µm distance from the graft site. The number and distance in µm of cells dispersed beyond 200 µm was also measured. An average of 2,000 cells was counted per animal. Double labeling was determined using the confocal laser scanning microscope by random sampling of 100 or more cells per marker for each animal, scoring first for hNuc+, followed by DAPI+ nuclei and then the marker of choice.
