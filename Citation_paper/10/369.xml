        <p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) possess immune privileged properties and have the capacity to modulate immune activation. However, the mechanisms by which ESCs inhibit immune activation remain mostly unknown. We have previously shown that ESC-derived factors block dendritic cell maturation, thereby indirectly affecting T cell activation. Here, we show that ESC-derived factors also directly affect T cell activation. We provide the first demonstration that ESC-derived factors significantly down-regulated the expressions of IL-2 and IFN-γ, while markedly up-regulating the expression of IL-10, TGF-β, and Treg transcription factor Foxp3 in CD4+ CD25+ T cells. Furthermore, ESC-derived factors robustly suppressed T cell proliferation in response to the protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Western blot analysis indicated that ESC-derived factors prevented PKC-θ phosphorylation without influencing total PKC-θ levels. Moreover, IκB-α degradation was abrogated, confirming absence of PKC-θ activity. The impact of ESC-derived factors on PKC-θ activation appeared to be specific since other upstream T cell signaling components were not affected. In conclusion, ESCs appear to directly impact T cell activation and polarization by negatively regulating the PKC-θ pathway.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent stem cells and are able to differentiate into cells derived from all three germ layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Evans1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Thomson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Martin1">[3]</xref>. As such, they represent an important tool for the study of developmental biology and may provide new treatment for a variety of degenerative and genetic diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Carpenter1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-ItskovitzEldor1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Kaufman1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Levenberg1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Rambhatla1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Reubinoff1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, several groups have described that ESCs possess immune privileged properties. These properties allow ESCs to survive across both allogeneic and xenogeneic barriers without evoking immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Drukker1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Drukker2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Fandrich1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Koch1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Koch2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Li1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Magliocca1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Nussbaum1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Robertson1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Zhang1">[19]</xref>. The ability of ESCs to evade the immune system may be associated with their very low level of MHC I expression and no MHC II expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Drukker1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Drukker2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Fandrich1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Koch2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Li1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Magliocca1">[16]</xref>. In addition, ESCs lack expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and CD40 that may contribute to activating immune effector cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Drukker1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Drukker2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Fandrich1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Koch2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Li1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Magliocca1">[16]</xref>. However, differentiation of ESCs and treatment with inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ results in MHC I expression and immune recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Drukker2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Li1">[15]</xref>. Notably, these properties are found to be consistent in human, mouse and rat ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Drukker2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Fandrich1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Magliocca1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to evading the immune system, ESCs also have the capacity to actively modulate the immune system towards a tolerant state. In mixed lymphocyte reaction assays, ESCs suppress immune activation and proliferation in response to third party antigen presenting cells (APCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Koch2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Li1">[15]</xref>. It has become apparent that ESCs are able to influence APCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Drukker2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Koch2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Li1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Mohib1">[20]</xref>. Other studies have elucidated that ESCs are able to directly inhibit T cell and NK cell activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Drukker2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Swijnenburg1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-YachimovichCohen1">[22]</xref>. Significantly, rat ESCs were shown to provide immune protection to solid organ transplants across allogeneic barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Fandrich1">[12]</xref>. Therefore, ESCs possess powerful immune modulatory properties that not only facilitate their own survival in hostile immunological environments but also inhibit immune responses to third party APCs and provide protection to solid organ transplants.</p>
      <p>Harnessing these immune modulatory properties may yield important applications in autoimmune conditions, allergy and transplantation. However, ectopic tumor (teratoma) formation after using live ESCs in vivo is the most serious safety concern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Evans1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Thomson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Martin1">[3]</xref>. This has caused great apprehension in recent clinical trials when transplanted embryonic neuronal precursors gave rise to spinal cord and brain stem tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Amariglio1">[23]</xref>. As a result, use of live ESCs to promote immune tolerance and reduce the severity of aberrant or unwanted immune activation is currently limited by potential serious adverse effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Thomson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Berstine1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Kleinsmith1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Solter1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Stevens1">[27]</xref>. Therefore, alternative strategies that can circumvent tumor formation while retaining the immune modulatory properties of ESCs are needed.</p>
      <p>Recently, we have established that cytoplasmic lysates of both human and mouse ESCs retain the immune modulatory properties of live cells thereby averting the potential of teratoma formation. Our studies elucidated that these ESC-derived factors have the capacity to inhibit maturation of monocyte-derived DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Mohib1">[20]</xref>. ESC-derived factors prevented full maturation of DCs in response to TNF-α by decreasing surface expression of CD80, MHC II and CD83 molecules. Accordingly, DCs treated with ESC-derived factors retained greater phagocytic ability, secreted low levels of IL-12p40 and were poor stimulators of allogeneic T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Mohib1">[20]</xref>. Interestingly, we observed that inhibition of T cell activation by DCs could be enhanced further by addition of ESC-derived factors during the T cell activation assay, suggesting that ESC-derived factors may also affect T cell activation.</p>
      <p>Here we show that ESC-derived factors have the capacity to modulate T cell function directly. ESC-derived factors suppress the upregulation of T cell activation markers CD25, CD44, and CD69. They also inhibit IFN-γ production in T cells while promoting Foxp3 expression. In addition, we provide the first evidence that ESCs suppress PKC-θ activation without affecting upstream signaling components originating from CD3 and CD28 receptors. Moreover, ESC-derived factors work synergistically with very low dose of immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine (calcineurin inhibitor) to markedly suppress T cell proliferation in response to allo-antigen. Hence, ESC-derived factors may hold the potential to be used as a therapeutic, instead of live ESCs, in overcoming aberrant immune responses.</p>

        <title>ESC-derived factors directly inhibit T cell proliferation and activation</title>
        <p>In order to specifically determine the impact of ESCs on T cells, we stimulated mouse B6 splenocytes with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of increasing concentrations of ESC-conditioned media (ESC-CM) or control MEF cell-conditioned media. We found that ESC-CM inhibited T cell proliferation as indicated by reduced number of cell divisions reflected by lower degree of CFSE dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Moreover, increasing amounts of ESC-CM (from 50% in combination with RPMI media to 100% of ESC-CM) had a greater inhibitory effect on T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast, non-conditioned media and media conditioned by MEF cells did not have an effect on anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mediated T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). To further confirm that T cell inhibition was due to ESC-derived factors, we prepared and examined the cytoplasmic fraction of ESCs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref>) on T cell proliferation. Splenocytes were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of increasing concentrations of ESC-derived factors. Similar to ESC-CM, ESC-derived factors inhibited T cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). The inhibitory effect of ESC-derived factors was also examined in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays. Once again, ESC-derived factors were able to inhibit T cells proliferation in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032420.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Conversely, vehicle control did not affect T cell proliferation, while mouse muscle stem cell precursor-derived factors (C2C12 cell line) enhanced T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). Notably, human ESC-derived factors from H9 cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Drukker2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Koch2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Li1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Mohib1">[20]</xref> were also found to inhibit T cell proliferation in response to concanavalin A and PMA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032420.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

        <p>To elucidate whether T cell inhibition is due to activation-induced cell death (AICD) by ESC-derived factors, we examined T cell apoptosis and necrosis using Annexin V and 7AAD respectively. Splenocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and treated with ESC-derived factors were found to have the same number of CD3+ dead cells as control treatments 24 hours following stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, the number of dead T cells did not significantly increase after stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and treatment with ESC-derived factors for 72 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032420.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These data suggests that ESC-derived factors inhibit T cell proliferation without inducing T cell death following activation.</p>

        <title>ESC-derived factors skew T cells responses by preventing PKC-θ phosphorylation</title>
        <p>The mechanisms underlying ESC-mediated T cell inhibition remain poorly understood. Recently, Yachimovich-Cohen et al. described that intact human ESCs are able to directly inhibit T cell proliferation through the expression of the enzyme arginase-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-YachimovichCohen1">[22]</xref>. However, in our assays we supplement the cytoplasmic lysates with excess amounts of L-arginine to prevent protein-protein aggregation and dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Reddy1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Wang1">[33]</xref>. It is very likely that ESCs may have multiple properties that affect T cell activation and proliferation. To delineate alternate mechanisms, we stimulated splenocytes with various mitogens that activate specific signaling pathways in T cells. Interestingly, we found that ESC-derived factors could specifically inhibit phorbol-1-3-merystate (PMA) mediated proliferation of splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g006">Figure 6a</xref>). Similarly, human ESC-derived factors were able to inhibit PMA-mediated proliferation of healthy donor T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032420.s002">Figure S2</xref>). It is well known that PMA is a specific activator of protein kinase C-theta (PKC-θ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Touraine1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Isakov1">[35]</xref> Therefore, ESC-derived factors may inhibit proper T cell activation and proliferation by suppressing PKC-θ activation.</p>

        <p>To directly establish the impact of ESCs on PKC-θ, splenocytes were stimulated with PMA in the presence and absence of ESC-derived factors. Subsequently, western blot assays were carried out to assess PKC-θ phosphorylation at Threonine-538 (Thre-538) that has been shown to be reflective of its activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Passalacqua1">[36]</xref>. Splenocytes treated with ESC-derived factors at various time points had very little or no phosphorylation of PKC-θ whereas control splenocytes showed strong phosporylation in response to PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g006">Figure 6b</xref>). Notably, ESC-derived factors did not have an effect on total PKC-θ levels as they remained constant at all time points similar to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g006">Figure 6b</xref>). To determine whether the absence of phosphorylation at Thr-538 was indeed reflective of PKC-θ activity we examined down stream targets of the kinase. PKC-θ is known to form a complex with CARMA-1, Bcl-10 and MALT-1 to induce NFκB translocation to the nucleus by causing degradation of IκB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Wang2">[37]</xref>. As a result we examined IκB-α degradation in purified T cells that had been activated with PMA. Consistent with above results, we found that IκB-α was not or only slightly degraded in cells that were treated with ESC-derived factors whereas IκB-α was visibly degraded in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g006">Figure 6c</xref>). Accordingly, cells treated with ESC-derived factors had decreased levels of NFκB translocated to the nucleus in comparison to those treated with vehicle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032420.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

        <title>ESC-derived factors specifically inhibit PKC-θ activation without affecting upstream T cell signaling</title>
        <p>Although ESC-derived factors have the capacity to inhibit PMA mediated PKC-θ activation, it is unclear whether they also affect other signaling components emanating from the TCR and CD28. It is known that PKC-θ activation is mediated by signaling molecules PLC-γ and PI3K originating from the TCR and CD28, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-SanchezLockhart1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Weiss1">[39]</xref>.

Splenocytes were pre-treated overnight with ESC-derived factors and stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for the indicated time periods. Subsequently, phosphorylation of PLC-γ, AKT (used as a surrogate marker for PI3K) and PKC-θ were examined. Consistent with the data obtained with PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we found that splenocytes treated with ESC-derived factors and activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 had little or no phosphorylation of PKC-θ at all time points, whereas phosphorylation was detected in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032420-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

Here we have further demonstrated that ESCs have the capacity to directly inhibit T cell proliferation and activation. Moreover, we have demonstrated for the first time that one of the mechanisms by which ESCs modulate the immune system occurs through suppression of PKC-θ phosphorylation. In addition, we have found that ESC-derived factors skew T helper responses from Th1 towards a regulatory T cell phenotype by decreasing the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ and increasing production of TGF-beta and Foxp3. We also determined that ESC-derived factors were able to specifically inhibit PKC-θ phosphorylation without affecting upstream T cell signaling components derived from both CD3 and CD28, such as PLC-γ and PI3K (known activators of PKC-θ).</p>
      <p>The role of PKC-θ and its contribution to T cell function and phenotype has been expanded by several important findings. Zanin-Zhorov's et al. have recently elucidated that PKC-θ is recruited much less in T regulatory cells compared to effecter T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-ZaninZhorov1">[42]</xref>. They established that PKC-θ has a negative impact on T regulatory cells rendering them less effective in suppressing effecter T cell function. Moreover, inhibition of PKC-θ was shown to enhance T regulatory potency in suppressing effecter T cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-ZaninZhorov1">[42]</xref>. Meanwhile, Valenzuela et al. have found that PKC-θ is required for allo-antigen responses in a GVHD model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Valenzuela1">[43]</xref>. Whereas wild type T cells induced severe GVHD resulting in a lethal outcome for all mice, PKC-θ-KO T cells induced very mild or no GVHD leading to the survival of most transplanted mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Valenzuela1">[43]</xref>. Finally, several groups have established that in the absence of PKC-θ activation, an anergic genetic program is initiated. This anergic state is induced due to prolonged calcium flux leading to persistent activation and translocation of NFAT to the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Macian1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Heissmeyer1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Macian2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-SotoNieves1">[47]</xref> and an enhanced expression of E3 ubiquitin ligases that negatively regulate T cell signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Kriegel1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Jeon1">[49]</xref>, in the absence of other transcription factor such as NFκB and AP-1. Our current results expand on the previous findings and provide the first connection between ESC immune modulation and PKC-θ inhibition. We believe that the inhibition of PKC-θ by ESC-derived factors will have a major impact in modulating T cell responses.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms underlying ESC-mediated immune modulation remain mostly unknown. Previous studies have shown possible involvement of TGF-β in mouse ESCs while FasL has been implicated in rat ESC immune modulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Fandrich1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Koch1">[13]</xref>. In our studies we treated ESC-derived factors with neutralizing antibodies against TGF-β in both T cell proliferation and in Foxp3 induction assays. We did not find a noticeable increase in T cell proliferation and a reduction in the number of Foxp3+ T cells in response to ESC-derived factors after neutralizing TGF-β (data not shown). Consistent with these results, Robertson et al. examined 87 immunologically relevant genes in mouse ESC and found that IL-10, TGF-β1, arginase-1, arginase-2 and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase did not contribute to their immune privilege <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Robertson1">[18]</xref>. Studies carried with human ESCs have shown that arginase-1 and HLA-G may play a role in ESC-mediated immune modulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-YachimovichCohen1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032420-Verloes1">[41]</xref>. Based on these reports, it has become apparent that ESC-mediated immune modulation may occur through a number of different factors and mechanisms. Given the importance of ESCs in PKC-θ activation, our current focus has been to identify a specific factor that mediates such an effect.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>ESC-derived factors have the capacity to modulate T cell responses directly. In the presence of ESC-derived factors T cell proliferation is hindered and the expression of activation markers decreased. Moreover, ESC-derived factors favour a T regulatory phenotype over a Th1 response, leading to an increase in CD4+, CD25+ Foxp3+ cells and a decrease in IFN-γproduction. Such a modulation in T cell responses may be achieved by the ability of ESCs that specifically inhibit PKC-θ phosphorylation and its subsequent activity.</p>

        <title>Mouse ESC extraction</title>
        <p>Mouse ES lines D3, J1 and B6 were grown on mitomycin- treated MEF cells in Dulbecco's modified eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 4.0 mM L-glutamine, 1.0% non-essential amino acids, 0.10 µM 2-ME, 1.0×10<sup>2</sup> units of Penicillin, 1.0×10<sup>2</sup> units of Streptomycin and 15% FBS (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington ON) supplemented with 1.0×10<sup>3</sup> units/mL of LIF (Millipore Canada Ltd., Etobicoke ON) and incubated at 37°C with 5.0% CO<sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, the cells were cultured on 0.10% gelatin coated plates for two passages in order to eliminate MEF cells. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were harvested by treatment with trypsin (Invitrogen Inc.) and dissociated to obtain a single cell suspension. Subsequently, ESCs were washed twice with ice cold PBS and centrifuged at 400 g for 6 minutes at 4°C. After washing, the cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer. (50 mM HEPES, 50 mNaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, 1.0 mM DTT, 50 mM L-arginine, pH 8.2). The lysis buffer was supplemented with pan protease inhibitors at 1∶100 (4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), pepstatinA, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) dissolved in DMSO, Sigma Aldrich Canada Ltd, Oakvile ON). At this point the cells were incubated for 30 minutes on ice and sonicated until complete lysis of the cells was achieved. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 15000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C to remove cell membrane, mitochondrial and nuclear fractions. The soluble cell free fraction was separated from the insoluble fraction and both stored at −80°C. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Mississauga ON).</p>

        <title>Western blot</title>
        <p>Two million splenocytes were-pretreated with 0.23 mg/ml of ESC-derived factors or vehicle control overnight in 0.50 ml of RPMI medium in 48 well plates. The next day, cells were stimulated with either 50 ng/ml of PMA or anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for the indicated periods. Cells were harvested and lysed immediately in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 5.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.0% NP-40, 1.0 mM DTT, 5.0% glycerol, [pH 7.5]) and an equivalent volume of Laemmli Sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd.) was added to the samples. Samples were boiled for 5 minutes and ran on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% powder milk (w/v) or 5% BSA (w/v) in TBS-T for 1 hour. Membranes were probed with rabbit anti-mouse phospho-PKC-θ (Thre538) and total PKC-θ antibodies at 1∶500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Santa Cruz, CA) overnight. Subsequently, membranes were washed 3 times with TBS-T for 15 minutes and were probed with goat anti-rabbit secondary HRP conjugated antibody. Again, membranes were washed 3 times with TBS-T. At this point, the bands were visualized with Amersham ECL Plus western blot detection systems (GE Healthcare Biosciences Corp. Piscataway, NJ). A similar procedure was carried out for pAKT (1∶3000), IκB-α (1∶500) and pPLC-γ (1∶1000) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Danvers, MA).</p>
