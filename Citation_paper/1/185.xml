<abstract>
<p>For most sample types, the automation of RNA and DNA sample preparation workflows enables high throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation. Greater adoption of small RNA (sRNA) sequencing has been hindered by high sample input requirements and inherent ligation side products formed during library preparation. These side products, known as adapter dimer, are very similar in size to the tagged library. Most sRNA library preparation strategies thus employ a gel purification step to isolate tagged library from adapter dimer contaminants. At very low sample inputs, adapter dimer side products dominate the reaction and limit the sensitivity of this technique. Here we address the need for improved specificity of sRNA library preparation workflows with a novel library preparation approach that uses modified adapters to suppress adapter dimer formation. This workflow allows for lower sample inputs and elimination of the gel purification step, which in turn allows for an automatable sRNA library preparation protocol.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>NGS is a powerful tool that yields vast amounts of sequence data and allows the analysis of many samples in parallel. Correlation with genetic databases allows identification of novel biomarkers for better diagnosis and more personalized treatment. Next-generation sequencing can be used to examine DNA or RNA for whole genome or transcriptome analysis, respectively. In addition, various techniques such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Cross-linking Immunoprecipitation (ClIP), and RNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (RIP-Seq) isolate protein/nucleic acid complexes and sequencing of the partitioned nucleic acids allows cataloging of molecular interactions. Transcriptome analysis can be further divided into long coding RNA (messenger RNA or mRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), or small RNA (sRNA). sRNA are &lt; 500 nucleotides (nt) and consist of a variety of sRNA species including piwi interacting RNA (piRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), Y RNA, transfer RNA (tRNA), and mircroRNA (miRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref003">3</xref>]. miRNA are a well-studied class of 19–23 nt sRNAs which play a major role in gene regulation. With the discovery of circulating nucleic acids in blood samples, miRNA expression analysis in plasma or exosomes are becoming increasingly important for biomarker discovery in the diagnostics field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref004">4</xref>]. While blood samples are less invasive to the patient than tissue biopsies, they contain very low levels of circulating RNA and are thus difficult to analyze. Therefore a highly sensitive method for sRNA analysis is crucial.</p>
<p>Long RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq library preparation techniques have matured quickly and allow PCR free library preparation with low sample inputs and automated protocols. Inherent obstacles for small RNA-Seq (sRNA-Seq) library preparation have thus far limited sequencing of lower RNA inputs and have prevented sRNA-Seq automation. In a traditional sRNA library preparation, oligonucleotides called adapters are ligated onto both the 5΄ and 3΄ ends of the small RNA targets (library) to form a tagged library pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). These adapters provide a universal sequence used for downstream amplification of tagged libraries. The first ligation step requires a pre-adenylated 3΄ adapter and an RNA ligase lacking the ATP binding domain, which is specific for ligation between the adenylate to the 3΄ hydroxyl of an RNA or library insert. This feature of the RNA ligase prevents RNA library inserts from circularizing and self-ligating during this step. Additionally, the 3΄ adapter is blocked on its 3΄ end to prevent self-concatemerization. The second ligation step uses an RNA 5΄ adapter and an ATP dependent RNA ligase. The 5΄ adapter is not phosphorylated on the 5΄ end which prevents self-concatemerization, but during this second ligation step an unwanted side reaction of adapter dimer formation can occur when the 5΄ adapter ligates directly to any excess 3΄ adapter that has not already ligated to an RNA insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Since sRNA insert sizes are very short (~22 nt), the tagged library product is very similar in size to the undesired adapter dimer side product, a difference of approximately 20 nucleotides. This size similarity makes these two PCR products difficult to separate during purification so, a gel extraction step is required to isolate the tagged library away from adapter dimer. Furthermore, because the adapter dimer is smaller than the tagged library, its preferential amplification tends to dominate the downstream PCR reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref005">5</xref>]. This problem is exacerbated at lower RNA inputs, where there is a very limited amount of library to tag but still substantial adapter dimer present. Using current commercially available kits at low inputs, tagged library becomes minimized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) while adapter dimer consumes the majority of the sequencing reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s001">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Several methods have been developed to curtail adapter dimer formation. One method requires early inclusion of the reverse transcription (RT) primer, which is complementary to the 3΄ adapter. Directly after the first ligation step, the RT primer is added to create a double stranded product which cannot be ligated by T4 RNA Ligase 1 to the 5΄ adapter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref006">6</xref>]. Other methods employ multiple purification steps to size select away excess adapters from the reaction to isolate desired products during the workflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref007">7</xref>]. An alternative strategy uses a non-ligation approach that entails 3΄ A-tailing of the library and a 5΄ template switching mechanism to prepare library ends for downstream RT and PCR. Elimination of the ligation steps precludes the formation of adapter dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Gel purification is a common and often necessary size selection procedure as a final step in library preparation. However, even with a laborious gel purification step that can substantially reduce the amount of adapter dimer, its presence is not completely eliminated. Minimal amounts of adapter dimer contamination will be loaded onto the flow cell along with the tagged library and again preferentially amplify to form clusters and take up valuable sequencing reads that could otherwise be occupied by tagged library. Reproducibility of gel extractions can vary tremendously in percent recovery of sample and success largely depends on the technician performing the procedure. Furthermore, with low product recovery it is possible to lose RNA sequences that have low expression levels, leading to false negative data. Gel purification significantly limits the ability to automate library preparation for sRNA thus limiting high throughput experiments. The two most common commercially available kits, TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) and NEBNext Small RNA Library Prep Set (New England Biolabs), recommend 100 ng total RNA input as the lowest sample amount achievable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref008">8</xref>]. Below 100 ng of total RNA input, it becomes challenging to produce high quality sequencing data, which hinders sequencing of low input samples such as plasma or urine.</p>
<p>We have developed a novel small RNA library preparation method which uses chemically modified adapters to prevent adapter dimer formation by blocking ligation of the 5΄ and 3΄ adapters to one another, while allowing for efficient tagging of adapters onto the small RNA library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Chemical modifications can be introduced onto oligonucleotides to enhance enzymatic reactions or to prevent specific reactions from occurring until desired. These chemical modifications can be placed on the sugar, the base, or the inter-nucleotide phosphate linkages. In the present study, we specifically investigate the ligation step of the library preparation workflow since that is the source of adapter dimer formation. We screened 256 different combinations of modifications to determine how they influenced ligase function. Our results show that certain combinations of modifications completely inhibit ligation activity, while some enhance ligation efficiency, and yet others have a variable effect. The combination of one modification near the ligation junction on the 3΄ adapter and a different modification on the 5΄ adapter proved to suppress adapter dimer formation while allowing for adapter tagging of the sRNA library to occur. We also reasoned that when two chemical modifications were in close proximity (as they would be in the adapter dimer) they would prevent reverse transcriptase (RT) read-through during the cDNA synthesis step. In contrast when the two chemical modifications were separated by a library insert (tagged library), they would permit RT read-through. Thus adapter dimer would be limited at both the ligation and cDNA synthesis steps. With the suppression of adapter dimer, a gel purification step is no longer required and can be replaced with a two-step automatable bead based size selection, allowing for the sample to be directly loaded onto a sequencer. sRNA library preparation using modified adapters extends the current limits of detection (100 ng) to ultra-low inputs or single cell quantities (10 pg) of total RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref005">5</xref>]. Here we demonstrate that rendering adapter dimer formation negligible is the key to overcoming a major challenge for sRNA library preparation.</p>

<title>Library multiplexing and pooling</title>
<p>In most cases, experiments were planned to contain 24 samples which would be barcoded, pooled equally, and then loaded onto one lane of a flow cell. Libraries were prepared individually and barcoded with reverse primers during the PCR step which contained Illumina compatible indices #1–24. Individual library concentrations were determined by running a high sensitivity Bioanalyzer chip followed by smear analysis. Since all samples were to occupy a similar amount of space on the flow cell, we divided the final concentration of our pooled mixture, 10 nM for example, by 24 to determine that each samples final concentration should equal 0.416 nM. We then calculated the volume of each sample that would be required to meet this number based on the individual concentration. Each of the 24 samples was pooled accordingly to occupy equal space on a single lane of a flow cell.</p>

<title>Chemically modified adapters suppress adapter dimer</title>
<p>Adapter chemical modifications screened consisted of either sugar modifications at the n, n-1, or n-2 nucleotide sugars or backbone modifications at the n, n-1, or n-2 inter-nucleotide phosphate linkages. Sugar modifications included 2'-fluoro (F), 2'-O-methyl (OMe), and 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinonucleic acid (FANA). Backbone modifications included phosphorothioate (Ps) and methylphosphonate (MP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). While there were only 5 modifications, there were three different positions near the ligation junction so each modification would yield 2–3 adapters to test. In some cases, two modifications were used on the same adapter. We designed matrices that combined one of the modified 3' adapters with each of the modified 5' adapters and vice versa producing 256 combinations of modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s007">S1 Table</xref>).These combinations of modifications were interrogated with the following criteria in mind: 1) ability to ligate to an unmodified RNA library; 2) inhibition of 5΄ and 3΄ adapter ligation to prevent adapter dimer; and 3) ability of reverse transcriptase enzymes to read through modifications, when separated by an RNA insert, to form an unmodified cDNA for downstream PCR.</p>
<p>The effect of modifications on ligation was initially determined by assessing the yield of ligation reactions using one modified adapter, one unmodified adapter, and T4 RNA Ligase 1. These yields were compared to ligations which used an unmodified version of both the adapters. All modified 3΄ adapters produced a ligation product when ligated to an unmodified RNA oligonucleotide (5΄ Adapter) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Most modifications did not reduce ligation yields when compared to unmodified with the exception of the MP (n-1) modification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). There was more variability in yields with modifications on the 5΄ adapter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Most modified 5΄ adapters ligated efficiently to another unmodified oligonucleotide (3΄ Adapter Luo) with the exception of MP modifications and one of the OMe modifications, all of which had reduced yields (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). An MP at the first inter-nucleotide linkage on the 5´ adapter was the only modification that failed to produce a detectable product at the ligation step. Later, ligation efficiency experiments were repeated with a different 3΄ adapter (Unmodified 3΄ adapter) and a synthetic Let7d RNA oligonucleotide for the library insert. Ligation yields varied slightly with new sequences, however overall patterns remained consistent (data not shown).</p>
<p>Next, ligation reactions were performed with T4 RNA ligase 1 in the absence of target library RNA with combinations of modified 5΄ adapters and modified 3΄ adapters to discern which pairs had reduced ligation yields, a measure of prevention of adapter dimer formation. It was determined early on that there was only one modified 3΄ adapter (MP at the n-1 position) that worked to prevent ligation when paired with other modified 5΄ adapters (data not shown). All other modifications when placed on the 3΄ adapter exhibited very little effect to suppress ligation. We therefore focused on modified 3΄ adapter MP (n-1) moving forward. Several combinations with various modifications on the 5΄ adapter reduced adapter dimer formation (FANA (n-1), PS (n)) and a few seemed to completely inhibit it (2΄Ome (n), 2΄Ome (n-2), MP (n), MP (n-1)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g002">Fig 2</xref>). From this, a smaller group of promising modified adapter combinations was tested in sequential ligation steps to assess yield of tagged library and adapter dimer. In general, results showed that modified adapters which suppressed adapter dimer produced lower yields for tagged libraries than their unmodified versions (data not shown) and therefore key components in the ligation workflow were further optimized.</p>

<p>Several aspects of the library preparation workflow were evaluated to determine if they would increase library ligation yield while maintaining specificity. Optimizations included adapter concentration, incubation temperatures and times, ligation buffers, ATP concentration, polyethylene glycol (PEG) percentage, and ligase enzymes. There were several critical components which improved the overall ligation yield significantly. We determined that the most critical ingredient for increased ligation yields was PEG 8000. Optimal PEG concentration of 18.75% allowed for a significant increase in yield for the 3´ adapter ligation step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). A 4-fold excess of 5΄ adapter concentration over the 3΄ adapter also increased yields (data not shown). Initially we compared several T4 RNA Ligase enzymes in the first ligation step: T4 RNA Ligase 1 and several truncated T4 RNA Ligase 2 derivatives. T4 RNA Ligase 1 is an ATP dependent single stranded RNA ligase which can ligate single stranded RNA or DNA oligonucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref003">3</xref>]. While T4 RNA Ligase 1 is typically only used in the second ligation step, we found that this enzyme could also be used in the first ligation step with an adenylated oligonucleotide in the absence of ATP. The truncation derivatives of T4 RNA Ligase 2 allow for ATP independent ligation on single stranded RNA or RNA/DNA hybrids. The truncation derivatives tested include T4 RNA Ligase 2, truncated (T42t); T4 RNA Ligase 2, truncated K227Q; and T4 RNA Ligase 2, truncated KQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref028">28</xref>]. Preliminary results indicated that K227Q offered no advantage for ligation yield or specificity (data not shown) so this enzyme was excluded early on. In a fully optimized workflow the ligation yields between three of the enzymes were comparable, however the use of KQ resulted in a more specific ligation product, so this ligase was used in subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). After all ligation components were optimized, the modified adapters still produced slightly lower yields at the ligation step than the unmodified adapters, however, due to the reduction in adapter dimer formation, downstream library yields after PCR were increased.</p>

<p>Next, a full library prep workflow including the reverse transcription (RT) and PCR step was performed with various promising modified adapter combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Results indicated that reverse transcription was possible with most modifications when an insert RNA was present between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g004">Fig 4</xref>) but specific yields of solely the RT step for all modifications were not assessed. Modified adapter combinations which provided the highest library yield with the lowest amount of adapter dimer (MP (n-1) on the 3´ adapter paired with PS (n), MP (n-1), 2´OMe (n), or 2´OMe (n-2) on the 5´ adpater) were further investigated for performance at lower levels of RNA input. Not surprisingly, the MP (n) modification on the 5´ adapter resulted in low library yield as we had previously observed undetectable ligation product when tested with an unmodified oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Preliminary studies with an RNA input of 1000 ng of total brain RNA revealed almost complete suppression of adapter dimer for both the OMe (n) and the OMe (n-2) modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g005">Fig 5</xref>). However when using ten-fold lower total RNA input (100ng), adapter dimer was no longer suppressed by the OMe (n-2) modification while the OMe (n) modification continued to show suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

The PS modification (combination 3) displayed increased library yield by gel, while producing just a slight amount of adapter dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). However the data from the NGS run had significantly more adapter dimer reads than the other modified adapters but a statistically comparable amount of filtered (mappable) reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Ultimately this modification did not offer any downstream advantage by having more library yield to begin with. This further proves that even small levels of adapter dimer present in the reaction can be exacerbated when clustering on the flow cell. The other two combinations of adapters preformed comparably but further experimentation revealed more consistent results for combination 1: MP at the n-1 position on the 3΄ adapter and an OMe modification on the n position of the 5΄ adapter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This combination of modified adapters is now referred to as CleanTag. The final CleanTag adapters with modifications are the Illumina compatible CleanTag 3΄ adapter [<monospace>5΄-(rApp)T(MP)GG AAT TCT CGG GTG CCA AGG (ddC)- 3΄</monospace>] and the Illumina compatible CleanTag 5΄ adapter [<monospace>5΄- GUU CAG AGU UCU ACA GUC CGA CGA UC(OMe)-3΄</monospace>].</p>

<p>Finally, we investigated whether these modifications, when in close proximity without an RNA insert (adapter dimer), would inhibit the cDNA synthesis step. This in turn would further help to suppress any residual adapter dimer if formed at the ligation step. The ability to reverse transcribe through a single MP and a single OMe modification was evident since a product was formed from a tagged library but there was no specific investigation into whether these modifications slowed down cDNA synthesis. To test the effect of the modifications on reverse transcription for the CleanTag modifications, we used a FAM labeled RT primer to track cDNA synthesis yield on various adapter dimer versions: A) unmodified; B) 3΄ adapter modified only; C) 5΄ adapter modified only; and D) both 3΄ and 5΄ modified adapters. At very high concentrations and with nothing else in the reaction to compete with, we were able to force ligation of the modified adapters to one another and conduct the downstream RT reaction. Reading through two modifications in close proximity to each other proved challenging for the reverse transcriptase enzyme as cDNA synthesis was decreased by 70% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). This gave a clear indication that any residual ligated adapter dimer would further be suppressed during the RT step when using modified adapters.</p>
<p>We then introduced our top modifications onto another set of adapter sequences but interestingly, we determined that adapter dimer suppression was not as dramatic as when using the CleanTag adapter sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). No further investigation was done to determine why the modifications only worked within specific adapter sequences.</p>

<title>Effect of modifications on the tagged library population</title>
<p>In order to determine if the chemical modifications introduced any significant changes in miRNA detection, we compared sequencing results between unmodified and modified adapters within our optimized workflow. We found that a similar population of miRNA was tagged by unmodified adapters compared to those tagged by the modified adapters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Though there are slight differences between the two libraries, this provided evidence that within our workflow the modifications themselves were not significantly skewing the tagged miRNA population. Furthermore, a comparison across multiple commercial kits showed that each kit tags specific miRNA that the other kits do not, however, the majority (728 miRNA) of the tagged miRNA population were similar amongst all three kits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>

<title>Lower inputs</title>
<p>With strong suppression of adapter dimer using CleanTag modifications in the library preparation workflow, sequencing from much lower RNA inputs is now possible. Samples using a range of human total brain RNA inputs were sequenced to determine the limit of detection using the modified adapters. Adapters were diluted to optimized concentrations for each amount of total RNA input and PCR cycles were increased accordingly (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and Methods</xref>, Sample Preparation Section). Samples prepared with modified adapters were compared to the TruSeq small RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). The TruSeq kit recommends a minimum of 1000 ng RNA input in combination with a gel purification step after library preparation; however, we also tested this kit at lower RNA inputs. When analyzing these two workflows at 100 ng total RNA input using a gel purification step, mapped reads and adapter dimer reads were statistically comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). However, at 10 ng total RNA input, the samples prepared with CleanTag adapters yielded significantly more mapped reads and significantly less adapter dimer than the TruSeq kit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Even with a tedious gel purification step, the TruSeq samples lost 48% of their reads to adapter dimer at 10 ng compared to less than 1% when using modified adapters. With 1 nanogram total RNA input using CleanTag adapters, we found less than 1% of reads lost to adapter dimer while sustaining similar levels of mappable reads compared to the higher inputs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s008">S2 Table</xref>). This demonstrates that lower RNA inputs can now achieve quality sequencing results without losing copious reads to adapter dimer. Furthermore, we have tested a number of total RNAs extracted from various cell lines that vary in the amount of miRNA they contain to ensure the protocol is robust for many sample types and samples with low abundance of miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Gel-free clean up for automated library prep</title>
<p>In addition to allowing for lower RNA inputs, removal of the adapter dimer also eliminates the need for the gel purification step. This in turn facilitates automation of the small RNA library prep process. A two-step AMPure XP bead-based purification protocol was optimized to size select product between 100–200 nucleotides. Library preparation with the CleanTag workflow results in limited adapter dimer but also a decrease in side products. This leads to a cleaner bead purified sample downstream, especially when compared to TruSeq Small RNA Library Prep Kit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g010">Fig 10</xref>). While bead-based purification does not completely isolate the library of interest, CleanTag produces a trace where the miRNA library is the major peak or product while everything else remains at background level. Despite the fact that other products are also loaded onto the flow cell, NGS data revealed no loss in total number of miRNA reads from bead purified libraries when compared to a gel purified sample at 100-fold higher input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g011">Fig 11</xref>). The number of miRNA identified was also comparable between purification methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s008">S2 Table</xref>). In addition, we did a thorough investigation into individual peaks which appear on a Bioanalyzer trace after bead-based purification to determine their origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s006">S1 File</xref>). The ability for automation with bead-based protocols enables higher throughput sequencing for faster data acquisition in both research and diagnostic settings.</p>

<title>Single cell inputs</title>
<p>We further pushed the limit of detection for small RNA library prep using modified adapters down to 100 and 10 pg of human brain total RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g012">Fig 12A and 12B</xref>). A single cell has approximately 10 pg total RNA. Adapter dilutions and PCR cycles were adjusted accordingly for each input amount. While a small amount of adapter dimer is now evident at these ultra low input levels there is still an adequate amount of library to sequence when previously these amounts of RNA inputs gave no detectable library. In order to extract the best quality sequencing results from these ultra low inputs, all replicates of the 100 and 10 pg samples (three samples each) were pooled and gel purified to reduce any low levels of adapter dimer product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g012">Fig 12C</xref>). Higher input samples (1000 and 1 ng) were prepared using a bead-based purification for comparison to ultra low inputs at 100 and 10 pg which were prepared using gel purification. Each input group consisted of three replicates and libraries were pooled to generate similar amounts of reads across samples. The total number of reads and downstream filtered reads (3΄ adapter trimmed and quality filtered) were comparable across all sample inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g013">Fig 13A</xref>). The reads lost to adapter dimer were less than 3% even at 10 pg input. Filtered reads were mapped to miRbase mature miRNA database and piRNA database using Galaxy to generate individual read counts per sample. All filtered reads that were not mapped to miRbase or piRNA database were considered “other small RNA” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g013">Fig 13B</xref>). The percentage of small RNA types (miRNA, piRNA, other) were later confirmed by analysis with BaseSpace (Illumina) which further categorized the other small RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167009.g014">Fig 14</xref>). At 1000 and 1 ng of RNA input, 46% and 40% of the reads respectively were attributed to miRNA, a trend we observed initially where mapping quality was fairly consistent amongst inputs. At the 100 and 10 pg levels, mapped miRNA reads fall to 13% and 7%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s009">S3 Table</xref>). A closer analysis of the tagged miRNAs in each sample revealed that lower input samples maintain reads of highly expressed miRNA in brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s010">S4 Table</xref>). Read counts for top 40 expressed miRNA contain previously validated miRNA enriched in brain including miR-9, miR-128, and Let 7 family members, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref032">32</xref>] while lower abundance miRNA tend to drop out at lower inputs of 100 and 10 pg. Another trend that was observed with ultra low inputs is that 50% of the reads were now dominated by “other” small RNA of which the majority consisted of tRNA. It is unclear why these species begin to dominate the workflow as the RNA input drops and further investigation is ongoing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec024">
<title>Chemically modified adapters suppress adapter dimer</title>
<p>Herein we have demonstrated the use of oligonucleotide modifications to specifically inhibit the ligation of the 5΄ adapter to the 3΄ adapter thereby significantly reducing adapter dimer formation and improving the specificity of small RNA library preparation workflows. The specific interaction of a 2΄ OMethyl (OMe) and a methyl phosphonate (MP) modification on the adapters proved to be one of few combinations which inhibited ligation and furthermore repressed RT read through and downstream amplification. While certain other modifications initially appeared to suppress ligation, after RT-PCR, the adapter dimer ligation product could be detected and was an indication that not all modifications that suppressed ligation had the added benefit of preventing RT read through. We therefore chose to optimize the workflow around the top combination of modified adapters that suppressed adapter dimer to the greatest extent after both the ligation and reverse transcription-PCR steps. Although initial ligation yields using modified adapters were slightly lower than unmodified adapters, upon workflow optimization the benefit of reduced adapter dimer seemed to help promote RT and PCR amplification of the tagged library and diminish any lower yield effects brought on by the modifications during ligation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the adapter dimer suppression effect seen with our top modifications seems to depend largely on the sequence of the adapters. These modifications were later tested on several other sets of adapter sequences (data from one example shown) but the same level of adapter dimer suppression was not achieved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167009.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Simply changing the primary sequence of either of the adapters results in higher yields of adapter dimer formation which indicates there may be an underlying sequence effect. While the reason for this remains unclear, we speculate secondary structure and folding within the ligase active domain may be part of the cause. The modifications on the adapters are not the sole reason for significant reduction of dimer. The workflow for using the modified adapters was optimized to improve yield and specificity of small RNA library formation. Initially library yields were lower in comparison to unmodified adapters. Extensive testing of individual components, reagents, and incubation times were investigated thoroughly. PEG concentration was determined to be one of the critical components that when optimized had a significant effect on library yield. Recovery of ligation yield through increased PEG levels has been previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref028">28</xref>]. PEG is thought to act as a molecular crowding reagent that increases the local concentrations of adapter and library. Furthermore, the modified adapters cannot be easily substituted into other workflows or commercially available kits. It is therefore a combination of the modified adapters and optimized conditions which act to prevent adapter dimer formation.</p>

<sec id="sec025">
<title>Modifications do not alter tagged library population</title>
<p>It is known that RNA ligases have specific preferences for their substrates, thus introducing a level of bias into the small RNA library preparation workflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref003">3</xref>]. It is clear that many current library preparation protocols may not cover all small RNA species due to inherent secondary structures of miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref034">34</xref>]. We investigated whether the chemically modified adapters would significantly alter miRNA signatures when compared to unmodified adapters in the same workflow. Given that the modifications did not tag a different population of miRNA compared to unmodified adapters further investigation was not done.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec026">
<title>Lower inputs</title>
<p>A limitation of current small RNA library preparation is high input requirements. Low RNA inputs often result in high adapter dimer yield as this product is preferentially formed and amplified. This makes investigation of small RNAs from precious biological samples difficult as they often give low RNA yield. We have demonstrated that small RNA sequencing from as low as 1 ng total RNA input is made possible due to suppressed adapter dimer. We were unable to produce sufficient library at such low inputs using commercially available kits, as adapter dimer was the dominant product, which emphasizes the importance of dimer suppression, even when gel purification is used. At 1 ng total RNA input we obtained quality sequencing data without significant loss of miRNA reads. At these input levels more limiting biological samples can be easily interrogated. Lower RNA inputs will expand the small RNA-Seq field in several ways. Small RNA from biofluids (plasma, serum, urine, saliva), FACS cells, exosomes, Clip-Seq, and FFPE samples can more easily be analyzed by next-generation sequencing with higher quality sequencing data. Examples of sRNA library preparation with CleanTag and these challenging sample types are presented elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>We found that moving to lower RNA input levels also required the dilution of the adapter input in order to maintain a reduction in adapter dimer formation. Very low amounts of adapter were needed to form tagged libraries at low RNA inputs. With the reduction in RNA input, an increase in number of PCR cycles was needed to generate enough copies of tagged library for downstream sequencing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec027">
<title>Gel-free clean up for automated library preparation</title>
<p>Automated high throughput sample preparation that is common for DNA-Seq or RNA-Seq has not yet been implemented for small RNA sequencing. This is largely due to the post library preparation gel clean up needed to eliminate adapter dimer. With the suppression of adapter dimer formation an automatable bead-based purification method can replace manual gel extractions. In general our workflow using modified adapters results in cleaner small RNA libraries with less side products as compared to other commercial kits. Therefore bead purification of CleanTag libraries is a sufficient clean up method for sequencing at most routine RNA inputs. While bead purified samples contain a variety of tagged species which can also be sequenced, we showed that this did not significantly detract from the number of mappable miRNA reads in the sample. Sequencing data generated from bead purified samples produced comparable number of miRNA reads to that of gel purified samples despite the presence of additional tagged species. With the elimination of adapter dimer there is more functional space on the flow cell for sequencing other important small RNA targets in addition to miRNA. miRNA are often still the dominant and shortest product in the reaction so these will preferentially amplify over any other larger molecular weight species, thus maintaining number of mappable reads for this important small RNA category.</p>
<p>While maintaining miRNA information, bead-based methods also offers the ability to analyze all types of sRNA tagged in a library ranging in size from 100 to 200 nt, not just a specific type or length of sRNA such as miRNA that has been size selected from a gel. Different cell types or bodily fluids may contain different RNA signatures and be enriched in other types of sRNA other than miRNA. Valuable information including new small RNA biomarkers can be extracted from these sample types and a more in depth analysis can be done when data from other small RNA would have been previously excluded by gel excising the 140 nt targets exclusively. As further information is gained and various new types of sRNA are discovered, small RNA-Seq is becoming increasingly important. Now, more information can be gained from sequencing bead-purified samples and analyzing all small RNA species that are present in a given sample.</p>
<p>It is now possible for liquid handling robots to be programmed for automated small RNA library preparation and purification to prepare samples for direct loading onto the sequencer. This will significantly decrease hands on time, human error, and increase throughput. CleanTag improves small RNA sequencing by 1) enabling sequencing of samples containing as little as 1 ng total RNA; 2) allowing for automation by the use of a bead-based purification; and 3) increasing throughput potential with an automated workflow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec028">
<title>Single cell quantity inputs</title>
<p>Samples with ultra low levels of RNA including single cell quantities (10 pg) of material can now be easily analyzed by NGS. Preliminary results reveal adequate amounts of library generated from these low inputs, a sufficient amount of quality reads generated after filtering, but an overall loss in low expressed miRNA species and an overabundance of tRNA reads. The biological relevance of this observation remains to be examined. The importance of tRNA fragments as other small RNA biomarkers is increasing, especially in breast cancer research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167009.ref037">37</xref>]. It has yet to be demonstrated whether this approach could currently be useful to specifically interrogate biomarkers which are overexpressed in certain diseases or cancers at these ultra low input levels. Further investigation remains to be done to improve the process and increase number of miRNA reads at single cell levels.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have demonstrated that rendering adapter dimer formation negligible overcomes many of the current challenges for sRNA library preparation. There are multiple benefits from adapter dimer suppression including the feasibility of using ultra-low total RNA inputs, potential to automate the entire workflow, and elimination of a gel-extraction clean up step. These improvements significantly enhance sRNA library preparation workflow and the ability to sequence ultra low inputs now opens up sRNA-Seq to more sample types regardless of limiting material. This includes single cell samples, FACS sorted cells, FFPE, Clip-Seq, biological fluids, etc. This modified adapter technology may also be applied to other library preparation techniques such as long RNA-Seq, and cell free ssDNA-Seq in the near future, as our investigations of these applications is ongoing.</p>

<title>Effect of modification proximity on reverse transcription yield.</title>
<p>Reverse transcription was performed on different modified adapter dimer substrates using a FAM-labeled RT primer. Ligation product from unmodified adapters served as the control for normalization (column A). Read through from a single modification on either the 3´ adapter (B) or 5´ adapter (C) was compared to a double modified substrate (D), both 5´ and 3´ adapters modified. RT products were run on a gel, imaged, and quantified for relative cDNA synthesis yield determination.</p>

<title>Library preparation comparison using top modifications on two different sets of adapter sequences.</title>
<p>A) Library preparation using 7 ng synthetic miRNA (Let 7d-3p (NNN)) input. U = both adapters were unmodified; M = both adapter were modified with top modifications. The CleanTag adapter set was compared to an alternate adapter set with a different sequence for the 3´ adapter. The same modifications were used for the alternate set. B) The alternate adapters were also tested with 1000 ng brain total RNA input. The CleanTag library preparation workflow was used to prepare libraries.</p>
