        <p>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the Western world. Survival of CLL cells depends on their close contact with stromal cells in lymphatic tissues, bone marrow and blood. This microenvironmental regulation of CLL cell survival involves the stromal secretion of chemo- and cytokines as well as the expression of adhesion molecules. Since CLL survival may also be driven by antigenic stimulation through the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), we explored the hypothesis that these processes may be linked to each other. We tested if stromal cells could serve as an antigen reservoir for CLL cells, thus promoting CLL cell survival by stimulation through the BCR. As a proof of principle, we found that two CLL BCRs with a common stereotyped heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (previously characterized as “subset 1”) recognize antigens highly expressed in stromal cells – vimentin and calreticulin. Both antigens are well-documented targets of autoantibodies in autoimmune disorders. We demonstrated that vimentin is displayed on the surface of viable stromal cells and that it is present and bound by the stereotyped CLL BCR in CLL-stroma co-culture supernatant. Blocking the vimentin antigen by recombinant soluble CLL BCR under CLL-stromal cell co-culture conditions reduces stroma-mediated anti-apoptotic effects by 20–45%. We therefore conclude that CLL BCR stimulation by stroma-derived antigens can contribute to the protective effect that the stroma exerts on CLL cells. This finding sheds a new light on the understanding of the pathobiology of this so far mostly incurable disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent type of leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Chiorazzi1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Dighiero1">[2]</xref>. This incurable disease most commonly consists of malignant B-cells expressing common B-cell markers as well as monoclonal membrane immunoglobulin, the B-cell receptor for antigen (BCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Matutes1">[3]</xref>. Major progress has been made in understanding the functional role of the BCR as well as the microenvironment in CLL pathobiology, providing crucial insights into the biology of this cancer in recent years.</p>
      <p>In lymphatic tissues and the bone marrow, CLL cells are in close contact with a connective tissue network of mesenchyma-derived stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger3">[6]</xref> including mesenchymal marrow stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Lagneaux1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Panayiotidis1">[8]</xref>, CD68+ monocyte-derived nurse-like cells (NLC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger1">[4]</xref>, and follicular dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Pedersen1">[9]</xref>. This supportive hematopoietic microenvironment protects CLL cells from spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger1">[4]</xref> and is therefore studied as a novel drug target in CLL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Niedermeier1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Balakrishnan1">[11]</xref>. The CLL-stroma contact is mediated primarily by cytokine receptors and adhesion molecules. One major cytokine axis involves the microenvironmental expression and secretion of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and CXCL13 which bind to the respective cytokine receptors on CLL cells, promoting migration and survival in CLL cells. In addition to classical cytokines, stromal cells secrete hedgehog ligands, which promote survival in CLL cells, as well as a range of anti-apoptotic membrane proteins such as B-cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF), the proliferation-inducing ligand APRIL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Nishio1">[12]</xref>, and CD31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Deaglio1">[13]</xref>. CLL-stroma adhesion is largely mediated by integrins, particularly VLA-4 (CD49d), which attaches to stromally expressed VCAM-1 and fibronectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger4">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-RedondoMunoz1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Zucchetto1">[16]</xref>. The complex cross-talk between CLL cells and their protective environment has recently been reviewed comprehensively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger3">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Microenvironmental stimuli by adhesion molecules and cytokines seem not to be the only factors promoting survival of B-CLL cells. There is emerging evidence that the development and course of this disease may also be driven by antigenic stimulation through the BCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Chiorazzi2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Stevenson1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Stamatopoulos1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Messmer1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Refaeli1">[21]</xref>. Our current understanding of the configuration of BCRs in CLL strongly supports this hypothesis. During normal B-cell development, genetic recombination of various immunoglobulin-encoding genes and somatic hypermutation shape BCRs and their highly variable complementarity-determining regions 3 (CDR3) such that each B-cell recognizes a particular antigen. If the development of the malignant CLL clone occurred independently of antigenic interaction, one would expect the gene usage and CDR3 sequences (the most individual antigen-binding part of the immunoglobulin) of CLL BCRs to be randomly distributed as in normal B-cells. However, the CLL immunoglobulin gene usage is biased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Tobin1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Stamatopoulos2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Fais1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Ghiotto1">[25]</xref> and a number of highly similar CDR3 regions are expressed. Indeed, more than 26% of CLL cells express BCRs belonging to one of almost 150 stereotyped subsets with virtually identical CDR3 sequences characterized so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Stamatopoulos1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Messmer1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Fais1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Thorselius1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Tobin2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Tobin3">[28]</xref>. Thus, one could postulate that at least CLL cases with stereotyped BCRs recognize a limited number of epitopes as part of certain antigens that may therefore trigger and/or sustain the disease through B-cell-receptor-mediated cell activation. Indeed, CLL BCRs react with recurring self-antigens <italic>in vitro</italic>, including IgG, thyroglobulin, DNA, actin, cardiolipin and others as well as with microbial antigens and epitopes exposed on cell surfaces as a result of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Sthoeger1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Dighiero2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Chiorazzi3">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Herve1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-LanemoMyhrinder1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although microenvironmental stimulation and antigenic drive through the BCR have been studied mainly as independent phenomena, there is some recent evidence that these processes may actually be linked in a broader concept of CLL pathogenesis and progression. Burger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger5">[34]</xref> found that CLL cells upregulate the expression of the chemoattractants CCL3 and CCL4 when co-cultured with NLCs. This upregulation could be inhibited by blocking BCR signaling with a specific Syk inhibitor, suggesting that antigenic stimulation through the BCR had caused CCL3/4 upregulation under co-culture conditions. Moreover, the pro-survival effects of nurse-like cells could be abrogated by blocking BCR signaling with a Syk inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Quiroga1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we set out to test the hypothesis if stromal cells could serve as an antigen reservoir for CLL cells, thus promoting CLL cell survival by stimulation through the BCR. We found that CLL BCRs expressing a stereotyped heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) can recognize the antigens vimentin and calreticulin which are highly expressed in stromal cells. We showed that the cytoskeletal protein vimentin is displayed on the surface of viable NLCs and that this BCR interaction contributes to stroma-mediated anti-apoptotic effects. Our results indicate that, in addition to the known effects of survival factors and adhesion molecules, stroma-mediated protection from apoptosis can be achieved through CLL BCR stimulation by stroma-derived antigens.</p>

        <p>We tested the hypothesis that CLL B-cell receptors (BCR) may recognize antigens expressed on stromal cells. Therefore, we investigated the reactivity of a small set of recombinantly expressed CLL BCRs with protein extracts from stromal cells. All CLL BCRs used for this analysis expressed stereotyped heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences frequently found in CLL patients (subset 1, 3 and 7 according to Stamatopoulos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Stamatopoulos1">[19]</xref> and Murray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Murray1">[38]</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015992-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes BCR gene usage, CDR3 sequence, and mutational status of the four CLL BCRs used for this study. For protein extraction, we used primary nurse-like cells (NLCs) from the blood of CLL patients and the murine stromal cell line M210B4 alone or after co-culture with primary CLL cells. Extracted proteins of these cells were subjected to one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The reactivity of the CLL BCRs Ig014, Ig015 and Ig022 as well as control IgG with proteins from the cell extracts was tested by Western blot analysis using the respective BCR as primary antibody, followed by HRP-based secondary detection. We found that the CLL BCR named "Ig014", which belonged to the stereotyped subset 1, recognized a range of proteins sized between 45 and 57 kDa that were expressed in the NLC extract and the stromal cell extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0015992.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To identify the stromal proteins recognized by CLL BCR Ig014, the NLC protein extract was subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). After electroblotting to a membrane and development with Ig014 and an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, 26 spots were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, left Western blot) that corresponded in size to the bands detected in the one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The isoelectric pH values (pI) of the detected spots ranged from 4.5 to 5.5. All protein spots were detectable in an independently performed two-dimensional electrophoresis by Coomassie blue staining, indicating that the proteins were abundantly expressed in NLCs. A magnified overlay of the Western blot and the corresponding Coomassie gel run in parallel is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g001">Figure 1C</xref> (left panel) with all overlapping spots depicted in brown and black. The spots were excised and proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Twenty-two of the 26 protein spots were identified as vimentin by MALDI TOF/TOF.

        <p>To confirm that CLL BCRs using the stereotyped subset 1 HCDR3 region recognize vimentin, we tested the binding of another CLL BCR of this subset (Ig044) to the NLC protein extract. As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015992-t001">Table 1</xref>, Ig014 and Ig044 express the same HCDR3 region whereas they differ in their heavy- and light-chain gene usage. Indeed, like Ig014, Ig044 recognized the spots previously characterized as vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g001">Figure 1A-C</xref>, right panels). In addition to these spots, Ig044 recognized another protein highly expressed in NLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g001">Figure 1C, right panel</xref>, spot 27). This protein was identified as calreticulin by ESI-ion trap analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015992-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Because vimentin was shown to be recognized by both subset 1 antibodies, we focused further evaluation and functional studies on this antigen.</p>

        <p>To corroborate the finding that vimentin functions as an antigen recognized by stereotyped CLL BCRs of subset 1, we further explored its interaction with a broader range of protein extracts from stromal and control cells and correlated it with the interaction pattern of a commercially available anti-vimentin antibody. We generated protein extracts from the following cell types: i.) human cell lines expressing no vimentin (MCF-7) or very low levels of vimentin (HEK293T, HeLa); ii.) the mouse stromal cell line M210B4 which is used to support primary human CLL cells in culture; iii.) primary NLC extracts from the peripheral blood of three patients with CLL. Protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using Ig014 and a commercially available vimentin antibody as primary antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Detection with an anti-β-actin antibody revealed similar signals in each of the lanes, confirming that equal amounts of protein had been loaded. The soluble Ig014 BCR detected vimentin at the same pattern as a commercially available anti-vimentin antibody albeit at lower sensitivity. Vimentin was detected in all stromal cell-derived protein extracts, whereas a much weaker signal was obtained for HEK293T and HeLa cells, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Both antibodies did not detect specific signals in the protein extract from the vimentin-negative cell line MCF-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The commercial anti-vimentin antibody showed a somewhat weaker signal for vimentin in the M210B4 mouse cell line extract which we attributed to the lower reactivity of this antibody with rodent vimentin than with human vimentin as described previously for this antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Bohn1">[47]</xref>. Interestingly, Ig014 reacted much stronger with stroma-derived vimentin as compared to vimentin from other cell lines, possibly indicating that stroma-specific post-translational modifications could be preferentially recognized by this CLL BCR.</p>

Protein extracts were generated from human cell lines expressing no vimentin (MCF-7) or low levels of vimentin (HEK293T, HeLa) as well as protein extracts from the vimentin-expressing mouse stromal cell line M210B4 and from NLCs of three patients (I, II, III) with CLL.

A HeLa cell extract and HeLa supernatant was used as a negative control. Precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using Ig014 or a commercial anti-vimentin antibody as primary antibodies. Note that in the left panel the light (LC) and heavy chains (HC) of the Ig014 immunoglobulin used for immunoprecipitation is also detected because an anti-human immunoglobulin secondary antibody was used when Western blot staining was done with Ig014 as the primary antibody.</p>

        <p>To prove that Ig014 interacts with vimentin also in its native conformation, immunoprecipitations of proteins from NLC protein extracts were performed. Ig014 was incubated with protein extracts from NLCs proven to express vimentin and then immunoprecipitated using protein-G sepharose beads. Precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of vimentin using the Ig014 immunoglobulin or the commercial anti-vimentin antibody for detection. The blots showed clearly that Ig014 precipitated vimentin in its native conformation from NLCs. In contrast, no vimentin could be detected when control protein extracts were used for immunopreciptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>We reasoned that if stroma-derived vimentin serves as an antigen recognized by CLL cells, it is necessary that vimentin is at least partially expressed on the surface of and/or secreted and/or shed by stromal cells. In fact, it has been shown that macrophages can secrete vimentin and display it on their surface when activated by infectious agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-MorVaknin1">[48]</xref>. To verify this for the CLL patient-derived NLCs, we immunoprecipitated both a supernatant from NLCs and a control supernatant from HeLa cells with Ig014. Vimentin was detected, albeit at low levels, in precipitates only if NLC supernatant was used for the immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). No vimentin could be precipitated from the control supernatant.</p>

        <p>The data described above shows that vimentin is present in the supernatant of NLCs which could be due to active secretion, membrane shedding, or as a result of NLC apoptosis. To investigate whether vimentin is indeed also detectable on the plasma membrane of stromal cells, we performed immunofluorescence stainings on NLCs and the mouse stromal cell line M210B4 using confocal microscopy. Both Ig014 and the vimentin antibody yielded a strong cytoplasmic and membrane signal in NLCs and M210B4 cells (green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g003">Figure 3A and B</xref>) which partially matched the signal of phalloidin-Alexa 594 reacting with cytoplasmatic and membrane-bound actin (red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g003">Figure 3A and B</xref>). To further determine whether the staining observed at the edges of the cells indicated the presence of vimentin on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, we performed immunofluorescence on non-permeabilized stromal cells. Indeed, membrane-associated vimentin staining was also detected in non-permeabilized stromal cells (green "corona", <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), implying that some vimentin is displayed on the outer surface of the cell.</p>

        <p>Regarding autoantigen-reactivity of CLL BCRs, it has been suggested that CLL emerges from B-lymphocytes that have been primed by (mainly intracellular) autoantigens released or displayed during apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-LanemoMyhrinder1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Chu1">[49]</xref>. This may also hold true for vimentin, that has been shown to be displayed on the surface of cells undergoing apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-LanemoMyhrinder1">[33]</xref>. We therefore investigated if the stromal cells staining positive for membrane-bound vimentin (almost 100% of all stromal cells) were viable at the time of staining or whether they were undergoing apoptosis at this point. Therefore, trypan blue and 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) stainings were performed on the stromal cell layers used for immunofluorescence just prior to fixation. Of note, less than 1% of stromal cells stained positive for either trypan blue or 7-AAD, suggesting that the majority of cells were not apoptotic while displaying vimentin on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). To exclude that the cells were in very early phases of apoptosis not yet detectable by trypan blue or 7-AAD staining, we also stained and counted the number of apoptotic/dead cells on the slide and in the supernatant 24 and 48 hours after the time point when the stromal cells were used for vimentin immunofluorescence stainings. We assumed that early apoptotic cells would then be in late phases of apoptosis and thus detectable in the supernatant and on the slide by stainings with apoptosis markers. After 24 hours, &gt;99% and after 48 hours, &gt;97% of the adherent stromal cells were viable and less than 100 dead cells (out of 10<sup>5</sup> seeded adherent cells) were counted in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, time points "24 h" and "48 h"). This indicates that at the time point of the vimentin staining, stromal cells were not undergoing apoptosis und thus vimentin was displayed “actively” on viable stromal cells.</p>

        <title>Stroma blocking with recombinant BCR reduces CLL 014 protection from apoptosis</title>
        <p>Stroma-mediated anti-apoptotic effects have so far been mainly ascribed to the action of cytokines and other anti-apoptotic proteins expressed by stromal cells. Having shown that the stroma-derived antigen vimentin is displayed on the surface of viable stromal cells, we asked whether this BCR-antigen interaction can protect CLL 014 cells from apoptosis. Therefore, CLL 014 cells were cultured alone and on a layer of M210B4 stromal cells blocked with either Ig014 or the control BCR IgGr at 100 µg/ml. The viability of CLL 014 cells was assessed after six days of co-culture by trypan blue staining and in a separate experiment by 7-AAD staining followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g005">Figure 5A and B</xref>). In both experimental approaches, the majority of previously cryopreserved CLL 014 cells lost viability after six days when cultured without a protective stromal cell layer (viability approximately 5%). There was a clear anti-apoptotic effect upon CLL cell cultivation on the stromal cell layer, resulting in 30–40% viable cells, when the stromal cell layer was blocked with the control BCR IgGr. When Ig014 was used to block the CLL-stroma interaction, the viability of CLL 014 cells was significantly lower (20–25% viable cells), suggesting an anti-apoptotic effect of the BCR-vimentin interaction on the surface or in the supernatant of M210B4 stromal cells. Next, CLL 014 cell viability was determined over a defined time course under the same conditions as specified above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The measurement of apoptosis was performed by FACS analysis using 7-AAD complemented by annexin V to detect even earlier phases of apoptosis. Therefore, the percentage of viable CLL 014 cells was slightly lower than in previous experiments at a comparable time point. As in previous experiments, CLL 014 cells died rapidly without stromal support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The anti-apoptotic effect of the stroma was significantly inhibited when stromal cells were blocked with the specific CLL BCR Ig014. This effect wore off after seven days of culture, when 90% of all co-cultured CLL cells were dead. To determine if the effect was indeed mediated by vimentin, we compared the inhibition of the protective stroma effect by BCR Ig014 with a commercially available anti-vimentin antibody. Therefore, CLL 014 cells were cultured alone, on a layer of M210B4 stromal cells, or on stroma cells and blocked with either control BCR IgGr, BCR Ig014, or the commercial anti-vimentin antibody with specificity for human and murine vimentin. The viability of CLL 014 cells was assessed after 12 hours of co-culture by Annexin/PI staining followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). The protective stroma effect on CLL cells could be blocked to the same extent (approximately 40%) by both BCR Ig014 and the vimentin antibody as compared to unblocked or control antibody-blocked stroma (p = 0.002). These results suggest that vimentin is displayed on the surface of stromal cells and provides anti-apoptotic signals to CLL 014 cells through the BCR. We reasoned that, alternatively, the reduced viability of CLL cells on blocked stroma could be explained by the limited stroma-attachment itself, as a physical contact between stromal and CLL cells has been shown to be required for stroma-induced anti-apoptotic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Lagneaux1">[7]</xref>. To dissect the effects of mere attachment-related and direct anti-apoptotic effects through the BCR, HEK 293T cells were transfected with a eukaryotic secretory expression vector encoding vimentin and an empty control vector, respectively, and used as a "feeder layer" for CLL 014 cells. HEK 293T cells transiently transfected with the vimentin encoding vector secreted vimentin in the supernatant (data not shown). When CLL 014 cells were cultured on this "feeder layer", the viability was enhanced compared to CLL 014 cells cultured on HEK 293T cells transfected with an insertless control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015992-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting protective effects of the secreted BCR antigen.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The B-cell receptor and its recognition of antigens may play a very important role in CLL pathogenesis and progression. Several antigens that are recognized by CLL B-cell receptors (BCRs) have been described. Yet, there is only speculation as to where these antigens are expressed, under which conditions they are exposed as well as whether – and if so: how – this relates to the interaction of the malignant lymphocytes with their microenvironment. Many studies have addressed the protective role of the stroma in CLL and different cell biological axes have been described to mediate these effects. These include protection from apoptosis by chemo- and cytokines, such as the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) which is secreted by stromal cells and interacts with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 on CLL cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger1">[4]</xref>. After chemokine-mediated migration to the protective microenvironment, CLL cells attach to stromal cells via integrins, such as VLA-4 which binds to stromal VCAM-1 and fibronectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger4">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-RedondoMunoz1">[15]</xref>. Based on recent studies, however, there is reason to believe that stroma protection is not exclusively chemokine-, cytokine- and integrin-mediated but may also involve signaling through the BCR for antigen. Burger et al. recently showed that CCL3 and CCL4 expression is induced upon co-culture of CLL cells with stromal cells and that this can be blocked by antagonists of the BCR signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Burger5">[34]</xref>. Moreover, there is evidence that antagonists of the BCR pathway, such as Syk or Akt inhibitors, can inhibit stroma-mediated protection from apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Quiroga1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Kurtova1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Buchner1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Quiroga2">[52]</xref>. These data led us to hypothesize that stromal cells may constitute an antigen reservoir for CLL cells, thus providing not only cytokine- and classical adhesion molecule-mediated but also BCR-mediated survival signals.</p>
      <p>To test this hypothesis, we cloned and expressed a set of CLL BCRs expressing common stereotyped HCDR3 sequences (subsets 1, 3 and 7 according to Stamatopoulos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Stamatopoulos1">[19]</xref> and Murray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Murray1">[38]</xref>) and tested the interaction of these antibodies with lysates of a set of different cell types including stromal cells. We found that two CLL BCRs belonging to subset 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Stamatopoulos1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Murray1">[38]</xref>, termed Ig014 and Ig044, recognize the protein vimentin. One of the antibodies, Ig044, also interacted with calreticulin. The results of our confocal microscopy studies suggested that Ig014 interacts with vimentin exposed on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane of stromal cells. This BCR-mediated stromal antigen recognition seemed to be functionally relevant. We found a significant reduction of stroma-mediated protection from apoptosis in CLL 014 cells when stromal vimentin was competitively blocked by the CLL BCR or a commercially available anti-vimentin antibody and found an enhanced protective effect when feeder cells were forced to secrete vimentin. Therefore, our results prove for the first time that a stroma-derived antigen adds to the effect of stroma-mediated protection from apoptosis by BCR binding.</p>
      <p>The CLL BCRs Ig014 and Ig044 use different heavy and light chain genes; yet, both of them are categorized as subset 1 antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Stamatopoulos1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Murray1">[38]</xref> as they express highly homologous HCDR3 sequences. Considering this, their common reactivity with vimentin is presumably mediated by their shared HCDR3, whereas calreticulin could be recognized by other regions of CLL BCR Ig044 such as CDR1, CDR2 or framework regions. Interestingly, vimentin and calreticulin have physiological and pathophysiological features in common. Both proteins are multifunctional, primarily intracellular proteins highly expressed in NLCs. Vimentin, a class III cytoskeletal protein in cells of mesenchymal origin, locates to the cytoplasm whereas calreticulin is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. Translocation to the plasma membrane has been described for both proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-MorVaknin1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Li1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Obeid1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Johnson1">[55]</xref>. In addition to their physiological roles, vimentin and calreticulin are targets in autoimmune conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Verreck1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Nijenhuis1">[57]</xref>. During apoptosis, vimentin can be exposed on the cell surface and triggers the generation of autoantibodies in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Nijenhuis1">[57]</xref>. Independently of apoptotic events, vimentin can be actively secreted and exposed on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane as it has been shown recently for activated macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-MorVaknin1">[48]</xref>. Interestingly, macrophages and NLCs are similar cell types in that they both derive from monocytes. Vimentin has been described as an antigen recognized by different stereotyped (IGHV3-30-subset 32 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-LanemoMyhrinder1">[33]</xref>, IGHV4-39-subset 8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Chu1">[49]</xref>) and non-stereotyped (IGHV3-30 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-LanemoMyhrinder1">[33]</xref>) CLL BCRs. This finding has strengthened the hypothesis that CLL BCRs may frequently, if not generally, recognize molecular binding motifs on apoptotic cells, also taking into account reactivities with other proteins exposed on apoptotic cell surfaces. While this hypothesis may hold true, our data indicate that there may also be active secretion of proteins by viable stromal cells, potentially accounting for chronic antigen stimulation through the BCR.</p>
      <p>CLL is a heterogeneous condition with some patients living for decades after diagnosis whereas others succumb rapidly to the disease despite therapy. Patients 014 and 044 of our study express a BCR with a stereotyped HCDR3 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Stamatopoulos1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015992-Murray1">[38]</xref>). This class of receptors is associated with an aggressive clinical course and effective treatment options are an unmet clinical need especially for this group of patients. As we improve our understanding of the protective role of accessory stromal cells in CLL, the microenvironment becomes an increasingly attractive biological target for novel treatment strategies in CLL.</p>

The reactivity of polyclonal IgG and the CLL BCRs Ig014, Ig015 and Ig022 was tested by Western blot analysis using the BCR as primary antibody followed by HRP-based secondary detection. Ig014 recognized a range of proteins between 45 and 57 kDa in size which were not recognized by the other BCRs.</p>
