<abstract>
<p>Inflammation and oxidative stress are considered the main drivers of vasomotor dysfunction and progression of atherosclerosis after inhalation of particulate matter. In addition, new studies have shown that particle exposure can induce the level of bioactive mediators in serum, driving vascular- and systemic toxicity. We aimed to investigate if pulmonary inflammation would accelerate nanoparticle-induced atherosclerotic plaque progression in <italic>Apolipoprotein E</italic> knockout (<italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) mice. <italic>ApoE</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice were exposed to vehicle, 8.53 or 25.6 Î¼g nanosized carbon black (CB) alone or spiked with LPS (0.2 Î¼g/mouse/exposure; once a week for 10 weeks). Inflammation was determined by counting cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. <italic>Serum Amyloid A3</italic> (<italic>Saa3</italic>) expression and glutathione status were determined in lung tissue. Plaque progression was assessed in the aorta and the brachiocephalic artery. The effect of vasoactive mediators in plasma of exposed <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice was assessed in aorta rings isolated from naÃ¯ve C57BL/6 mice. Pulmonary exposure to CB and/or LPS resulted in pulmonary inflammation with a robust influx of neutrophils. The CB exposure did not promote plaque progression in aorta or BCA. Incubation with 0.5% plasma extracted from CB-exposed <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice caused vasoconstriction in aorta rings isolated from naÃ¯ve mice; this effect was abolished by the treatment with the serotonin receptor antagonist Ketanserin. In conclusion, repeated pulmonary exposure to nanosized CB and LPS caused lung inflammation without progression of atherosclerosis in <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. Nevertheless, plasma extracted from mice exposed to nanosized CB induced vasoconstriction in aortas of naÃ¯ve wild-type mice, an effect possibly related to increased plasma serotonin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with exposure to inhaled airborne particulate matter being a major contributor to the burden of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref001">1</xref>]. Exposure to particulate matter from ambient air or nanomaterials (NMs) is associated with vascular dysfunction and progression of atherosclerosis, which is believed to be promoted by inflammation, acute phase response and oxidative stress in the lungs and target tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref002">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref005">5</xref>]. The role of pulmonary inflammation in particle-induced cardiovascular outcomes has been debated with experimental evidence ranging from the spill-over effect of cytokines from the lung to the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref006">6</xref>] to vascular effects occurring independently of pulmonary inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>A number of studies have addressed cardiovascular effects of carbon black (CB) exposure in animal models. CB is a widely used carbon-based material in both bulk form and as an NM. The latter has a high particle number to mass ratio and unique surface properties, which make them attractive component in many products, although the small size and large surface area potentially make them more toxic than their larger counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref008">8</xref>]. It has been shown that pulmonary exposure to CB by intratracheal instillation (i.t.) once a week for ten weeks in LDL receptor knockout mice on a cholesterol-rich diet promoted progression of atherosclerotic plaque in the aorta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref009">9</xref>]. There has also been reported a decrease in the vasorelaxation response in aortic segments from <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice after two i.t. instillations of nanosized CB, whereas the same dose did not cause plaque progression in the aorta or the brachiocephalic artery (BCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref010">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, 4 weeks inhalation by nose-only exposure to CB did not affect the vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation response in the aorta of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref011">11</xref>]. Particle-generated vasomotor dysfunction may be related to relatively acute exposures because it has been shown that exposure to nanosized CB did not alter the vasorelaxation response in second order branch interlobar pulmonary arteries of male Wistar rats at day 21 after an i.t. instillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref012">12</xref>]. The same pattern was observed in dyslipidemic Zucker rats following oral administration of CB for 10 weeks; vasomotor dysfunction in the aorta was observed 24 h after the last exposure, whereas this particle-effect had subsided at 13 weeks post-exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref013">13</xref>]. The mechanistic link between pulmonary/intestinal exposure to CB and cardiovascular outcomes has not been elucidated. The direct application of nanosized CB to artery segments caused dysfunction of the vasorelaxation response and increased vasoconstriction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref015">15</xref>]. However, these <italic>ex vivo</italic> observations are based on concentrations that are much higher than the concentrations that may be relevant in physiological scenarios after pulmonary exposure. The translocation of poorly soluble particles is typically much less than 1% of the deposited dose in the lungs, whereas higher translocation can ben observed for nanomaterials with high solubility such as zincoxide or nanosilver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref016">16</xref>]. In addition, systemic low-grade inflammation has been hypothetized to be a mechanism of vascular effects following pulmonary exposure to particulate matter, but a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature do not demonstrate any consistency between systemic inflammation and vascular endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref017">17</xref>]. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that pulmonary exposure to particles or ozone can induce the level of bioactive mediators in serum that acts as drivers for systemic toxicity, including loss of vascular integrity and vasomotor dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref018">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref020">20</xref>]. As such, it is difficult to disentangle the contribution of pulmonary inflammation from other mediators on vascular effects in CB exposed animals because the material dose-dependently causes a strong pulmonary inflammation response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate if pulmonary inflammation exacerbated nanosized CB induced progression of atherosclerosis. LPS was used as a non-particulate agent because it induces inflammation and accelerates plaque progression in <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref022">22</xref>]. We carried out a range-finding experiment to find a dose of LPS that would produce a similar extent of pulmonary inflammation as the CB material of choice (i.e. Printex 90). Subsequently, we assessed pulmonary inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque progression after CB and/or LPS exposure in <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. Plaque progression was evaluated in the aorta and BCA; both arteries are prone to develop atherosclerotic lesions in <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed as a neutrophilic influx in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the acute phase response as gene expression of <italic>Serum Amyloid A3</italic> (<italic>Saa3</italic>) in lung tissue. The level of oxidative stress in the lungs was assessed by measuring the glutathione balance. Finally, we investigated vasoactive effects of mediators in plasma from nanosized CB, and/or LPS exposed <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice in aortas of naÃ¯ve wild-type C57BL/6 mice (the <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> background strain).</p>

<p>CB was chosen as a high volume industrial NM. Specifically, we used Printex 90 because it is well-characterized physicochemically and it has been used in several studies as benchmark type on NM that causes both pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref023">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref030">30</xref>]. Printex 90 was a kind gift from Degussa-HÃ¼ls, Frankfurt, Germany. We have previously analyzed and reported the physicochemical characteristics of the Printex 90 material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Printex 90 was suspended in nanopure water (&lt; 45 Î¼m pore size) to a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml and sonicated in an ice bath for 16 min with 10% amplitude using a Branson Sonifier S-450D (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT, USA) equipped with a disruptor horn (Model number: 101-147-037). The instillation vehicle was prepared as described above without particles. For LPS spiked suspensions, 4 Î¼g/ml LPS (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 055: B5, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the sonicated suspension with or without particles and vortexed for 2 min before i.t. instillation. A fresh suspension was prepared immediately before i.t. instillation.</p>
<p>Dynamic light scattering (DLS) Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK) was used to measure the hydrodynamic size distribution of CB in nanopure water as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref029">29</xref>]. Calculations were done by the DTS software using the viscosity of water. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160731.s001">S1 Fig</xref> depicts particle size in the suspensions. In brief, the particle size of CB was 44 and 38 nm in the low and high dose groups, respectively. Addition of LPS increased the particle size of the suspension to 1281 and 1718 nm, respectively. Likewise, the polydispersity index of the suspensions with CB were lower as compared to the suspensions with CB and LPS.</p>

<title>Animal and caging conditions</title>
<p>For the LPS pilot study, female C57BL/6-Ntac mice were purchased from Taconic (Ejby, Denmark) at nine weeks of age and allowed one week of acclimatization before the first exposure. For the main studies, female C57BL/6-Apoe<sup>tm1</sup> <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice were purchased from Taconic (Ejby, Denmark) at eight weeks of age and allowed two weeks of acclimation before the experimental procedure. All mice were randomly assigned to groups of 10 animals and housed in polypropylene cages (Jeluxyl HW 300/500) with sawdust bedding and enrichment, such as pinewood sticks and rodent tunnels. The mice were maintained on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle and with controlled humidity and temperature. Mice had ad libitum access to regular mouse chow (Altromin no. 1324 Christian Petersen, Denmark) and tap water. All animal procedures followed the local institutional and governmental guidelines on animal ethics and welfare issued by the Danish government and the Animal Experimental Inspectorate under the Ministry of Justice approved the study (permission 2010/561-1779).</p>

<title>LPS pilot study</title>
<p>The LPS dose-range study was designed to find a dose of LPS that in C57BL/6 mice when repeatedly administered, would give a neutrophil influx in BALF similar to that of CB. Furthermore, the purpose of the experiment was to select doses of CB and LPS that would not cause a saturation of the inflammatory response. In the assessment of dose-response relationship, C57BL/6 mice were exposed by i.t. instillation to vehicle, 0.047 Î¼g, 0.094 Î¼g, 0.187 Î¼g, 0.375 Î¼g, 0.750 Î¼g, 1.5 Î¼g, 3.0 Î¼g or 6.0 Î¼g of LPS and euthanized at 24 h post-exposure (n = 3 mice/group). This was followed by a repeated exposure study in which C57BL/6 mice were exposed by i.t. instillation to vehicle, 0.2 Î¼g (low-dose) or 1.0 Î¼g (high-dose) of LPS once a week for four weeks (n = 3 mice/group). The total dose in the repeated exposure study was 0.8 Î¼g (low-dose) and 4 Î¼g (high-dose). The mice were euthanized at 24 h after the last exposure, and the BALF was collected. The vehicle utilized in these experiments was 2% serum obtained from sibling mice diluted with nanopure water under sterile conditions.</p>

Based on these observations, it was anticipated that CB exposure would yield approximately 50.000 neutrophils in BALF. Hence, an LPS dose of 0.2 Î¼g/mouse (total dose = 2 Î¼g/mouse) was selected for the repeated exposure study in C57BL/6 mice. The lowest of exposure to CB (8.53 Î¼g/mouse, corresponding to approximately 0.30 mg/kg bodyweight per week) is approximately equal to the accumulated dose that humans can encounter during a one-week stay in a working environment with the same aerosol concentration of respirable CB as the Danish threshold limit (i.e. aerosol concentration of 3.5 Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup>, inhalation of 8 m<sup>3</sup>/day, 15% deposition in lower respiratory tract and 70 kg bodyweight).</p>

<p>Triplicates of 5 Î¼m thick frozen sections were obtained at 100 and 200 Î¼m distal to the aortic arch on a CM3050 S-Cryostat (Leica Microsystems Nussloch GmbH, DE). The sections were mounted on Super FrostÂ® Plus slides (Thermo Scientific) and stored at -80Â°C. The mounted sections were fixed in Bouinâs solution (Sigma) overnight, followed by staining with Masson's trichrome stain (Sigma). In brief, sections were stained in Weigertâs Iron Hematoxylin Solution (Ampliqon, DK) for 2 min; Biebrich Scarlet-Acid Fuchsin (HT15-1, Sigma) for 5 min; Phosphotungstic Acid/Phosphomolybdic Acid workings solution (HT152/HT153, Sigma) for 5 min, and Aniline Blue for 5 min.

<title>Effects of vasomotor active mediators in plasma</title>
<p>The aorta of naÃ¯ve female C57BL/6 Ntac mice (Taconic, Ejby, Denmark) aged 10â12 weeks was dissected and trimmed free of fat and connective tissue in oxygenated cold physiological saline solution (PSS) buffer after cervical dislocation, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref040">40</xref>]. The thoracic section of the aorta was cut into ring-shaped segments of 2 mm. Two stainless steel wires, 40 Î¼m in diameter, were gently led through the lumen of each ring segment and mounted in the organ bath of a Multi-Wire Myograph 620M (Danish Myo Technology, Aarhus, DK) interfaced to a PowerLab 4/35 recorder (ADInstruments). Each organ bath contained 5 ml of cold oxygenated PSS and was continuously perfused with a 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> gas mixture. After mounting the segments, the heat was turned on, fresh 37Â°C warm PSS added and the segments were allowed to equilibrate. Next the passive length-tension relationships of each segment were determined using the DMT LabChart normalization procedure. After a successful normalization, the vessel viability was confirmed via non-receptor mediated contraction. In brief, 5 ml of K-PSS was added to the organ bath while the contraction was allowed to stabilize (reached a plateau). Thereafter, the vessels were stimulated three times with 37Â°C K-PSS. Only viable vessels were used and stimulated with plasma from <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice that had been exposed to vehicle, LPS or low-dose CB in order to investigate the vasomotor response. The aorta ring segments were stimulated with 0.5% plasma, and the presence or absence of vessel contraction recorded. At this juncture, an additional 0.5% of plasma was added to the vessel and contraction evaluated. As a final phase, 10 Î¼M of acetylcholine (Ach) was added to assess the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (endothelium function). This concentration of Ach induces maximal relaxation of prostaglandin F<sub>2Î±</sub> pre-contracted aorta rings. In addition, we have previously shown that exposure to nanomaterials affects the maximal endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation rather than the EC<sub>50</sub> value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref041">41</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>To investigate the origin of the pharmacological modulators in the plasma we antagonized the serotonin receptor with ketanserin. This drug is a S<sub>2</sub>-serotoninergic antagonist, which also inhibits Î±<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref044">44</xref>]. 1) Aorta ring segments were stimulated with 1% plasma (from CB-exposed <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice), at the plateau of contraction the serotonin receptor antagonist Ketanserin (0.1 Î¼M) was added and the force was recorded. 2) Aorta ring segments were pre-incubated 17 min with Ketanserin (0.1 Î¼M), and 1% plasma (plasma from CB-exposed <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice) was added, and the force was recorded. In addition, the aorta ring segments were stimulated with Phenylephrine (10 Î¼M) to demonstrate whether the artery had preserved the ability to receptor-mediated contraction via a receptor different from serotonin receptors. The serotonin investigations were reproduced in 3 different mice (n = 3).</p>
<p>For data analysis, the response was ranked based upon contraction above 0.5 mN in the aorta ring segments. This difference was used for practical reasons because certain plasma samples produced little vasoconstriction, although the basal tonus increased slightly over the incubation period, whereas other samples produced a swift vasoconstriction. An increase in tonus of 0.5 mN was used as threshold for vasoconstriction because this difference is larger than the variation observed in the basal tonus of aorta rings. The threshold for a significant vasorelaxation response to 10 Î¼M Ach was calculated as a decrease of more than 50% from the contraction following incubation with 0.5% plasma. The results of study 1 and 2 have been pooled in the statistical analysis to increase the power of the qualitative assessment.</p>

In brief, a suspension of 5 ml (2.5 mg/ml) CB was sonicated in endotoxin-free water for 16 min and used at the same concentration as the i.t. instillations. LPS (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 055: B5, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 4 Î¼g/ml, equivalent to 10,000 Endotoxin Unit/ml. The CB working solutions (8.53 Î¼g/ml and 25.6 Î¼g/ml) were serially diluted (two-fold dilution) for analysis and a standard curve was generated according to the manufacturer's protocol. A solid gel clot formation was interpreted as LPS being present in the sample or as no interference from the CB in the sample. The lack of clot formation as was interpreted as no LPS being present in the sample or that CB inhibited the effect of LPS.</p>

BALF data for eosinophils were log-transformed to achieve homogeneity of variance (assessed by Bartlettâs test). For lymphocytes, neutrophils and epithelial cells, log-transformation did not produce homogeneity of variance and parametric test on ranks was used with Fisherâs LSD post-hoc test (fold-differences and 95% confidence interval (CI) have been calculated from data on the nominal scale).

<p>To further investigate the origin of the pharmacological modulators in the plasma, we investigated if the above-observed responses were serotonin-driven (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160731.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The plasma mediated contraction was decreased after the addition of the serotonin receptor antagonist Ketanserin (0.1 Î¼M). Additionally, a 15 min incubation of Ketanserin (0.1 Î¼M) completely suppressed the plasma mediated contraction in aorta ring segments.</p>

<title>Serotonin receptor antagonist inhibition of plasma-mediated vasomotor contraction in aorta rings.</title>
<p>The figure shows two graphical illustrations of the vasomotor function in real-time recorded in Lab Chart 8 myograph module (ADInstruments &amp; DMT). A) 1% plasma from CB-exposed <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice causes contraction of the naÃ¯ve aorta ring segment. The addition the serotonin receptor antagonist Ketanserin (0.1 Î¼M) on the plateau of the constriction response releases the plasma-mediated contraction. B) 17 min pre-incubation with Ketanserin (0.1 Î¼M) inhibits the 1% plasma-mediated vessel contraction. Stimulation of the adrenergic receptors in the naÃ¯ve aorta ring segments with Phenylephrine (10 Î¼M), demonstrates that the artery has preserved the ability for receptor-mediated contraction via a receptor not specific for serotonin. The findings presented in the figure was reproduced in 3 different mice (n = 3) with the same result.</p>

<title>The activity of LPS in the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay is inhibited by addition of CB</title>
<p>The observation of a statistically significant interaction between the high-dose CB and LPS on pulmonary inflammation suggested that CB may inhibit the biological activity of LPS through a physical interaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160731.t004">Table 4</xref>). Firstly, the gel clot formation in the LAL assay at 4.26 Î¼g/ml of CB indicated the presence of LPS in the sample. This was also tested with the suspensions of CB used for the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Three 2-fold dilutions of the low dose CB+LPS suspension promoted clotting in the LAL assay (corresponding to 1.07 Î¼g/ml of CB and 125 EU/ml of LPS). However, clotting did not occur in the high dose CB+LPS, despite the substantially higher concentration of both CB and LPS. Therefore, this suggests a CB concentration-dependent inhibition of the effects of LPS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> pulmonary and cardiovascular effects following repeated exposure to nanosized CB and/or LPS. Our findings show that repeated pulmonary exposure to CB increases the total cell number in BALF with a modest yet significant influx of neutrophils. The data are in concordance with results from previous studies on repeated i.t. instillation of Printex 90 to Balb/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref045">45</xref>]. It has also been shown that multiple i.t. instillations of LPS increased the influx of neutrophils in BALF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref046">46</xref>]. We observed a similar pattern following 10 weeks of pulmonary exposure to LPS, regardless of co-exposure to CB. The total BALF cell number in the LPS exposed groups was significantly increased and mainly driven by the strong neutrophil influx contributing to approximately 50% of the total cell number. Moreover, the macrophage numbers were significantly increased in the LPS- and low-dose CB+LPS group, but not the high-dose CB+LPS group following repeated exposures. We only found increased expression of <italic>Saa3</italic> in the lungs of mice exposed to high-dose CB+LPS; this is different from observations in studies with a single i.t. instillation of nanosized CB, which increased <italic>Saa3</italic> expression levels in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice at day 1, 3 and 28 post-exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref036">36</xref>]. The differences in <italic>Saa3</italic> expression levels witnessed here and previous studies might be due to variances in the acute phase response between single and repeated exposures (i.e. high levels of <italic>Saa3</italic> after a single exposure). If inflammation persists, it may lead to a redox imbalance favoring a pro-oxidant milieu causing the depletion of antioxidant enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref047">47</xref>]. It is recognized that altered glutathione metabolism occurs in inflammatory lung diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref048">48</xref>]. Nevertheless, the levels and balance of total and reduced glutathione in lung tissue of <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice at 24 h after last exposure were not affected, indicating that the pulmonary exposure did not cause oxidative stress in the lungs (or it was too late to investigate this end-point). It is our experience that it requires relatively high bolus doses of NMs to cause glutathione depletion in the lungs; e.g. i.t. instillation of 15 Î¼g ZnO caused both cytotoxicity and depletion of glutathione in mouse lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref049">49</xref>]. However, it should also be noted that the lung tissue samples had a relatively high content of oxidized glutathione (approximately 30%), which may indicate spontaneous oxidation of the samples during storage at -80Â°C. The repeated exposure of CB and/or LPS may have been associated with subtle differences in the glutathione status, but not an adaptation in terms of increased glutathione levels in the lungs.</p>
<p>The exposure to CB did not accelerate plaque progression in the aorta or the BCA. An earlier study on repeated exposure to CB showed that a much higher dose administered by i.t. instillation (1000 Î¼g/mouse per week for ten weeks) was associated with increased plaque progression in LDL receptor knockout mice on a cholesterol-rich diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref009">9</xref>]. It is well documented that cholesterol-enriched diet <italic>per se</italic> accelerates plaque progression in both <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and LDL receptor knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref050">50</xref>]. However, it is not possible to disentangle the effect of high CB dose from diet-induced susceptibility to plaque progression. In an earlier study, we exposed 48â49 weeks old <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice to Printex 90 by i.t. instillation (0.5 mg/kg once a week for 2 weeks), but the study was terminated prematurely because of a high mortality rate after each round of exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Pulmonary exposure to LPS in study 1 indicated a tendency towards accelerated plaque progression in the aorta; therefore, study 2 was carried out to increase the statistical power. However, the results of study 2 did not support the initial findings of study 1. Previous studies have indicated that LPS exposure by intraperitoneal injection was associated with increased plaque progression in the aorta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref052">52</xref>]. Surprisingly, we found that mice exposed to high-dose CB+LPS had lower plaque progression and less pronounced pulmonary inflammation as compared to the LPS exposed group. This led us to investigate if CB could inhibit the effect of LPS using the LAL assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160731.t004">Table 4</xref> the high dose CB was able to inhibit gel clot formation i.e. the LPS-mediated effect, whereas low-dose CB+LPS did not. Indeed, the LAL assay showed that 1 Î¼g CB was enough to eliminate the effect of at least 39 endotoxin units. However, clotting indicated that LPS was present in CB in concentrations down to 4.3 Î¼g/ml. Thus, it suggests that CB affects the action of LPS and its downstream signaling cascade. One possible explanation for this inhibition could be the adsorption of LPS by CB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
<p>Endothelial dysfunction, including impaired vasomotor function, is a hallmark of early progression of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref054">54</xref>]. Vasomotor dysfunction also occurs by pulmonary exposure to particles in wild-type and atherosclerosis-prone animals as well as in humans with clinical manifestation of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref004">4</xref>]. Although this may be related to structural or molecular changes in the endothelium or intima, recent evidence also indicates that pulmonary toxicity can be conveyed systemically with circulating vasoactive molecules capable of modulating vasomotor function in arteries from naÃ¯ve animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref018">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref020">20</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that vasomotor active molecules in the plasma from CB or LPS exposed <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice would alter the vasomotor function in aortas from naÃ¯ve C57BL/6 mice. There was an increased vasoconstriction response in aorta rings that were incubated with 0.5% plasma from the low-dose CB exposed mice. Increasing the concentration to 1% caused a contraction in all three groups. This effect was attributed to increased level of serotonin in plasma of the exposed mice because incubation with ketanserin abolished the vasoconstriction response. The antihypertensive action of ketanserin in humans has been ascribed to its action on both the S<sub>2</sub>-serotoninergic and Î±<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref044">44</xref>]. However, it has been shown that the <italic>ex vivo</italic> contractile response of arteries to serum was abolished in the presence of ketanserin, whereas the Î±<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor prazosin had no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref055">55</xref>]. Extended <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultures of arteries in the presence of serum for 4 days also produced a progressive constriction and arterial wall remodeling, which was not released by treatment with ketanserin, indicating a different mechanism of constriction than soluble vasoconstrictors in long-term cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref056">56</xref>]. Unfortunately, we did not have sufficient quantities of plasma to measure the serotonin concentration. The concentration of serotonin in plasma is lower than serum; e.g. studies that have assessed serotonin concentration in samples from the same individuals have shown 3â15 versus 72â137 ng/ml in plasma and serum, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref058">58</xref>]. The higher serotonin concentration in serum could be related to release during the blood clot formation, which may cause degranulation of platelets. Indeed, it does seem that incubation with serum had a strong constriction response in other studies; e.g. 1% serum produced a constriction response in aorta rings that was comparable to that induced by KPSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref014">14</xref>]. Other observations from the same group showed that aorta rings from unexposed mice had a basal tonus of 8.8 mN and addition of 2.5% serum increased it with 5.3 mN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref020">20</xref>]. In comparison, the basal tonus was approximately 5 mN in aorta segments and addition of 0.5% plasma from CB-exposed mice produced approximately 40% increased tonus (i.e. a net increase of 2 mN). It is possible that the elevated serotonin concentrations in the plasma originate from platelets as either a cause or consequence of prothrombotic propensity (direct systemic administration of CB in mice has demonstrated to increase prothrombotic activity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref059">59</xref>]. In addition, i.t. instillation of CB in rats has resulted in platelet hyperactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref060">60</xref>], although other studies showed no effect on plasma levels of coagulation factors or infarct size after cardiac ischemic/reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref061">61</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref063">63</xref>]. An increased plasma concentration of serotonin might be a contributing factor to hypertension in humans due to increased vasoconstriction. Exposure to particulate matter in air pollution is associated with hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref064">64</xref>]. Interestingly, a panel study with personal black carbon measurements (i.e. a proxy-measure of air pollution) showed association between exposure and rapid changes in carotid arterial stiffening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref065">65</xref>]. Increased arterial stiffening is a predictor of cardiovascular disease mortality in patients with essential hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref066">66</xref>]. Moreover, it has also been shown that inhalation exposure to concentrated ambient air particulate matter in <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice augmented the vasoconstrictor response to serotonin in aorta rings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160731.ref067">67</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study shows that 10 weeks of i.t. instillation with nanosized CB, LPS or a combination in <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice induced pulmonary inflammation that was mainly characterized by an influx of neutrophils. The lung antioxidant defense (glutathione) and pulmonary expression of <italic>Saa3</italic> were unaffected by repeated exposures. We did not find evidence of accelerated progression of atherosclerosis in the aorta or BCA after exposure to CB or LPS. Nevertheless, plasma from <italic>ApoE</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice exposed to CB caused vasoconstriction when added to aorta rings from naÃ¯ve wild-type mice, which appeared to be related to increased plasma levels of serotonin.</p>

The SMD has been calculated using Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.0 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre. The Cochrane Collaboration. 2008). The SMD is the difference between the two groups divided by the pooled standard deviation. The SMD in the top and bottom graphs cannot be compared with nominal values (i.e. number of cells) because they represent different scales. The SMD for total cells is close to zero (i.e. no effect), whereas there is a slightly increased influx of neutrophils at the low doses. The dose of 18 Î¼g/mouse shows increased total cells as compared to low doses and a similar level of neutrophils. The responses at doses 54 and 162 Î¼g/mouse suggest a plateau for both total cells and neutrophils in BALF.</p>
