<abstract>
<p>Fungal endophytes have shown to affect plant growth and to confer stress tolerance to the host; however, effects of endophytes isolated from water plants have been poorly investigated. In this study, fungi isolated from stems (stem-E) and roots (root-E) of <italic>Mentha aquatica</italic> L. (water mint) were identified, and their morphogenetic properties analysed on <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (L.) Heynh., 14 and 21 days after inoculation (DAI). Nineteen fungi were analysed and, based on ITS analysis, 17 isolates showed to be genetically distinct. The overall effect of water mint endophytes on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> fresh (FW) and dry weight (DW) was neutral and positive, respectively, and the increased DW, mainly occurring 14 DAI, was possibly related to plant defence mechanism. Only three fungi increased both FW and DW of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> at 14 and 21 DAI, thus behaving as plant growth promoting (PGP) fungi. E-treatment caused a reduction of root depth and primary root length in most cases and inhibition-to-promotion of root area and lateral root length, from 14 DAI. Only <italic>Phoma macrostoma</italic>, among the water mint PGP fungi, increased both root area and depth, 21 DAI. Root depth and area 14 DAI were shown to influence DWs, indicating that the extension of the root system, and thus nutrient uptake, was an important determinant of plant dry biomass. Reduction of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root depth occurred to a great extent when plants where treated with stem-E while root area decreased or increased under the effects of stem-E and root-E, respectively, pointing to an influence of the endophyte origin on root extension. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>aquatica</italic> and many other perennial hydrophytes have growing worldwide application in water pollution remediation. The present study provided a model for directed screening of endophytes able to modulate plant growth in the perspective of future field applications of these fungi.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plants are sessile organisms characterized by developmental plasticity, which allows them to adapt to environmental conditions. In recent years, it has become clear that plants do not live alone, but are a component of the “holobiont”, “the host organism and all its symbiotic microbiota” [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] with associated microorganisms having a remarkable role in plant adaptation and survival [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A large group of plant-associated microorganisms is represented by endophytic fungi (Petrini 1986, see e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]) which, in natural ecosystems are hosted by most or, perhaps, all plants. Fungal endophytes may be mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal, the latter are primarily formed up by Ascomycota and include the clavicipitaceous endophytes of grasses and the more heterogeneous group of the nonclavicipitaceous (NC) endophytes [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to Brundrett [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], mycorrhizal associations differ from the non-mycorrhizal ones because of the construction of a specialized interface to transfer nutrients between hosts. Moreover, whilst the development of mycorrhizal fungi is restricted to roots, non-mycorrhizal endophytes may grow into the roots (e.g. the dark septate endophytes (DSE) [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]) or the stem-leaf system, or both [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Diversity and abundance of non-mycorrhizal endophytes is very high, even in the same population, plant and organ [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and become enormous when considering the number of fungal strains of each species. However, despite their widespread occurrence, ecological role and the benefits of endophytic associations are still poorly understood, the responses of plants spanning from negative to positive. These latter, which mainly consist in increased stress tolerance towards biotic and abiotic stresses and plant growth, have generally been ascribed to modulation of nutrient uptake, plant phytohormones and antioxidant responses [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, some NC endophytes, growing in a stressful environment, have shown to confer habitat-adapted benefits to the host growing under the same, but not other, type of stress [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Endophytes have been mostly studied in terrestrial plants and their occurrence in water environments, as well as their effects on the aquatic hosts, is comparatively less known [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, a culture-dependent isolation method was applied to analyse <italic>in planta</italic> the effects of fungal endophytes inhabiting shoots and submerged roots of water mint (<italic>Mentha aquatica</italic>). This plant is a facultative hydrophyte, which has been used in monitoring water ecosystems quality [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is a good candidate for water phytodepuration in constructed wetlands because it presents large root surface supporting the growth of beneficial microbes and secretes substances into the rhizosphere that have shown to inhibit coliform bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Besides, water mint tolerates prolonged dry conditions typical of seasonally flooded wetlands and intermittent streams [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Because little is known about growth and development of water mint <italic>in vitro</italic>, we assessed the effects of its endophytes on <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> to address the following questions: (1) are the overall effects of water mint endophytes on plant growth positive, neutral or negative? (2) is plant biomass influenced by the fungal-related root phenotype? and (3) does <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth response differ between endophytes isolated from roots and shoots?</p>
<p>The use of a non-host plant for this study was justified by the intrinsic characteristics of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and by its susceptibility to be colonized by a large variety of non-mycorrhizal symbiotic microorganisms [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] thus becoming a model plant to investigate endophytic interactions [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, almost for the DSE, the results obtained on model and native plants have shown to be similar [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>

<title>Fungal endophytes isolation</title>
<p>Fungal endophytes were isolated from stems (stem-E) and roots (root-E) of 20 individuals of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>aquatica</italic> growing in a water stream siding Demonte river, in the Valle Stura di Demonte, Cuneo, Italy (44°18.350′N, 7°22.296′E; 680 m a.s.l.). No specific permissions were required to take samples of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>aquatica</italic> at this location; the collection of live specimens was limited to five individuals per person a day as regulated by Regional legislation (Piedmont, Italy). The field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. Three pieces (4–5 cm long) for each plant and type of organ were washed under running tap water for at least two h and then incubated for 1 h in a 4% PPM<sup>™</sup> (v/v) water solution. Hereafter, stem explants were sterilized with 70% ethanol for 90 s, and 40% bleach plus 0.01% Tween 20 for 5 min; roots were sterilized with 95% ethanol for 30 s, 6% bleach plus 0.01% Tween 20 for 2 min and 2% chloramine T (w/v) in water plus 0.01% Tween 20 for 10 min. After five washes in distilled water, stems and roots pieces were cut in 10 mm-long segments, plated on Malt Extract Agar (MEA) medium and incubated at 23±1°C. Fungal colonies were isolated in pure cultures collecting aerial mycelia and classified according their morphology and growth rate in order to screen for different isolates. An imprint of the sterilized root or stem tissue was made on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium to check for effectiveness of sterilization. Water mint endophytes were grown and maintained on MEA medium and subcultured regularly.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Molecular identification of endophytic fungi</title>
<p>Fungal mycelia were scraped from pure cultures grown on MEA medium for 2 weeks at 25°C in the dark and ground to a fine powder with liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Total DNA was extracted using the Qiagen Mini Kit following manufacturer’s instructions. The ITS region was amplified with primers ITS1F/ITS1 [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and ITS4 [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. PCR was performed in 25 μl reaction volume following [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Inc. (Amsterdam, Europe). Sequence<strike>s</strike> were assembled and edited in Geneious v. 8.1.2 [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and then submitted to GenBank. Blast database searches were performed with ITS-fragments queries to reveal relationships to published sequences.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Plant material and growth conditions</title>
<p>Endophytes were evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> for their effects on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0 ecotype. Seeds were surface sterilized with 75% ethanol for 90 s and 10% bleach plus 0.01% Tween 20 for 5 min. After five washes in distilled water, seeds were sown and grown on square agar plates (120×120×17 mm) containing 0.2×MS medium [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with the addition of 0.5% myo-inositol (w/v), 0.02% glycine (w/v), 0.5% sucrose (w/v) (pH corrected to 5.7 with NaOH) and incubated at 7±1°C for 72 h. Thereafter, plants were placed in a plant growth chamber with a photoperiod of 18 h of light/6 h darkness, light intensity of 150 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup>, and temperature of 23±1°C. Plates were placed at an angle of 70° to allow root growth along the agar surface and to prompt aerial growth of the hypocotyls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Plant and fungal co-cultures</title>
<p>Two mycelial plugs (7 mm diameter) cut with a sterile cork borer in non-sporulating fungal cultures were aseptically placed at a 7 cm distance from the root tip of 4-d-old germinated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings (13 seedlings per plate). Exact plugs positioning was determined in a previous experiment to avoid as much as possible any contact between fungal mycelia and growing plants. In the case of sporulating isolates of <italic>Penicillium</italic>, fungal spore density of 10<sup>6</sup> were inoculated with a sterile pipette inside two holes cored in the agar medium (50 μl each) in the same position as the mycelial plugs. Plates were doubled sealed with Parafilm. E-treated plants consisted of eight plates for each endophyte, cultured for and analysed at two different sampling periods: 14 and 21 DAI. Control plates were inoculated with plugs of MEA medium or 100 μl sterile water. Endophyte-treated plants (E-treatments) and controls were cultured at the same conditions used for germination and analysed 14 and 21 DAI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Plant fresh and dry weights</title>
<p>Four groups of three plants were measured for each treatment. Immediately after harvest, plants were blotted dry on a paper towel to remove excess of agar and water, and fresh weight (FW) measured on an analytical scale. Plant dry weights (DW) were obtained after drying plant material in a ventilated oven at 60°C to a constant weight. DWs were measured after allowing plant material to cool down to room temperature inside a desiccator. Percentage of dry-to-fresh mass were also calculated as the % ration between FWs and DWs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Root system morphology</title>
<p>Images of the whole plants were acquired with an Epson Perfection V300 scanner (Epson America, USA) at 600 dpi, using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, USA) and saved in TIFF format. At each sampling time, to evaluate the capacity of the root system to explore the growth medium, the root area and the root depth were determined. The root area was determined as the total root surface included in a rectangular frame having a 20 mm width; five frames for each treatment were analysed. Within each frame, root depth was measured as the length of projection on a Y axes of the distance between the root collar and the more distal root apex (<xref rid="pone.0143353.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Images were processed with ImageJ 1.48v.</p>
<p>Root system architecture (RSA) was determined 14 DAI on E-treatments showing significant alterations in FW and/or DW in relation to controls and at both sampling times. The total number and length of 1<sup>st</sup> order lateral roots, and the length of the primary root were measured in 6 plants per treatment. Branching of the primary root was calculated as the ratio between the number of emerged laterals and primary root length (mm).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data variability and comparison with controls were represented by using boxplots drawn in R (version 3.1.2). Variability of aggregated values of plant fresh and dry weights, % dry weights, root areas and root depths were also presented for stem endophytes (stem-E), root endophytes (root-E) and all fungi (E). The significance of differences between the control and E-treatments was statistically evaluated by ANOVA with Dunnett’s test for multiple comparison of means implemented in R package <italic>multcomp</italic>. Differences were considered significant at a probability level of p&lt;0.05. To equalize variances, biomasses and RSA parameters were log<sub>10</sub> transformed. Percentage data of dry weights were transformed to arcsin square root percentage before analysis.</p>
<p>To look for correlations between root morphometric parameters and plant biomasses, linear regression analysis (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>) on mean values at 14 and 21 DAI were performed.</p>

<p>Co-culture of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with the fungal isolate SS and RT6c increased the FW of about 30% in relation to the controls, while SE, SL, SO, ST2, RL3 and RT5a decreased significantly it (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). The highest inhibition, of about 67%, was induced by the fungal isolate RT5a, while the reduction of plant biomasses due to the other fungi ranged between 29 and 49%.</p>
<p>Only a few fungal endophytes which significantly affected FW 14 DAI, affected it also 21 DAI; they were: SS, which significantly increased FW, and SE, SL, RL3 and RT5a, which negatively affected it (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). Some fungal isolates significantly increased (SB and RT5b) or decreased (RT10) FW 21 DAI only (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). A significant correlation was found between FWs of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> sampling time (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.396; P = 0.002) and the analysis of pooled data on FW did not indicate any significant difference between controls and E-treated plants, despite a slight decrease was found in relation to controls (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c and 1d</xref>).</p>

<title>Root system architecture (RSA)</title>
<p>The morphometric parameters related to RSA of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were analysed 14 DAI on ten E-treatments that were characterized by coherent and significant alterations in FW and/or DW in relation to controls at both samplings.

<p>None of the selected endophytes increased the number of first order lateral roots of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with respect to the control plants, and decreases were significant for four of them: SE, SL, RL3 and RT5a (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8a</xref>).

<p>The general reduction in both the primary root length and in the number of lateral roots led to a not-significant effect on the primary root branching of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in most cases. In fact, lateral root density of the primary root was modified significantly only by the SL fungal isolate of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>luteo-olivacea</italic>, which increased it due to the strong shortening of the primary root (Figs <xref rid="pone.0143353.g004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0143353.g008" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>).</p>

<p>As expected, in terms of plant biomass, the effects of water mint endophytes ranged from inhibition to promotion of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth (Figs <xref rid="pone.0143353.g001" ref-type="fig">1a and 1b</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0143353.g002" ref-type="fig">2a and 2b</xref>). In some cases the effects observed were consistent with the literature as it happened for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>strictum</italic> (SS) which showed a PGP effect on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d and 4d’</xref>) and other hosts [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. On the contrary, the water mint isolate SB, genetically close to the pathogen <italic>Phoma macrostoma</italic> with bioherbicidal activity [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], in our study turned to be a PGP fungus (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b’</xref>). The opposite occurred with the water mint isolates SE, RT5a and RL3, which affected negatively <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plant biomass, although <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pullulans</italic> was described as a biological control agent capable of beneficial effects on hosts [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>resedanum</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>solitum</italic> strains showed to be beneficial or neutral when associated to <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], respectively.</p>
<p>Differences between our results and those of the literature can rely on different experimental procedures. However, fungal isolates belonging to the same species may behave differently. Variability of plant host effects among different isolates of the same species has been documented in the literature for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>solitum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>luteo-olivacea</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Accordingly, in our work the two isolates of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>luteo-olivacea</italic> exerted a strong and opposite influence on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth. In fact, SA significantly increased FW, DW and root area while SL decreased the same characters, 21 DAI (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), indicating that different isolates of the same species may behave differently even when isolated from the same plant organ.</p>
<p>As a whole, water mint endophytes exerted a neutral/beneficial effect on plant growth (see FW and DW pooled data, Figs <xref rid="pone.0143353.g001" ref-type="fig">1c and 1d</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0143353.g002" ref-type="fig">2c and 2d</xref>). This contrasts with results from a recent meta-analysis conducted on DSE, where the response of total biomass to fungal inoculation was about 18% lower than non-inoculated controls [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], despite the observed PGP effect of a number of DSE [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
<p>All water mint endophytes induced an increase of % dry-to-fresh biomass 14 DAI at least (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>), mainly due to a general increase in DW (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a–2d</xref>). Variation of plant biomass following fungus inoculation is frequently expressed as variations in fresh or dry weights [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and % dry-to-fresh biomass has been rarely reported. However, PGP endophytes such as <italic>P</italic>. <italic>indica</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and PGP-HSF [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], increased more the fresh than the dry biomasses of <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> and <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>, respectively, while in other cases the influence of endophytes on the % in DW and FW were rather similar [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, the increase in the DW unrelated to FW observed in our work (SL23, ST2, RT6c and RT10; compare Figs <xref rid="pone.0143353.g001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0143353.g003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) is difficult to explain. We suspected that a number of water mint isolates behaved as mild pathogens when co-cultured with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, as generally occurs during non-systemic endophyte infection [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and references therein]. In response, plants may have reduced cell elongation, thus producing more cells per volume unit, and/or increased cell wall thickness [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]). Auxin, which is known to be extremely important not only in plant development [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] but also in plant-pathogen interactions and plant defence mechanisms (reviewed by [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]), could tentatively be involved in this response.</p>
<p>Water mint endophytes affected significantly <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root shape and extension and a significant decrease of root depth with respect to control plants occurred by 14 DAI, in almost all treatments (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a and 6b</xref>). This accorded with the substantial and consistent reduction of the primary root length induced by the ten selected fungi 14 DAI (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8c</xref>). Because this occurred along with a general reduction of the number of lateral roots (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8a</xref>), root branching did not change significantly with most endophytes (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8d</xref>).</p>
<p>A comparison of the effects of the different fungi on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root development 14 DAI showed that the reduction in root depth and total root area with respect to control plants was related to plant growth on a DW basis (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.21; P = 0.024 and adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.37; P = 0.003, respectively). On the contrary, significant relations were not found among the same parameters 21 DAI. This indicates that the effect exerted by a number of endophytes on DW could depend on a root system more or less efficient in nutrient absorption in the early growth stages.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that alterations in RSA can influence plant growth independently of nutrient uptake by regulating plant-microorganism interactions. A reduction in root length, as above explained, may be related to more rigid cell walls and greater resistance towards pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Moreover, RSA plays a significant role in determining composition and quantity of exudates (reviewed by [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]). Water mint isolates, by changing the proportion of apical, elongating and mature root zone, may regulate the release of nutrients, gases, anti-microbial or signalling compounds, which are important chemical mediators between plant and rhizospheric microorganisms and, as already discussed, can also affect the phytodepurative properties of the plant [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Microbial endophytes can influence plant morphogenesis directly, by releasing auxins, or indirectly, through regulating auxin biosynthesis, homeostasis and signalling in host tissues [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Because one of the most striking effect of E-treatment on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was primary root shortening, which is typically induced by high concentrations of auxin [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143353.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], we estimated the presence of IAA derivatives in water mint endophytes growth medium. None of the water mint endophytes produced IAA derivatives in liquid culture, with the exclusion of SA (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>luteo-olivacea</italic>), whose IAA-derivatives level (0.055 μg/ml; <xref rid="pone.0143353.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>) was however lower than the range of concentrations reported for other fungal endophytes [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The response of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to SA was characterized by a significant increase of DW and root area, only 21 DAI, and by a strong reduction in the length of the primary root and root depth, without a significant branching increase (14 DAI). Therefore, growth alterations produced by SA accorded only in part with the production of auxin by the fungus [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and were similar to those induced e.g. by SS, whose auxin levels were not detectable. This led us to suppose the influence of other factors on root development, although a more specific auxin content quantification, and the use of auxin synthesis and signaling <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants are needed to draw any conclusion.</p>
<p>Plant tissues and organs represent different ecological niches with regard to endophyte diversity, favouring host-specific and organ-specific endophytes [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Fungal endophytes have been shown to produce and release different substances according to the tissue or organ of origin [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Our results pointed to a dependence of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root morphogenesis on the organ source of endophytes. In fact, although pooled data showed comparable effects of stem-E and root-E on FW (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c and 1d</xref>), the increase in dry biomasses of E-treatments was mainly ascribable to stem-E, 21 DAI (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root area decreased or increased under the effects of stem-E and root-E, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c and 5d</xref>) and reduction of root depth occurred to a great extent when plants where treated with stem-E (<xref rid="pone.0143353.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6c and 6d</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We proposed a model for the occurrence of plant growth-modulating traits in water mint-associated fungi, contributing to elucidate the role on plant growth of fungi living in an aquatic environment.</p>
<p>Our analyses allowed us to recognize three PGP fungi, SB, SS and RT5b, which increased both FW and DW of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> at 14 and 21 DAI. However, effects of these fungi on root extension were variable: two of them, SB and SS, increased root area significantly 21 DAI, while only SB enhanced root depth 21 DAI. In general, although <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> responses to inoculation varied significantly according to the fungal endophyte, with effects ranging from inhibition to promotion of plant growth, we were able to establish that: (1) <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth responses under the influence of water mint endophytes in terms of FW and DW were neutral and positive, respectively; the effect on DW addressing to a typical plant response toward non-systemic and potentially pathogenic infections; (2) a consistent decrease in root depth and primary root length were the main features of root extension modulation which influenced DWs 14 DAI; (3) Root extension was likely related to the source organ (shoot or root), although this aspect need further confirmation.</p>
<p>Many questions remain unresolved; nevertheless this model could be used for screening the ability of other endophytes to modulate <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RSA, in the perspective of future field applications of these fungi.</p>
<p>Water mint is a facultative hydrophyte that, due to its relatively high biomass, fast growth and depurative capacity, is useful for phytodepuration in constructed wetlands [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In these systems, plant health is affected by the toxicity of contaminants and other environmental stresses, such as frequent fluctuation in water depth, which reduce biomass production and thus limits the purification process. Some endophytes have shown to reduce stress [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and those with PGP activity, such as the water mint isolates SA, SB and SS, may improve the process of phytodepuration through enhancing plant growth. Moreover, larger root areas, other than increase plant nutrient and contaminant absorption, may give greater chances of establishing beneficial associations with rhizobacteria [<xref rid="pone.0143353.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Root growth modulation by fungal endophytes towards more efficient and stress tolerant plants would be therefore tested in watermint and other macrophytes to withstand the pollutant loading and the stresses associated with these aquatic treatment systems. Future studies will be also addressed to the exploitation in field of fungal-related plant phenotypes to produce environmentally friendly bio-inoculants and enhance phytodepurative properties of plants.</p>
