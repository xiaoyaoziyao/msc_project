Paradoxically, classical anti-psychotic, anti-calmodulin drugs were noted here to inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake <italic>via</italic> the vanilloid inducible Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel/inflamatory pain receptor 1 (TRPV1), which suggests that calmodulin inhibitors may block pore formation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Functional assays on TRPV1 expressing cells support direct, dose-dependent inhibition of vanilloid-induced <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake at µM concentrations: calmidazolium (broad range)≥trifluoperazine (narrow range)&gt;chlorpromazine/amitriptyline&gt;fluphenazine&gt;&gt;W-7 and W-13 (only partially). Most likely a short acidic domain at the pore loop of the channel orifice functions as binding site either for Ca<sup>2+</sup> or anti-calmodulin drugs. Camstatin, a selective peptide blocker of calmodulin, inhibits vanilloid-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake in intact TRPV1<sup>+</sup> cells, and suggests an extracellular site of inhibition. TRPV1<sup>+</sup>, inflammatory pain-conferring nociceptive neurons from sensory ganglia, were blocked by various anti-psychotic and anti-calmodulin drugs. Among them, calmidazolium, the most effective calmodulin agonist, blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry by a non-competitive kinetics, affecting the TRPV1 at a different site than the vanilloid binding pocket. Data suggest that various calmodulin antagonists dock to an extracellular site, not found in other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels. Calmodulin antagonist-evoked inhibition of TRPV1 and NMDA receptors/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels was validated by microiontophoresis of calmidazolium to laminectomised rat monitored with extracellular single unit recordings <italic>in vivo</italic>. These unexpected findings may explain empirically noted efficacy of clinical pain adjuvant therapy that justify efforts to develop hits into painkillers, selective to sensory Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels but not affecting motoneurons.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>ZO was supported by MC-IRG030854-PAINKILLER; Anyos Jedlik Program NKFP-1-00019/2005; GVOP-3.3.1-05/1.-2005-05-0057/3.0.

Dynamics of TRP cation channel opening and closing has remained largely unknown, although various mechanisms have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Jung1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Bhave1">[14]</xref>. Due to lack of purification and crystallization protocol the three-dimensional (3D) structure information is scarce, the initial conformation change and subsequent steps leading to pore opening/closing has yet to be elucidated. Better understanding of transmembrane proteins is hampered by process development such as high scale production, solubilization, and purification, which preserves the native state and function. As in case of many transmembrane domain proteins/ion channels, 3D structure of TRPV1 is still subject of intense research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Jordt2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Kedei1">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Calmodulin is the most well-known calcium binding protein, which is ubiquitous and preserved in the eukaryotic cell, either human, animal, fungal or plant. Ca<sup>2+</sup>, among others, selectively interacts with the so-called “EF-hand”/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein motifs located either intracellularly or extracellularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Donato1">[17]</xref>. Dose-dependent interaction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with calmodulin elicits a robust conformational change that exposes hidden hydrophobic domains required for subsequent effects on down-stream protein targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Likic1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Douglass1">[19]</xref>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>- calmodulin complex, formed upon entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the cytosol resulting in elevation of intracellular free calcium [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> can turn on/off different enzymes and ion channels. Camstatin, a recently found conserved polypeptide motif in PEP-19, neurogranin and neuromodulin, has been noted to enhance dissociation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from calmodulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Slemmon1">[20]</xref> and disable interaction with down-stream targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Johanson1">[21]</xref>. These observations suggest that one of the major functions of calmodulin would be to buffer and/or neutralize the rapid increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, thus to prevent excitotoxicity. Serving as a shut off valve on broad-spectra of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup>- calmodulin protects Ca<sup>2+</sup>-overload-induced cell death, either due to necrotic or apoptotic mechanisms. The specific intracellular sites has been identified but the exact mechanism of calmodulin binding is still debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Rosenbaum1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Numazaki1">[23]</xref>.</p><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup>- calmodulin mediated feedback due to increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, has recently been elucidated in detail in case of the TRP3 channel. It has been noted that upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depletion, IP<sub>3</sub>R, a sensor of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-load of ER, directly interacts and props the TRP3<sub>PM</sub> channel open by the so-called “store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry” mechanism. Indeed, one or two specific domains of IP<sub>3</sub>R can interact with cognate sites of TRP3<sub>PM</sub> and contribute to opening of the pore. However, both Ca<sup>2+</sup>- calmodulin and cytoplasmic domain of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>ER</sub> competes for an overlapping site and either open or close the given TRP channel, respectively and the preference only depends on the levels of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. In fact, calmodulin, upon saturation with Ca<sup>2+</sup> displaces IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>ER</sub>, which leads to termination of store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup>- calmodulin can be displaced by excess synthetic peptides, derived either from the competitive IP<sub>3</sub>R motif or from the heterologous myosin light chain kinase. The former is known to block IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>ER</sub> binding to TRP3<sub>PM</sub> by direct competition, whereas, cognate domain from myosin light chain kinase, as well as calmidazolium, inhibit the interaction indirectly, due to prevention of Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading of calmodulin. It is conceivable that either mechanism can serve as a shut off valve of TRP3<sub>PM</sub>. In general, either disruption of a TRP-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel interaction or block of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-feedback by anti- calmodulin agents can deregulate store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and cause eventually excitotoxicity and cell death by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-overload <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Zhang1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Tang1">[25]</xref>. Indeed, application of calmidazolium to HL-60 cells has recently been shown to increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, which is consistent with disrupted Ca<sup>2+</sup>- calmodulin feedback regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Harper1">[26]</xref>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>- calmodulin-mediated termination of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry is not confined to TRP channels only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Gamper1">[27]</xref>, rise of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> also shuts off M-, and L-type voltage-gated channels. Opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated, small conductance K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channels is elicited by calmodulin binding to the C-terminus. Further elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and saturation of calmodulin with Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivate the pore opening mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-BrueningWright1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Soldatov1">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Consistent with this Ca<sup>2+</sup>-feedback theory, anti- calmodulin agents, such as calmidazolium are expected to suspend the feedback on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry, and thus potentiate elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to toxic levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Boulay1">[30]</xref>. Classical antipsychotic drugs, such as trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine and fluphenazine also target calmodulin, so they were also hypothesised to deregulate agonist-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase. To test this hypothesis and better understand channel function of TRPV1, we carried out experiments with tricyclic anti-psychotic calmodulin antagonist drugs and other selective inhibitors of calmodulin. Our new data, in lieu of expectations, suggest that <italic>bona fide</italic> calmodulin antagonists blocks and do not promote Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport <italic>via</italic> TRPV1.</p><p>To address paradoxical effects of anti- calmodulin agents, we hypothesized that these compounds might not enter the cell, but inhibit the pore opening of pain/TRPV1 channel, most likely directly at the cation filter site, located at the extra-cellular orifice of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel. In fact, sequence comparisons of various TRP channels suggest that a short acidic amino acid stretch at the pore loop of TRPV1 resembles to “EF-hand” and “<italic>Excalibur</italic>” motifs, both identified previously in calmodulin and calmodulin-like proteins, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Rigden1">[31]</xref>. Since direct sequence homology was not that obvious, structure and function of TRPV1 was probed with various anti-calmodulin agents such as antipsychotic drugs and homologues with basic pharmacophore similar to that identified in calmidazolium. Functional assays were carried out in TRPV1-NIH3T3 cells permanently expressing the receptor ectopically, and in primary cultures from embryonic rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG), enriched in TRPV1<sup>+</sup> nociceptor/pain neurons.</p><p>Consistent with our hypothesis, but contrary to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin feedback theory, a set of anti-calmodulin agents acutely inhibited the vanilloid/capsaicin–induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake in TRPV1 expressing cells and neurons. Extracellularly added camstatin peptide, an antagonist of calmodulin, also blocked capsaicin–induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake in intact cells. Studies carried out at the cellular levels and in animal pain models were in concert with previously noted analgesic actions of calmodulin-antagonists determined <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Menendez1">[32]</xref>, but we gave here new evidence that calmodulin antagonists can directly block ion channel function of TRPV1. We suggest that the analgesic effect of these calmodulin antagonists is independent of conventional intracellular targets and we propose a specific site of action located extracellularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Numazaki1">[23]</xref>. Pharmacophores of various calmodulin inhibitors studied here may yield discovery of novel analgesics in the near future <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Williams1">[33]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To better understand potential effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- calmodulin inhibitors on nociception, activity of various phenothiazines were studied at the molecular levels in TRPV1-NIH 3T3 cells, in which the pain signal was mimicked with capsaicin-induced <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000545-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Assays were carried out in 2×10<sup>−5</sup> M extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in 96 well plate formats at room temperature (22°C) for 10 min with robotic liquid handling. Briefly, cells were co-incubated with capsaicin for vanilloid-induced opening of TRPV1. Various Ca<sup>2+</sup>- calmodulin inhibitors were co-incubated in progressively increasing concentration in the 2 µM capsaicin supplemented incubation medium. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake was expected, due to a severe damage of shut off valve mechanism caused by the presence of calmodulin antagonists. Contrary to this theory, detailed referring to other TRP channels in the introduction, we noted that the tested calmodulin inhibitors inhibited the capsaicin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake in TRPV1-NIH3T3 cells with varying potency: calmidazolium (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7 µM)&gt;trifluoperazine (IC<sub>50</sub> = 9 µM)&gt;chlorpromazine (IC<sub>50</sub> = 70 µM)&gt;W-7 (IC<sub>50</sub>∼200 µM)&gt;fluphenazine (IC<sub>50</sub>∼250 µM), and W-13 (IC<sub>50</sub>&gt;300 µM), and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> did not accumulate in these cells at even higher concentrations of calmodulin inhibitors. The same agents were also tested in the absence of capsaicin, where none of them induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, i.e., they did not activate the vanilloid receptor. For the sake of clarity these curves were omitted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000545-g001">Fig 1</xref>. and the following figures also (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000545-g002">Fig 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000545-g003"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000545-g004"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000545-g005"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000545-g006">6</xref>). Efficacy of calmidazolium in the µM scale was also validated in a human TRPV1-HaCaT keratinocyte line (data not shown). Interestingly, fluphenazine, but less pronouncedly both W13 and W7 increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake in the presence of 2 mM capsaicin at low concentrations. Similar cooperative effect was noted previously between [<sup>3</sup>H] resiniferatoxin and different antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Acs1">[34]</xref>. We hypothesized that calmodulin antagonists and some registered drugs may exert their blocking effect with another mechanisms on TRPV1 and not necessarily on their conventional target. Acting extracellularly, the inhibitors prevent TRPV1 activation, therefore the intracellular calmodulin might be secondary and has little if any effect on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signal induced by inflammatory pain agonists either exo-, or endogenous.</p><fig id="pone-0000545-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000545.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Antagonist activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin inhibitors in TRPV1-NIH3T3 cells.</title><p><sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake experiments were carried out in 96 well plates with robotic liquid handling.

Amitriptyline and fluphenazine showed almost an order of magnitude less blocking efficacy among the registered drugs on TRPV1. Terfluzine® would be an adjuvant of choice in therapeutic protocols to potentiate either efficacy of opioids or NSAIDs, although, some other factors, for example inadvertent side effects, specificity to calmodulin and ADMETox characteristics can modify optimal selection. Calmidazolium, a miconazole type calmodulin antagonist was ranked to the 1<sup>st</sup> place. We showed in laminectomised rat models that calmidazolium inhibits pain response to noxious heat, moreover firing evoked by NMDA and kainic acid. In the spinal dorsal horn calmidazolium inhibits other channels than the heat and inflammatory pain channel and it is active on NMDA and kainic acid receptors that usually prolong the duration of pain state.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is usually followed by a currently recognized mechanism, so called store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, which replenish the ER store emptied by different Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels, including the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/vanilloid-induced TRPV1<sub>ER</sub>. The usual function of store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is to maintain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-homeostasis, around 1 mM in the ER, and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> = 10<sup>−7</sup> M, both essential for pain signaling in primary afferents sensory neurons. Coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is now a well accepted hypothesis, therefore, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is an ideal test-bead for searching specific inhibitors affecting either one or both the TRPV1<sub>PM</sub> and TRPV1<sub>ER</sub> pools. Contrary to that noted with other TRP channels, calmodulin antagonists do not eliminate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-feedback. Even more, an initial observation with the camstatin peptide prompted us to hypothesise that antipsychotic inhibitors of calmodulin eliminate vanilloid-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake due to binding to an extracellular domain of TRPV1. Likewise, calmidazolium may block noxious heat-, NMDA- and kainic acid -induced pain signaling by a mechanism that does not need internalization of the compound in laminectomised rat.

Our theory is that a short segment of the pore loop may mimic some feature of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins where anti-calmodulin drugs dock and inhibit down-stream signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000545-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). Ruthenium red is widely used as a channel blocker in electrophysiology of sensory neurons, but only just recently has been mapped to bind at the acidic tetrad of TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000545-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). Camstatin, a highly basic and lysine rich polypeptide may recognize this calmodulin-like region and block the TRPV1 channel without internalization. This particular domain of the pore loop may also serve as a cation filter and anti-calmodulin compounds can bind after Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds first to this TRPV1 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000545-g010">Fig. 10</xref>), thereby preventing pore opening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-Mohapatra1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000545-GarciaMartinez1">[45]</xref>.

Single unit extracellular recordings were made from selected dorsal horn neurons characterized by their responses to both innocuous (brush, pressure) and noxious (pinch, squeeze that was felt as painful by the experimenter) stimuli applied to the excitatory receptive fields of the hind paw. Mechanical stimuli of increasing strength were delivered by a small brush and three serrated clamps with a graduated force. The experimenter released clamps so that force was standard for each mechanical stimulus delivered over a period of 3 s, and about 1 min were allowed to pass between trials. Neurons were characterized as low threshold (LT), nociceptive specific (NS) or wide dynamic range (WDR) by their responses to mechanical stimuli of increasing strength. Extracellular signals from dorsal horn neurons were amplified and filtered (300 Hz to 8 KHz) using an ExAmp-20K equipment and preamplifier (Kation Scientific). Neuronal activity was displayed on an oscilloscope and through an audio analyzer and detected with a WD-2 window discriminator (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN). The number of action potentials per second was counted by the computer and the resulting peristimulus time histograms were displayed. Iontophoretic drug delivery and collection of experimental data were performed by a multifunction data acquisition board (PCI-1200, National Instruments, Austin, TX) placed in a computer and programmed in LabVIEW 7 (National Instruments). Delivery of drugs by microiontophoresis was performed using Union-36 constant current source units (Kation Scientific).

NMDA and kainic acid were ejected with negative iontophoretic currents ranging from 10 to 100 nA for 5 s in every 2 min. calmidazolium was ejected with positive currents at 100 nA for 120 s.

The structure of the receptor-ligand complex was approximated by minimizing with the prepositioned ligand. The backbone of the residues of the receptor complex outside the 20 angstrom boundary from the inhibitor molecule were constrained in a fixed position allowing larger movement of the neighboring amino acids only. The calmidazolium, holding an inherent positive charge, was fixed by closely surrounding Asp and Glu residues. No aromatic-aromatic interactions were observed indicating the dominance of charged residues in the channel blocking process.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
