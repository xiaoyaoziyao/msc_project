<abstract>
<p>Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) is an enterovirus that is both genetically and antigenically closely related to human coxsackievirus B5 within the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family. SVDV is the causative agent of a highly contagious (though rarely fatal) vesicular disease in pigs. We report a rapid method that is suitable for sequencing the complete protein-encoding sequences of SVDV isolates in which the RNA is relatively intact. The approach couples a single PCR amplification reaction, using only a single PCR primer set to amplify the near-complete SVDV genome, with deep-sequencing using a small fraction of the capacity of a Roche GS FLX sequencing platform. Sequences were initially verified through one of two criteria; either a match between a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and a reference mapping, or a match between all of five different reference mappings performed against a fixed set of starting reference genomes with significant genetic distances within the same species of viruses. All reference mappings used an iterative method to avoid bias. Further verification was achieved through phylogenetic analysis against published SVDV genomes and additional <italic>Enterovirus B</italic> sequences. This approach allows high confidence in the obtained consensus sequences, as well as provides sufficiently high and evenly dispersed sequence coverage to allow future studies of intra-host variation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Swine vesicular disease (SVD) is a highly contagious viral disease of pigs. The first outbreak of SVD was observed in 1966 in Italy, although at the time, it was misidentified as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Nardelli1">[1]</xref>. Shortly after, the causative agent, SVD virus (SVDV), was shown to be an enterovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Nardelli1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Dawe1">[3]</xref> and classified as a member of the <italic>Enterovirus B</italic> species within the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family. It is a non-enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity of approximately 7.4 kb in length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Inoue1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Seechurn1">[5]</xref>, and shares the same physico-chemical properties of other enteroviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Nardelli1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Dawe1">[3]</xref>. Previous studies have confirmed that SVDV is antigenically related to the human pathogen coxsackievirus B5 (CV-B5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Graves1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Brown1">[7]</xref>, leading Graves to propose that SVD and its causative agent most likely originated from infection of pigs with a human CV-B5. A study comparing the complete nucleotide sequence of two SVDVs and one CV-B5, reported that CV-B5 is more closely related to SVDV than to other coxsackie B viruses in the regions encoding the major capsid proteins 1B, 1C and 1D (also known as VP2, VP3 and VP1, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Zhang1">[8]</xref>. Another study by Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Zhang2">[9]</xref> investigated the molecular evolution of SVDV. Here, they analyzed sequence data from 42 SVDV isolates and seven CV-B5 isolates in two shorter regions of the viral genomes; the regions encoding the capsid protein VP1 and the non-structural 3BC corresponding to 283 and 205 amino acids, respectively. They showed that SVDV formed a single monophyletic group, which was clearly distinct from any included CV-B5 as well as other coxsackieviruses included in the study. Furthermore, for each of these regions, the date for which SVDV is believed to have originated in pigs was estimated to have been between 1945 and 1965.</p>
<p>Due to improvements in DNA sequencing technologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Metzker1">[10]</xref>, and hence the ease with which sequencing data can be generated, sequencing and characterization of viral genomes has accelerated. Because SVDV is of ongoing veterinary concern, we anticipate future studies will have an interest in obtaining increased numbers of SVDV coding-region sequences. Therefore, we developed a simple method to reconstruct near-complete SVDV genomes (encompassing the complete coding region) that is suitable for application to SVDV isolates in which RNA is largely intact. The method is based on PCR amplification using only a single primer set to generate the near-complete SVDV genome, which is performed after first-strand cDNA synthesis and coupled to second-generation sequencing using the Roche GS FLX series of platforms, and is demonstrated on five SVDV isolates originating from Hong Kong during the 1970s. Sequence authenticity was validated in a multi-tiered approach (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097180-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Firstly through one of two criteria; either a match between a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and a reference mapping, or a match between all of five different reference mappings performed against a fixed set of starting reference genomes with significant genetic distances within the same species of viruses. All reference mappings used an iterative method to avoid bias. Secondly, final validation was achieved through phylogenetic analysis against published SVDV sequences and additional <italic>Enterovirus B</italic> viruses using the VP2-VP3-VP1 genome region. The success of the method suggests it will be a useful tool for future analyses into the origin and spread of SVDV.</p>

<title>Decision diagram for validation of consensus sequences.</title>
<p>The diagram illustrates the logic of the applied methodology for obtaining consensus sequences validated for further analysis. The process begins with <italic>de novo</italic> assembly as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">methods</xref> section. The starting point from there is the blue-outline box in the top left hand corner. Positive answers follow the green ‘YES’ arrows, negative ones follow the red ‘NO’ arrows, and grey arrows are followed in all cases. Termination in a red box should lead to thorough analysis of upstream sources of error, including everything from contaminated samples to late stage <italic>in silico</italic> problems. Arriving at the first green box means that the consensus sequence of assembly/mapping has been verified. Arriving at the final green box means that the sample sequence is fully validated, now also with regard to sample provenance. The sample sequence is now ready to be used for further scientific analysis.</p>

<p>RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) followed by 1<sup>st</sup> strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase, RNaseOUT, and dNTPs (all Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All components were mixed and centrifuged briefly before use. The following reagents were mixed in a 0.2mL PCR tube at a total of 12 µL: 5 µL RNA, 2 µM oligo(dT) primer, and 0.4 mM dNTPs. Samples were incubated 5 minutes at 65°C followed by a snap-chill on ice. To the RNA/primer/dNTP mix the following reagents were added to a total of 20 µL: 1× RT buffer, 10 mM DTT, 40 U RNaseOUT, and 200 U SuperScript III RT enzyme. After a gentle mix and brief centrifugation samples were incubated 50 min at 50°C followed by 15 min at 70°C. To each sample, 2 U RNase H was added, incubated for 20 min at 37°C, and transferred to ice. PCR amplification was performed using a single primer set, which was designed to amplify all coxsackie B viruses independent of serotype and based on an alignment of all available full genome coxsackie B virus sequences in GenBank (data not shown).

<title>Processing of data and sequence assembly/mapping</title>
<p>Sequence reads and their corresponding quality scores were imported and merged into Geneious (v.6.0.3 created by Biomatters, available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneious.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.geneious.com</ext-link>). Reads were separated by Multiplex Identifier (MID) barcodes allowing no mismatches. Further, only unique reads were kept (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097180-t001">Table 1</xref> for the number of total and unique reads for each sample following separation by barcode).</p>
<p>For the sake of validation and to avoid bias being introduced into the mapping process by the choice of reference sequence, a multi-tiered approach was chosen to obtain consensus sequences, and is illustrated in detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097180-g001">Figure 1</xref>. For each sample <italic>de novo</italic> assembly was attempted using the Geneious assembler (v.6.0.3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Kearse1">[13]</xref> starting with the lowest standard sensitivity setting, and if this failed to deliver a full-length contig the sensitivity was incremented following the standard settings. If a full-length contig was obtained, the veracity of the <italic>de novo</italic> consensus sequence was substantiated by performing an iterative mapping against one or more starting reference sequences (the starting reference sequence is only used in the first round in the iterative mapping process, whereas all subsequent rounds use the consensus from the contig of the previous round as reference), and ensuring that the two consensus sequences matched (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097180-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097180-g001">Figure 1</xref>). If no full-length contigs were obtained in the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, multiple iterative mappings against starting references of varying genetic distance (within the same species but including different serotypes, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097180-t001">Table 1</xref>) were performed using the Geneious Read Mapper (v.6.0.3) (see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://assets.geneious.com/documentation/geneious/GeneiousReadMapper.pdf" xlink:type="simple">http://assets.geneious.com/documentation/geneious/GeneiousReadMapper.pdf</ext-link>). The consensus sequences of these were then checked for identity and upon confirmation of this, the sequence was accepted. Mappings to (starting) references, including those used to confirm <italic>de novo</italic> results, used the medium sensitivity setting in Geneious (v.6.0.3) and importantly all used the iterative mapping feature, ensuring that sufficient iterations were allowed for mappings to converge to a stable (and thus unbiased) consensus sequence. All consensus sequences were called using a 50% strict consensus criterion. For samples where there were any differences between <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and reference mapping consensus sequences, the <italic>de novo</italic> derived result was chosen as final.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic-based sequence verification</title>
<p>We further validated the sequence assemblies through a phylogenetic approach. This was primarily done to ensure that the serology and sample provenance made sense in light of cladistics. Due to what is known of the nature of recombination in this genus of viruses, and because it is what determines serology, as it forms the external part of the capsid, the VP2-VP3-VP1 genome region was chosen for analysis. In addition to the five samples, publically available sequences from 50 isolates of SVDV and Coxsackievirus B1 to B6 were aligned in the MAFFT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Katoh1">[14]</xref> plugin (v.1.3) in Geneious (v.6.0.3), and visually inspected.

<title>Complete protein-encoding genomes</title>
<p>Nucleotide sequences encompassing the complete 6,558 bases coding region of five Hong Kong SVDV isolates (all from the 1970s) were deep sequenced and assembled into a 6,938 nucleotide sequence, extending 307 bases upstream of the coding region and 73 bases downstream (excluding stop codon). The sequences have been deposited in NCBI's GenBank under reference accessions KF963274- KF963278. Further, sequence data are accessible through EBI's European Nucleotide Archive with study accession number PRJEB5810 (for direct access: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB5810" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB5810</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Assembly and mapping statistics are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097180-t001">Table 1</xref>. The strong similarity for the statistics between mappings against different starting references for the same sample is a sign of the strength of the method, as they represent the statistics of the final resulting contig of the iterative mapping process. Thus they are a reflection of the fact that the mappings have all converged. This is further reflected in the lack of difference in the consensus sequences. For the samples where <italic>de novo</italic> was successful at full-length assembly, there are very few differences between the consensus sequence from these and those from the mappings (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097180-t001">Table 1</xref>) with a maximum of two polymorphic sites between all assembly/mappings for any sample. This level of accord should serve as a guide when applying the current methodology.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic reconstruction using a Maximum Likelihood approach</title>
<p>At nearly three times the length of alignments typically employed for VP1 based phylogenies, our alignment can be considered highly informative. The phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097180-g002">Figure 2</xref>), rooted on the branch between the CV-B5's and all other CV-B's, shows all CV-B5 sequences and all SVDV sequences forming a highly supported (bootstrap proportion 100/100) monophyletic cluster, with the SVDV sequences themselves forming a highly supported (bootstrap proportion 96/100) monophyletic cluster within this. This conforms to the currently accepted evolutionary relationship of the strains for this genomic region. Furthermore, the topology shows no apparent aberrations with regards to the geographical location or age of isolates vs. branch lengths with regards to the five SVDV samples.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic validation of samples.</title>
<p>Using a maximum likelihood approach as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref> on the 1B-1C-1D genome region, corresponding to the outer capsid proteins VP2, VP3 and VP1, final validation was obtained for the samples. The five Hong Kong SVDVs isolated in the 1970s and which were sequenced in this study, are shown in red and all other SVD virus isolates are shown in pink. Coxsackievirus B5 isolates are shown in blue, and other <italic>Enterovirus B</italic> serotypes are shown in black. As expected from the previous literature, all CV-B5 together with all SVDV form a monophyletic cluster. This is supported with a bootstrap proportion of 100/100. Within this cluster all the SVD virus isolates, including those sequenced in this study, form a monophyletic cluster with bootstrap support of 96/100. Additionally, none of the five presently sequenced Hong Kong isolates show any obvious aberrations with regards to their position in the topology concerning either geographical information or branch lengths (vs. age). The tree is rooted on the branch leading from CV-B5 to all other CV-B sequences, and all branch labels show support in the form of bootstrap proportions out of one hundred. Support values for nodes with minor importance regarding the verification are not shown.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The principal aim of this study was to develop a simple and rapid workflow for the sequencing of near-complete SVDV genome sequences, under the assumption that the samples contain suitable quality RNA for initial first-strand cDNA synthesis. With many samples available in cultures in reference banks such as that held at the Pirbright Institute, this is not an unlikely expectation. A limitation of the method, however, is that as it is based upon a single long-range PCR reaction, it will not be suitable for samples in which the SVDV RNA molecules are not near-complete length, thus in those situations other methods should be considered. Nevertheless, for isolates were the genome is intact, the primer set presented here will allow for the rapid generation of the complete coding genome.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was purely methodological, thus we do not wish to dwell on the phylogenetic results. However, the analysis demonstrates that all sequences cluster, as expected, among published SVDV sequence data, and overall the phylogenetic relationship for the full dataset is consistent with that previously generated using the VP1 gene sequences by Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097180-Zhang2">[9]</xref>. The data furthermore shows that assembly and mapping of the viral genomes and use of the validation strategy employed provides unbiased consensus sequences and is thus suitable for obtaining reliable results. Furthermore, contigs and assemblies have a sufficiently high and evenly distributed coverage to make them suitable for intra-host studies, should this be desired.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>In this study, near-complete genomes, encompassing complete coding regions, of five cultured SVDV isolates were generated in a simple and rapid manner. Given the known existence of large numbers of similarly cultured samples in archives, and known questions about the time and source of origin of SVDV as a livestock pathogen, we anticipate that our method may be of use for future studies that wish to address this question in more detail.</p>
