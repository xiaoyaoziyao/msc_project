<abstract>
<p>Dicer enzymes process double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small RNAs that target gene silencing through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Dicer enzymes are complex, multi-domain RNaseIII proteins, however structural minimalism of this protein has recently emerged in parasitic and fungal systems. The most minimal Dicer, <italic>Saccharomyces castellii</italic> Dicer1, has a single RNaseIII domain and two double stranded RNA binding domains. In the protozoan parasite <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> 27nt small RNAs are abundant and mediate silencing, yet no canonical Dicer enzyme has been identified. Although EhRNaseIII does not exhibit robust dsRNA cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic>, it can process dsRNA in the RNAi-negative background of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and in conjunction with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>castellii</italic> Argonaute1 can partially reconstitute the RNAi pathway. Thus, although EhRNaseIII lacks the domain architecture of canonical or minimal Dicer enzymes, it has dsRNA processing activity that contributes to gene silencing via RNAi. Our data advance the understanding of small RNA biogenesis in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> as well as broaden the spectrum of non-canonical Dicer enzymes that contribute to the RNAi pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Small RNAs (sRNAs) and the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway play critical roles in diverse processes across many eukaryotic systems [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since the discovery that small non-coding RNAs can direct targeted gene silencing, multiple classes of sRNAs and sRNA biogenesis pathways have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the classical primary RNAi pathway, Dicer (an RNaseIII endonuclease) recognizes and cleaves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into 20-30bp fragments that have 5'-monophosphate termini [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These duplexes are loaded into an RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) where one strand is preferentially retained to guide sequence-specific silencing of its target mRNA by Argonaute (Ago), a key component of RISC [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In nematodes, an amplified silencing response occurs through the production of secondary sRNAs by RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These secondary sRNAs are characterized by 5'-polyphosphate (5'-polyP) termini and are loaded into secondary AGOs to mediate silencing [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The only system other than nematodes in which 5'-polyP secondary sRNAs have been described is the parasitic protist <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, 5'-polyP sRNAs mediate nuclear RNAi and highly stable transcriptional gene silencing of virulence genes [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Although conserved in function, the structure of Dicer enzymes varies among eukaryotes [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Canonical Dicer enzymes contain a PAZ domain, which binds the 3'-end of the sRNA, and two RNaseIII domains, which dimerize to form the catalytic center of the enzyme [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Some canonical Dicer enzymes have additional domains such as an N-terminal helicase domain, a domain of unknown function (DUF 283), or a double-stranded RNA binding domain [dsRBD) [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, not all Dicer enzymes exhibit this canonical structure. Both <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> Dicers contain two RNaseIII domains but lack any other recognizable domains [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The most minimal eukaryotic Dicers are found in budding yeast, which contain a single RNaseIII domain and two C-terminal dsRBDs, although only one dsRBD is required for full activity <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As RNA hydrolysis requires dimerization of two RNaseIII domains, budding yeast Dicers form homodimers to function [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although Dicer enzymes play key roles in many RNAi pathways, Dicer-independent biogenesis of sRNAs also occurs. These include microRNA-451, for which AGO2 mediates cleavage to the mature species, and Piwi-interacting small RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> is an important human pathogen and the second leading cause of parasitic death worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A complex repertoire of sRNAs has been identified in this protozoan parasite including abundant 27nt sRNAs in the trophozoite stage [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The 27nt heterogenous sRNA population has 5'-polyP termini, associates with the abundant and nuclear localized EhAgo2-2, and mediates stable transcriptional gene silencing (13, 14]. The 5'-polyP structure of amebic sRNAs is similar to that of secondary sRNAs in nematodes, indicating that they are generated in a Dicer-independent manner [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, even in systems with secondary RNAi pathways, the process is initiated by a primary small interfering RNA (siRNA), which is generated by Dicer-dependent cleavage [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, the amplified silencing pathway, mediated by 5'-polyP sRNAs, also requires Dicer processing to initiate the cascade. The <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> genome encodes several core elements of the RNAi machinery including three Ago proteins (EhAgo2-1, EhAgo2-2, and EhAgo2-3) and two RdRP enzymes (EhRdRP1 and EhRdRP2). Despite a robust endogenous RNAi pathway, a canonical Dicer enzyme is notably absent in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> leaving open the question of how the secondary RNAi pathway is initiated and whether further divergence of the Dicer enzyme may have occurred in this parasitic protist. A gene with a single RNaseIII-domain (EHI_068740) is encoded in the genome [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This gene has been shown to have some dsRNA cleavage activity, although the specific size of the cleavage product and its loading into the RNAi pathway have not been demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study we explore whether EhRNaseIII (EHI_068740), the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> protein with a single RNaseIII domain but without a dsRBD or other domains typically found in Dicer enzymes, can function to contribute to gene silencing via RNAi. We found that while unable to robustly cleave dsRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> under standard experimental conditions, EhRNaseIII is capable of processing dsRNA and contributing to gene silencing in a heterologous system, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Our results not only broaden the understanding about potential sRNA biogenesis mechanisms in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> but also potentially expand the repertoire of non-canonical proteins and their contributions to RNAi pathways in non-model systems.</p>

<title>The <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> genome contains a single gene (EHI_068740) with an RNaseIII domain</title>
<p>A canonical Dicer enzyme that contains two RNaseIII domains and a PAZ or dsRBD domains has not been identified in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> genome [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Instead, only a single gene with a single RNaseIII domain and no other conserved domains is annotated in the genome (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). In order to identify other potential Dicer candidate genes, we conducted a bioinformatics search of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> genome for the most common domains found in Dicer enzymes (RNaseIII and PAZ) using profile Hidden Markov Models (HMM). For each domain we retrieved the Pfam-generated HMM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk" xlink:type="simple">http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>) as well as built our own HMM from a multiple sequence alignment of RNaseIII- or PAZ-containing proteins. To identify domains that may have been mis-annotated or overlooked in the genome annotation, we translated the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> genome in six frames and queried both the annotated and translated genomes with each HMM. Hits to each HMM with an e-value ≤ 0.5 were retained as viable candidates. EhRNaseIII was identified by both the Pfam RNaseIII HMM as well as the custom RNaseIII HMM in both the annotated and translated genomes, and was the only hit to meet the significance criteria (<xref rid="pone.0133740.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The PAZ domain HMM identified the three amebic Argonaute genes but no other genes that met the significance criteria (<xref rid="pone.0133740.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The possibility that the genome sequencing missed genomic regions with PAZ or RNaseIII domains given the 12.5x coverage is relatively low [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, these data indicate that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> does not contain a gene with domain features typical of a canonical Dicer enzyme. However, EhRNaseIII does contain all the conserved and catalytic residues characteristic of RNaseIII enzymes (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0133740.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>

<p>EhRNaseIII (EHI_068740) thus remains the only potential Dicer-like candidate in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>. The lack of a PAZ domain suggests that EhRNaseIII may require a cofactor that binds dsRNA in order to function efficiently. <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> Dicer-1, which fits the canonical Dicer structure, requires a dsRNA binding protein, RDE-4, to cleave dsRNA [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Alternatively, although no other domains have been identified in EhRNaseIII, it is possible that a divergent dsRBD may be present. Importantly, not all Dicers contain PAZ domains as notably both <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> Dicer enzymes lack identifiable PAZ or dsRBDs and yet are fully functional [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether EhRNaseIII is itself capable of functioning as a Dicer-like enzyme or whether additional proteins are required for activity.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>EhRNaseIII has limited dsRNA cleavage activity in vitro</title>
<p>To determine the role of EhRNaseIII in the amebic RNAi pathway, we attempted to downregulate EhRNaseIII through a variety of techniques including antisense strategies and an RNAi-trigger approach [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; however, they were not successful [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Additionally, we tried to impair endogenous EhRNaseIII protein activity using multiple dominant-negative approaches, which also proved ineffective in changing the abundance of amebic sRNA populations (Pompey and Singh, unpublished data). Given that EhRNaseIII is the sole RNaseIII domain gene in the genome and could be necessary for multiple aspects of RNA processing, we attributed the lack of downregulation as potentially indicating essential cellular function(s). With the difficulties of genetic manipulation, we turned to an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay to determine EhRNaseIII function. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays are a classic method to demonstrate substrate cleavage and have been used to prove the functionality of numerous Dicer enzymes in varied systems including <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, <italic>Giardia intestinalis</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, and the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces castellii</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Abed <italic>et al</italic>. previously reported RNaseIII activity <italic>in vitro</italic> in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> lysate with degradation of the dsRNA substrate within one hour and the appearance of a diffuse approximately 100bp product after a 16 hour incubation [27). We were able to recapitulate these findings in a similar <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assay using a pre-microRNA dsRNA substrate (pre-miR122), shorter incubation times, and whole cell lysate from trophozoites constitutively overexpressing EhRNaseIII (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Limited RNA processing was observed resulting in specific products of approximately 50-60nt and faint products around 20-21nt (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Addition of EDTA chelates the divalent cation, which is required for RNA hydrolysis and consequently inhibits RNaseIII activity [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, in the presence of EDTA, we were not able to detect processed products, suggesting that these products are specific results of dsRNA processing. Abundant 40-50nt non-specific products were detected despite the addition of EDTA likely due to the efficient cleavage of the imperfect stem-loop structure of pre-miR122. Recombinant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNaseIII efficiently cleaved the pre-miR122 substrate into specific products (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The use of cold single-stranded RNA and recombinant EhRNaseIII in cleavage reactions did not reduce substrate degradation (data not shown). Cleavage assays using whole cell lysate with endogenous levels of Dicer have been successful in other systems [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, it is likely that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> contains too many nucleases to allow for ample accumulation of small RNA cleavage products <italic>in vitro</italic> using whole cell extract or alternatively the EhRNaseIII enzyme may be of low efficiency leading to low level specific dsRNA cleavage.</p>

<p>We employed a less readily hydrolyzed substrate—a 125bp perfect duplex dsRNA (EhdsRNA) from EHI_165450, a gene with abundant endogenous 27nt antisense RNAs in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> trophozoites [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Extensive degradation was still observed with whole cell lysate from untransfected trophozoites (<xref rid="pone.0133740.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>) and using smaller volumes of lysate from parasites overexpressing EhRNaseIII did not improve degradation (<xref rid="pone.0133740.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Seeking to further minimize degradation and enrich for EhRNaseIII activity, we immunoprecipitated EhRNaseIII from EhRNaseIII-overexpressing parasites under a variety of wash conditions, yet no cleavage was detected (data not shown). The budding yeast Dicer <italic>S</italic>. <italic>castellii</italic> Dcr1 resembles EhRNaseIII in structure and is sufficient to generate sRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; therefore, we also assessed whether recombinant EhRNaseIII alone was capable of cleaving dsRNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. No RNA processing was observed under a range of magnesium chloride or salt concentrations (data not shown). Supplementing both recombinant protein and immunoprecipitation reactions with an additional divalent cation, calcium chloride, and extending reaction times to 24 hours did not yield specific cleavage products (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that either EhRNaseIII does not cleave dsRNA in the presence of magnesium or calcium or that the optimal conditions for EhRNaseIII immunoprecipitation and/or cleavage of dsRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> have not been identified. It is also possible that a cofactor, such as a dsRNA-binding protein, is needed for the dsRNA processing activity of EhRNaseIII.</p>

<title>EhRNaseIII and EhAgo2-2 do not reconstitute the RNAi pathway in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic></title>
<p>Given the difficulties with assessing EhRNaseIII activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, we turned to a heterologous system to probe the function of EhRNaseIII (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).

Thus, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>castellii</italic> Dicer (ScaDcr1) and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>castellii</italic> Argonaute (ScaAgo1) are sufficient to reconstitute RNAi gene silencing in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, an RNAi-deficient system [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We were able to recapitulate these data in our laboratory (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). This reconstitution system is based on three GFP-positive <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> strains stably transformed with either an inducible weak silencing construct that produces long GFP dsRNA, an inducible strong silencing construct that produces a GFP hairpin RNA, or no GFP silencing construct [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A similar study using human RNAi proteins—Dicer, Ago2, and HIV-1 transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP)—demonstrated that the reconstitution approach is broadly applicable across eukaryotic systems [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To determine whether <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> Ago2-2 (EhAgo2-2) and EhRNaseIII are able to reconstitute the RNAi pathway in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, we expressed EhAgo2-2 and EhRNaseIII in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and assayed for generation of GFP sRNAs as well as for silencing of GFP transcript and protein. To ensure that the amebic proteins would be expressed, we codon-optimized EhRNaseIII and EhAgo2-2 for expression in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and integrated these genes into the chromosomes of the three reporter strains. We added an N-terminal 3xMyc tag to the codon-optimized EhRNaseIII gene to verify expression of this protein in the transformed strains. As shown by Western blot analysis, both Myc-EhRNaseIII and EhAgo2-2 were expressed in all three <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> reporter strains (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Two species of EhRNaseIII were detected—a 50 kDa and 25 kDa band (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). The 25 kDa size is consistent with an EhRNaseIII monomer, suggesting that the 50 kDa band is a dimer. Given the denaturing lysate preparations, the presence of the larger band may suggest that EhRNaseIII forms a tight dimer, which is consistent with RNaseIII mechanism of action [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

<p>To ascertain whether EhRNaseIII could generate sRNAs to GFP, we grew the Myc-EhRNaseIII/EhAgo2-2 expressing reporter strains in galactose to induce production of the GFP silencing substrates and assayed for sRNA generation by high resolution Northern blot analysis. Strains expressing ScaDcr1/ScaAgo1 were included as positive controls. As expected, abundant GFP sRNAs were detected in the control ScaDcr1/ScaAgo1 strain expressing the strong silencing substrate. However, no GFP sRNAs were detected in the EhRNaseIII reporter strains expressing either the weak or the strong silencing dsRNA substrate (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Notably, the ScaDcr1/ScaAgo1 strain expressing the weak silencing construct also does not show abundant GFP sRNA generation by Northern blot analysis but GFP is partially silenced in this strain indicating that sRNAs were produced ([<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], <xref rid="pone.0133740.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that EhRNaseIII produces GFP sRNAs but which are below the limit of detection of by Northern blot analysis.</p>
<p>We next examined GFP protein and mRNA levels to assess whether EhRNaseIII generated a smaller pool of GFP sRNAs than can be assayed by Northern blot analysis, but which are adequate and functional to reduce GFP expression. Flow cytometry was used to measure GFP fluorescence in strains expressing EhRNaseIII/EhAgo2-2 and in strains expressing ScaDcr1/ScaAgo1. A GFP-negative <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> strain that contained no RNAi genes was used as a negative control and the GFP-positive reporter strain expressing EhRNaseIII/EhAgo2-2 but lacking a silencing construct served as a positive control for GFP expression. The same culture samples were used for Northern blot and flow cytometry analyses. Drinnenberg and colleagues showed that ScaDcr1/ScaAgo1 strains exhibit a strong shift in GFP fluorescence with the strong silencing substrate, in accordance with the abundant GFP sRNAs produced by ScaDcr1 [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. They also demonstrated an intermediate shift in fluorescence with the weak silencing substrate indicating that GFP sRNAs are produced from long dsRNA even though they are not detected by Northern blot analysis [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, in our assays with the strains expressing EhRNaseIII/EhAgo2-2 and either the weak or the strong silencing substrate there was no shift in GFP fluorescence (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), although we were able to recapitulate the positive results with ScaDcr1/ScaAgo1 (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). These results were corroborated by the Northern blot data for GFP mRNA where there was no decrease in transcript levels among the strains expressing EhRNaseIII/EhAgo2-2 (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). In fact, there was a slight increase in GFP transcript in strains expressing a silencing construct (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), potentially a stress response to expressing but not processing the dsRNA substrates. Taken together, these data indicate that EhRNaseIII and EhAgo2-2 are not able to reconstitute the RNAi pathway in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>.</p>
<p>These data may indicate that EhRNaseIII does not generate sRNAs. Alternatively, the lack of functional GFP silencing could be due to the inability of EhAgo2-2 to bind and/or recognize sRNAs that are characteristic of RNaseIII cleavage. Dicer-generated sRNAs have characteristic 5′-monophosphate termini [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A conserved binding pocket in Ago proteins mediates specificity for 5′ features of sRNAs and thus Argonaute proteins bind sRNAs with either 5′-monophosphate or 5′-polyphosphate termini [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Given that EhAgo2-2 endogenously associates with 5′-polyphosphate sRNAs in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], this protein may not be able to bind and/or mediate silencing using 5′-monophosphate sRNAs generated in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Thus, the lack of GFP silencing in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> with EhRNaseIII/EhAgo2-2 may be due to the inability of EhRNaseIII to cleave dsRNA or instead may be due to the inability of EhAgo2-2 to use 5′-monophosphate sRNAs for gene silencing (through either an inability to bind or to mediate target RNA silencing using 5′-monophosphate sRNAs).</p>

<title>EhRNaseIII and ScaAgo1 mediate partial silencing of GFP</title>
<p>One possibility is that EhRNaseIII is capable of generating GFP sRNAs that are below the limit of detection by Northern blot analysis and cannot load into EhAgo2-2. In order to assess this possibility, we utilized ScaAgo1, which is capable of binding 5′-monophosphate sRNAs and using them to mediate gene silencing [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We generated <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> GFP reporter strains expressing EhRNaseIII and ScaAgo1. Using the weak and strong silencing constructs, we determined the level of GFP expression in these strains. In contrast to all previous results, reconstitution of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> with EhRNaseIII and ScaAgo1 revealed a reduction in GFP fluorescence in cells induced with the strong silencing construct, whereas no GFP shift was noted with the weak silencing construct (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). The GFP reduction with EhRNaseIII/ScaAgo1 and the strong silencing construct resembled the intermediate silencing phenotype observed with ScaDcr1/ScaAgo1 and the weak silencing construct. Northern blot analysis confirmed the flow cytometry data of intermediate GFP reduction. GFP transcript abundance was reduced to similar levels in both the EhRNaseIII/ScaAgo1 strong construct strain and the ScaDcr1/ScaAgo1 weak construct strain (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). However, despite GFP reduction of both transcript and protein levels, no GFP sRNAs were detected by high resolution Northern blot analysis with 15μg of total RNA in either the EhRNaseIII/ScaAgo1 strong silencing construct strain or the ScaDcr1/ScaAgo1 weak silencing construct strain (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). These data indicate that in an <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> reconstitution system, EhRNaseIII produces GFP sRNAs that are capable of mediating silencing but in quantities that are not abundant enough to be detected by Northern blot analysis, similar to the outcome noted for ScaDcr1/ScaAgo1 with the weak silencing construct.</p>

<title>EhRNaseIII is capable of processing dsRNA to smaller fragments that mediate gene silencing in association with ScaAgo1</title>
<p>Given that EhRNaseIII/ScaAgo1 resulted in reduction of GFP, we sought to better visualize EhRNaseIII-generated GFP sRNAs by probing 50μg of sRNA-enriched material in a high resolution Northern blot analysis. With the use of sRNA-enriched material, GFP sRNAs produced from the weak RNA substrate by ScaDcr1 were visible for the first time (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). In the EhRNaseIII/ScaAgo1 strain, we could also detect two RNA species: the first at ~300nt and the second as a diffuse population at ~50-60nt (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). To determine the origin of the 300nt and 50-60nt RNA species, we probed 15μg of total RNA from different strains for GFP sRNAs (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). The strains we tested lacked ScaAgo1 but contained combinations of GFP, the strong silencing construct, and ScaDcr1 or EhRNaseIII.

<p>The GFP sRNAs generated by EhRNaseIII suggest that EhRNaseIII may use a different mechanism to determine sRNA length and/or an amebic factor is needed for complete and efficient dsRNA processing. The expected length of sRNAs produced by EhRNaseIII and how EhRNaseIII determines the length of its sRNAs are not known. Budding yeast Dicers generate 23nt sRNAs; this is the distance between the active sites of adjacent Dicer dimers that assemble on the dsRNA substrate [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Despite the larger size of the sRNAs produced by EhRNaseIII in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> system, these sRNAs are capable of partially silencing GFP and appear to be as efficient as the GFP sRNAs produced by ScaDcr1 using the weak RNA substrate (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Further investigation is required to identify proteins that may interact with EhRNaseIII to mediate highly efficient processing. How ScaAgo1 utilizes the larger EhRNaseIII-generated sRNAs to silence GFP is also unclear. The crystal structure of another budding yeast Ago, <italic>Kluyveromyces polysporus</italic> Ago, reveals an extended, unobstructed nucleic acid binding channel [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Perhaps this conformation allows for binding of the longer EhRNaseIII sRNAs. Another possibility is that EhRNaseIII sRNAs are trimmed by the endogenous <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> RNaseIII, Rnt1, which processes pre-ribosomal RNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and small nucleolar RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], to a length which ScaAgo1 can bind.</p>
<p>To test specificity of the results of the EhRNaseIII/ScaAgo1 strain we chose to analyze the parental strain that contains the GFP reporter and the strong silencing construct and expresses EhRNaseIII but not ScaAgo1. First, we used flow cytometry to examine GFP expression. As expected, EhRNaseIII without ScaAgo1 showed no shift in GFP fluorescence (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Drinnenberg <italic>et al</italic>. have previously shown that ScaAgo1 does not mediate GFP silencing in the absence of ScaDcr1 [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and thus the partial silencing with EhRNaseIII/ScAgo1 should not be attributed to ScAgo1. Thus, the GFP reduction seen with EhRNaseIII/ScaAgo1 should be due to EhRNaseIII-generated sRNAs but is dependent on the presence of ScaAgo1 to mediate silencing (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). In order to visualize low abundant sRNA populations, we probed 100μg of sRNA-enriched material for GFP sRNAs. We could not detect discrete sRNAs in the 20-30nt range in the presence of EhRNaseIII/ScaAgo1 but again observed the larger RNA processing intermediates (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Of note, the pattern of processed RNA for the ~100-300nt fragments is similar to that of ScaDcr1/ScaAgo1. The EhRNaseIII/strong silencing construct strain, which lacks ScaAgo1, showed a lower abundance of processed RNA suggesting that ScaAgo1 may facilitate stabilizing the sRNA products (<xref rid="pone.0133740.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). In other systems, Ago is important for sRNA stability and escorting sRNAs to their final destination to base pair with their cognate mRNA [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Collectively, these data indicate that EhRNaseIII is capable of processing dsRNA into smaller fragments that can partially silence a gene target—a function reminiscent of Dicer enzymes. Thus, even though EhRNaseIII lacks the canonical Dicer structure, it possesses some Dicer-like activity, which in conjunction with an Argonaute protein is able to mediate RNA processing and gene silencing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Small RNAs mediate gene silencing in the RNAi pathway with Dicer, an RNaseIII enzyme, being central to the majority of small RNA generation pathways. Although many Dicer enzymes have complex domain architecture, structural minimalism of this protein has increasingly been reported. In this study we have identified a unique and very minimal Dicer candidate in the protist <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>. We demonstrated that although amebic EhRNaseIII contains only a single RNaseIII domain and lacks all other recognizable domains, it is capable of processing dsRNA into shorter RNA fragments that, in combination with an Argonaute protein, can mediate gene silencing in a heterologous system. Overall, these data indicate that EhRNaseIII has the potential to operate as a Dicer-like enzyme in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> and may expand the repertoire of non-canonical proteins that contribute to the RNAi pathway in non-model systems.</p>
<p>Studying EhRNaseIII in an RNAi-negative background revealed its dsRNA processing ability that was otherwise confounded in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. The incomplete silencing of GFP in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> suggests that processing of dsRNA substrates by EhRNaseIII could be enhanced by amebic cofactors. Notably absent from EhRNaseIII are domains commonly found in Dicer enzymes that bind dsRNA such as PAZ or dsRBDs. Dicer enzymes in other systems often associate with dsRNA binding proteins such as TRBP, PACT, Loquacious, RDE-4, and R2D2, although not all of them are required for small RNA generation [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Perhaps the addition of a dsRNA binding protein would help EhRNaseIII achieve maximal RNaseIII activity either through enhanced binding of the dsRNA substrate, proper positioning, and/or coordinated cleavage of the substrate. It is also possible that EhRNaseIII activity is normally low and that additional amebic factors are required to amplify the low abundant small RNAs generated by EhRNaseIII. Importantly, in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> secondary small RNAs with 5'-polyphosphate termini are abundant and in systems with amplified silencing such as nematodes, these secondary small RNAs likely arise from RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> has two RdRP genes and thus an inefficient Dicer-like enzyme may be counterbalanced by active RdRP-mediated generation of secondary small RNAs leading to efficient gene silencing [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanism of how EhRNaseIII determines the size of its products is unclear as it contains no defined RNA binding domain. In canonical Dicer enzymes, small RNA length is determined by the distance from the PAZ domain to the catalytic center of the RNaseIII domains [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133740.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. There is evidence that some Dicer enzymes, such as human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dicer, also measure from the 5' end of the dsRNA rather than from the 3'-overhang that binds the PAZ domain [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thus, canonical Dicers measure from the ends of their dsRNA substrates. Budding yeast Dicers, however, utilize an “inside-out” mechanism where cooperative binding of the two Dicer dimers occurs randomly at an internal site on the dsRNA. The distance between the active sites of adjacent dimers determines the size of the small RNA and processing continues outward towards the ends of the dsRNA [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the extremely pared down structure of EhRNaseIII, it is plausible that additional amebic proteins are required to coordinate dsRNA binding and to generate small RNAs of a specific length. The range of processed RNA visible in the EhRNaseIII/ScaAgo1 strain may be due to the lack of other amebic RNAi protein machinery in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Identification of proteins that associate with EhRNaseIII may help elucidate the molecular ruler utilized by the amebic “Dicer-like” complex.</p>
<p>Building upon the existing knowledge of the amebic RNAi pathway as well as the RNAi pathway in other systems, we propose a new working model of the RNAi pathway in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>. EhRNaseIII in conjunction with other amebic cofactors forms a Dicer-like complex. This complex processes structured dsRNA precursors into shorter fragments. Drawing on similarities with the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> RNAi pathways, we would expect that these Dicer-derived primary small RNAs are rare, which would explain the lack of an abundant endogenous 5'-monophosphate small RNA population in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> trophozoites [<xref rid="pone.0133740.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. According to the current model of how Argonaute proteins recognize and bind their small RNAs, we would expect that EhAgo2-2 is not involved in binding amebic EhRNaseIII-derived small RNAs since it associates with 5'-polyphosphate small RNAs. This preference for 5'-polyphosphate small RNAs would also explain why EhRNaseIII in concert with EhAgo2-2 was unable to reconstitute the RNAi pathway in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. A number of outstanding questions are raised by our data including: What other proteins comprise the Dicer-like complex in <italic>Entamoeba</italic>? What is the size of Dicer-derived small RNAs in ameba? And how does the complex determine the length of its products? Future investigations will focus on answering some of these questions with the priority being identifying other components of the Dicer-like complex. In summary, this work demonstrates that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> RNaseIII contributes to small RNA biogenesis in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> and likely gene silencing via the RNAi pathway.</p>
