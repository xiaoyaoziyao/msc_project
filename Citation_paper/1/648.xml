        <p><italic>Bacillus methanolicus</italic> can utilize methanol as the sole carbon source for growth and it encodes an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh), catalyzing the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. Recently, the genomes of the <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> strains MGA3 (ATCC53907) and PB1 (NCIMB13113) were sequenced and found to harbor three different putative Mdh encoding genes, each belonging to the type III Fe-NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases. In each strain, two of these genes are encoded on the chromosome and one on a plasmid; only one chromosomal <italic>act</italic> gene encoding the previously described activator protein ACT was found. The six Mdhs and the ACT proteins were produced recombinantly in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, purified, and characterized. All Mdhs required NAD<sup>+</sup> as cosubstrate, were catalytically stimulated by ACT, exhibited a broad and different substrate specificity range and displayed both dehydrogenase and reductase activities. All Mdhs catalyzed the oxidation of methanol; however the catalytic activity for methanol was considerably lower than for most other alcohols tested, suggesting that these enzymes represent a novel class of alcohol dehydrogenases. The kinetic constants for the Mdhs were comparable when acting as pure enzymes, but together with ACT the differences were more pronounced. Quantitative PCR experiments revealed major differences with respect to transcriptional regulation of the paralogous genes. Taken together our data indicate that the repertoire of methanol oxidizing enzymes in thermotolerant bacilli is larger than expected with complex mechanisms involved in their regulation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Methylotrophs use reduced one-carbon (C<sub>1</sub>) compounds such as methane and methanol as their sole sources of carbon and energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Anthony1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Chistoserdova1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Chistoserdova2">[3]</xref>. There is both a scientific interest in studying the repertoire of genes and enzymes enabling methylotrophy and applied interest in developing production processes, in which methanol can be converted into useful products, for instance amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Brautaset1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Schrader1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Nrdal1">[6]</xref>. Methanol is oxidized by methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh), and an efficient methanol oxidation and concomitant formaldehyde assimilation and dissimilation is of crucial importance for growth and energy generation. In this regard, understanding the nature of the Mdh is important for the basic understanding of methylotrophy and when developing an industrial scale production process using methylotrophic microorganisms.</p>
      <p>In methylotrophic bacteria, Mdhs belong to two distinct groups. The best studied group of Mdhs consists of the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-containing and cytochrome dependent periplasmic Mdh which exhibits an α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> conformation and is found in Gram-negative bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Chistoserdova2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Anthony2">[7]</xref>. The other group comprises NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>-dependent cytoplasmic Mdhs composed of one type of subunit that are commonly encoded by Gram-positive methylotrophs, including <italic>Bacillus methanolicus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Anthony2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Arfman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Bystrykh1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Anthony3">[10]</xref>. In the thermotolerant <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> C1 strain, the <italic>mdh</italic> gene, encoding an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent Mdh, was cloned and found to be involved in methanol oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Vonck1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-deVries1">[12]</xref>. The <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> Mdh primary sequence resembles the iron containing alcohol dehydrogenases, and was therefore classified together with the group III of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases. Based on electron microscopy, an overall arrangement of a decamer was suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Vonck1">[11]</xref>. Each of the ten subunits was shown to contain a tightly, but non-covalently, bound NAD(H) molecule in addition to a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-ion and 1–2 Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Vonck1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-deVries1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Arfman2">[13]</xref>. It has been reported that the activity of this Mdh enzyme could be stimulated up to 40-fold by an activator protein, ACT, <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Arfman2">[13]</xref>. ACT belongs to the Nudix hydrolase family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Bessman1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Kloosterman1">[15]</xref> and it shows sequence similarity to bacterial ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases (EC.3.6.1.13), enzymes which hydrolyze ADP-ribose, an NADH degradation product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-McLennan1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We previously demonstrated that the <italic>mdh</italic> gene in the <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> model strain MGA3 is encoded on a multi-copy natural plasmid, pBM19, and that plasmid-dependent methylotrophy is a widespread trait among <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Brautaset1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Brautaset2">[17]</xref>. The recently sequenced genomes of the strains MGA3 and PB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Heggeset1">[18]</xref> surprisingly showed that their chromosomes harbor two additional putative <italic>mdh</italic>-like genes each. In the present report all six Mdh proteins were recombinantly produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified and biochemically characterized. Our results provide new insight into the complex biochemistry and regulation of methanol oxidation in thermotolerant bacilli.</p>

NAD<sup>+</sup> was substituted with 0.5 mM NADP<sup>+</sup>, FMN<sup>+</sup>, or FAD<sup>+</sup> when indicated. When measuring formaldehyde reductase activity, the reaction mixture contained: 50 mM Potassium-phosphate buffer pH 6.7, 0.15 mM NADH, 1 mM DTT and 11.6 mM formaldehyde or acetaldehyde. Unless otherwise stated, the assay components were mixed in the cuvette and pre-warmed to 45°C. The generation or consumption of NADH was monitored at 340 nm. One unit (U) of Mdh activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to produce or consume 1 µmol NADH per minute under the conditions described above. Purified ACT (0.1–40 µg) or NudF (20 µg) proteins were added to the reaction mixtures as indicated in the text. The six Mdh proteins were analyzed for pH and temperature optima. All enzymes displayed the highest catalytic activity at pH between 9.5 and 10. The Mdhs were assayed at pH 9.5 at temperatures ranging from 25°C to 45°C, and the results showed that they all had temperature optima around 45°C (data not shown). Because of technical limitations of the instrument used, kinetic experiments were conducted at 45°C.</p>
        <p>In order to determine the Michaelis Menten constants of the enzymes during the oxidation of methanol or reduction of formaldehyde, activities were measured at varying methanol concentrations (0.1–2000 mM) keeping NAD<sup>+</sup> at saturation (0.5 M), at varying NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations (1–2000 µM) keeping methanol at saturation (0.5 M), or at varying formaldehyde concentrations (0.1–40 mM) keeping NADH at saturation (0.15 mM). The data were plotted and fitted using Prism 5.04 (GraphPad software). The Mdh reaction has previously been found not to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but rather displays a ping-pong type of reaction mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Arfman3">[24]</xref>. By using a definition of <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> as the substrate concentration resulting in a reaction rate of ½<italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> rough estimates of the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values for methanol were made, and they correlated well with the constants found fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation in Prism 5.04. It was therefore decided to report the Prism 5.04 calculated constants.</p>

Inspection of the PB1 genome sequence confirmed the presence of three putative MDH encoding genes (here denoted <italic>mdh</italic><sup>P</sup>, <italic>mdh1</italic><sup>P</sup> and <italic>mdh2</italic><sup>P</sup>). The <italic>mdh</italic><sup>P</sup> gene located on plasmid pBM20 encodes an Mdh<sup>P</sup> protein sharing 93% primary sequence identity to the Mdh<sup>M</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059188-g001"><bold>Figure 1a</bold></xref>). The <italic>mdh1</italic><sup>P</sup>-gene encodes an Mdh1<sup>P</sup> protein with 92% primary sequence identity to the Mdh<sup>P</sup> protein, while the <italic>mdh2</italic><sup>P</sup> gene encodes an Mdh2<sup>P</sup> protein with 91% and 92% primary sequence identity to the Mdh2<sup>M</sup> and Mdh3<sup>M</sup> proteins, respectively, while only about 60% primary sequence identity to Mdh<sup>P</sup>, Mdh1<sup>P</sup> and Mdh<sup>M</sup>. The chromosome of each of the <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> strains contained a single <italic>act</italic>-gene each (here denoted <italic>act</italic><sup>M</sup> and <italic>act</italic><sup>P</sup>), encoding the previously described activator protein important for Mdh activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Kloosterman1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Hektor1">[23]</xref>.

Due to the high homology between the deduced primary sequences of the Mdh<sup>M</sup>, Mdh<sup>P</sup> and Mdh1<sup>P</sup> proteins, and between the Mdh2<sup>M</sup>, Mdh3<sup>M</sup>, and Mdh2<sup>P</sup> proteins, no model search was performed for the remaining Mdhs. Superposing the 9 template files using Deep view/Swiss pdb viewer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Guex1">[33]</xref> showed that they all have very similar C<sub>α</sub>-traces, despite the low primary sequence identity (only 26% sequence identity between pdb:3bfj and pdb:1oj7), (data not shown). This implies that the 3D fold of the Mdhs is conserved, and that their varying properties are likely to be caused solely by amino acid variations in and around the catalytic site and/or the NAD<sup>+</sup> binding site. The 1,3-PDH is a type III Fe-NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase that catalyzes the conversion of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde into 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD).

The monomers of the 1,3-PDH folds into two structural domains that are separated by a cleft. The N-terminal domain contains the binding site of the NAD<sup>+</sup> cofactor and the C-terminal domain includes the residues involved in iron binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Maral1">[27]</xref>. A conserved GGGSX<sub>2</sub>DX<sub>2</sub>K motif involved in NAD<sup>+</sup> cofactor binding was found in the N-terminal region of Mdh<sup>C</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Hektor1">[23]</xref> (in position 95–104 of Mdh<sup>M</sup>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059188-g001"><bold>Figure 1a</bold></xref>) and this region is also found in the 1,3-PDH and in all Mdhs investigated in this study.

        <title>All Mdh-like Enzymes have Broad Substrate Specificities and Different Preferences for Alcohols</title>
        <p>The purified Mdh proteins were tested for catalytic activities using several alternative alcohol substrates, and all enzymes displayed activities on ethanol, propanol, butanol, isopropanol, 1,2-propanediol and 1,3-propanediol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059188-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), when assayed with 500 mM. In addition, due to the low solubility of larger primary alcohols, the enzymes were assayed with 50 mM alcohol concentrations and found to also be active on pentanol and hexanol. The relative catalytic activities for the recently discovered subgroup of Mdh-like enzymes were all shown to be substantially higher with the alcohols tested compared to methanol, similarly to the originally described Mdh of <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Arfman4">[34]</xref>. This may imply that the catalytic site of the Mdhs is easily accessible for larger substrates, and that the substrate binding of medium sized primary alcohols could be more efficient than binding of the smaller methanol. The relative catalytic activities on the different alcohols tested varied substantially between the six Mdhs, indicating different substrate preferences among the proteins. For example, the activities of the Mdh3<sup>M</sup> and the Mdh2<sup>P</sup> enzymes with propanol were about 35 to 70-fold higher than their activity on methanol. Notably, the Mdhs belonging to the Mdh2/3 type from both strains displayed higher catalytic activity than the enzymes belonging to the Mdh/Mdh1 type with most of the substrates, under the conditions tested. All six enzymes also displayed formaldehyde and acetaldehyde reductase activities, which is further described below. Based on these data, these proteins could be classified as Adhs rather than Mdhs; however, we prefer to keep the designation of Mdhs for these enzymes, in line with the original Mdh from <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> C1 and MGA3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Kloosterman1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Brautaset2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Hektor1">[23]</xref>.</p>

        <p>The heat stability of the six Mdhs was tested by pre-incubation of the proteins at 45°C and 60°C, and samples were taken at different time points for enzyme assays. As expected, all enzymes retained essentially all catalytic activity upon preincubations at 45°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059188-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). The catalytic activities of Mdh<sup>M</sup>, Mdh2<sup>M</sup>, Mdh<sup>P</sup> and Mdh1<sup>P</sup> were however strongly reduced (up to 80%) upon preincubations at 60°C for 6 minutes, while this treatment had only moderately negative effects on the Mdh3<sup>M</sup> and Mdh2<sup>P</sup> catalytic activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059188-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). A selection of the experiments was repeated in the presence of equal amounts of purified ACT; however, ACT addition had no effect on temperature stability for any of the Mdhs (data not shown). One might speculate whether the presumably higher instability of MDH could be an important way of regulating the Mdh levels in the cells to avoid formaldehyde accumulation in response to varying methanol concentrations in the surroundings. However, it could not be ruled out that the stabilities of the Mdhs in vivo are quite different from those measured in vitro.</p>

Full activation was reached at a relative concentration of between 5∶1 and 1∶1, and no inhibition due to higher activator concentrations was observed (data not shown). For further testing, equal concentrations of Mdh and ACT (1∶1) were used. Next, similar assays were performed with all six Mdhs using methanol as substrate and the data showed that the Mdh activities were increased 2 to 13-fold for the MGA3 Mdhs in the presence of Act<sup>M</sup>, and 3 to 10-fold for the PB1 Mdhs, in the presence of Act<sup>P</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059188-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>).</p>

Although the biological function of this remains to be elucidated, one could speculate if the combination of increased affinity for MeOH and decreased affinity for NAD<sup>+</sup> in the presence of ACT, might help the cells to keep the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio inside the cells stable even at very high methanol concentrations.

        <title>The Mdhs Generally have Higher Activity and Affinity for Formaldehyde Compared to Methanol</title>
        <p>The biological significance of Mdh for methanol oxidation during methylotrophic growth is unambiguous, while the biological role of these enzymes as part of a formaldehyde detoxification system in the methanol consuming cells is less studied. It was here demonstrated that all enzymes displayed both formaldehyde- and acetaldehyde reductase activities (see above), and we chose to characterize the reductase properties kinetically. By using formaldehyde as the substrate the <italic>K<sub>m,FA</sub></italic> values were determined to be 1.1 mM, 4.5 mM and 7.1 mM respectively and the corresponding <italic>V<sub>max,FA</sub></italic> values were 0.6 U/mg, 1.8 U/mg and 4.6 U/mg for the MGA3 proteins Mdh<sup>M</sup>, Mdh2<sup>M</sup> and Mdh3<sup>M</sup> respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059188-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). For the PB1 proteins Mdh<sup>P</sup>, Mdh1<sup>P</sup>, and Mdh2<sup>P</sup> the K<italic><sub>m,FA</sub></italic> values were 3 mM, 7 mM and 1 mM, respectively, and the corresponding <italic>V<sub>max,FA</sub></italic> values were 0.5 U/mg, 0.6 U/mg and 1.1 U/mg, respectively. Together, these results show that all six Mdhs generally have higher affinity and higher <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> values when formaldehyde is the substrate, compared to when methanol is the substrate. Due to the lack of any response to ACT on the formaldehyde reductase activities of the Mdhs (see above), it was chosen not to perform kinetic measurements in the presence of ACT. The biological relevance of the reduction of formaldehyde by the Mdhs is not known. This could however, be part of additional formaldehyde detoxification system under critically high formaldehyde levels in the cell. From a BLAST search, a protein named EutG, with similarity to the MDHs was found. EutG is a novel Fe-alcohol dehydrogenase, and its main function is suggested to be the protection of cells from aldehydes by converting them into alcohols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Stojiljkovic1">[37]</xref>. Like EutG, all six Mdhs have the ability to catalyze the reduction of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde into its respective alcohols, indicating that they may play a part in detoxification systems.</p>

        <title>The <italic>mdh</italic> Genes are Transcribed at Different Levels in Exponentially Growing <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> Cells</title>
        <p>The presence of several alternative MDH-encoding genes in the <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> strains is an interesting attribute. qPCR was used to determine if the Mdhs transcriptional levels were regulated in response to methylotrophic versus non-methylotrophic growth (methanol or <sc>d</sc>-mannitol). In addition, qPCR was adopted to estimate the relative expression level among the Mdhs located in each of the genomes of the two strains studied. We have previously demonstrated that the <italic>mdh</italic><sup>M</sup> transcription is very high in <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> MGA3 cells, and that it was slightly up-regulated in cells growing on methanol versus on <sc>d</sc>-mannitol, while the <italic>act</italic><sup>M</sup> transcript levels were similar under both growth conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Jakobsen1">[20]</xref>. We here included all six Mdhs encoding genes in a similar qPCR analysis, and the results showed that the relative transcription levels of <italic>mdh</italic><sup>M</sup> and <italic>mdh2</italic><sup>M</sup> were 2 and 3-fold higher on methanol compared to on <sc>d</sc>-mannitol while the <italic>mdh3</italic><sup>M</sup> transcription level was essentially the same under the two different growth conditions. In contrast, analogous experiments using the PB1 strain showed that both <italic>mdh</italic><sup>P</sup> and <italic>mdh1</italic><sup>P</sup> were transcribed at a higher rate (2- and 14-fold, respectively) in cells growing on <sc>d</sc>-mannitol compared to methanol, while <italic>mdh2</italic><sup>P</sup> was unaffected by the carbon source. The three Mdhs present in each strain could have very different total transcription levels, which again can lead to different amounts of enzymes being expressed. One way to investigate this closer is to compare the difference in the respective Ct values obtained under standardized qPCR conditions for the three genes of each strain (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">material and methods</xref>). For example, in MGA3 the Ct<italic><sub>mdh2</sub></italic><sup>M</sup> minus the Ct<italic><sub>mdh</sub></italic><sup>M</sup> was found to be 8 and the Ct<italic><sub>mdh3</sub></italic><sup>M</sup> minus the Ct<italic><sub>mdh</sub></italic><sup>M</sup> was 14. Taking into consideration that all three primer pairs have about 100% primer efficiency (data not shown), these numbers imply that the <italic>mdh2</italic><sup>M</sup> and <italic>mdh3</italic><sup>M</sup> transcript levels are approximately 60-fold (2<sup>6</sup>) and 4000-fold (2<sup>12</sup>) lower than the <italic>mdh</italic><sup>M</sup> transcript level, respectively. Likewise, the <italic>mdh1</italic><sup>P</sup> and <italic>mdh2</italic><sup>P</sup> transcript levels are approximately 32-fold (2<sup>5</sup>) and 4000-fold (2<sup>12</sup>) lower than the <italic>mdh</italic><sup>P</sup> transcription level, under the conditions tested. The <italic>mdh2</italic><sup>M</sup> and <italic>mdh3</italic><sup>M</sup> coding sequences are 96% identical at the DNA level and to rule out any cross hybridization of the qPCR primers in these experiments, the respective qPCR primer pairs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>) were tested towards plasmid DNAs, pTMB1 and pTMB2, carrying the <italic>mdh2</italic><sup>M</sup> and <italic>mdh3</italic><sup>M</sup> gene sequences respectively. No detectable PCR products were obtained when the <italic>mdh2</italic><sup>M</sup> specific primers were used together with pTMB2 DNA, or alternatively when the <italic>mdh3</italic><sup>M</sup> specific primers were used together with pTMB1 DNA template (data not shown). These data confirmed that the qPCR primers used for <italic>mdh2</italic><sup>M</sup> and <italic>mdh3</italic><sup>M</sup> are specific for their respective targets, and that the obtained data should be reliable.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the individual Mdh-encoding genes are subjected to different transcriptional regulation, as a response to the C-source, and their total transcriptional levels differ from each other. This opens up for a different methanol oxidation potential of the two strains, which may explain why the MGA3 and PB1 strains were found to have highly different CO<sub>2</sub> profiles in fed batch methanol fermentations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Heggeset1">[18]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>The presence of paralogous Mdhs was recently discovered when genome sequencing the two <italic>B. methanolicus</italic> strains MGA3 and PB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059188-Heggeset1">[18]</xref>. Each of the sequenced strains harbored three Mdh-like genes that fall into two distinct subtypes. Biochemical characterization of all six enzymes revealed that they were able to oxidize a wide range of primary alcohols; however, they showed different biochemical and physical properties and are subjected to distinct regulatory cues. These results imply that methanol oxidation in this methylotrophic bacterium is a complex process involving multiple enzymes, and is presumably regulated at several different levels. Possibly, this complexity could be beneficial for a carefully adjusted response to growth in challenging environments where the temperature and methanol concentrations vary.</p>
