        <p>UFM1 is a member of the ubiquitin like protein family. While the enzymatic cascade of UFM1 conjugation has been elucidated in recent years, the biological function remains largely unknown. In this report we demonstrate that the recently identified C20orf116 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Tatsumi1">[1]</xref>, which we name <underline>UF</underline>M1-<underline>b</underline>inding protein 1 containing a <underline>P</underline>CI domain (UFBP1), andCDK5RAP3 interact with UFM1. Components of the UFM1 conjugation pathway (UFM1, UFBP1, UFL1 and CDK5RAP3) are highly expressed in pancreatic islets of Langerhans and some other secretory tissues. Co-localization of UFM1 with UFBP1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)depends on UFBP1. We demonstrate that ER stress, which is common in secretory cells, induces expression of <italic>Ufm1</italic>, <italic>Ufbp1</italic> and <italic>Ufl1</italic> in the beta-cell line INS-1E.siRNA-mediated <italic>Ufm1</italic> or <italic>Ufbp1</italic>knockdown enhances apoptosis upon ER stress.Silencing the E3 enzyme UFL1, results in similar outcomes, suggesting that UFM1-UFBP1 conjugation is required to prevent ER stress-induced apoptosis. Together, our data suggest that UFM1-UFBP1participate in preventing ER stress-induced apoptosis in protein secretory cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Ubiquitin is a small (8.5 kDa) protein, which is evolutionary conserved in eukaryotes. The so-called post-translational modification ‚Äòubiquitilation‚Äô is the covalent binding of ubiquitin to a substrate protein. The best-known function of ubiquitilation is the targeting of proteins for degradation by the proteasome. However, ubiquitilation can also affect subcellular localization, interactions, stability or activity of the substrate protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Welchman1">[2]</xref>. Therefore, ubiquitin can participate in a wide variety of cellular processes. Besides ubiquitin, a large family of ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) has been identified. These proteins do not necessarily share a high degree of sequence similarity to ubiquitin, but they all contain the typical ubiquitin-like tertiary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Hochstrasser1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 or UFM1 has recently been identified as a novel protein-conjugating system, displaying a similar tertiary structure to ubiquitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Komatsu1">[4]</xref>. To be activated, UFM1 is processed C-terminally by two specific proteases, UfSP1 and UfSP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Kang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Ha1">[6]</xref>. After processing, UFM1 is activated via the E1 enzyme, UBA5, and then conjugated by the E2 enzyme, UFC1. UFL1 has very recently been identified as the E3 enzyme and C20orf116 as a substrate of UFM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Tatsumi1">[1]</xref>. However, cellular functions associated withtarget proteins that aremodified by UFM1 are still unknown.</p>
      <p>The pancreatic beta cell is unique in its capacity to synthesize, store and secrete insulin with precise rates to cover the metabolic needs of the organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Muoio1">[7]</xref>. The fine-tuning of insulin synthesis, storage and secretion is regulated at many levels of gene expression, ranging from transcription, mRNA stability to translation and folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Hinke1">[8]</xref>. Microautophagic activity also plays a role in maintaining cellular hormone stores to optimal levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Marsh1">[9]</xref>. To fulfill this heavy task of insulin biosynthesis, the beta cell has a highly developed endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Optimal functioning of the ER is essential for proper protein folding and cell survival. Any disturbance in ER folding needs and capacity leads to ER stress and activation of the ER stress response (also called unfolded protein response) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Cnop1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Eizirik1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Scheuner1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Ron1">[13]</xref>. The aim of this response is to restore ER homeostasis and at least three functionally distinct responses have been identified. First, up-regulation of ER chaperones to increase protein folding activity and to prevent protein aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Bertolotti1">[14]</xref>. Second, attenuation of global protein translation to reduce the load of newly synthesized proteins and prevent excessive accumulation of unfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Harding1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Shi1">[16]</xref>. Finally, degradation of proteins misfolded in the ER, which is called ER-associated degradation (ERAD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-McCracken1">[17]</xref>. Three ER stress transducers can be recognized: IRE1, ATF6 and PERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Harding1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Yoshida1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Tirasophon1">[19]</xref>. IRE1 induces <italic>Xbp1</italic> splicing, which in turn, together with ATF6, induces transcription of chaperones (e.g. BiP), genes involved in ERAD and CHOP. In parallel, PERK activation upon ER stress increases eIF2Œ± phosphorylation, which on the one hand inhibits protein translation and on the other hand activates transcription of chaperones, genes involved in ERAD and CHOP. When this ER stress response fails to restore ER homeostasis, apoptosis is triggered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Oyadomari1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The link between ER dysfunction and diabetes has been studied extensively. PERK null mice have increased beta cell apoptosis and early onset diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Harding2">[21]</xref>, eIF2Œ±<sup>S51A</sup> heterozygous mice develop diabetes when fed a high fat diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Scheuner2">[22]</xref>, and CHOP<sup>‚àí/‚àí</sup>mice have improvedbeta cell function and bettercell survival in conditions that cause diabetes in control mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Song1">[23]</xref>. The conservation of these regulatory pathways among vertebrates and the link between PERK mutations and diabetes in patients with the Wolcott-Rallison syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Delepine1">[24]</xref> indicate that ER stress is important for diabetes in humans (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Eizirik1">[11]</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the present study we have investigated the UFM1 pathway in rodent pancreatic beta cells using both mouse isolated islets and the cell lines INS1 and MIN6. Our results show thatUFM1 and its target UFBP1are highly expressed in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, and that their expression is increased upon ER stress.We provide evidence that UFM1 and UFBP1are important for the prevention of ER stress-induced apoptosis.</p>

        <title>Identification of the interactions between UFM1, UFBP1, CDK5RAP3 and UFL1</title>
        <p>To identify the target(s) of UFM1, we performed a UFM1 affinity purification. We engineered a STrEP-tag at the N-terminus of UFM1and transfected clonal insulin-producing MIN6 cells with this STrEP-<italic>Ufm1</italic> construct. We exposed the cells for 2 hours to 10 mg/l cycloheximide to increase UFM1 conjugation (see below). STrEP-UFM1 was affinity purified and the eluates were analyzed via SDS-PAGE and coomassie staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). In total, 9 protein fragments were eluted from gel and further analyzed via mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0018517-t001">Table 1</xref>). We identified the conjugating enzyme UFC1 in the‚àº20 and ‚àº36 kDa fragment and the activating enzyme UBA5 in the ‚àº45 kDa and ‚àº60 kDa protein fragments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Komatsu1">[4]</xref>. Also the very recently reported ligating enzyme UFL1 (‚àº100 kDa fragment; 1810074P20Rik) and the substrate C20orf116 (‚àº40 kDa fragment; 2600009E05Rik) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Tatsumi1">[1]</xref> were picked-up in this screen. CDK5RAP3/LZAP (‚àº60 kDa fragment), two heat shock proteins HSPA8 and HSPA5 (BiP) (70 kDa fragment) and pyruvate carboxylase (‚àº130 kDa) were the other identified proteins. The isolation of pyruvate carboxylase is perhaps not surprisingly since it is biotinylated and highly expressed in beta cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Schuit1">[25]</xref>.</p>

        <p>The interactions between the identified proteins and UFM1 were further analyzed by GST pull down. A GST-tag was coupled to the N-terminus of mouse UFM1 with a C-terminal ending glycine residue (GST-UFM1(G)). Purified GST-UFM1(G) and GST protein were coupled to glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-labeled mouse 2600009E05Rik/C20orf116, CDK5RAP3, BiP and 1810074P20Rik /UFL1, which were generated by T7 <italic>invitro</italic> transcription/translation. 2600009E05Rik and CDK5RAP3 were recovered from the GST-Ufm1(G) coupled beads, but not from the GST coupled beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, we propose to name 2600009E05Rik/C20orf116asUFBP1, or <underline>U</underline>FM1 <underline>b</underline>inding protein 1 containing a <underline>P</underline>CI domain. Although very weak, the interaction between UFM1 and UFBP1 was also confirmed via co-immunoprecipitation with a UFBP1 and UFM1 specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Neither BiP nor UFL1 could bind to GST-UFM1(G) or GST coupled beads, indicating that they do not interact directly with UFM1. Co-immunoprecipitation with a BiP or UFM1 specific antibody could also not demonstrate a binding between UFM1 and BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However, an interaction between UFBP1 and BiP was observed after co-immunoprecipitation with a UFBP1 specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). To analyze why UFL1 did not bind in our <italic>in vitro</italic> screen, we used the same GST pull down strategy, using CDK5RAP3-GST as bait. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows an interaction between CDK5RAP3 and UFL1, but not with UFBP1. These results show that UFM1 directly binds (covalent or non-covalent) to UFBP1 and CDK5RAP3, and that UFL1 binds to CDK5RAP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

        <p>UFBP1 is, like UFM1, evolutionary conserved. The protein is present in plants, invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Detailed computational analysis of the UFBP1 protein (314 aa) sequence and structure revealed the presence of a signal peptide for the ER (aa 1‚Äì28), a transmembrane helix (aa 5‚Äì22), a nuclear localization signal (aa 65‚Äì69) and a PCI domain (aa 229‚Äì273) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Gasteiger1">[29]</xref>. PCI domains are present in several regulatory <underline>P</underline>roteasome subunits, <underline>C</underline>OP9 subunits, e<underline>I</underline>F3 translation initiation factor subunits, and in certain other multi-protein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Hofmann1">[30]</xref>. To investigate the role of these two domains in the binding with UFM1, we performed a new GST-pull down experiment. We first constructed a<italic>Ufbp1</italic> construct without the signal peptide, UFBP1<sup>29‚Äì314</sup>, or without the PCI domain, UFBP1<sup>1‚Äì219</sup>. <sup>35</sup>S-labelled UFBP1<sup>29‚Äì314</sup> (without the signal peptide) and UFBP1<sup>1‚Äì219</sup> (without the PCI domain) were generated by T7 <italic>invitro</italic> transcription/translation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows that both truncated proteins could still bind to UFM1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, showing that neither the signal peptide nor the PCI domain is required for the interaction between UFM1 andUFBP1.</p>
        <p>To clarify if the UFM1/UFBP1-interaction is covalent or non-covalent, we first performed a STrEP-tag affinity purification with UFBP1_STrEP, similar to the affinity purification with STrEP_UFM1. The eluates were also analysed via SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Three distinct protein fragments (‚àº38, ‚àº41 and ‚àº50 kDa) were identified as UFBP1. Interestingly, the protein fragment of ‚àº50 kDa was about 10 kDa too high for UFBP1 and missed the peptides containing the unmodified K268. The ‚àº10 kDa shift is in perfect agreement with a UFM1 modification (+9.1 kDa) of UFBP1 and lysine K268 being involved in UFM1 conjugation with UFBP1 is in agreement with previous published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Tatsumi1">[1]</xref>. In a second approach, we performed cellular fractionation of MIN6 lysates and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g002">Figure 2E</xref> clearly shows that the UFM1 conjugate of about 40 kDa was at the same height and showed the same cellular localization as UFBP1. In addition, overexpression of UFBP1_eGFP, resulted in a UFM1 conjugate of ‚àº70 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Surprisingly, also overexpression of UFBP1<sup>K268R</sup>-eGFP resulted in a UFM1 conjugate of ‚àº70 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). These data indicate that UFM1 can bind covalent to UFBP1 and that K268 is involved, but not required for this binding.</p>

        <p>Different eGFP and mRFP fusion constructs were made and transfected into INS1-832/13 cells, to analyze the cellular localization of UFM1 and UFBP1 via fluorescence microscopy. After overexpression, UFM1 was equally localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Overexpression of full length UFBP1-eGFP showed an ER-specific expression. Deletion of the PCI domain of UFBP1 had almost no effect on the localization of the protein, while deletion of the signal peptide resulted in an exclusive nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). When we overexpressed mRFP-UFM1 and UFBP1-eGFP together, UFBP1 remained localized in the ER, but UFM1 was no longer equally distributed over cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g004">Figure 4B,D</xref>). Instead, it was more localized in the ER, indicating that overexpression of UFBP1 influences the localization of UFM1. A similar localization pattern was observed in cells where mRFP-UFM1 and UFBP1<sup>1‚Äì219</sup>-eGFPwere co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Overexpression of UFM1 together with UFBP1<sup>29‚Äì314</sup>, which is truncated for the signal peptide, however, resulted primarily in a nuclear localization of UFM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). The same results were obtained after overexpression of these constructs in human HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), indicating that UFM1 and UFBP1 localization is similar in mouse and human. Next we overexpressed the mutants UFBP1<sup>K268R</sup> and UFM1<sup>G83A</sup> in INS1 cells. Processing of UFM1 to its mature form is significantly reduced in the UFM1<sup>G83A</sup> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Tatsumi1">[1]</xref>. Both mutants showed a similar localization as their WT counterpart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s004">Figure S4A</xref> and results not shown). Overexpression of mRFP-UFM1 and UFBP1-eGFP in INS1 cells resulted in 34¬±4% of the cells in co-localization of UFM1 and UFBP1 in the ER. When the mutant UFBP1<sup>K268R</sup>-eGFP was overexpressed together with WT UFM1, we found co-localization in 33¬±2% of the cells, which is similar with WT UFBP1. After co-transfection of UFM1<sup>G83A</sup>-mRFP and UFBP1-eGFP or UFBP1<sup>K268R</sup>-eGFP, the amount of cells with co-localization of the two proteins was significantly increased (70¬±7%; p‚Ää=‚Ää0.006 and 60¬±6%; p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02, respectively, n‚Ää=‚Ää4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), compared to overexpression of the WT proteins.</p>

        <p>To ensure that overexpression did not cause a mislocalization of the proteins, we also detected the cellular localization of endogenous UFM1 and UFBP1 via cellular fractionation. It is clear that UFBP1 was present in the same fraction as BiP, indicative for ER localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). UFM1 partially co-localized with UFBP1 in the ER, but a significant amount of UFM1 protein was detected in the cytosolic fraction, which contains both cytosolic proteins and large protein complexes. Overexpression of UFM1 did not change the localization of UFM1, still cytoplasmic and ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). In contrast, when UFBP1 or both, UFM1 and UFBP1 were overexpressed, UFM1 was mainly expressed in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), similar to what we observed via immunocytochemistry. Overexpression of UFM1<sup>G83A</sup> resulted in a wrong localization when not processed, but a normal localization was observed when processed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g004">Figure 4F</xref>, upper and lower band respectively). However, via fluorescence microscopy, UFM1 and UFM1<sup>G83A</sup> showed the same localization and UFM1<sup>G83A</sup> was still partially co-localized in the ER when overexpressed with UFBP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>These data indicate that UFBP1 and UFM1 are partially co-localized in the ER and that UFBP1 plays an important role in the compartmentalization of UFM1 in the cell. We also show that the PCI domainof UFBP1, containing lysine K268, and glycine G83 of UFM1 are not required for this co-localization, suggesting that a non-covalent binding between UFM1 and UFBP1 could be responsible for the co-localization in the ER.</p>

        <title>UFM1 and UFBP1 are not involved in glucose stimulated insulin secretion</title>
        <p>Based on the expression profile of UFM1and its cellular localization, we hypothesized that UFM1 could play a role in the secretory pathway of protein secreting cells. To address this, we investigated the role of UFM1 and UFBP1 on insulin secretion in the rat glucose-responsive insulinoma cell line INS1-832/13. The effect of Ufm1 specific RNAi mediated silencing on glucose-stimulated insulin release was examined 48 hours after transfection of 832/13 cells with a<italic>Ufm1</italic>- or <italic>Ufbp1</italic>-specific siRNA duplex or a control duplex (siControl) with no known sequence homology.

        <p>The effect of ER stressors on UFM1 conjugation was also analyzed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g005">Figure 5E</xref> shows a clear reduction of UFM1-UFBP1 conjugation after ER stress. The reduction in conjugation was not a consequence of increased proteasome activity since the conjugates also decreased after treatment of the cells with MG115, a potent proteasome inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018517-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). In contrast, decreasing the ER load via translational inhibition with cycloheximide resulted in an increase in UFM1-UFBP1 conjugation. These data suggest that UFM1-UFBP1 conjugation depends on the protein load in the ER, high when protein load is low and low when protein load is high.</p>
        <p>Because apoptosis is triggered when the ER stress response fails to restore ER homeostasis, we analyzed the effect of a reduced <italic>Ufm1</italic>and<italic>Ufbp1</italic> expression on beta cell survival.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we provide evidence for a role of UFM1 and UFBP1in ER stress-induced beta cell apoptosis. We also identified a second interacting protein of UFM1, namely CDK5RAP3/LZAP.</p>
      <p>Eight UFM1 interacting proteins were isolated and identified via affinity purification and mass spectrometry (UFC1, UFBP1, UBA5, CDK5RAP3, HSPA8, BiP, UFL1 and PC). For two of these, UFBP1 and CDK5RAP3, the interaction could be confirmed <italic>in vitro</italic> by GST pull down. Two expected UFM1 interacting proteins (UBA5 and UFC1, the known activating and conjugating enzymes of human UFM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Komatsu1">[4]</xref>) were identified. However, each of these two proteins was identified ashaving two distinct molecular masses. This could be explained by the fact that during denaturation of the protein extracts, the interaction between UFM1 and UBA5 or UFC1 was partially sustained. The screen also identified pyruvate carboxylase, but this is likely to be an artifact since the STrEP-tag affinity purification is based on streptavidin-biotin binding and pyruvate carboxylase has biotin as a natural co-factor. Moreover, pyruvate carboxylase protein is very abundant in beta cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Schuit1">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, the important ER chaperoneBiPwhich is known to play an important role in the unfolded protein response of protein secreting cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Ma1">[36]</xref> and in particular for pro-insulin folding in the pancreatic beta cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Scheuner2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Yoshida2">[37]</xref> interacted with UFM1 in our screen.While we could not confirm this interaction in GST pull down experiments and co-immunoprecipitations, we found an interaction between UFBP1 and BiP after co-immunoprecipitation.</p>
      <p>In a large scale mapping of human protein-protein interactions by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, Ewing et al. provided evidence for an interaction of CDK5RAP3 with UFM1, UFC1, UFL1 and UFBP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Ewing1">[38]</xref>. Since we found an interaction of mouse UFM1 with the same proteins, this suggests that a similar complex exists both in mouse and human. Although we could not confirm the interaction between UFM1 and UFL1 via GST pull downs <italic>in vitro</italic>, these data, together with our finding that UFL1 interacts<italic>in vitro</italic> to CDK5RAP3, suggest that UFL1 is part of the complex, but that it has no direct interaction with UFM1. Tatsumi et al. reported that UFL1 is an E3 ligase for UFM1, although it has no structural characteristics of the typical E3 enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Tatsumi1">[1]</xref>. They found an interaction between UFM1-UFL1, UFL1-UFC1 and UFM1-C20orf116, using immunoprecipitations. Since under these conditions, also all other proteins (e.g. CDK5RAP3) are present, it is possible that the interaction between UFM1 and UFL1 is indirect, as shown in our experiments. Another possibility is that under our GST-pull down conditions, the required environment for interaction was not created, although we do see an interaction between UFL1 and CDK5RAP3 under these conditions. An interaction between UFL1 and CDK5RAP3 was recently also shown by some other groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Kwon1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Shiwaku1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Wu1">[28]</xref>. The covalent binding between UFM1 and UFBP1 is supported by the MS/MS identification of UFBP1 in a protein fragment which is about 10 kDa higher than the predicted molecular weight of UFBP1, and which contains a modified lysine 268. The increase in molecular weight is in perfect agreement with a UFM1 modification (‚àº9.1 kDa). Also the presence of a UFM1 conjugate at the same height and with the same cellular localization as UFBP1 supports the covalent binding.</p>
      <p>Detailed analysis of the protein sequence of UFBP1 revealed the presence of a signal peptide, a nuclear localization signal and a PCI domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Gasteiger1">[29]</xref>. Based on the presence of this signal peptide, UFBP1 is predicted to play a role in the secretory pathway (Target P1.1 prediction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Emanuelsson1">[39]</xref>). Deletion of the signal peptide did not prevent the binding between UFM1 and UFBP1 <italic>in vitro</italic> but it prevented the ER localization of both UFBP1 and UFM1. Both proteins were mainly localized in the nucleus when the signal peptide was deleted, which could be explained by the presence of a nuclear localization signal in UFBP1. The function of this nuclear localization signal seemed to be overruled by the signal peptide, since the full length protein is localized in the ER. UFBP1 also contains a PCI domain, an alpha-helical domain of about 200 residues, which is generally localized at the C-terminus of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Hofmann1">[30]</xref>. The COP9 signalosome is a conserved eight-subunit complex, which can physically associate with the 26S proteasome, and may function as an alternate lid for the proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Huang1">[40]</xref>. A PCI domain can serve as a structural scaffold for multi-protein complexes or proteasome regulators. However, deletion of the PCI domain resulted in a stronger interaction between UFM1 and UFBP1, compared to the interaction with the full length UFBP1. Furthermore, UFBP1<sup>1‚Äì219</sup> co-localized even stronger with UFM1 to the ER than UFBP1 did. We analyzed several conserved lysine residues (K121/K122, K192/K194 and K159) outside the signal peptide and PCI-domain via GST pull down, but none of these lysine residues seemed to play a role on their own for interaction with UFM1 (results not shown).K268 may not be the only lysine residue involved in UFM1 conjugation since the mutants UFBP1<sup>K268R</sup> and UFBP1<sup>1‚Äì219</sup> are still able to form UFM1 conjugates. Our interpretation is that while K268 is the main lysine residue for conjugation, but when this residue is deleted, other lysine residues can take over. Most likely, UFM1 can interact with UFBP1, both covalent and non-covalent, since the mutants UFM1<sup>G83A</sup>, UFBP1<sup>K268R</sup> and UFBP1<sup>1‚Äì219</sup> can still co-localize in the ER. However, we cannot exclude that endogenous UFM1 and UFBP1 play a role in this co-localization (e.g. via dimerization). Another possibility is that overexpression of UFBP1 caused changes in the ER (<italic>e.g.</italic> massive amplification of ER network as recently reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Tatsumi1">[1]</xref>), and that these changes had an influence on the localization of UFM1.</p>
      <p>Since UFBP1 was predicted to function in the secretory pathway and UFM1 is mainly expressed in secretory cells, we analyzed the effect of <italic>Ufm1</italic> and <italic>Ufbp1</italic> silencing on the glucose stimulated insulin release. However, no clear effect of decreased UFM1 and UFBP1 protein levels on insulin release was observed. Also no secreted UFBP1 could be detected in the medium (results not shown).</p>
      <p>We showed that <italic>Ufm1</italic>, <italic>Ufbp1</italic>and <italic>Ufl1</italic> expression in INS1 cells was increased upon ER stress induced by chemical ER stressors and by the FFAs palmitate and oleate, fitting with other data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Azfer1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Harding3">[32]</xref>. The protein synthesis/folding load in the ER had a strong influence on the amount of detected UFM1-UFBP1 conjugates: increasing the protein load with ER stressors (cyclopiazonic acid, thapsigargin) decreased the abundance of conjugates, while a decrease in protein load with the translational inhibitor cycloheximide increased UFM1-UFBP1 conjugation. One possible interpretation is that UFM1-UFBP1 conjugates are used during protein folding in order to prevent ER stress and beta cell apoptosis. A difference in conjugate stability under different conditions could be the reason why after cycloheximide treatment the amount of conjugates increased, while free UFM1 protein and <italic>Ufm1</italic> mRNA levels stayed the same. Apoptosis induced by non-ER stressors was not influenced by the knockdown of UFM1 or UFBP1. The fact that <italic>Ufl1</italic> knockdown also enhanced apoptosis, similar to <italic>Ufm1</italic> and <italic>Ufbp1</italic> silenced cells, suggests that it is the conjugation between UFM1 and UFBP1 that is required, rather than the expression of the proteins itself. The exact mechanism how UFM1-UFBP1 conjugation can protect the cell is not known. Although <italic>Ufbp1</italic> and <italic>Ufm1</italic> silencing sensitized beta cells to ER stress, the expression of <italic>BiP</italic>, <italic>Chop</italic> or spliced <italic>Xbp1</italic> was not altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s007">Figure S7</xref>). However, we did see an impairment of ERAD activity upon <italic>Ufbp1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018517.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
      <p>Importantly, in a recent study, Lu et al. identified UFM1 as a potential factor associated with the development of type 2 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Lu1">[41]</xref>. UFM1 expression was 1.94 (protein) and 1.53 (mRNA) times higher in MKR mice (Type 2 diabetes model) than in wild type mice. MKR islets also contain more molecular chaperones (GRP78 and GRP94) and proteins involved in ERAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Kincaid1">[42]</xref>. In light of our present data, this increased UFM1 expression may be the result of ER stress in beta cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, and might be part of a protective response.</p>
      <p>CDK5RAP3/LZAP is a putative tumor suppressor, as it was shown to activate the tumor suppressor p53 and to inhibit growth of tumor cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Wang1">[43]</xref>. Furthermore, CDK5RAP3 promotes apoptosis in response to genotoxic agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Jiang1">[44]</xref> and is an inhibitor of NF-Œ∫B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018517-Wang2">[45]</xref>. Very recently, Shiwaku et al. demonstrated that UFL1 (Maxer) is also anchored in the ER and interacts with its N-terminal cytosolic part to CDK5RAP3. With this interaction, UFL1 prevents CDK5RAP3 to inhibit cyclin D1 expression, required for G1/S transition. Further experiments are necessary to clarify the role of the interaction between UFM1 and CDK5RAP3 in the cell.</p>
      <p>In summary our study shows that UFM1-UFBP1interaction occurs primarily in protein secreting cells like pancreatic beta cells; in such cells this interaction may protect the cells against ER stress and apoptosis.</p>

Briefly, cells were washed with HEPES balanced salt solution (HBSS) (114 mMNaCl, 4.7 mMKCl, 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.16 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 20mM HEPES, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25.5 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 0.2% BSA, pH7.2) with 3 mM glucose followed by a 2 hour pre-incubation in the same buffer. For glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, cells were incubated in HBSS for an additional 2 hours in the presence of 3 mM, 15 mM glucose or 15 mM glucose+30 mMKCl as indicated followed by collection of buffer for insulin radioimmunoassay (Coat-A-Count kit, DPC).</p>

After total protein extraction in S1 buffer, lysates were incubated with STrEP-Tactin beads (Westburg), following the manufacturer's protocol. The affinity purified proteins were separated on a 4‚Äì12% Tris/Glycine gel (Invitrogen) and stained with coomassie. The proteins that were present in the UFM1 purified samples and not in the control were picked for analysis via mass spectrometry.<italic>Mass spectrometry</italic>.Gel bands were picked in water, transferred to 100 ¬µl fixation solution (50% methanol; 5% acetic acid) and rinsed three times with water and three times with ACN (LC-MS quality, chromasolv, Sigma). The gels were hydrated in 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HC0<sub>3</sub>, followed by dehydration in 100% ACN, each 10 min. This step was repeated twice prior to dehydrating the gel pieces in a speedvac. Gel pieces were rehydrated in digestion buffer (50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>; 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>), containing 1 ng/¬µl modified trypsin (Promega) and incubated overnight at 37¬∞C. The resulting peptides were extracted from gel in four steps: once with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, twice with 50% ACN; 5% formic acid and once with 95% ACN; 5% formic acid, each 30 min. Supernatants were dried in a speedvac. Upon concentrating and desalting the tryptic fragments using Millipore C-18 ZipTips, the samples were mixed in a 1/1 v/v ratio with alpha-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid matrix (saturated solution in 50% ACN; 2.5% TFA in HPLC water), spotted onto the MALDI target plate and allowed to air dry. MS/MS analysis was performed on a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF (Applied Biosystems). The instrument was calibrated with the Applied Biosystems Calibration Mixture 1. Measurements were taken in the positive ion mode between 900 and 9000 m/z. Sequences were automatically acquired by scanning first in MS mode and selecting the 15 most intense ions for MS/MS using an exclusion list of peaks arising from trypticautodigestion. Data interpretation was carried out with the GPS Explorer software (V3.5) and database searching with the Mascot program (version 2.0.00). MS/MS searches were conducted with the following settings: MS/MS tolerance for precursor and fragment ions between 0.2 and 1 Da depending on the sample, methionine oxidation as variable modification and carbamidomethylation of cysteine as fixed modification. Trypsin was selected as enzyme and a maximum of one missed cleavage was allowed. Using these parameters the probability-based MOWSE score greater than the given cut-off value for MS/MS fragmentation data were taken as significant (p&lt;0.05).</p>

          <p><bold>Coomassie staining of the different fractions during STrEP-tag affinity purification of UFM1 (A) and UFBP1 (B).</bold> Together with the eluate samples, a small aliquot was taken from the protein extract before and after binding to the beads and from the wash step. MIN6 cells were transfected with empty vector (E) or with a vector containing STrep-Ufm1 (U). Two different molecular weight markers were used. The protein fragments used for MS/MS identification are indicated and numbered. The identification of the proteins of UFM1 purification is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0018517-t001">table 1</xref>, B Three distinct bands were shown to contain the UFBP1 protein. Fragment 1: the presence of both UFBP1 and G3P (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, mass: 35810 Da) was demonstrated. The tryptic peptide containing the unmodified K268 (sequence: IQDLLTEGTLTGVIDGGK, mass: 2044 Da) in UFBP1 was measured with confidence (delta mass of 0.01 Da). Also the tryptic peptide following the K268 residue (sequence: FIYITPEELAAVANFIR, mass: 1967 Da) was demonstrated with confidence (delta mass: 0.04 Da), supporting the idea K268 is not modified and thereby excluded as a trypsin-cleaving site. Peptide fragmentation data was generated by MS/MS analysis and confirmed the peptide identities. Fragment 2: this band is identified as UFBP1. Again the 2044 (delta: 0.01 Da) and the 1967 (delta: 0.04 Da) masses were present. MS/MS analysis confirmed the AA sequences. The elution position in the SDS-PAGE gel corresponds to the expected molecular weight of the native protein (35956 Da). Fragment 3: Two proteins were identified: PDIA6 (protein disulfide-isomerase A6) and UFBP1. The position in the SDS-PAGE gel fits perfectly with the mass of PDIA6 (48070 Da) but is about 10 kDa too high for UFBP1. However, it is in perfect agreement with a UFM1 modification (+9.1 kDa) of UFBP1. Remarkably, both peptides (2044 and 1967), reporting the unmodified K268, are now missing, C Cellular fractionation of MIN6 cells overexpressing UFBP1_eGFP+UFM1 (left panel) or UFBP1K268R_eGFP+UFM1 (right panel). *‚Ää=‚ÄäUFBP1‚àíUFM1 conjugate, ‚Üê‚Ää=‚ÄäUFBP1-eGFP‚àíUFM1 conjugate.</p>
