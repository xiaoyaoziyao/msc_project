<abstract>
<p>One of the most valuable aquaculture fish in Europe is the rainbow trout, <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>, but the profitability of trout production is threatened by a highly lethal infectious disease, viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), caused by the VHS virus (VHSV). For the past few decades, the subgenogroup <italic>Ia</italic> of VHSV has been the main cause of VHS outbreaks in European freshwater-farmed rainbow trout. Little is currently known, however, about the phylogenetic radiation of this <italic>Ia</italic> lineage into subordinate <italic>Ia</italic> clades and their subsequent geographical spread routes. We investigated this topic using the largest <italic>Ia</italic>-isolate dataset ever compiled, comprising 651 complete <italic>G</italic> gene sequences: 209 GenBank <italic>Ia</italic> isolates and 442 <italic>Ia</italic> isolates from this study. The sequences come from 11 European countries and cover the period 1971–2015. Based on this dataset, we documented the extensive spread of the <italic>Ia</italic> population and the strong mixing of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates, assumed to be the result of the Europe-wide trout trade. For example, the <italic>Ia</italic> lineage underwent a radiation into nine <italic>Ia</italic> clades, most of which are difficult to allocate to a specific geographic distribution. Furthermore, we found indications for two rapid, large-scale population growth events, and identified three polytomies among the <italic>Ia</italic> clades, both of which possibly indicate a rapid radiation. However, only about 4% of <italic>Ia</italic> haplotypes (out of 398) occur in more than one European country. This apparently conflicting finding regarding the Europe-wide spread and mixing of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates can be explained by the high mutation rate of VHSV. Accordingly, the mean period of occurrence of a single <italic>Ia</italic> haplotype was less than a full year, and we found a substitution rate of up to 7.813 × 10<sup>−4</sup> nucleotides per site per year. Finally, we documented significant differences between Germany and Denmark regarding their VHS epidemiology, apparently due to those countries’ individual handling of VHS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rainbow trout, <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic> (Walbaum, 1792), is one of the dominant fish species in European aquaculture in terms of produced weight and value. In 2014, 272,938 metric tons of rainbow trout (from inland waters, brackish waters, and marine waters) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref001">1</xref>] worth about 1,000,000 USD were produced in Europe (approximately 4 USD per kilo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref002">2</xref>]. European rainbow trout production is threatened, however, by viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), which annually leads to substantial economic losses in the trout farming industry. These losses can be a direct consequence of fish mortality or an indirect consequence of disease control measures. In view of its large economic impact, VHS is categorized as a notifiable disease by the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref003">3</xref>] and the European Union (Council Directive 2006/88/EC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref004">4</xref>]. The etiological agent of VHS is the VHS virus (VHSV), an enveloped single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus <italic>Novirhabdovirus</italic> in the family <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref005">5</xref>]. The genome of this virus contains approximately 11,200 nucleotides and encodes six proteins in the following arrangement: 3′-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5′ (a non-structural protein (NV) and five structural proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and RNA polymerase (L)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>During acute VHS infection, fish do exhibit external disease signs such as a darkening of the skin, bulging eyes, anemia, bleeding on the skin, gills, eyes, and internal organs, and a bloated abdomen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref008">8</xref>]. Mortality can be as high as 100% in fry, but ranges from 5% to 90% in older rainbow trout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref009">9</xref>]. VHSV is transmitted through contact with the urine or reproductive fluids of other infected fish and also through virus-contaminated water or objects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref008">8</xref>]. VHS is commonly a cool- or cold-water disease that is most prevalent at temperatures of 9–12°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>The first records of a rainbow trout exhibiting symptoms similar to those of the current VHS disease are from German trout farms in the early 1930s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref010">10</xref>]. Soon after, the disease was reported from several other European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref009">9</xref>]. However, the viral agent in this disease was not successfully isolated until the early 1960s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Until the mid-1970s, VHS was considered to be a disease specific to trout in Europe, but in the decades that followed, VHSV was also isolated from a variety of farmed and wild fish species in Europe, North America, Japan, and Korea; VHSV has now been isolated from more than 80 wild and farmed fish species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref008">8</xref>]. The chronology of VHSV isolation did not occur in parallel with a simultaneous spreading event of VHSV, however, it resulted mainly from an increase in monitoring efforts, which initially focused mostly on European rainbow trout farms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Europe harbors its own endemic VHSV genogroups in comparison to North America and Asia. Whereas genogroups <italic>I</italic> (marine and freshwater), <italic>II</italic> (marine), and <italic>III</italic> (marine) are endemic to Europe, genogroup <italic>IV</italic> (marine and freshwater) has almost exclusively been isolated from North American and Asian fish. Currently, there is substantial evidence that these genogroups had already split before the 20<sup>th</sup> century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref013">13</xref>] and therefore long before the virus was discovered in North America (1988) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref014">14</xref>] and Asia (1996) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Genogroup <italic>I</italic> is further divided into six subgenogroups: <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>(unclassified)</italic></sub> (Denmark, freshwater), <italic>Ia</italic> (predominantly continental Europe), <italic>Ib</italic> (Northern Europe, marine), <italic>Ic</italic> (continental Europe), <italic>Id</italic> (Scandinavia–Baltic Sea and freshwater), and <italic>Ie</italic> (Black Sea region); and genogroup <italic>IV</italic> is divided into three subgenogroups: <italic>IVa</italic> (North American Pacific Coast), <italic>IVb</italic> (Great Lakes), and <italic>IVc</italic> (North American Atlantic Coast) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref017">17</xref>]. This phylogenetic classification has largely been derived from sequences of the <italic>G</italic> and <italic>N</italic> genes.</p>
<p>In Europe, VHS has a major adverse effect on the production of freshwater-farmed rainbow trout, but disastrous VHS outbreaks have also been recorded in a few cases of farmed turbot (<italic>Scophthalmus maximus</italic>) and brown trout (<italic>Salmo trutta</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref021">21</xref>]. Since the collection of VHSV isolates from European freshwater rainbow trout farms began in 1962, most VHS outbreaks have been found to be caused by subgenogroup <italic>Ia</italic> isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>He and colleagues (2014) suggested that the ancestral <italic>Ia</italic> lineage arose from a pathogenic virus of freshwater-farmed rainbow trout during the 1950s in France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref013">13</xref>]. Little is still known, however, about the <italic>Ia</italic> lineage radiation into <italic>Ia</italic> clades and their respective spread routes. Currently, there is a hypothesis that the <italic>Ia</italic> lineage can be divided into two sublineages (<italic>Ia</italic>-1 and <italic>Ia</italic>-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref022">22</xref>]. This hypothesis is based on the observation that most of the isolates from the <italic>Ia</italic>-1 group were sampled from Danish farms, whereas isolates from the <italic>Ia</italic>-2 group were largely from other European countries.</p>
<p>Given that in RNA viruses (such as the VHSV), the accumulation of mutational changes and biogeographical processes (e.g., an event of spread, vicariance, extinction, or rapid population growth) take place at similar temporal scales due to the high substitution rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref023">23</xref>], it is assumed that the phylogeny and phylogeographic pattern of VHSV will provide important insights into the epidemiology of VHS. Accordingly, in this study, we sought to shed new light on the following topics: (1) the phylogenetic radiation of the <italic>Ia</italic> lineage into subordinate <italic>Ia</italic> clades; (2) the country-specific distribution and individual spread route of each <italic>Ia</italic> clade; and finally, (3) the question if there are indications for a hard polytomy, or a sudden demographic expansion, which would point to a rapid radiation. Due to the particularly high spatiotemporal density of Danish and German <italic>Ia</italic> isolates in our dataset from approximately the last 20 years, we particularly focused our phylogenetic analysis on those two countries during this period.</p>
<p>Our study was carried out within the scope of a multidisciplinary trans-European research project, MOLTRAQ (molecular tracing of viral pathogens in aquaculture), by using the largest dataset of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates ever compiled. We believe this work will provide an enhanced epidemiological understanding of European VHS disease, and our goal is to contribute the epidemiological knowledge that is a basic prerequisite for developing and implementing efficient VHSV prevention and eradication measures in the future.</p>

<title>Collection of VHSV isolates</title>
<p>We sampled 452 VHSV isolates: 2 from Austria, 1 from the Czech Republic, 152 from Denmark, 11 from France, 222 from Germany, 21 from Italy, 1 from Kattegat (Scandinavian sea area), 3 from the Netherlands, 37 from Switzerland, and 2 from Turkey. These samples covered the period from 1977–2015 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). The viruses were sampled and isolated according to the standardized methods described in 2001/183/EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref024">24</xref>]. The date of collection, site of collection, and host species of each isolate are summarized in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>.

<title>RT-PCR and <italic>G</italic> gene sequencing</title>
<p>Primers for RT-PCR and sequencing were designed based on the published sequence of VHSV in the GenBank database under the accession number Y18263 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s003">S2 Table</xref>).

The predicted 1883-bp RT-PCR product (VHSV genome: nucleotides 2782–4664) encompasses the 1524-bp-long <italic>G</italic> gene, which is localized between nucleotides 2959 and 4482 of the VHSV genome (accession number: Y18263) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref025">25</xref>]. RT-PCR was performed using the One Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). The 25-μL reaction mixture consisted of the one-step RT-PCR buffer (Qiagen, including 12.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 40 mM deoxynucleosidetriphosphate (dNTP) mix (10mM of each dNTP), 10 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers, 1.0 μL of the enzyme mix (Qiagen), 20U of RNasin (Promega), and 10–100 ng of total extracted RNA. The following PCR cycling conditions were used: 45 min at 45°C for reverse transcription; 15 min at 95°C for initial activation of DNA polymerase and for inactivation of reverse transcriptase and denaturation of the cDNA template; and then 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s (denaturation), 57°C for 30 s (annealing), and 68°C for 10 min (extension).

<title>Identification of a polytomy in the phylogeny to indicate a potential hard polytomy</title>
<p>A polytomy means that a node splits into more than two nodes. However, in case of a phylogenetic tree (in our case the bifurcating ML tree), its bifurcation algorithm does not permit the correct phylogenetic resolution of a polytomy. Normally, there are two possible causes for a polytomy. The first possible cause is taxon sampling bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref031">31</xref>] due to a lack of sufficient data or inappropriate analysis of characters. The second possible cause is a hard polytomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref031">31</xref>]. This means that a lineage splits into more than two descendant lineages, also referred to as multifurcation. Such polytomy nodes can occur, for example, when isolates (with a specific haplotype) were simultaneously separated into more than two different environments (e.g., geographic regions). After this, different local scenarios of selection and genetic drift result in the development of individual sublineages (clades) with a common time of origin. Therefore, a hard polytomy can be interpreted as a rapid radiation event. It is widely recognized that polytomy relationships are relatively common in intraspecific gene phylogenies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Although an extensive dataset of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates is available for this study, a sampling bias cannot generally be excluded. Therefore, detected polytomies can be interpreted as a potential indicator for a hard polytomy rather than evidence for such. To discover nodes with a tendency toward polytomy we adopted the following procedure. First, we created a phylogenetic Median Joining (MJ) network using the computer program NETWORK version 4.6.1.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fluxus-engineering.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.fluxus-engineering.com</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref033">33</xref>]. This method is well suited to represent the polytomy structure of a node. The program’s default setting of Epsilon (0) was chosen and the transition/transversion bias (R) was based on a maximum likelihood estimate obtained using MEGA version 5.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref029">29</xref>]. Due to the lack of a robustness measure for the MJ network in the NETWORK program, we sought to enhance the reliability of the MJ network topology by examining: (1) if the haplotypes of each ML <italic>Ia</italic> clade are also grouped in the MJ network; and (2) if they have a phylotemporal structure. In case of the latter, the expectation would be that older isolates (earlier collection dates) would cluster closer to the ancestral node of the lineage than isolates with more recent collection dates. Secondly, we created a NeighborNet (NN) network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref034">34</xref>] using the program SplitsTree version 4.13.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref035">35</xref>]. This method is also well suited to represent the polytomy structure of a node, as it can present alternative parallel branches (splits) in the phylogenetic topology and even allows bootstrapping. We generated 1,000 bootstrap replicates to assess the reliability of the splits obtained in the splits graph. Finally, for each polytomy node (noticed in the MJ and NN networks), we examined whether such a node was associated with a bifurcation conflict in the ML tree. For this purpose, we used a quick principle: the number of internal nodes is less than the number of tips minus 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref036">36</xref>]. In other words, each polytomy node leads to at least one additional node (depending on the number of descendant lineages, for example: 1, in the case of a trifurcating node; 2, in the case of a quadfurcating node; and so forth) with a low bootstrap support value, which is only present in the ML tree, and not in the MJ nor NN networks.</p>

<title>Indication of rapid population growth</title>
<p>A rapid increase in the size of an <italic>Ia</italic> clade population (a sudden demographic expansion due to increased population growth) was indicated using the following methods. (1) Visual inspection for a major star-like pattern in the MJ phylogenetic network constructed by NETWORK version 4.6.1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref033">33</xref>]. (2) A coalescent Bayesian skyline analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref038">38</xref>]. The Bayesian skyline plot was constructed using the program BEAST version 1.8.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref039">39</xref>] and was visualized with the program Tracer version 1.5 (from BEAST). A further output of that method was the meanRate (substitution rate) of the sequence used for this calculation. The BEAST input gene files were generated using BEAUti version 1.8.2. Our analyses used the random starting tree for the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) search, selecting a general time GTR model along with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock. We ran 90 million cycles sampling every 9,000 cycles. Outputs were assessed in TRACER version 1.5 to ensure that values reached stationarity. (3) Statistical tests, including the raggedness index (r), Tajima’s D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref040">40</xref>], and Fu’s Fs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref041">41</xref>], using DnaSP version 5.10.01 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref028">28</xref>]. (4) A mismatch distribution analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref043">43</xref>], also using DnaSP version 5.10.01 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref028">28</xref>]. However, the above mentioned methods may not separate the effects of rapid population growth from a recent selective sweep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref044">44</xref>]. Therefore, their results can only be used as an indicator for such a demographic event.</p>

The GenBank and Fishpathogens database accession numbers of the additional sequences obtained for this study are also listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>. In total, the dataset (GenBank samples and samples sequenced for this study) consists of 734 VHSV isolates (4 <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>(unclassified)</italic></sub> isolates, 651<italic>Ia</italic> isolates, 27 <italic>Ib</italic> isolates, 11 <italic>Ic</italic> isolates, 32 <italic>Id</italic> isolates, 6 <italic>Ie</italic> isolates, and 1 each of isolates <italic>II</italic>, <italic>III</italic>, and <italic>IV</italic>). Genogroup <italic>Ia</italic> isolates can be subdivided into 398 haplotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Approximately 95% of these 651 <italic>Ia</italic> isolates were obtained from <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>, 3% from <italic>Salmo trutta</italic>, 1% from <italic>Esox</italic> lucius, and 1% from 6 further fish species (isolates from an unknown host species are excluded) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>We divided the <italic>Ia</italic> haplotypes into nine clades (<italic>Ia</italic> clades <italic>1</italic>–<italic>9</italic>). Their ML bootstrap support values ranged from 78% and 99% (mean value = 94%; standard deviation = 8.62%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g001">Fig 1a</xref>). This division was identical to the <italic>Ia</italic>-haplotype clade structure in the MJ phylogenetic network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>). A striking exception was isolate U28800 (hereafter referred to as isolate X) that was the only taxon in the <italic>Ia</italic> dataset with varying clade-membership when comparing the ML, MJ, and NN <italic>Ia</italic> phylogeny. In the ML tree, isolate X clustered with clade <italic>6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g001">Fig 1b</xref>), but with a very low bootstrap support value of 19%. In contrast, in the MJ network, the lineage of X originated from the common ancestor of clade <italic>2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>), whereas in the case of the NN network, it originated close to the ancestral node of the <italic>Ia</italic> lineage (node 1), which was approximately between the origins of the lineage of clade <italic>2</italic> and the lineage of clade <italic>6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g001">Fig 1d</xref>).

<p>The <italic>Ia</italic> phylogeny in the MJ network was largely characterized by a phylotemporal structure: older <italic>Ia</italic> clades (those that included isolates with earlier collection dates) clustered closer to the phylogenetic origin of the <italic>Ia</italic> lineage (node 1) than did clades with more recent isolates. For example, clades <italic>1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, and <italic>6</italic> include haplotypes from the oldest collected <italic>Ia</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>).

<p>We found many polytomy nodes, as well as several circle structures within individual <italic>Ia</italic> clades in the MJ network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and many nodes with weak bootstrap support within individual <italic>Ia</italic> clades in the ML tree (not shown) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Furthermore, we discovered three polytomies (node 1–3) among the <italic>Ia</italic> clades. In the MJ network, node 1 and node 3 were clear polytomy nodes, whereas node 2 matched a polytomy rather than bifurcation. Node 1 corresponds to the common origin of all <italic>Ia</italic> isolates and splits into the lineage of clade <italic>1</italic>, the lineage of clades <italic>2</italic>–<italic>5</italic>, and the lineage of clades <italic>6</italic>–<italic>9</italic>. Node 2 originated from node 1 and it splits into the lineage of clade <italic>2</italic>, the lineage of clades <italic>3</italic> and <italic>4</italic>, and the lineage of clade <italic>5</italic>; by contrast, node 3 originated from the bifurcating node Y and splits into the lineage of clade <italic>7</italic>, the lineage of clade <italic>8</italic>, and the lineage of clade <italic>9</italic>. Furthermore, the low ML bootstrap support value of the three nodes BC1–3 and the fact that these nodes were only present in the ML tree and not in the MJ nor NN networks (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g001">1a, 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">2</xref>), supported the assumption of a polytomy.</p>
<p>The nucleotide diversity (π) of the total European <italic>Ia</italic> population (number of used sequences: 651) was 0.029 π.

The mean period of occurrence of a single <italic>Ia</italic> haplotype was 1.482 years (standard deviation (σ) = 0.55 years) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). A striking exception was one haplotype of clade <italic>6</italic> (number of haplotypes: 140) that included a German isolate from 1990 (V01-90he) and a French isolate from 1971 (FR-0771), which was thus re-isolated 19 years after its first isolation. This exceptional case has led us to exclude this haplotype from the calculation of the mean period of occurrence of the <italic>Ia</italic> haplotypes. In addition, as this haplotype is a member of clade 6, we have excluded this clade from the calculation of the mean period of occurrence of the <italic>Ia</italic> clades. The mean period of occurrence of a <italic>Ia</italic> clade was 11.4 years (σ = 6.5 years) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Notably, German <italic>Ia</italic> haplotypes from 2005 to 2015 fall into four distinct <italic>Ia</italic> clades (<italic>4</italic>, <italic>5</italic>, <italic>8</italic>, and <italic>9</italic>), whereas Danish <italic>Ia</italic> haplotypes from 1999 to 2009 fall into two <italic>Ia</italic> clades (<italic>5</italic> and <italic>9</italic>). By comparison, the mean value was 4.7 <italic>Ia</italic> clades per calendar year (σ = 1.658 per calendar year) for the entire dataset, calculated over the last 20 years (1996–2015). On the basis of the phylogeographic pattern of the <italic>Ia</italic> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>), clades <italic>1</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, and <italic>6</italic> indicate a trend toward Germany and France, whereas clades 2 and 7 suggest a trend toward Germany and Denmark. In case of clades <italic>8</italic> and <italic>9</italic>, the phylogeographic pattern was particularly difficult to interpret, as each of them included isolates from an especially large number of European countries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). While the isolates of clade <italic>8</italic> were from Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Switzerland, the isolates of clade <italic>9</italic> were from Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, and Switzerland. However, both clades were dominated by German isolates. By contrast, although clade <italic>5</italic> also includes several German isolates and an isolate from the United Kingdom, this clade exhibited a clear trend toward Denmark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, 4.02% of the <italic>Ia</italic> haplotypes appeared in more than one European country (nine haplotypes of clade <italic>9</italic>, three of clade <italic>8</italic>, one of clade <italic>6</italic>, and three of clade <italic>5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). The most widespread <italic>Ia</italic> haplotype—haplotype number 161, occurring in Germany, France, Poland, and Switzerland—was located very close to the center of clade <italic>9</italic>, which was the most widespread <italic>Ia</italic> clade with haplotypes isolated from seven European countries: Austria, France, Germany, Poland, Italy, Slovenia, and Switzerland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). In addition, this clade contained the highest number of <italic>Ia</italic> haplotypes that occurred in more than one country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>We found indications for two instances of large-scale rapid population growth during the evolution of the <italic>Ia</italic> lineage. One of these events took place in the 9<italic>i</italic> population of clade <italic>9</italic>, and the other event occurred in the <italic>5i</italic> population of clade <italic>5</italic>. This finding was based on two major star-like patterns in the MJ network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>). During these events, the substitution rate was 7.813 × 10<sup>−4</sup> nucleotides per site per year for the 5<italic>i</italic> haplotypes, and 5.651 × 10<sup>-4</sup>nucleotides per site per year for the 9<italic>i</italic> haplotypes. These potential demographic expansions were also indicated through a Bayesian skyline plot and a mismatch distribution via a unimodal curve (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g004">4</xref>). On the basis of the Bayesian skyline plot, this rapid increase in the population size of thlle 5<italic>i</italic> population occurred between approximately 2000 and 2001, and in the case of the 9<italic>i</italic> population, it occurred between approximately 2001 and 2003. Moreover, we confirmed a low value for the raggedness index and statistically significant negative values in tests for Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs for both datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0164475.t001">Table 1</xref>). This was also the case when we examined separately either the Danish 5<italic>i</italic> haplotypes or the German 9<italic>i</italic> haplotypes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0164475.t001">Table 1</xref>). However, when we calculated the mismatch distribution of clade <italic>9i</italic> haplotypes exclusively from Switzerland, Italy, or Poland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g003">Fig 3</xref>), and also of the haplotypes from <italic>5ii</italic>, <italic>8ii</italic>, <italic>8iii</italic>, and <italic>9ii</italic> (graphs not shown), the data only poorly fit the unimodal curve. Instead of a smooth unimodal shape, these curves exhibit a more ragged shape. Accordingly, the raggedness index was significantly increased and a negative non-significant <italic>P</italic> value was also obtained in tests for Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0164475.t001">Table 1</xref>). By contrast, the multimodal curve of haplotypes from clade <italic>2</italic> had no similarity to a unimodal curve (graph not shown). In case of clades <italic>1</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, <italic>6</italic>, and <italic>7</italic>, and <italic>8iii</italic> and <italic>9iii</italic>, we did not perform a demographic expansion analysis because of the small number of different haplotypes in those clades.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since the first <italic>Ia</italic> isolate was detected in France in 1971, the <italic>Ia</italic> population has become widely distributed in Europe, especially where rainbow trout is intensively produced in freshwater aquaculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref009">9</xref>]. This extensive spread is clearly confirmed by our phylogenetic results. First, the <italic>Ia</italic> lineage underwent a considerable phylogenetic radiation, since we were able to divide this subgenogroup into nine <italic>Ia</italic> clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Normally, such radiation is based on different local scenarios of selection and genetic drift resulting from the spread events. In addition, isolate X may even indicate—as a tenth <italic>Ia</italic> clade—the existence of further clades which remain, however, undetected using this dataset. Secondly, each of the three polytomies (nodes 1–3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>) that were found among the <italic>Ia</italic> clades could be an indicator for a rapid radiation, as they reflect a simultaneous spread from one single place to several places. For example, in the case of even a single delivery of VHS-infected trout, one single <italic>Ia</italic> haplotype can be spread to various regions of Europe. However, this is only true, if these polytomies are hard polytomies and not the result of a potential taxon sampling bias in our dataset. Third, the Europe-wide distribution of clades <italic>8</italic> and <italic>9</italic>, in particular, indicates a strong mixing of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates through the trout trade. Clade <italic>8</italic> includes isolates from seven different European countries, and clade <italic>9</italic> from eight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Finally, the indications for the two large-scale rapid population growth events in the <italic>Ia</italic> population could also point to, at least temporally, a sudden extensive demographic expansion, which is normally the result of the spatial spread of a species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>However, a clear reconstruction of the spread routes of ancestral lineages of individual <italic>Ia</italic> clades was largely impossible. The reason for that was that most <italic>Ia</italic> clades include several nodes with weak ML bootstrap support (not shown), a result of the low resolving power of mutational differences among their closely related haplotypes, and apparently due to homoplasy (parallel or back mutation events) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref033">33</xref>]. This poor phylogenetic resolution was also apparent in the MJ network through the many polytomy structures, and several circle structures within the <italic>Ia</italic> clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Furthermore, this reconstruction was additionally complicated by an almost complete absence of a country-specific distribution for most of the <italic>Ia</italic> clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>). As mentioned above, it seems that the <italic>Ia</italic> isolates were permanently and complexly changed due to the Europe-wide mixing of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates via the trout trade. And finally, the reconstruction of the spread routes was further complicated, by a sampling bias in our dataset. Although an extensive dataset of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates was used here, spatiotemporal sampling bias may exist in the case of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates obtained from Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Georgia, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and from Germany and Denmark before 1996 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This is possible, as outbreak samples from European trout farms (let alone from farms with latent infections) were collected using different levels of strictness depending on individual national surveillance of VHS. Therefore, we believe that this study may represent an incomplete pan-European picture of the country-specific distribution for most <italic>Ia</italic> clades. This circumstance has also contributed to our decision to largely avoid the reconstruction of the spread routes for the ancestral lineages of these <italic>Ia</italic> clades. For example, we consciously decided against speculating on the place of origin of the <italic>Ia</italic> lineage. This place might be obscured by an extensive Europe-wide spread of the <italic>Ia</italic> lineage shortly after its origin. On the one hand, this could explain the polytomy structure of node 1, provided that it reflects a hard polytomy(Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g001">1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">2</xref>). But in view of the above mentioned potential sampling bias, this polytomy cannot be seen as an argument for a real hard polytomy. On the other hand, the isolates that cluster closest to this node 1 (clades <italic>1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, and <italic>6</italic>) were from different European countries (Denmark, Germany, and France) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In addition, the determination of the place of origin is further complicated because our dataset exhibits a spatiotemporal sampling bias of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates from the period when the first <italic>Ia</italic> isolates were collected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to the particularly high spatiotemporal density of Danish and German <italic>Ia</italic> isolates in our dataset from approximately the last 20 years, we particularly focused our phylogenetic analysis on those two countries during this period. Thus, in comparison to the German situation, we observed an instance of rare gene flow of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates between Denmark and other European countries. This was supported by the following three findings. (1) Haplotypes of the dominant Danish clade (clade <italic>5</italic>)—the clade with the largest number of different Danish haplotypes—were almost exclusively detected in Denmark, whereas many haplotypes of clade <italic>9</italic>—the clade with the largest number of different German haplotypes—were also found outside Germany in several other European countries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s003">S2 Table</xref>). In addition, we found no isolate of clade <italic>9</italic> in Denmark, even though this was the most widespread clade in Europe (occurring in nine different European countries) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). In contrast, the clear dominance of Danish isolates in clade <italic>5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>) strongly indicates a Danish origin of this clade, and therefore it can be assumed that the ancestral lineage of the German and British isolates of clade <italic>5</italic> was introduced from Denmark. This conclusion also agrees with the findings of Kahns and his colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref022">22</xref>]. (2) Danish isolates fall into only four of the nine <italic>Ia</italic> clades detected, whereas German isolates fall into all nine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Accordingly, the nucleotide diversity of the German <italic>Ia</italic> population (304 used sequences) was almost more than twice as high as the nucleotide diversity of the Danish <italic>Ia</italic> population (244 used sequences) (not shown). (3) Danish haplotypes that were also detected outside Denmark were only found in Germany, whereas German haplotypes that were detected outside Germany were also found in several other European countries (Austria, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Switzerland) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>This relatively rare cross-border exchange of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates between Denmark and other European countries very likely reflects the strict control of export and import of rainbow trout in Denmark. As Danish fish farms produce fish mainly under tight economic pressure and their production volumes are mostly large, the potential economic impact of a VHS outbreak is substantial. Therefore, since the 1960s, several extensive sanitation and eradication programs have been implemented to control VHS, and since the spring of 2009, no VHS has been detected in any Danish fish farm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref022">22</xref>]. In contrast to Danish trout farming conditions, approximately 95% of all German trout farms are very small (annual production volume of &lt;5 metric tons; Survey and Diagnosis 2014, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eurl-fish.eu/Activities/survey_and_diagnosis" xlink:type="simple">http://www.eurl-fish.eu/Activities/survey_and_diagnosis</ext-link>), and their trout production is intended more for the local market or even for self-sufficiency. The smaller economic weight of rainbow trout production in Germany could be one reason for this less strict control.</p>
<p>Given that the rapid population growth of the 5<italic>i</italic> population took place exclusively in Denmark between approximately 2000 and 2001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g004">Fig 4</xref>) (provided that our analysis reflects a demographic expansion and not a selective sweep), it therefore occurred during the final period of the Danish VHS-eradication program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref022">22</xref>]. This was surprising as such an event can point, under certain circumstances, to a biosecurity gap; for example, when dealing with practices of aquaculture or fish trade for farming and restocking purposes. The underlying idea is that careless handling of VHSV-infected fish may suddenly result in an increased spread rate of the virus, which is normally the basis for a sudden demographic expansion event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref045">45</xref>]. However, such an increased spread rate can also be the result of either a sudden non-human-mediated change in the natural environment (e.g., changes in the climate), or a successful evolutionary adaptation towards increased fitness that may have acted within these circulating VHSV infections. Seen in this light, we believe that the causative factor of this Danish demographic expansion event may be of particular interest in follow-up studies.</p>
<p>In the case of the potential rapid population growth of the 9<italic>i</italic> population, we think that Germany was a crucial place for its emergence, at least from approximately 2001–2003 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Nevertheless, we found 9<italic>i</italic> isolates in eight further European countries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Accordingly, their participation in the population growth was not excludable, because of the mentioned sampling bias of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates in our dataset. In particular, the role of Italy, Poland, and Switzerland was at issue, as their jagged mismatch curves still exhibited a discernible unimodal shape that may indicate their participation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In the case of Switzerland, however, we know that the trout farming industry did not sell life trout abroad during this period; instead, they bought many life trout from surrounding countries. We only exclude Danish participation, as our dataset comprised no Danish 9<italic>i</italic> isolates, even though our dataset has a high spatiotemporal density of Danish isolates from that period.</p>
<p>At first sight, this Europe-wide spread and mixing of <italic>Ia</italic> isolates seems to be surprisingly inconsistent with another outcome of this study, namely that only about 4% of the <italic>Ia</italic> haplotypes occurred in more than one European country (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). However, we think that this can most probably be explained by the observed high substitution rate of VHSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref017">17</xref>]. Our dataset indicates that the mean period of occurrence of a single <italic>Ia</italic> haplotype is typically not longer than one calendar year. Furthermore, distinct isolates from the same VHS outbreak occasionally fall into different but very closely related haplotypes (e.g., isolates V43-14bb, V44-14bb, and V45-14bb) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164475.s002">S1 Table</xref>). However, the observation that one haplotype in our dataset (number 140) was re-isolated (as isolate V01-90he) 19 years after its first isolation (as isolate FR-0771) can be best explained by laboratory contamination or a confusion event.</p>
<p>Our dataset suggests that <italic>Ia</italic> clades become extinct after a period, since the mean period of occurrence of a clade is approximately 11 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164475.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We consider that this cyclic pattern of newly arising formations and the disappearance of clades have been mainly caused by anthropogenic influences such as trout farmers and traders, since the host of the <italic>Ia</italic> population has mainly been the European farmed rainbow trout. Approximately 95% of the <italic>Ia</italic> isolates of our dataset are from farmed rainbow trout. This close ecological interaction is supported by the fact that <italic>Ia</italic> isolates have, in contrast to isolates from other subgenogroups of the genogroup <italic>I</italic> (<italic>Ib</italic>–<italic>Ie</italic>) and the genogroups <italic>II</italic>–<italic>IV</italic>, a particularly high virulence for farmed rainbow trout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref046">46</xref>]. We believe that careless breeding and trade practices when dealing with VHS-infected fish have unintentionally supported the geographical spread of the virus and the establishment of new clades, while sanitation and eradication measures have led to their extinction. We also largely exclude a natural host’s adaptation toward resistance against the virus. This is because farmed animal stocks frequently suffer from weaker resistance against infectious disease and often have a lower potential for evolutionary resistance adaptation in comparison to their wild ancestors. Furthermore, housing and trading conditions make farmed stocks particularly vulnerable to the spread of pathogens. The main reasons for this are: (1) the loss of variation at resistance loci because of founder effects that result from domestication and intentional breeding events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref049">49</xref>]; (2) a decreased chance of successfully adapting towards disease resistance due to artificial mating systems and a consequent relaxation of natural selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref051">51</xref>]; (3) the danger of pleiotropic effects (negative side effects) from intentional breeding that can negatively influence disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref052">52</xref>]; (4) factory farming practices that can lead to a stress-induced weak immune system due to artificial housing conditions and high population density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref053">53</xref>]; and last but not least, (5) a high population density that can additionally increase virus transmissibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164475.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
