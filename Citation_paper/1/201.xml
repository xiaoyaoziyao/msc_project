<abstract>
<p>Crown rot (<italic>Phytophthora cactorum</italic>) causes significant economic losses in strawberry production. The best control strategy would be to use resistant cultivars, but polygenically inherited resistance makes the breeding of the garden strawberry (<italic>Fragaria</italic> × <italic>ananassa</italic>) challenging. The diploid wild strawberry <italic>Fragaria vesca</italic> Hawaii 4 genotype was shown previously to have resistance against crown rot. To explore the resistance mechanisms, we inoculated the roots of Hawaii 4 with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> in a novel <italic>in vitro</italic> hydroponic system to minimize interference caused by other microbes. Major reprogramming of the root transcriptome occurred, involving 30% of the genes. The surveillance system of the plant shifted from the development mode to the defense mode. Furthermore, the immune responses as well as many genes involved in the biosynthesis of the defense hormones jasmonic acid, ethylene and salicylic acid were up-regulated. Several major allergen-like genes encoding PR-10 proteins were highly expressed in the inoculated plants, suggesting that they also have a crucial role in the defense responses against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic>. Additionally, flavonoids and terpenoids may be of vital importance, as several genes involved in their biosynthesis were up-regulated. The cell wall biosynthesis and developmental processes were down-regulated, possibly as a result of the down-regulation of the key genes involved in the biosynthesis of growth-promoting hormones brassinosteroids and auxin. Of particular interest was the expression of potential resistance genes in the recently identified <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> resistance locus <italic>RPc-1</italic>. These new findings help to target the breeding efforts aiming at more resistant strawberry cultivars.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Strawberry crown rot caused by the hemibiotrophic oomycete <italic>Phytophthora cactorum</italic> hampers strawberry production in many parts of the world. It causes stunting and wilting of the plants and spoils the fruits by causing leather rot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref001">1</xref>]. The wilting symptoms first appear in the young leaves and as the disease progresses the whole plant may collapse. The most characteristic symptom is brown necrosis in the vascular tissue of the crown. As <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> is a soil-borne pathogen and forms sexual oospores that may survive many years in the soil, the removal of the disease from the infested fields is difficult. The cultivation practices promoting soil drainage may help in managing the disease. In addition, fosetyl-Al, phosphite-based products or elicitors could provide some protection against crown rot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref002">2</xref>]. However, the most effective method to control the disease is the use of resistant cultivars.</p>
<p>Strawberry displays resistance against most <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> strains, and only specialized <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> isolates have shown potential to cause crown rot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref004">4</xref>]. On the other hand, many of the widely used strawberry cultivars are susceptible to specialized <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> crown rot isolates, and only a few cultivars display resistance quite consistently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref006">6</xref>]. Shaw et al. have suggested that resistance against crown rot pathotype is a polygenic trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref008">8</xref>]. Besides the genetic background, the physiological status of the plant plays a role: cold-stored and/or wounded plants are particularly prone to the disease, and young plants tend to be more susceptible than the older ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref009">9</xref>]. Eikemo et al. tested 60 diploid <italic>Fragaria</italic> sp. accessions for their resistance/susceptibility to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref010">10</xref>]. The accessions varied from resistant to highly susceptible, but a majority was categorized as resistant or moderately resistant. Recently, Davik et al. analyzed the F<sub>2</sub> population of a cross between crown rot resistant and susceptible <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> genotypes (Bukammen and Haugastøl 3, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref011">11</xref>]. They were able to identify a single major gene locus (named <italic>RPc-1</italic>, <italic>Resistance</italic> to <italic>Phytophthora cactorum 1</italic>), which explained 74.4% of the phenotypic variance. The 3.3 Mb QTL region contained 801 predicted genes, of which 69 may play a role in disease resistance. However, a major effort is still needed to identify those genes actually conferring crown rot resistance.</p>
<p>The defense mechanisms against strawberry pathogens have been extensively reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref012">12</xref>]. As in other plants, a two-layered inducible defense system probably functions also in strawberry. Immunity is induced, if the plant recognizes a highly conserved pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular pattern (PAMP or MAMP) with the help of a membrane-localized pattern-recognition-receptor (PRR), or if it perceives a pathogen effector with the help of a resistance (R) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref013">13</xref>]. The recognition triggers a complex signaling network, leading to the reprogramming of gene expression and to the activation of defense responses, including the synthesis of antimicrobial secondary metabolites and the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. The magnitude of the defense varies depending on the pathogen, the effector-triggered immunity (ETI) being a stronger and faster response than the PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Plant hormones play important roles in the modulation of defense responses. In general, the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent signaling pathway is effective against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens and is required for the activation of hypersensitive cell death response, whereas the jasmonate (JA)- and ethylene (ET)-mediated defense responses act against necrotrophs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref014">14</xref>]. Crosstalk between these two signaling pathways is often antagonistic, and defense responses can be modulated also by other plant hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Until now, no large-scale transcriptome analyses on strawberry defense responses against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> have been reported. To gain a better understanding of the defense mechanisms, we inoculated <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> plantlets with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> zoospores, and sequenced the root transcriptome. The diploid woodland strawberry, <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic>, is the wild relative of the octoploid garden strawberry. The accession Hawaii 4 (H4) was chosen as it is quite resistant against crown rot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref010">10</xref>], and is the reference accession used in the genomic sequencing project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref016">16</xref>]. In order to reduce biological variation between the replicates, micropropagated plant clones were used, and a novel hydroponic <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system was exploited to eliminate interference caused by other microbes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The samples were collected two days post-inoculation, representing the early infection stage according to Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref017">17</xref>]. The data provide comprehensive insight into the transcriptional reprogramming that occurs in the roots of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> upon inoculation.</p>

<p>Micropropagated plants of garden strawberry, <italic>Fragaria</italic> x <italic>ananassa</italic> cv. ‘Senga Sengana’, were purchased from Agrifood Research Finland MTT, Laukaa Research and Elite Plant Station. The seeds of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic>, accession Hawaii 4, were provided by Dr. Timo Hytönen (Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Helsinki, Finland). The seeds were disinfected in 5% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, washed in sterile deionized water, and placed on Murashige-Skoog (MS) agar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref018">18</xref>]. Two germinated seedlings, named H4.4 and H4.5, and the ‘Senga Sengana’ plants were micropropagated on MS agar supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine (2,2 mg/l) and indole-3-butyric acid (0,4 mg/l). Temperature of the growth room was 20 ± 2°C and the light/dark cycle was 16/8 h.</p>
<p>To induce the root formation, the micropropagated plants were transplanted to MS agar without hormones. After 4 weeks, when the roots were sufficiently developed, the plants were transferred to aerated hydroponic culture in modified RITA® containers (VITROPIC, Saint-Mathieu-de-Tréviers, France) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Two plants of each clone (H4.4, H4.5, ‘Senga Sengana’) were placed in each container (six containers in total), and the roots were protected from light by wrapping aluminum foil around the lower part of the container. The plants were grown in modified half-strength Hoagland solution (3 mM KNO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mM Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 μM KCl, 25 μM H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, 2 μM ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 μM MnSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 μM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 μM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>, 20 μM Fe(Na)EDTA, 2 mM MES) for 20 days before the inoculation. The growth room conditions were as described above.</p>

<p>The <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> isolate Pc407 originates from infected rhododendrons and is highly virulent to garden strawberry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref019">19</xref>]. The <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> isolate was maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at the room temperature. To induce sporangia and zoospore production, the isolate was cultured in pea broth and soil extract water. Pea broth was prepared as described by Zentmyer and Chen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref020">20</xref>]. Frozen green peas were mixed in a blender in deionized water (100 g/250 ml). After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through Whatman® qualitative filter paper (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), deionized water was added to 500 ml, and the preparation was autoclaved (121°C, 15 min). The soil extract water was prepared according to Hamm &amp; Hansen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref021">21</xref>]. The soil (Puutarhamulta, Kekkilä Oy, Vantaa, Finland) was mixed in deionized water (1:1) and kept overnight at room temperature. After centrifugation and filtering through qualitative filter paper, the soil extract water was autoclaved.</p>
<p>The <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> was grown in the pea broth (10 ml) in Petri dishes for three days at room temperature. To induce sporangia development, the cultures were washed three times with sterilized deionized water, and 10 ml of soil extract water was added. The plates were incubated overnight at room temperature under fluorescent light. The soil extract water was removed and the plates were kept under fluorescent light for another 24 h, after which plenty of sporangia were visible. Sterile deionized water (25 ml, 4°C) was added, and the cultures were chilled for 30 min at 4°C and then returned to room temperature. After 2 h, most of the zoospores were liberated, and the suspensions were decanted to sterile Erlenmeyer flasks. The zoospores were counted (Bürker chamber), and the concentration was adjusted to 5000 zoospores ml<sup>-1</sup> by adding sterile deionized water.</p>

<title>Inoculation with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> zoospores and sample collection</title>
<p>For the inoculation with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> zoospores, the scaffolds, each holding six plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), were transferred to RITA®-containers (modified for hydroponic growth) containing 390 ml of zoospore suspension or sterile deionized water (negative control). The roots were immersed in the liquid for 30 min, and then returned to half-strength Hoagland solution. All treatments were made in triplicate.</p>
<p>Samples for RNA extraction were collected 2 days after inoculation, as the hyphae were visible on the root surfaces of the inoculated plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Three biological replicates were collected, all from different containers. Roots, crown and leaves were excised with scalpel, weighed separately and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at—80°C.</p>

<title>RNA extraction</title>
<p>Roots of H4.4 plants were ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, each individual separately. During grinding, 1 ml of SE buffer (0,14 M NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 8 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>*2 H<sub>2</sub>O, 0,05% v/v Tween-20, 2% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone 40, 0,7% w/v bovine serum albumin) was added to 100 mg of plant material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref023">23</xref>]. The powder (~ 150 mg) was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. RNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to manufacturer´s instruction. To remove genomic DNA, On-column DNase Digestion was made with RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). The quality and quantity of RNA was determined with Nanodrop® ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Products, Wilmington, DE, USA), and samples with 260/280 and 260/230 absorbance ratios of &gt; 2.0 and &gt; 1.75, respectively, were accepted for sequencing.</p>

<title>Library preparation and RNA sequencing</title>
<p>RNA sequencing was made to six root samples of Hawaii4.4 (three controls and three inoculated root samples), each representing one individual and collected from a different container. The library construction and sequencing of the samples were performed in Weill Cornell Medical College, Genomics Resources Core Facility (NY, USA). The RNA integrity was verified with Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The libraries were constructed with Illumina Truseq RNA-seq Sample Prep Kit, and the sequencing was made using Illumina HiSeq2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The raw reads are available at the NCBI SRA database (accession numbers SRR3743193, SRR3743194, SRR3743195, SRR3743196, SRR3743197, SRR3743198).</p>

<p>The raw reads were first trimmed using Trimmomatic (version 0.32) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref024">24</xref>]. The adapter sequences were removed, and low quality bases (phred quality score below 3) were deleted from both ends of the reads. The reads were also scanned with 4-base sliding window and cut if the average quality per base dropped below 15. Reads shorter than 36 bases were discarded.</p>
<p>The trimmed reads were mapped against <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> nuclear (version v1.0) and chloroplast genome using STAR RNA-seq aligner (version 2.4.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref025">25</xref>]. Maximum of ten mismatches were allowed, and the minimum and maximum intron lengths were set to 20 and 6000, respectively. Reads that were mapped to coding sequences (CDS) of annotated genes were counted using featureCounts with default settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref026">26</xref>]. Chloroplast genome annotation was released on 12.05.2011 and genome annotation was last updated on 04.03.2015. The unmapped paired-end reads were mapped against expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> species (330 482 sequences downloaded from NCBI EST database) using Bowtie (version 0.12.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Differential expression analysis was made using EdgeR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref028">28</xref>]. Only the genes with a minimum expression level of one count per million (cpm) in at least three replicates were used. The genes were considered differentially expressed, if the false discovery rate (FDR) was &lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub> fold change &lt; -1 or &gt; 1.</p>
<p>Gene Ontology (GO) terms were searched for the longest protein sequence of each gene using PANNZER with default settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref029">29</xref>]. GO term enrichment analysis was made using BiNGO plugin in Cytoscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref030">30</xref>]. REVIGO was used to remove redundant terms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref031">31</xref>]. Protein domains for receptor-like kinases were searched with Interproscan in Geneious 8.1.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneious.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.geneious.com</ext-link>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref032">32</xref>]. Separate GO term enrichment analysis was also made for the up- and down-regulated RLK gene sets, using the whole RLK gene set as a reference.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>To understand the molecular events resulting from the interaction of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> with strawberry roots, we first needed to establish a suitable plant-pathogen pair. Of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> isolate selection in our position, the isolate 407, originating from infected rhododendrons, was known to be highly virulent to garden strawberry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref019">19</xref>]. It killed or nearly killed 80% of the inoculated garden strawberry cv. Jonsok plants in pathogenicity tests. When we tested the isolate on another strawberry cv. Senga Sengana known to be one of the most resistant cultivars against crown rot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref006">6</xref>], it caused severe stunting of the plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). On the other hand, 407 did not cause significant decrease in the biomass of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> Hawaii 4.4 either in greenhouse conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) or in hydroponic <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We concluded that the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> isolate 407 together with <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> genotype Hawaii 4.4 served our purpose, as the isolate was not pathogenic to Hawaii but was pathogenic at least to two garden strawberry cultivars. The responses that would be seen were expected to indicate how <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> protects itself against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> and crown rot disease.</p>

<p>Genes expressed at a low level were filtered out, leaving 16 793 genes for further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s007">S1 Table</xref>). Of these genes, 4576 and 4243 were down- and up-regulated (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05) in the inoculated plants compared to water controls, respectively, if no fold-change cut-off values were applied. However, to improve the reliability of the results, more stringent analysis was carried out with cut-off values of log<sub>2</sub> fold-change &lt; -1 or &gt; 1, resulting in 2993 significantly down-regulated and 2371 up-regulated genes (FDR &lt; 0.05). These more stringent cut-off values were used below. The differences between the groups were mainly quantitative, since only 15 and 10 genes were expressed exclusively in the controls and inoculated plants, respectively.</p>
<p>GO terms were assigned to 13 144 genes (78% of the genes) using PANNZER annotation program (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s007">S1 Table</xref>). GO term enrichment analysis of the expressed genes revealed 656 and 475 biological processes, 252 and 84 molecular functions and 37 and 85 cellular components significantly enriched (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) in the up- and down-regulated gene sets, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s008">S2 Table</xref>). The most significantly (adjusted p-value &lt; 1E-15) enriched biological processes are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s004">S4 Fig</xref>. As one might expect, “response to biotic stimulus” was the most significantly enriched biological process among the gene set up-regulated in the inoculated plants. This confirms that the experimental set-up was successful. Other up-regulated biological processes included many GO terms associated with metabolic/biosynthetic processes, signaling, transport, responses to various stimuli, defense responses and regulation of immune processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s008">S2 Table</xref>). Salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene biosynthetic/metabolic processes were up-regulated as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, “cell wall organization or biogenesis” was the most significantly down-regulated biological process. Several GO terms related to polysaccharide metabolism, morphogenesis, development and growth were also down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s008">S2 Table</xref>). Of the hormonal processes, auxin transport and brassinosteroid metabolic/biosynthetic processes were the most significantly down-regulated ones. Down-regulation of growth and development is a well-known phenomenon in pathogen-challenged plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref033">33</xref>]. When the resources are limited, the plant needs to prioritize the defense over development and growth in order to survive. However, constant, unnecessary activation of the defense responses at the expense of development is harmful for the fitness of the plant. In this study, growth repression caused by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculation was apparently transient, as there were no significant differences in the biomass between the inoculated and uninoculated plants in the long-term experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s003">S3</xref> Figs). This minuscule effect on growth may be associated to the tight regulation of defense responses. In the next chapters, a closer look is taken to the genes related to the most significantly up- and down-regulated biological processes and the genes that could play important roles in plant immunity.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Genes expressed in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> resistance locus <italic>RPc-1</italic></title>
<p>Of particular interest was the expression of 69 defense related genes, located in the QTL region associated with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> resistance in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref011">11</xref>]. Of these genes, 47 were expressed highly enough (at least one cpm in three replicates) to be included in the differential expression analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161078.t002">Table 2</xref>). Seven of these genes were significantly down-regulated, while 19 were up-regulated upon <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculation. Many of the up-regulated genes, such as cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, calcium-binding protein and kinases are probably involved in signaling events, whereas WRKY transcription factors are important transcriptional regulators of plant defense responses. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) catalyzes the first committed step in the phenylpropanoid pathway, leading to the biosynthesis of various polyphenolic compounds, and is arguably one of the central players in plant defense. However, the most interesting resistance gene candidates are receptor-like protein, receptor kinases and nucleotide-binding site–leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) resistance proteins possibly functioning in pathogen perception. In total, four NBS-LRR protein-encoding genes (101306457, 101297569, 101300750, 101304699) were expressed in the <italic>RPc-1</italic> locus, two of them being significantly down-regulated in the inoculated plants. The most highly expressed NBS-LRR gene was 101297569, which had much higher expression level compared to the other NBS-LRR genes, and can thus be considered as one of the resistance gene candidates in the <italic>RPc-1</italic> locus. Receptor-like kinases (RLK) are discussed in more detail in the next chapter.</p>

<title>Receptor-like kinases</title>
<p>Membrane-bound receptor-like kinases are involved in pathogen recognition and activation of immune responses as well as in the regulation of plant development. Protein domains for annotated receptor-like kinases (RLKs) were searched, and 308 RLKs were classified in nine groups based on their domain structures and similarity to known RLKs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161078.t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Approximately 66% of these RLKs were differentially expressed upon <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> attack. Among the up-regulated RLK gene set, several enriched GO terms were related to stress and defense responses, the most significant term being “response to salicylic acid stimulus”. In contrast, most of the enriched GO terms in the down-regulated RLK set were related to the regulation of development and growth, indicating that the surveillance system of the plant was shifted from the development mode to the defense mode.</p>

<p>Interestingly, two L-type-lectin-RLKs (101310048, 101309756), two G-type-lectin-RLKs (101305393, 101305094) and one receptor-like protein (RLP) (101290881), significantly up-regulated in the inoculated plants in our study, are located in the QTL region associated with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> resistance in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref011">11</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161078.t002">Table 2</xref>). Especially, two L-type-lectin-RLKs (101310048, 101309756) were highly expressed and markedly up-regulated in the inoculated plants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161078.t002">Table 2</xref>); they were also the most highly expressed L-type-lectin-RLKs in the inoculated roots of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic>. In addition, one gene (101292033) located in the <italic>RPc-1</italic> locus, with typical L-type-lectin receptor domain but lacking kinase domain, was constitutively highly expressed in the roots (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161078.t002">Table 2</xref>). As several studies have demonstrated the role of L-type-lectin-RLKs in <italic>Phytophthora</italic> resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref036">36</xref>], these genes can be considered as the strongest resistance gene candidates in the <italic>RPc-1</italic> locus. Some G-type-lectin-RLKs are involved in innate immunity as well, although they are better known for their role in the control of self-incompatibility in <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref037">37</xref>]. For example, NgRLK1 is the interactor of <italic>Phytophthora capsici</italic> elicitin, capsicein, that is able to trigger a hypersensitive response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref038">38</xref>]. Up-regulated RLP in the <italic>RPc-1</italic> locus contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-domain in the extracellular part but lacks a cytoplasmic kinase domain. As this gene was highly expressed in the inoculated plants and LRR-RLPs have been implicated in disease resistance in several plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref039">39</xref>], this gene is also a good resistance gene candidate in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic>. To unravel the potential role of these RLKs in the crown rot resistance, mechanistic studies should be carried out.</p>
<p>A closer look at the RLKs revealed a new group of proteins, which often contained wall-associated receptor kinase galacturonan-binding domain (IPR025287) in their extracellular part, although being otherwise more similar to pathogenesis-related 5 (PR5)-like receptor kinase-related (PTHR24420:SF561) subfamily in the PANTHER database. Over 80% of the members of this RLK group were up-regulated in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> roots after <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161078.t003">Table 3</xref>), suggesting an important role in defense responses. Wall-associated kinases (WAK)/WAK-like (WAKL) may serve as sensors monitoring cell wall integrity, since they are directly cross-linked to cell wall pectins, but are also able to bind shorter pectin fragments released from the cell wall in pathogen attacks and activate defense responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref040">40</xref>]. We also identified an additional RLK group that contained LRR-domain followed by malectin-like carbohydrate-binding domain (IPR024788). Some of the members of this group showed similarity to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> LysM RLK1-interacting kinase 1, which regulates negatively the innate immunity triggered by chitin and flg22, and positively JA and ET signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref041">41</xref>]. Of the other RLK groups, the members of which were most often up-regulated, cysteine-rich receptor kinases (CRKs) may perceive extracellular ROS signals and activate intracellular signaling in response to abiotic or biotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Three RLK groups, in which the members were more often down-regulated than up-regulated, were LRR-RLKs, <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> RLK1-like kinases (CrRLK1Ls) and MLD-LRR-RLKs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161078.t003">Table 3</xref>). CrRLK1Ls regulate cell elongation and developmental processes in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref043">43</xref>], and many of the down-regulated LRR-RLKs seem to control plant development as well. These data are in line with the results of GO term enrichment analysis indicating the down-regulation of developmental processes upon <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Examples of MLD-LRR-RLKs include symbioses receptor-like kinase (SYMRK) required for symbiotic plant-pathogen-interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref045">45</xref>], and impaired oomycete susceptibility 1 (IOS1) that contributes to downy mildew disease development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref046">46</xref>]. As some of the MLD-LRR-RLKs may function as susceptibility factors, it may be beneficial to down-regulate their expression upon pathogen attack.</p>

<title>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase genes and positive regulators of SA signaling</title>
<p>The SA-related biological processes were up-regulated in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> upon <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculation. In SA-rich plants such as poplar, rice and potato, SA synthesis mainly takes place through phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL)-dependent phenylpropanoid pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref047">47</xref>]. As strawberry leaves have high basal levels of SA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref048">48</xref>], it seems probable that phenylpropanoid pathway is the main SA biosynthesis pathway also in <italic>Fragaria</italic> spp. Of the two PAL-encoding genes expressed in our transcriptome, one (101315259) is located in the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> resistance locus in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, SA is mostly synthesized through isochorismate synthase 1 (ICS1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref049">49</xref>], which has not been identified in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic>. However, some other gene homologs known to be involved in SA signaling in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were up-regulated in inoculated <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> roots. These included enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) and phytoalexin-deficient 4 (PAD4) that function upstream of SA synthesis and potentiate SA signaling in a positive feedback loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref050">50</xref>]. EDS1 is able to form heterodimers with PAD4 and also with senescence-associated gene101 (SAG101) that has been implicated in plant immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref051">51</xref>]. In our study, three SAG101-genes were up-regulated in the inoculated plants. In addition, two AGD2-like defense response protein 1 (ALD1) genes and two flavin-dependent monooxygenase 1 (FMO1) genes were up-regulated. FMO1 is required for systemic accumulation of SA in systemic acquired resistance (SAR) along with ALD1, which is responsible for the synthesis of pipecolic acid, a long distance signal for SA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref052">52</xref>]. The results suggest that systemic responses are activated in the inoculated <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> roots.</p>

<title>JA and ET biosynthesis and metabolism</title>
<p>The biosynthetic and metabolic processes of JA and ET were significantly enriched among the gene set up-regulated in the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculated <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> roots. Two 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase-like (ACS) genes and at least two ACC oxidase-like (ACO) genes were up-regulated in the ET biosynthetic pathway. Also three ethylene response factor 1 (ERF1) genes were up-regulated. ERF1 is known to activate transcription of several PR genes in response to ET and JA and is an important transcription factor in plant defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref053">53</xref>]. Also the negative regulators of ET signaling were up-regulated upon <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> attack: reversion-to-ethylene sensitivity 1 (RTE1) and two ET receptors (ethylene receptor 2 (ETR2) and ethylene response sensor 1 (ERS1)). These receptors serve as negative regulators of ET signaling, ensuring that the responses are down-regulated as soon as the ET level is diminished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref054">54</xref>]. As the prolonged up-regulation of immune responses can be detrimental, this feedback regulation system is probably crucial for the plant.</p>
<p>Most genes in key steps of JA biosynthesis were up-regulated upon <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> attack: three LOX-like genes, two allene oxide synthase-like (AOS) genes, two allene oxide cyclase-like (AOC) genes, and three 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 3-like genes (OPR3). Activation of negative regulation was also observed. Four negative regulators of JA-responsive genes, jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) genes, were significantly up-regulated, whereas the Coronatine-insensitive protein 1 (COI1)–encoding transcripts were reduced (log<sub>2</sub> FC -0.955, FDR 4.12E-05). This could cause desensitization to JA-Ile, since COI1 functions as JA-Ile receptor, and forms SCF<sup>COI1</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes with other proteins to recruit JAZ repressors for ubiquitination and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref055">55</xref>]. Similar responses have been observed in potato cultivar Ackersegen that displays quantitative resistance against <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>: concentrated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> culture filtrate caused up-regulation of genes implicated in SA-related defense responses and JA biosynthesis, but also up-regulation of JAZ1 and down-regulation of COI1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref056">56</xref>]. This suggests that the seemingly contradictory responses could represent a highly functional strategy against <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogens.</p>

<title>WRKY transcription factors potentially involved in SA/JA crosstalk</title>
<p>In total, 21 genes encoding WRKY transcription factors were significantly up-regulated in response to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculation.

<title>PR-10 proteins and flavonoid biosynthesis</title>
<p>In total, 18 genes with similarity to Mal d 1, Pru ar 1 or Pru av 1, major allergens of the Rosaceae family, were significantly up-regulated by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic>. Four of these were among the 10 most highly expressed genes in the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculated <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic>. All of these proteins belong to the PR-10 pathogenesis-related protein family induced by various stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref060">60</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that levels of PR-10 transcripts/proteins are elevated in <italic>Fragaria</italic> species challenged with pathogens such as <italic>Colletotrichum acutatum</italic>, <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>fragariae</italic>, <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and <italic>Podosphaera aphanis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref065">65</xref>]. The importance of these proteins in disease resistance is supported by the fact that their expression patterns differ between resistant and susceptible plants: some PR-10 proteins are expressed exclusively in the resistant genotype, or their up-regulation is faster or stronger compared to the susceptible genotype.</p>
<p>The PR-10 proteins can bind biologically important ligands in their hydrophobic cavity, including fatty acids, cytokinins, sterols and flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref066">66</xref>]. For example, the strawberry Fra a allergens bind metabolic intermediates of flavonoid biosynthesis and thereby control their biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref068">68</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that the up-regulation of the PR-10 proteins in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculated <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> is related to the enhanced synthesis of secondary metabolites. In accordance with this, the data suggest that the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161078.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In particular, the biosynthesis of flavan-3-ols, such as catechin, was probably increased, since leucoanthocyanidin reductase-like gene was up-regulated, but flavanol synthase and anthocyanidin synthase were significantly and nearly significantly (log<sub>2</sub> FC: -0.92, FDR: 0.008) down-regulated, respectively. Previous studies have shown that catechin is one of the most abundant flavonoids in strawberry fruits and leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref071">71</xref>]. Catechin seems to be involved in resistance against <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> and <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> in the leaves and fruits of strawberry, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref073">73</xref>].

<p>Several genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis according to KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) PATHWAY database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref074">74</xref>] were up-regulated in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculated <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161078.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This includes eight genes that catalyze the steps from acetyl-CoA to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. In contrast, none of the genes involved in the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway were up-regulated. The MVA pathway supplies precursors for the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoids and triterpenoids and functions in the cytosol/endoplasmic reticulum/peroxisomes, whereas the MEP pathway is located in the plastids and gives rise to monoterpenoids, diterpenoids and tetraterpenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref075">75</xref>]. Even though the MEP pathway was not up-regulated, there could be some changes in the monoterpenoid biosynthesis, as an (-)-alpha-pinene synthase-like gene was strongly up-regulated.</p>

<p>Genes involved in sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid synthesis were strongly up-regulated. Indeed, the most highly expressed gene in the inoculated plants encodes (-)-germacrene D synthase-like (GDS) protein included in sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161078.s007">S1 Table</xref>). Three other GDS genes were also significantly up-regulated. Transcript levels of squalene synthase, five squalene epoxidases and two beta-amyrin synthase-like genes were significantly higher in the inoculated roots, suggesting that triterpenoid biosynthesis is increased upon <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculation. Alpha/beta-amyrin synthase gene, along with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A synthase gene, were induced also in the fruits of garden strawberry 24 h after <italic>Colletotrichum acutatum</italic> inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref062">62</xref>]. Moreover, Hirai et al. have identified three antifungal triterpenoids from the inoculated and wounded fruits of strawberry cultivar that displays resistance against <italic>Colletotrichum fragariae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref076">76</xref>]. These results suggest that terpenoid biosynthesis is part of the general defense responses in strawberry.</p>
<p>Triterpenoids can be further processed to triterpenoid saponins that consist of triterpenoid backbone with one or more covalently linked sugar moieties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref077">77</xref>]. Prior to glycosylation, triterpenoid backbones are often oxygenated by cytochrome P450 enzymes. In our study, ten of the fifteen beta-amyrin 28-oxidase-like genes expressed in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> were up-regulated, suggesting that triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis is induced in the roots in response to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> attack. In a non-targeted metabolite analysis, triterpenoid saponins and glycosylated sesquiterpenoid derivatives have been identified in the strawberry flower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref078">78</xref>]. They are enriched in the sepals that protect floral buds from biotic and abiotic stresses, supporting an important role in defense. The molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial and antiherbivorous activities of saponins are not completely understood, but many of them are able to perturb the membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref079">79</xref>].</p>

<title>Brassinosteroid biosynthesis</title>
<p>In contrast to terpenoid biosynthesis, some of the genes catalyzing the biosynthesis of steroids and brassinosteroids (BR) were down-regulated in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> upon <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculation. This includes two genes encoding cycloartenol synthases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161078.g002">Fig 2</xref>), a gene encoding homolog of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DWF1 (DWARF1) and a gene encoding CYP85A2/BR6OX2 (BRASSINOSTEROID-6-OXIDASE 2). Cycloartenol synthases catalyze the first step in the pathway leading to campesterol and BR, i.e. the conversion of (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene to cycloartenol. DWF1 catalyzes the conversion of 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol and CYP85A2/BR6OX2 catalyzes the last, rate-limiting step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref080">80</xref>] in BR biosynthesis. We suggest that upon <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculation squalene is directed to triterpenoid biosynthesis rather than to BRs or other steroids. Furthermore, a homologue of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> BR receptor, BRI1 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1), was significantly down-regulated, presumably causing desensitization to BRs.</p>
<p>Down-regulation of BR biosynthesis and reduction of BR responsiveness is in agreement with the regulatory role of BRs in growth-immunity tradeoffs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref081">81</xref>]. Even though BRs can enhance pathogen resistance in some cases, several reports indicate negative effects on immunity, in particular on the activation of PAMP-triggered immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref082">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref083">83</xref>]. BR treatment also blocks benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced resistance in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref084">84</xref>]. It makes sense that BR synthesis would be diminished and BR responsiveness reduced in resistant <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> when inoculated with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic>, as BR signaling could otherwise override defense signaling. In addition, it would be beneficial for <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> to channel isoprenoid metabolites to terpenoid biosynthesis rather than to BR synthesis.</p>

<title>Auxin biosynthesis and transport</title>
<p>The transcriptome results suggest a decrease in auxin biosynthesis in the inoculated plants. All four YUCCA genes of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> (YUC1, YUC3, YUC5, YUC7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref085">85</xref>] expressed in the roots of the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> H4.4 genotype, were significantly down-regulated. The YUC flavin monoxygenase-like proteins catalyze the rate-limiting step in the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) pathway, which has been confirmed as the main auxin biosynthesis route in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref086">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref087">87</xref>]. According to GO term enrichment analysis, auxin transport was apparently down-regulated as well, and the expression levels of at least seven homologues of genes implicated in auxin transport in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were reduced in the inoculated <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> roots.</p>
<p>Auxin is an important regulator of development, and its impact on immunity can be negative or positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref088">88</xref>]. In general, auxin signaling seems to improve resistance against necrotrophs but enhance susceptibility against biotrophic pathogens, apparently because of the antagonistic relationship between SA and auxin. It has been reported that a mutation in WALLS ARE THIN1 (WAT1) gene, encoding a vacuolar auxin transporter, reduces auxin level and increases SA level in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots, which confers resistance to several vascular pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref089">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref090">90</xref>]. As WAT1 gene was down-regulated in the inoculated <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic>, it could play a role also in the defense responses against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic>. Auxin may enhance the susceptibility also by other mechanisms, e.g. by modulating cell wall properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref091">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref092">92</xref>]. On the other hand, it has been shown that suppression of auxin response renders <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> more susceptible to <italic>Phytophthora cinnamomi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref093">93</xref>]. Because of these contradictory findings it is difficult to conclude whether the changes in auxin-related processes promote or impede immunity in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic>.</p>

<title>Cell wall biosynthesis</title>
<p>Several GO terms related to cell wall biosynthesis, development and growth were enriched in the gene set down-regulated upon <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculation. Of the transcription factors regulating cell wall biosynthesis, two MYB46, VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 4 (VND4) and SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN 2 (SND2) genes were down-regulated in the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> inoculated plants. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, MYB46 acts as a master switch activating genes involved in the secondary cell wall synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref094">94</xref>], VNDs (VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN) are central activators of the secondary wall synthesis in the vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref095">95</xref>], and SND2 regulates genes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose biosynthesis and lignin polymerization in fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref096">96</xref>].</p>
<p>Of the cell wall biosynthetic genes, six out of eight cellulose synthase A catalytic subunit-like genes were down-regulated in the inoculated <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161078.t004">Table 4</xref>). Another group of genes systematically down-regulated was Fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (FLAs) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161078.t004">Table 4</xref>), which are suggested to have a role in cellulose deposition in the secondary cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref097">97</xref>]. Of the genes encoding Trichome birefringence-like (TBL) proteins, over 50% were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161078.t004">Table 4</xref>). The functions of TBLs are not well known, but some of them appear to contribute to the acetylation of cell wall polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref098">98</xref>]. The observed down-regulation of several cell wall synthesis genes may promote the activation of defense responses, as mutant plants with defects in the cell wall synthesis sometimes display changes in hormone homeostasis and enhanced resistance to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref099">99</xref>]. The only gene group involved in the cell wall synthesis that showed strong up-regulation in the inoculated plants, was the lignin-forming anionic peroxidase-like genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161078.t004">Table 4</xref>), suggesting that the plant attempts to compensate reduced cellulose synthesis by enhancing lignin deposition. This is in agreement with the finding that reduced cellulose synthesis leads to ectopic lignin synthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0161078.ref100">100</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This RNA-seq analysis provides comprehensive insight into the molecular survival mechanisms triggered in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> roots upon <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> attack, and emphasizes the balance between development and defense. Accordingly, cell wall synthesis is down-regulated, RLK-based surveillance system and biosynthesis pathways of hormones are reprogrammed and expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of potential defense compounds is enhanced. Interesting changes were also seen in the recently identified <italic>P</italic>. <italic>cactorum</italic> resistance locus <italic>RPc-1</italic>. Particularly, we want to highlight NBS-LRR resistance gene (101297569), which was the most highly expressed NBS-LRR gene in this locus, and the L-type-lectin-RLKs that were highly expressed and strongly up-regulated in the inoculated roots. Because L-type-lectin-RLKs are known to play important roles in <italic>Phytophthora</italic>-plant interactions, these RLKs are among the most interesting resistance gene candidates in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>vesca</italic> and their function should be further characterized. In addition, metabolomic studies should be carried out to confirm the changes observed in the biosynthesis pathways.</p>
