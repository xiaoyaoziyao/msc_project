<title>Background</title>
<p>Phytophagous insects have emerged successfully on the planet also because of the development of diverse and often astonishing defensive strategies against their enemies. The larvae of the mustard leaf beetle <italic>Phaedon cochleariae</italic>, for example, secrete deterrents from specialized defensive glands on their back. The secretion process involves ATP-binding cassette transporters. Therefore, sugar as one of the major energy sources to fuel the ATP synthesis for the cellular metabolism and transport processes, has to be present in the defensive glands. However, the role of sugar transporters for the production of defensive secretions was not addressed until now.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>To identify sugar transporters in <italic>P. cochleariae</italic>, a transcript catalogue was created by Illumina sequencing of cDNA libraries. A total of 68,667 transcripts were identified and 68 proteins were annotated as either members of the solute carrier 2 (SLC2) family or trehalose transporters. Phylogenetic analyses revealed an extension of the mammalian GLUT6/8 class in insects as well as one group of transporters exhibiting distinctive conserved motifs only present in the insect order Coleoptera. RNA-seq data of samples derived from the defensive glands revealed six transcripts encoding sugar transporters with more than 3,000 counts. Two of them are exclusively expressed in the glandular tissue. Reduction in secretions production was accomplished by silencing two of four selected transporters. RNA-seq experiments of transporter-silenced larvae showed the down-regulation of the silenced transporter but concurrently the up-regulation of other SLC2 transporters suggesting an adaptive system to maintain sugar homeostasis in the defensive glands.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We provide the first comprehensive phylogenetic study of the SLC2 family in a phytophagous beetle species. RNAi and RNA-seq experiments underline the importance of SLC2 transporters in defensive glands to achieve a chemical defense for successful competitive interaction in natural ecosystems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sugar sweetens our life. Glucose is one of the major energy sources and an important substrate for both protein and lipid synthesis. Its catabolism fuels cellular respiration for ATP production. For glucose absorption in the mammalian small intestine two pathways are known: the passive, paracellular absorption which bats rely on for more than 70% of their total sugar uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-CaviedesVidal1">[1]</xref> and the transporter-mediated transcellular pathways which non-flying mammals use preferentially. They take up glucose from interstitial fluid by a passive, facilitative transport process driven by the downward concentration gradient across the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Augustin1">[2]</xref>. Exclusively in the epithelial cell brush border of the small intestine and the kidney proximal convoluted tubules, glucose is absorbed or reabsorbed against its electrochemical gradient by a secondary active transport mechanism which uses the sodium concentration gradient established by Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATP pumps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Wright1">[3]</xref>. Unlike glucose in mammals, the major blood (hemolymph) sugar of insects is often the disaccharide trehalose (α-D-glucopyranosyl-α-D-glucopyranoside) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Elbein1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Thompson1">[6]</xref>. It is synthesized from glucose phosphates in fat body tissue and serves as a source of carbohydrates for various tissues including flight muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Wegener1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Candy1">[8]</xref>, intestinal tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Silva1">[9]</xref>, fat body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Bounias1">[10]</xref> or ovaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Shimada1">[11]</xref>. Besides trehalose absorption, the absorption of other sugars, such as fructose, glucose, and galactose, has been shown for different insect tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Bifano1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Meyer1">[17]</xref>. Only few examples of sugar transport proteins from insects have been functionally characterized to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Meyer1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Price2">[23]</xref>. Except for SCRT, which was classified as a member of family 49 of solute carriers (SLCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Meyer1">[17]</xref>, they all belong to the SLC2 family of glucose and polyol transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Thorens1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Mueckler1">[27]</xref>. In principle, SLC2 proteins are integral membrane proteins exhibiting a predicted twelve transmembrane domain topology. The so-called ‘sugar transport signatures’ that signify substrate binding and catalytic activity are also conserved in the SLC2 family. Usually, the expression of these proteins is tissue-specific and responds to metabolic and hormonal regulation. Each of the transporters possesses different affinities for sugars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Manolescu1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although beetles (Coleoptera) represent one of the most diversified lineages on earth with about 350,000 species described and total numbers probably an order of magnitude higher, SLC2 sugar transporters of beetles have not been in the focus of researchers so far. In particular, Chrysomelidae (leaf beetles) constitute, together with the Cerambycidae (longhorn beetles) and the Curculionoidea (weevils), the largest beetle radiation, namely “Phytophaga”, which represent about 40% of all known species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-GomezZurita1">[29]</xref>. Among phytophagous beetles are many pests such as the mustard leaf beetle <italic>Phaedon cochleariae</italic> which causes yield losses on cruciferous crops in Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Uddin1">[30]</xref>. This species is adapted to use host plants’ leaves as its food source for the duration of its life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Tremmel1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Termonia1">[32]</xref>. Due to its life in an exposed environment, it has to be protected against both the noxious effect of plant secondary metabolites and the attacks by its predators and parasitoids.</p>
<p>When it comes to producing defensive compounds to repel their omnipresent enemies, insect in general are very innovative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Whitman1">[33]</xref>. To circumvent auto-intoxicative effects, these natural products frequently are processed in exocrine glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Noirot1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Quennedey1">[36]</xref>. <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> is known to produce defensive compounds in such glands, herein further referred to as defensive glands, in the larval as well as in the adult stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Laurent1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Deroe1">[41]</xref>. The juvenile beetles possess nine pairs of these glands on their back and release deterrent secretions upon disturbance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Pasteels3">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Renner1">[43]</xref>. Each of these glands is composed of several secretory cells which are attached to a large reservoir. The anti-predatory effect of the secretions can be attributed to cyclopentanoid monoterpenes (iridoids) which are synthesized within the reservoir by few enzymatic reactions from a pre-toxin which is made in the fat body and from there transferred into the defensive glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Burse1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Frick1">[45]</xref>. Previously it has been shown that defensive gland cells possess ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters which are crucial for the shuttling of pre-toxins into the reservoir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Strauss1">[46]</xref>. Because ATP is used for the cellular metabolism and transport process into the defensive glands, sugars need to be delivered by transporters to drive ATP production in this tissue. Although defensive secretions from phytophagous insects are key players in trophic interactions found in terrestrial food webs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Ibanez1">[47]</xref>, their production pathways are often not fully understood. Sugar transporters may be essential components to fuel energy in insect defensive glands, however, nothing is known about their <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance for deterrent production.</p>
<p>Here we focus on a first catalogue of putative members of the SLC2 family as well as trehalose transporters for a phytophagous leaf beetle species. By means of a <italic>de novo</italic>-assembled transcriptome created from the mRNA of <italic>P. cochleariae</italic>, we have performed comprehensive and statistically supported phylogenetic analyses of the identified sequences together with their orthologs selected from other insects and other Metazoa including the known human glucose transporter (GLUT) isoforms. Our data revealed an enormous expansion of the GLUT6/8 sister group in insects and a clade of sequences unique for beetles. Subsequent next generation sequencing-based expression studies revealed putative SLC2 transcripts highly expressed in the defensive glands of juvenile <italic>P. cochleariae</italic>. Single silencing of selected SLC2-candidates by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted only in two cases in a reduced production of defensive secretions. However, in two other cases silencing did not affect deterrent production suggesting an adaptive backup system which stabilizes the sugar level in the defensive glands. To prove the observed homeostasis, we subsequently sequenced the mRNA of silenced larvae to study the differential expression of putative SLC2 transporters not only on phenotypic but also on a transcriptional level.</p>

<title>RNA Isolation, Library Construction and Sequencing</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from tissue samples from <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> larvae as described by Bodemann <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Bodemann1">[48]</xref>. Up to 5 µg of total RNA was then used for library preparation using TruSeq™ RNA Sample Prep Kit according to manufacturer’s description. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was done using Illumina next-generation sequencing technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Bentley1">[49]</xref> on a HiSeq2000 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California USA) in 50 bp single-read mode (two or three samples multiplexed in one lane). Pooled total RNAs from the different tissues (such as defensive glands, gut, fat body, Malpighian tubules, and head) from larval <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> were used for paired-end sequencing. Therefore, the fragmentation step during library preparation of the pooled total RNAs was shortened to four minutes (seven minutes for all the remaining samples) to obtain longer fragments. This library was sequenced using a GAIIx (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California USA) in 150 bp paired-end mode in one sample per lane. All reads were extracted in FastQ format using CASAVA v1.7 (HiSeq) and v1.8 (GAIIx) (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California USA) for further analysis.</p>
<p>Subsequently to the RNAi experiments (described below), additional sequencing was carried out. Four samples of glandular tissue (one sample of <italic>gfp</italic> dsRNA-injected larvae and three samples of larvae injected with dsRNA of three highly abundant sugar transporters) – two biological replicates each, have been prepared as mentioned above and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California USA) in 50 bp single-read mode (multiplexed in one lane). All reads were extracted in FastQ format using bcl2fastq v.1.8.3 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California USA). The raw sequence data are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084461-t001">Table 1</xref> and are stored in the Sequence Read Archive at NCBI (cDNA library 1: SRA100673; cDNA libraries 2: SRA106118, SRA106122, SRA106161; cDNA libraries 3: SRA108012, SRA108036; cDNA libraries 4: SRA108037, SRA108041; cDNA libraries 5: SRA109958, SRA109964; cDNA libraries 6: SRA109966, SRA109967).

Amino acid sequences in multi-FASTA format were aligned using Probalign version 1.4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Roshan1">[61]</xref> with default parameters or MAFFT version 7.023b with following settings: –maxiterate 1000 and –localpair. Thereafter, phylogenetic trees were calculated using MrBayes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Ronquist1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Huelsenbeck1">[63]</xref> version 3.2.1 and RAxML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Stamatakis1">[64]</xref> version 7.2.8 which use different methods. Namely, MrBayes uses Bayesian inference of phylogeny, and RAxML uses maximum likelihood estimation. Applying MrBayes the following settings were used: number of generations was set to 300,000, samplefreq and printfreq were set to 100, the number of runs was set to 2, and the type to calculate the consensus tree was set to allcompat. Applying RAxML the following parameters were used: the model of substitution was PROTGAMMAJTT (GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity), and 1000 rapid bootstrap inferences were done.</p>
<p>For every calculation of the phylogenetic tree only conserved parts were taken into account. Thus, the N-terminus, the loop between TM6 and TM7 as well as the C-terminus were excluded from calculating the phylogenetic tree.</p>
<p>First of all, the trees were calculated only for the chosen sequences derived from <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> to divide these into groups with respect to their sequence similarities. Second, sequences originating from other insects (<italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>, <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>, <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic>, <italic>Polypedilum vanderplanki, Bombyx mori</italic>) that have been functionally characterized were added to these sequences (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084461-t002">Table 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Chen1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kanamori1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kikawada1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Price1">[22]</xref>. Trees were re-calculated to identify sequences of <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> that are homologous to the characterized sequences. Third, the human GLUTs as well as other homologous sugar transporters from other Metazoa were selected. The chosen sequences derived from <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> were added to this selection and phylogenetic trees were calculated again to investigate the organisms’ distribution in the trees. Furthermore, we calculated trees for one specific branch (which separated from the others with bootstrap percentage of 100%). For this, orthologous sequences derived from other beetles namely <italic>Dendroctonus ponderosae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Keeling1">[65]</xref> and <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> were adjoined.</p>

<title>Gene Expression Profiling and Real-time PCR Validation of Putative Sugar Transporters in the Defensive Glands</title>
<p>Three replicates of the cDNA of <italic>P. cochleariae</italic>’s glands were prepared and sequenced as described above. All short reads of three replicates of glandular tissue were mapped onto the reassembled transcripts using Bowtie, an ultrafast short read aligner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Langmead1">[66]</xref> with –best and –strata options. Bioconductor is an open source, open development software project to provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is based primarily on the R programming language <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Gentleman1">[67]</xref>. The mapping results in bowtie format were loaded into R statistics using the ShortRead package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Morgan1">[68]</xref> which is part of the Bioconductor package. For estimation of variance-mean dependence in count data, the DESeq package was used which is also part of the Bioconductor package (release 2.11) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Anders1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Anders2">[70]</xref>. After analyzing the transcripts with DESeq, the sequences encoding the sugar transporters were selected and sorted regarding the number of sequence counts, beginning with the most abundant reads present in the glands. Furthermore, we normalized the normalized counts to the standards used for quantitative real-time PCR (<italic>Pcrpl6</italic> and <italic>Pcrps3</italic>) by first calculating the normalization factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Livak1">[71]</xref>. The normalized counts were then divided by this normalization factor to get fold changes comparable to the values resulting from quantitative real-time PCR experiments.</p>
<p>Real-time PCR was employed for relative quantification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Livak1">[71]</xref>. RNA was isolated as described above. Up to 5 µg of the RNA was reverse transcribed at 50°C for 60 min using SuperScript III and Oligo(dT)<sub>12–18</sub> primer (life technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). Two technical replicates were performed from three biological replicates each. Technical replicates with a Cq difference of &gt;1 were repeated. To normalize the PCRs for the amount of cDNA template added to the reactions, <italic>Pcrpl6</italic> and <italic>Pcrps3</italic> were chosen for <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> as reference genes.

<p>All 4 groups show the known and conserved facilitated sugar transporter motifs, such as DRxGRR/K in the second loop, PESPR/K in the sixth loop, E/DRxGRR/K in loop 8, and PETK/RGK/R in the carboxy terminal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Augustin1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Chen1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kanamori1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Zhao1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Price3">[86]</xref>. Furthermore, there are conserved amino acids, such as E and R in loop 4 and 10 (red). Those are needed for the glucose transport activity. Conserved tyrosines (turquois), such as the PMY motif mentioned by Chen <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Chen1">[15]</xref>, can be found in our sequences in TMD 4. Additionally, conserved glycines (yellowish) in TMD 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10 as well as in loop 2 and 7 are present, characteristic for the mammalian glucose transporter family. The purple branch exhibits a GWTAP motif in loop 1, a PFYV motif in loop 5, and a VILMNLH motif in TMD 10 (purple colored amino acids).</p>

<p>Besides the general conserved amino acid residues, we observed branch specific differences particularly for the purple branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084461-g002">Figure 2</xref>, purple colored amino acids). The conserved motif QQLSG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Augustin1">[2]</xref> which is present in all branches but substituted with QHXXG in the purple branch is important for the putative substrate binding. In addition, this purple branch exhibits several conserved motifs not present in other branches and not reported from any other transporter of the SLC2 family until now, such as a GWTAP motif in loop 1 (instead of GWTSP), a PFLPFY motif in loop 5, a VILMNLH motif in TMD 7, and a SWIP motif followed by a conserved methionine and tyrosine in TMD 10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084461.s003">Figure S3</xref>, multiple sequence alignment).</p>
<p>By comparing the sequences of chosen sugar transporters to sugar transporters of other insect species that have been functionally characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Chen1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kanamori1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kikawada1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Price1">[22]</xref>, we could show that these sequences fall exclusively into the green and yellow branch and not into the purple or blue branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084461-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084461.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The functionally proven trehalose transporters such as TRET1 from <italic>Polypedilum vanderplanki</italic>, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> build up a subbranch within the green branch together with <italic>Pc</italic>SUT12_1–4 (with bootstrap percentage of 98%). The GLUT8 of <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic> also belongs to this group. Therefore, we suggest (in agreement with Kanamori <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kanamori1">[18]</xref>), that this fire ant GLUT8 is probably a TRET1 ortholog. The functionally characterized glucose and glucose/fructose transporters from <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> and <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> cluster in the yellow branch. However, functional analysis of <italic>P. cochleariae</italic>’s transcripts is required to confirm substrate spectra of the transporters clustering into different branches.</p>

<p>To study phylogeny of sugar transporters in a larger context, we selected the <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> sequences and its homologs from selected Metazoa from various branches of the tree of life (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084461.s005">Figure S5</xref>), including the human SLC2 isoforms (GLUT1–12, H<sup>+</sup>-<italic>myo</italic>-inositol transporter (HMIT)), for cladistic analyses by MrBayes and RAxML. Generally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084461-g004">Figure 4</xref> displays that the sugar (glucose) and trehalose transporters build up a huge branch in insects, and the mammalian sugar porters form a separate branch. In accordance with the published phylogenetic analyses by Wilson-O’Brien <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-WilsonOBrien1">[79]</xref>, the mammalian GLUTs isoforms segregate into five distinct classes, also showing that the mammalian GLUTs are separate from their insect orthologs. Some insect sequences also cluster into the mammalian clades, e.g. the class I clade (GLUT1, 2, 3, 4) also contains insect sequences branching at the base with strong support (with bootstrap percentage of 100%). <italic>Pc</italic>SUT31 clusters together with mammalian HMIT. The class II (GLUT5, 7, 9, 11) and the GLUT10/12 clade contain only vertebrate sequences. According to Wilson-O’Brien <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-WilsonOBrien1">[79]</xref>, class II genes were most likely to arise after the divergence of this phylum, whereas the GLUT10/12 clade might has been lost in invertebrates secondarily. The majority of the tested insect sequences form a huge sister group of the GLUT6/8 class with strong support (100% bootstrap), suggesting an expansion of this class in insects. On inspection of the insect sequences, especially the green branch is remarkably large and can be subdivided into various subbranches. In addition to the five mammalian SCL2 classes, we suggest eight more classes in insects (each separated from the others with bootstrap percentages of at least 80%).</p>

<p>The bootstrap values of the tree of life support the notion that the purple branch may be restricted to the insect order Coleoptera. For deeper analysis of this branch, we have calculated trees with the sequences of this purple branch and its homologs/orthologs in insects. The MrBayes tree as well as the RAxML tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084461-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084461.s006">Figure S6</xref>) shows that only sequences derived from beetles such as <italic>Dendroctonus ponderosae</italic>, <italic>Tribolium castaneum,</italic> and <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> belong to this purple branch. Whereas, looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084461-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084461-g004">4</xref>, all other sequences derived from <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> show homologies to Diptera, Apocrita and other insect orders. According to our cladistic analyses, the purple branch of the phylogenetic trees seems to be the most interesting. All changed and additionally conserved motifs together with the motif QH lead to the hypothesis that the sequences belonging to the purple branch may provide a new class of sugar transporters in insects, especially in the order Coleoptera, not before described. However, their biological function remains to be elucidated.</p>

<title>Expression Profiles of SLC2 and Trehalose Transporter Transcripts in the Defensive Glands of Immature <italic>P. cochleariae</italic></title>
<p>The Illumina short reads derived from the glandular tissue sequenced using HiSeq2000 in 50 bp single-read mode (two or three samples multiplexed in one lane) resulted in 34,918,295 reads with length of 50 bp as well as 36,598,828 and 29,866,004 short reads, respectively. Those short reads have been mapped onto our transcriptome. 82.62% to 84.90% of all short reads could be mapped, whereas 14.28% to 16.31% of the reads failed to align (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084461.s014">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p>The mapping results were taken as input for R statistics. DESeq, belonging to the Bioconductor package, was applied to analyze the mapping results. The counts of transcripts are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084461.s013">Table S3</xref> (columns 3 to 5). All observed putative sugar transporters of SCL2 and trehalose transporters could be identified in the glandular tissue, although most of them at a very low level. Interestingly, the six most abundant transcripts (inclusive isoforms) with more than 3,000 normalized counts are spread among all four major phylogenetic subtrees as highlighted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084461.s007">Figure S7</xref>. Therefore, no specific branch is particularly overrepresented in the defensive glands. As previously demonstrated in literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Petzold1">[80]</xref>, evaluation of the RNA-seq data (standardized values shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084461.s015">Table S5</xref>) with quantitative real-time PCR data shows also in our experiments the comparability of the two methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084461.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Subsequently, the six transcripts have been analyzed regarding the distribution of their transcript levels in different larval tissues. Two sugar transporters namely <italic>Pc</italic>SUT2 and <italic>Pc</italic>SUT6, clustering into the blue branch, are exclusively expressed in defensive glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084461-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

By monitoring the development of treated larvae, significant weight reduction was observed neither for the larvae nor the pupae by transporter silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084461.s009">Figure S9</xref>). To screen for the function of the transporters for the synthesis of secretions, GC/MS analysis was carried out for quantification of the amount of chrysomelidial relatively to the <italic>gfp</italic>-controls. Here, we could observe decreases in the amount of chrysomelidial by silencing <italic>Pcsut1</italic> (p = 0.008) and <italic>Pcsut2</italic> (p = 0.001) and also in the amount of secretions produced by targeting <italic>Pcsut1</italic> (p = 0.007) and <italic>Pcsut2</italic> (p = 0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084461-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>).

<p>In contrast to the silencing effect of the ABC transporter in the defensive glands which caused a total loss of defensive secretions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Strauss1">[46]</xref>, RNAi targeting SLC2 transporters could not shut down the production of defensive exudates completely. This may be due to the turn-over rate of the integral-membrane proteins which may diminish the silencing effect or other transporters may be expressed to take over the function to achieve homeostasis in the tissue. To test the latter hypothesis, we have gathered RNA-seq data from larvae silenced in <italic>Pcsut2</italic> or <italic>Pcsut6</italic> (as examples for SLC2 members exclusively expressed in glands) or <italic>Pcsut1</italic> (as example highly expressed in defensive glands and gut) and analyzed differential expression of SLC2 transporters in comparison to <italic>gfp</italic>-treated larvae.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sugars play an important role in all species’ metabolism. Transporters of the SLC2 family are key elements involved in the adaptive response to sugar demand that have important physiological implications to cell survival and growth. They are expressed in a tissue-specific manner with different affinity, specificity and capacity for substrate transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Cura1">[81]</xref>. Recent phylogenetic analyses of genomic data available from sequenced insects suggest a remarkable expansion of the SLC2 family in insects compared to mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kanamori1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kikuta1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Price2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Joost1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-WilsonOBrien1">[79]</xref>. Beetles, however, have not yet been addressed. Here we present the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of members of the SLC2 sugar transporter family identified in a leaf beetle species.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Phylogenetic Analyses</title>
<p>We created a transcript catalogue of juveniles of <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> in which we annotated 68 sequences as SLC2 transporters. The phylogenetic analyses of putative sugar transporters were performed with MrBayes and RAxML. MrBayes, on the one hand, is a program for Bayesian inference and model choice across a large space of phylogenetic and evolutionary models. On the other hand, RAxML is a maximum likelihood phylogeny estimation. In our case, we were able to show that both programs result in a division of the predicted transporters into 4 main groups. However, there are some differences in the results of the calculations with the two methods. For example, <italic>Pc</italic>SUT8 belongs to the green branch of the phylogenetic tree showing <italic>P. cochleariae</italic>’s sequences as well as the functionally characterized sequences of the other insects calculated by MrBayes; RAxML sorted it into the blue branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084461-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084461.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Comparing these trees with the trees showing only sequences of <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> as well as with the trees which also include the sugar transporter sequences of mammals and other organisms, it can be seen that <italic>Pc</italic>SUT8 always belongs to the blue branch. To conclude, we propose that RAxML results in more stable trees when adding or deleting homologous sequences. This fact might be strengthened by Douady <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Douady1">[82]</xref> who concluded that the more conservative use of bootstrap percentages (as used by RAxML) might be less prone to supporting strongly a false phylogenetic hypothesis.</p>
<p>The mammalian GLUT proteins are well-studied, and phylogenetic studies have been carried out. In addition to the five distinct classes of mammalian GLUTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-WilsonOBrien1">[79]</xref>, we propose eight more groups of transporters including the trehalose transporters in the Insecta. The tree including mammalian GLUTs as well as homologous sequences of other organisms including insects shows that many transporters belonging to the SLC2 family derived from <italic>P. cochleariae</italic> and other insects constitute a huge subtree separate from the well-studied mammalian GLUTs. We suggest that the orange branch within this insect clade constitutes the fructose/glucose transporters. This suggestion is supported by, on the one hand, <italic>Ap</italic>ST3 from the pea aphid <italic>A. pisum</italic> which acts in the gut as a low-affinity uniporter for fructose and glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Price2">[23]</xref>, and on the other hand, <italic>Nl</italic>HT1 (<italic>Nl</italic>ST1) and <italic>Nl</italic>ST6 from the brown planthopper <italic>N. lugens</italic> which function as glucose and glucose/fructose transporters, respectively, in the gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kikuta1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Price1">[22]</xref>. The green branch within the huge insect clade most likely contains trehalose transporters including the transporter TRET1 from the sleeping chironomid <italic>P. vanderplanki</italic> and its orthologs from <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, <italic>B. mori</italic>, <italic>A. mellifera</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kanamori1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kikawada1">[19]</xref> and a proton-dependent transporter participating in trehalose reabsorption in Malpighian tubules of <italic>N. lugens</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kikuta2">[21]</xref>. Kinetic parameters show different affinities for trehalose among the TRET1 orthologs which mirror the trehalose:glucose ratio in the hemolymph of each species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Kanamori1">[18]</xref>. No functional assumptions can be made regarding all other subbranches, especially concerning the purple one which seems the most interesting to the study of beetles.</p>
<p>The large number of SLC2 transporters may result from gene duplications as has been suggested for <italic>A. pisum,</italic> whose genome contains a conspicuous number of genes encoding predicted sugar transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Price2">[23]</xref>. While such an idea still needs experimental proof, it may contribute to the reflection on how insects are able to adapt to extreme dietary conditions and to the testing of substrates not yet in the focus for SLC2 members such as plant derived glucosides, for example, present in large amounts in the diet of phytophagous insects.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the mammalian GLUT6/8 form a sister group of the expanded insect clade. In accordance with the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Zhao1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-WilsonOBrien1">[79]</xref> we see that GLUT6 and 8 are more closely related to sugar transporters present in invertebrate species than to other mammalian GLUTs. Mueckler <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Mueckler1">[27]</xref> stated that the primary physiological substrate for mammalian GLUT6 and 8 have not been definitely identified. Therefore, knowledge of substrate selectivity of the SLC2 members in the insect clade may also contribute to a deeper understanding of the function of GLUT 6 and 8 in mammals.</p>

<title>Membrane Protein Topology</title>
<p>Membrane proteins, such as sugar transporters, seem to have a restricted range of folds than their water-soluble counterparts, making them more amenable to structural predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Cuthbertson1">[83]</xref>. α-Helical membrane proteins contain one or more transmembrane helices which consist predominantly of hydrophobic amino acids. In our study of sugar transporters, 12 TM helices are stated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Joost1">[26]</xref>. To predict the TM domains of <italic>P. cochleariae</italic>’s sugar transporters, TMHMM as well as Memsat2 were used. For 40 of 68 sequences, Memsat2 was able to predict all 12 TM domains. TMHMM predicted those 12 TM domains for just 33 sequences. But, for three sequences Memsat2 failed to predict at least 10 TM helices and proposed 1 (twice) and 2 (once) TM helices. For those three sequences, TMHMM predicted 10 (once) and 12 (twice) TM helices. This leads us to the conclusion that neither of these prediction methods is perfect, but applying both gives us the required information. Furthermore, Cuthbertson <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Cuthbertson1">[83]</xref> suggested that optimal prediction is obtained by the method that best reflects the biological and physical principles governing membrane protein architecture.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4c">
<title>RNAi and Subsequent RNA-seq</title>
<p>After silencing <italic>Pcsut1</italic> and <italic>Pcsut2</italic>, phenotypic analyses revealed a reduction of defensive exudates in the larvae. Silencing of <italic>Pcsut5</italic> and <italic>Pcsut6</italic> did not result in a changed phenotype. By combining the RNAi experiments (silencing <italic>Pcsut1</italic>, <italic>Pcsut2</italic> and <italic>Pcsut6</italic>) with subsequent mRNA isolation and RNA sequencing, we could show the down-regulation as well as up-regulation of sugar transporters in the defensive glands. Silenced and induced sequences belong to separate branches in the phylogenetic trees which also suggest that insect transporters belonging to different clades can have comparable substrate preference. Anyhow, a direct correlation of counter-acting transporters was difficult to identify. All predicted off-targets according to Bodemann <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Bodemann1">[48]</xref> were excluded in the transporter sequences used for RNAi. Nevertheless, co-silencing effects could not be avoided. These effects could not be predicted most likely because of metabolic co-silencing which was already observed for two hexokinases in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Fraga1">[84]</xref>.</p>
<p>Homeostasis may not only be achieved by the induced expression of transporters but, for example, also by the induced trafficking of transport proteins within a cell. This trafficking is known, for example, from the mammalian GLUT4. The protein is hormonally induced to translocate from intra-cellular membranes to the plasma membrane for the absorption of excessive glucose from the blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084461-Leto1">[85]</xref>. In insects, however, an analogous phenomenon is not known and was not addressed in our analyses. In general, sugar homeostasis is not very well understood in insects, and the role of SLC2 members in this process has not been addressed to date. By transporter silencing in the defensive glands of the mustard leaf beetle larvae, we conclude that there is a complex network of SLC2 transporters in which several transporters compensate the function of the silenced ones. We demonstrate clearly the potential of SLC2 transporters to respond adaptively to nutrient demand. This response may have paramount ecological implications for the survival of phytophagous beetles in plant-insect interactions.</p>
