<abstract>
<p>CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) is involved in organizing chromosomes into mega base-sized, topologically associated domains (TADs) along with other factors that define sub-TAD organization. CTCF-Cohesin interactions have been shown to be critical for transcription insulation activity as it stabilizes long-range interactions to promote proper gene expression. Previous studies suggest that heterochromatin boundary activity of CTCF may be independent of Cohesin, and there may be additional mechanisms for defining topological domains. Here, we show that a boundary site we previously identified known as CTCF binding site 5 (CBS5) from the homeotic gene cluster A (HOXA) locus exhibits robust promoter activity. This promoter activity from the CBS5 boundary element generates a long noncoding RNA that we designate as <italic>b</italic>oundary associated <italic>l</italic>ong <italic>n</italic>oncoding <italic>RNA-1</italic> (blncRNA1). Functional characterization of this RNA suggests that the transcript stabilizes long-range interactions at the HOXA locus and promotes proper expression of HOXA genes. Additionally, our functional analysis also shows that this RNA is not needed in the stabilization of CTCF-Cohesin interactions however CTCF-Cohesin interactions are critical in the transcription of blncRNA1. Thus, the CTCF-associated boundary element, CBS5, employs both Cohesin and noncoding RNA to establish and maintain topologically associated domains at the HOXA locus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) is an eleven zinc finger protein that affects gene expression by a variety of mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Initially, CTCF was characterized as a transcription repressor of the c-Myc promoter [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Later studies have shown that CTCF can also act as a transcription activator [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. CTCF regulates transcription of the XIST gene and RNA interactions made with CTCF are critical for X chromosome inactivation (XCI) [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Notably, Cohesin has been found to bind to a majority of CTCF binding sites (CBSs) across the genome [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CTCF-Cohesin interactions are critical to the function of CTCF [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. CTCF recruits Cohesin directly via Cohesin subunit SA1/SA2 to facilitate long-range interactions [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The long-range interactions made by CTCF are critical for transcription insulation. Most recently, CTCF has been recognized as a critical component responsible for chromosome looping and topological organization of the genome [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Transcription insulation activities of CTCF include enhancer-blocking and heterochromatin boundary activities are two distinct assayable properties linked to a subclass of CBSs. Enhancer-blocking function resulting from CTCF–Cohesin interactions have been best characterized at the H19/Igf2 locus and the β-globin locus [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast, CTCF heterochromatin boundary activity is less well characterized, but may be independent of Cohesin [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Heterochromatin boundary activity was first characterized in <italic>Sacchromyces cerevisiae</italic>’s HMR locus and has been linked to Transcription Factor III (TFIII) C (TFIIIC) and RNA Polymerase (RNAP) III (RNAPIII) activity at the promoter region of the tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> gene encoded at the HMR locus [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Studies in yeast have shown that recruitment of RNAP can disrupt or antagonize heterochromatin [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In higher eukaryotes boundary activity has yet to be linked to active RNAP transcription, although it has been suggested to be associated with topological boundaries in the human genome [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast, stalled promoters in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, have been shown to confer boundary activity along the HOX locus [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Interestingly, the insulator protein CTCF has been shown to interact with RNAPII in eukaryotes [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, it remains unclear if active promoters might function at heterochromatin boundaries in the human genome and whether RNAPII transcription at boundaries generates functional noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
<p>There is growing evidence that noncoding RNAs play a significant role in long-range interactions mediating interactions between and within [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The role of RNAs in the structural organization of the genome has been suggested years ago in a study showing that RNAs are critical to the integrity of the nuclear matrix [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Since then, transcripts like XIST [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], Steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], Kcqn1ot1 [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and Functional intergenic repeating RNA element lncRNA [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] have been shown that long noncoding RNAs have a structure role in the integrity of TDs and the expression of genes at specific genomic loci. Unlike Cohesin interactions made with CTCF, it is not clear how lncRNAs coordinate long-range chromosomal interactions and regulate gene expression. Studies with SRA lncRNA and Kcqn1ot1 suggest that these transcripts either stabilize CTCF-Cohesin interactions or interact directly at its genomic loci target to mediate long-range interactions needed to maintain the genome architecture and regulate gene expression. SRA lncRNA acts in <italic>trans</italic> at the H19/Igf2 locus to facilitate a long-range interaction mediated by CTCF and Cohesin. RNA-DEAD box helicase p68 interacts with SRA and facilitate CTCF-Cohesin interactions, which in turn stabilize the chromosomal loop at the H19/Igf2 locus [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In more recent studies, lncRNAs have been shown to interact directly with CTCF [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Interactions made directly with CTCF may occur at the C-terminal domain of CTCF [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or the recently identified RNA binding domain of CTCF [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Based on what is known about SRA interactions with CTCF and its effect on long-range interactions, it has been hypothesized that CTCF-RNA interactions may be critical for topological organization of the genome. In addition, XCI studies have shown that CTCF-RNA interactions can act in <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> to regulate gene expression and genome topology [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Alternative to CTCF-RNA interactions, Kcqn1ot1 has shown that long-range interactions can be mediated through direct RNA-DNA interactions, independent of CTCF and Cohesin. Lastly, eRNAs have been shown to be important for long-range interactions that mediate promoter-enhancer communications [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus noncoding RNAs represent a growing class of macromolecules capable of organizing chromosome and mediating gene regulatory programs.</p>
<p>We sought to explore the relationships among CTCF-RNAPII interactions and noncoding RNA at a heterochromatin boundary element in the HOXA locus. Specifically, we were interested in the potential role(s) that CTCF-RNAPII interactions may play in topological organization at the HOXA boundary element, referred to as CBS5. We have detected reproducible RNAPII occupancy at CBS5, and show that these interactions are imperative for robust promoter activity in reporter assays. CBS5 promoter activity is also critical for the generation of a noncoding transcript in vivo across many cell types. We clone and characterize the corresponding full-length noncoding RNA that we referred to as boundary associated long noncoding RNA-1 (blncRNA1). We investigated the function of the blncRNA1 by knockdowns. Our experiments show that this transcript mediates long-range interactions at the HOXA locus that seems independent of CTCF-Cohesin interactions. Thus, our results suggest that both Cohesin and noncoding RNA at a boundary element can facilitate long-range chromosomal interactions.</p>

<title>CBS5 Boundary Element Is a Robust Promoter</title>
<p>Our initial characterization of boundary activity at the HOXA locus on chromosome 7 started with reporter assays to determine if the HOXA boundary element, CBS5, exhibited any other activities besides the boundary activity that we reported previously. We cloned the 591bp fragment containing CBS5 into the promoter region of pGL3 luciferase vector that also contained SV40 enhancer element (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). CBS5 sequence was cloned either CBS5 (-) or CBS5 (+) orientations relative to the genome hg18 build from the UCSC genome browser [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Due to low transfection efficiency of primary fibroblasts, we performed our reporter assays in HEK293 cells. When CBS5 is cloned in the same orientation as the other HOXA genes (HOXA7 and HOXA9), CBS5 (-), the reporter exhibited 70% of the promoter activity observed from the SV40 Promoter/Enhancer control reporter (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, CBS5 cloned in the opposite orientation, CBS5 (+), displayed only 5% activity. This result suggests that CBS5 drives transcription on the (-) strand. The direction of CBS5 promoter activity is orientated similar to the transcription of HOXA genes in the locus. To test the specificity of the detected promoter activity we made mutations within CTCF’s consensus sequence that has been previously identified [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and monitored its effect on the reporter activity. Mutations, CBS5 (-) mut made within the CTCF’s motif (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) in the CBS5 (-) construct, drastically reduce the promoter activity. A marginal change in promoter activity was detected when we mutated CTCF’s core in the CBS5 (+) mut construct (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>HOXA barrier CBS5 is a promoter.</title>
<p>(A) Lung fibroblast CTCF and H3K4me3 ChIP signals from the UCSC genome browser are shown (hg18 build). CBS5 is located between HOXA7 and HOXA9 (chr7:27167083–27167603). HME and MCF7 RNAseq tags from the UCSC genome browser align to CBS5. These tags were used for isolation of the blncRNA1 by 5’ and 3’ RACE. CBS5 was cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL3 SV40 Enhancer Vector. CBS5 fragment was inserted either antisense CBS5 (+) or sense CBS5 (-) relative to the hg18 assembly of the human genome. (B) CBS5 Promoter Activity. Activity of the CBS5 reporter constructs were measured and normalized to the luciferase activity detected for a positive control, the SV40 Promoter/Enhancer reporter. The y-axis represents the percentage of CBS5 reporter activity normalized to the SV40 Promoter/Enhancer. The inset denotes the wild type CTCF core binding sequence and the mutant core binding sequence in CBS5(-)mut. The specific mutations made are underlined in the wild type and mutant core sequence.

<p>The reporter assays suggested that CBS5 exhibits promoter activity and may recruit RNAPII if this activity is relevant at the endogenous site. We analyzed the endogenous CBS5 for CTCF-RNAPII interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) assay in fetal lung fibroblasts. The ChIP-qPCR data showed enrichment for RNAPII at CBS5 (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>), which supports our hypothesis of RNAPII recruitment to CBS5 by CTCF.</p>
<p>A previous study showed that a single CBS promotes reporter expression and the activity is the result of CTCF-RNAPII interactions [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, it was shown that not all CBS exhibit CTCF-RNAPII recruitment and as a result may not promote reporter expression [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our findings provide further support to the observation that a single CBS can drive reporter expression.</p>

<title>Isolation and Detection of blncRNA1 from CBS5</title>
<p>RNAPII interactions at CBS5 and the associated promoter activity suggested to us that a noncoding transcript might be generated from CBS5. The direction of the promoter activity guided our attempts to isolate this noncoding transcript by 5’ and 3’ RACE. Further support of the transcript came from Christopher Burge’s RNAseq data [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This data set contained several RNA-seq tags from human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and MCF7 breast cancer cells that aligned to the suspected start of the noncoding transcript (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). To isolate the potential transcript from CBS5 we used the sequence tags as anchors for our 3’ and 5’ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analyses. Our efforts resulted in successful isolation of a 572nt single exon polyadenylated transcript from CBS5 in HEK293. Comparative sequence analysis using ClustalW sequence alignment on Geneious Pro 5.4.6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genious.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://genious.com</ext-link>, [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) revealed that the noncoding transcript is highly conserved at the 5’ end in mammals (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The 3’ end of the transcript that contains the cleavage/polyadenylation specific factor (CPSF) [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] site and cleavage factor I (CFI) site [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] needed for polyadenylation and both sites exhibit sequence conservation (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Using the full-length sequence of blncRNA1, we designed primers for reverse transcription (RT) coupled quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection. Using these primers, we have detected the expression of blncRNA1 in human diploid fetal lung fibroblasts, thus confirming expression of blncRNA1 in HEK293 and IMR90 cells.</p>

<title>blncRNA1 Is Expressed in Differentiated Cells and Not in Stem Cells</title>
<p>Upon confirming expression of blncRNA1 in fetal lung fibroblasts, we checked if the transcript is expressed in other cell lines, in particular, human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and other fibroblasts. We used H1 and H9 ESC to check the expression of the blncRNA1 transcript by RT-qPCR. The transcript was barely detectable in H1 and H9 ESC (less than 0.1% of the level found in fetal lung fibroblasts, <xref rid="pone.0136104.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Since blncRNA1 was detected in anteriorly derived fetal lung fibroblasts, we were curious if the transcript is also expressed in more posteriorly derived fibroblasts whose heterochromatin (mainly methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 residue, H3K27me3) deposition pattern is inverse of the fetal lung fibroblast. We analyzed CTCF and RNAPII interactions at CBS5 by ChIP-qPCR in posterior fibroblasts and observed that similar interactions are made at CBS5 in foreskin fibroblasts (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).

The expression of blncRNA1 was monitored by RT-qPCR in these fibroblasts. As a control, we used HOTAIR, a noncoding RNA that is expressed posteriorly. We detected blncRNA1 in both foreskin and fetal lung fibroblasts, but HOTAIR was only expressed in foreskin fibroblasts as expected (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).

<title>blncRNA1 Expression Is Dependent on CTCF and Cohesin</title>
<p>Luciferase reporter assays showed that CBS5 promoter activity is lost upon mutations of the CTCF motif and initiator element at the transcription start site. We wanted to confirm that the expression of this transcript from the endogenous locus is dependent on CTCF. Using lentiviral particles expressing shRNA against CTCF we performed CTCF or Cohesin subunit RAD21 knockdown and analyzed blncRNA1 expression by RT-qPCR. We detected reduction of blncRNA1 expression upon the knockdown of either CTCF or RAD21 but not with the pGIPZ control (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).

<title>blncRNA1 Knockdown Results in Loss of Long-Range Interactions at the HOXA Locus</title>
<p>Changes in nearby HOXA genes upon blncRNA1 knockdown suggest that the transcript may be involved in long-range chromosomal interactions at the HOXA locus. Previous characterization of long-range interactions at CBS5 detected several interactions, upstream and downstream. Previously we have shown that knockdown of CTCF or Cohesin subunit RAD21 abolishes these long-range interactions at CBS5. To further characterize the role of blncRNA1 in higher order chromatin structure, we performed chromosome capture confirmation (3C) assays upon knockdown of blncRNA1 using the lentiviral vectors characterized in the previous section. We monitored the effects of knockdown on the long-range interactions that were previously published using CBS5 primer and primers specific to the upstream and down stream interaction sites [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Knockdown of blncRNA1 using shRNAs targeting the 5’ or 3’ of this transcript significantly reduced both upstream and downstream interactions at CBS5 (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). These results suggest that blncRNA1 may have a role in maintaining long-range interactions at the HOXA locus.</p>

<sec id="sec018">
<title>blncRNA1 Knockdown Does Not Alter CTCF and Cohesin Interactions at CBS5</title>
<p>One explanation for reduction of long-range interactions at CBS5 upon blncRNA knockdown is that the transcript stabilizes CTCF-Cohesin interactions at CBS5. To test if blncRNA1 might participate in stabilizing CTCF-Cohesin interactions at CBS5, we assayed for occupancy of CTCF or Cohesin at CBS5 upon knockdown of blncRNA1. Surprisingly, knockdown of blncRNA1 did not affect CTCF or Cohesin occupancy at CBS5 (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). This result suggests that blncRNA1 may function independently of CTCF or Cohesin to facilitate or stabilize these long-range interactions at the HOXA locus detected by 3C. We also performed RNAPII ChIP-qPCR upon knockdown of blncRNA1 to monitor RNAPII occupancy at CBS5, to confirm that knockdown did not affect generation of the transcript itself. Occupancy of RNAPII at CBS5 was not affected upon knockdown of blncRNA1 (<xref rid="pone.0136104.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, CTCF and Cohesin at CBS5 are critical for the production of blncRNA1. blncRNA1 knockdown does not alter CTCF, Cohesin, or RNAPII interactions at CBS5. Thus, the generation of blncRNA1 is dependent on CTCF and Cohesin, but the transcript seems to contribute to stabilization of long-range interactions at the HOXA locus independently of Cohesin.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we characterize CTCF-dependent promoter activity from a heterochromatin boundary element in the HOXA locus. This boundary element is an independently validated, evolutionarily conserved topological boundary element in mammalian genomes [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136104.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. RNAPII occupancy at this boundary element is consistent with the observed promoter activity in reporter assays. From these results, we were able to recover a long noncoding capped and polyadenylated transcript (blncRNA1) that emanates from the boundary element. We show that expression of this blncRNA1 depends on CTCF and its cognate site within the boundary element. We also observe that expression of blncRNA1 depends on Cohesin. The dependency of CTCF-Cohesin interactions on blncRNA1 expression has also been observed in RNA-seq data upon the knockdown of CTCF and Cohesin (<xref rid="pone.0136104.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>, data not published). Perturbations of blncRNA1 by knockdowns resulted in loss of long-range chromosomal interactions. Long-range interactions at the HOXA locus blncRNA1 perturbations do not alter CTCF-Cohesin interactions at HOXA boundary element CBS5 thus suggesting this RNA has an integral role to long-range chromosomal interactions at the HOXA locus. The data presented suggests that long-range interactions at the HOXA locus are dependent on the expression of blncRNA1 resulting from CTCF-Cohesin interactions. Together, these results highlight a novel mechanism of maintaining higher order chromatin structure that involves CTCF, Cohesin and long noncoding RNA. Specifically several notable features of this mechanism are worth highlighting:</p>
<p>Our finding concerning promoter activity in a well-defined boundary element is analogous to the previous studies of HMR locus barrier element in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and suggests that boundary activity is functionally conserved. Previous studies have shown that expression of tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> was linked to the heterochromatin barrier activity at the HMR locus [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This barrier activity was further linked to interactions TFIIIB and TFIIIC that bind A-box and B-box elements, respectively. Interaction of these two factors is needed for transcription initiation of RNAPIII [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the exact nature of relationship between boundary and promoter activity remains unclear and requires additional studies to resolve. The presence of a promoter activity does not necessarily indicate a productive transcript. Potentially, the transcription machinery may function to provide or facilitate boundary activity. Alternatively, a nascent transcript made at a boundary may serve to create the heterochromatin boundary by mechanisms currently unknown for the mammalian genomes. In the case of <italic>S</italic>.<italic>cerevisiae</italic> the promoter activity was found to be more critical than the production of tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>.</p>
<p>Our initial survey of cell lines suggests that blncRNA1 is expressed in all the differentiated cells examined, but not in pluripotent embryonic stem cells, H1 and H9 lines. The lack of expression in ESC suggests that this transcript may have a function that is important for differentiated cells. Because we detected blncRNA1 expression in fibroblasts with the inverse patterns of H3K27me3 deposition at HOXA locus, we suspect that blncRNA1 function in higher order organization of HOXA locus regardless of the direction of the heterochromatin deposition relative to CBS5.</p>
<p>There are currently two mechanism in which noncoding transcripts are thought to stabilize chromosomal loops, indirectly through protein intermediaries or directly. In the case of the SRA transcript, it was shown that this transcript supports CTCF-Cohesin interactions at the H19/Igf2 locus [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Alternatively, the transcript may stabilize the loop via RNA-DNA interactions as seen with the <italic>Kcqn1ot1</italic> transcript that stabilizes the loop at the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> locus [<xref rid="pone.0136104.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism of how blncRNA1 stabilizes chromosomal loops at the HOXA boundary is unclear, we were able to resolve that blncRNA1-mediated looping may be independent of CTCF-Cohesin interaction at CBS5. We demonstrate that blncRNA1 knockdowns resulted in loss of chromosomal looping but CTCF and Cohesin binding at the boundary was not affected. Thus, CTCF-Cohesin interactions are more than likely critical for generation of blncRNA1 and looping at CBS5 topological boundary involves CTCF, Cohesin and blncRNA1.</p>
<p>In summary, we have defined additional molecular mechanisms underlying a topological boundary element in the human genome. We find that promoter activity and generation of noncoding RNA from the boundary element may serve to stabilize topological organization of the locus. Thus, unexpectedly, we have discovered that transcription-promoting activity of CTCF is a key activity responsible for the generation of the noncoding RNA required for its function at the boundary element. Additional studies of other boundary associated long noncoding RNAs are required to examine generality of this mechanism, but the proposed mechanisms involving Cohesin and long non-coding RNAs are wholly consistent with the previous studies.</p>

The knockdown replicates are shown in tables (A-C) ad the overall analysis (D) is included. The standard deviation (STD) is also calculated in the overall analysis table. (Table M) HOXA Expression upon Control KD. The table shows the raw Ct values (Trial 1 Ct, Trial 2 Ct, Trial 3 Ct), average Ct values (Ave Ct), the copies, and number of molecules for HOXA6-A10 when using the shRNA control lentivirus. The replicates for each experiment (A-C), and the overall analysis (D), are also shown. The standard deviation (STD) is represented in the overall analysis. (Table N) HOXA Expression upon blncRNA1 KD. The table shows the raw Ct values (Trial 1 Ct, Trial 2 Ct, Trial 3 Ct), average Ct values (Ave Ct), the copies, and number of molecules for HOXA6-A10 when using the shRNA kd lentivirus. The replicates for each experiment (A-C), and the overall analysis (D), are also shown. The standard deviation (STD) is represented in the overall analysis. The p-Value shown in the overall analysis was calculated as a comparison to S13 Table using T-test. (Table O) Chromosome Capture Confirmation (3C) Analysis. The table shows the raw Ct Values (Trial 1 Ct, Trial 2 Ct, Trial 3 Ct, Trial 4 Ct, Trial 5 Ct, Trial 6 Ct), average Ct, interaction and final frequency for the lentivrial shRNA control, lentivrial 5' shRNA kd (shRNA37), and lentiviral 3' shRNA kd (shRNA 524). The BAC control for the 3C analysis is also shown in this figure. Replicates for each 3C experiment is shown (A-C) as well as the overall analysis and the standard deviation (STD) for the upstream (u10), and downstream (p40) positions. (Table P) CTCF Occupancy upon blncRNA1 KD. The table shows the raw Ct values (Trial 1 Ct, Trial 2 Ct, and Trial 3 Ct), average Ct (Ave Ct) values, and enrichment fold (ChIP-Input) for the CTCF ChIP experiment performed after kd of blncRNA1. The replicates for each experiment (A, B, C), ad the overall analysis (D) are also shown. The overall analysis includes averages of each experiments and the standard deviation (STD). (Table Q) RNAPII Occupancy upon blncRNA1 KD. The table shows the raw Ct values (Trial 1 Ct, Trial 2 Ct, and Trial 3 Ct), average Ct (Ave Ct) values, and enrichment fold (ChIP-Input) for the RNAPII ChIP experiment performed after kd of blncRNA1. The replicates for each experiment (A, B, C), ad the overall analysis (D) are also shown. The overall analysis includes averages of each experiments and the standard deviation (STD).
