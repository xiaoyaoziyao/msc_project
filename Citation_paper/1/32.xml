<abstract>
<p>Heavy metals contaminated soil is a serious environmental concern that has a negative impact on agriculture and ecosystem. Economical and efficient ways are needed to address this problem worldwide. In this regard, exploration and application of proficient microbial strains that can help the crop plants to thrive in agricultural soils that are greatly contaminated with heavy metals. The present study mainly focused on the effect of IAA producing endophytic fungi <italic>Penicillium ruqueforti</italic> Thom., on wheat plants cultivated in soil rich in heavy metals (Ni, Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb). <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ruqueforti</italic> has induced great resistance in wheat inoculated plants grown in heavy metal contaminated soil. Application of the isolated strain of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ruqueforti</italic> restricted the transfer of heavy metals from soil to the plants by secreting indole acetic acid (IAA). Furthermore, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ruqueforti</italic> inoculated wheat seedlings watered with waste water had higher plant growth, nutrient uptake and low concentrations of heavy metals in shoot and roots. On the contrary, non-inoculated wheat plants under heavy metal stress had stunted growth with symptoms of chlorosis. From the results, it is concluded that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ruqueforti</italic> inoculation can establish a symbiotic relationship with host plants, which is useful for phytostabilization of heavy metals or in other words helping the host crops to flourish through soil that are highly contaminated with heavy metals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heavy metal contamination is among one the global challenge and their enhanced concentration poses a significant risks to plants, ecosystem and public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref002">2</xref>]. In addition, access of heavy metals in soils result in decreased soil fertility that in turn effects plant growth, yield and vigor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref003">3</xref>]. Therefore, the development of novel environmental conservation and soil remediation strategies can serve as a paramount in securing healthy environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref004">4</xref>]. Though, small amounts of heavy metals are obligatory for cellular activities, but its presence in excessive amounts in the environment can be associated with mining, improper handling of industrial wastes, agricultural fertilizers and pesticides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The heavy metals persist in the soils of industrial areas or other parts with mining facilities and that is why, biological and natural reclamation of such polluted sites are challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref010">10</xref>]. In order to clean the soil of such areas, the heavy metal may be extracted through electrochemical methods, thermal processes, washing, stabilization/solidification and burial tie, etc. Though, the methods are sophisticated, but they are quiet expensive to reclaim the soil for crop production purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref011">11</xref>]. Keeping feeding of growing population of the world in view, an alternative strategy is demanded to make the heavy metal rich soil fit for crop production. In the current scenario, the use of plant beneficial microorganisms (especially endophytes) that interacts with plants in rhizoshpere and enabling them to alter the uptake, mobility and bioavailabity of metals ion seems the best [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref016">16</xref>]. These microbes release plant growth promoting substances such as siderophores, phosphate solubilzation, growth hormones IAA, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase that improves growth of plants in metal contaminated soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref022">22</xref>]. Furthermore, microbial activities inside host roots increases efficiency of metal degradation in contaminated soil through phytostabalization (by reducing the mobility of heavy metals in to the host plants), enhances metal tolerance and biomass production in host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Endophytic microbes (fungi and bacteria) involved in phytoremediation process have shown tremendous potential in improving phytoremediation processes by reducing metal availability, altering soil pH, releasing chelating agents along with multiple enzymatic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref026">26</xref>]. More recently, various studies have described the role of beneficial endophytic fungi in abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref028">28</xref>], however the field is still wide open to discover potential endophytic strains with a role in reducing heavy metal stress in crop plants. Therefore, the objective of the present work was: To isolate and identify beneficial endophytic fungi from <italic>Solanum surattense</italic> Burm. f. that can help the host plants under heavy metals stress; To assess the strain(s) for its role in ameliorating the effect of metal ions and enabling the host plants to take up the available nutrients. We reckon that this is the first ever report on isolation of endophytic fungi from the roots of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>surattense</italic> and confirming its potential in phytoremediation and stress adaptation.</p>

<title>Climatic condition of the study area</title>
<p>Gadoon amazai is located in the Northwest of Pakistan, with latitude 34.120155" north and longitude 72.470154" east with an elevation of about 341 meters above the sea level. Rainfall occurs in both winter and summer varies from 456 to 639 mm due to monsoon, which comes from Malakand and Hazara regions. Average temperature ranges from 2 °C to 40 °C with semi-arid climate, i.e. hot summers and cold winters. Winter starts in mid-November and ends in March, while summer starts from May and ends in September. Such variation produce diverse microbial habitat to adapt various environmental conditions and nature has bestowed the region to study best source of ecologically varied microorganisms.</p>

<title>Plant material, soil, water sampling and chemical analysis</title>
<p>The current study was approved by the “Advanced Studies and Research Board (AS&amp;RB), Hazara University Mansehra, Pakistan” and this study did not involve any endangered or protected species. Healthy plants of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>surattense</italic> Burm. f. were collected from the industrial sites of Gadun, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208150.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Seeds of wheat variety Bhakkar-2000 (KJ672075) were obtained from the Department of Crop Science, National Agriculture Research Centre (NARC), Islamabad, Pakistan. Similarly, seeds of Auxin-deficient mutant kernal (<italic>dek 18</italic>) and wild kernal (<italic>Dek 18</italic>) maize developed by University of Hohenheim, Germany were employed as a control in IAA assays. Soil and water samples were collected from the same area in sterile plastic bags and taken to the laboratory for analysis. To determine heavy metals, water samples were mixed and kept overnight with 10% hydrochloric acid solution. Few drops of HNO<sub>3</sub> were also added in each sample and stored at 5 °C until analyzed. Soil samples were collected from a depth of 0-12cm with sterile stainless steel auger, the soil samples were air dried and kept covered to avoid contamination. The dried soil samples were grinded and passed through 200 mech sieve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref029">29</xref>]. These soil samples were then autoclaved and filled into 1kg pots. Plant samples were washed with distilled water to remove any dirt, oven dried for 48 h and finally grounded. Subsequent sample preparations and analysis were done as described by Turkdogan et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref029">29</xref>].</p>

<title>Isolation, surface sterilization and screening of endophytic fungal strains</title>
<p>The fresh samples were processed in the laboratory within 48 h of collection. Surface sterilization was performed by the method of Qin et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref030">30</xref>]. The root segments of collected <italic>S</italic>. <italic>surattense</italic> were washed (tap water) to remove soil particles, than soaked for 5 min in distilled water having few drops of tween 80. After washing, the root samples were cut into small segments (0.5 cm), washed twice with autoclaved distilled water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O). The segments were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol and further treated with 1% perchloric acid, (30 s), rinsed with autoclaved distilled water and dried under sterile condition. The outer layer of the sterilized root segments were then removed and 5 segments per plate was placed on Hagem medium (0.05% KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.05% MgSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.05% NH4Cl, 0.5% glucose, 80 ppm streptomycin, 0.1% FeCl<sub>3</sub> and 1.5% agar; pH 5.6 ± 0.2) in order to isolate endophytic fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref031">31</xref>]. The plates were sealed and incubated at 28 °C for one week to observe the growth of endophytic fungi. Intact surface sterilized roots were also checked for any contamination according to the method described by Schulz et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref032">32</xref>], which confirmed the absence of any microbial growth on media plates. After incubation, the endophytic fungal hyphae that grew out from the root tissues were collected by Pasteur pipettes and transferred to a new PDA (potato dextrose agar) plates. The plates having the harvested hyphae were incubated for another 7 days at 25 °C to get pure cultures. Czapek culture broth (1% peptone, 1% glucose, 0.05% MgSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.05% KCl, 0.001% FeSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O; pH 7.3 ± 0.2) was used for further purification of fungal isolates, shaking at 120 rpm for 7 days at 30 °C. The culture filtrate (CF) was harvested through centrifugation at 4,000 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min. Harvested pellet and supernatant were lyophilized (ISE Bondiro Freeze Dryer) and kept at -70 °C.</p>
<p>The pellet was used for identification of fungal isolate, while the supernatant was diluted in 1 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O to perform the screening experiment. To assess the plant growth promoting/inhibiting capacity of the fungal isolates, seeds of IAA mutant kernel (<italic>dek18)</italic> and wild type kernel (<italic>Dek18)</italic> maize line were surface-sterilized with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for 30 min, rinsed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O, and then incubated for 48 h at 28 °C. Germinated maize seedlings were transplanted to autoclaved pots containing 0.8% water-agar medium and kept in a growth chamber for further growth. After attaining the two leaves stage, 10 μl of supernatant solution of fungal CF was applied at the seedling apex. After one week of treatment, the shoot length, chlorophyll content, and shoot fresh and dry weights were recorded and compared with negative (treated with DDW).</p>

<title>Screening for auxin production</title>
<p>The production of IAA was calorimetrically measured for all isolated strains as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref033">33</xref>], using Salkowski’s reagent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref034">34</xref>]. To 1 mL of centrifuged broth culture supernatant, 2 mL of Salkowski reagent was added and the mixture was incubated in the dark for 30 minutes. Absorbance of the pink colored complex was taken at 540 nm against the standard IAA using UV/VIZ spectrophotometer.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>IAA determination by HPLC</title>
<p>IAA was further quantified through HPLC following the method of Khan et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref035">35</xref>] with minor modification, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. injecting 20 μl fungal extract into a 5 μm reverse phase column (Waters Associates Bondapak C18, 250 mm × 4 mm) in a Waters Associates liquid chromatograph. Samples were analyzed under isocratic conditions with MeOH and water (80:20 v/v) as separation solvent at 1,200 p.s.i. flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Elutes were detected by differential ultraviolet detector at 254 nm. IAA was quantified by peak area reference obtained from IAA standard.</p>

<title>Screening of isolated strains for NaCl and heavy metals stress</title>
<p>Isolated strains were tested against heavy metals resistance by the method of Cervantes et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref036">36</xref>]. Soluble metals such as (CuSO<sub>4</sub>), cadmium (CdSO<sub>4</sub>), nickel (NiSO<sub>4</sub>), zinc (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>) and lead (PbSO<sub>4)</sub> were added to freshly prepared agar inoculated plates at various concentrations, ranging from 50 to 350 μg/ml and kept overnight at 28_°C in dark. The growth of isolated strains were measured as by the method of Hamayun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref037">37</xref>]. The strain that were mostly active under heavy metal stress were selected and grown in broth to determine the metal uptake potential of the selected strains.</p>
<p>To observe NaCl tolerance, the isolated endophytic fungus (24 h old test culture) was subjected to various salt concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 mM) to check its tolerance. The cultures in a salt medium were incubated at 27 °C with shaking (120 rpm) for 24–48 h and the growth was measured as described by Kumar et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref038">38</xref>]. The strain that performed best were selected and grown in Czapek broth for 7 days at 27_°C in a shaking incubator with 120 rpm for further experiments.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most plants, especially food crops are susceptible to a wide range of heavy metal stress because it can arrest plant growth, amplifies ionic imbalance inside organs and creates water deficit. Among the food crops, wheat is unequivocally recognized as a pivotal crop for addressing the growing demands of future world’s food supply. At the moment, serious efforts are underway at global level to broaden the genetic base of wheat genotypes through gene stacking and pyramided gene approaches against various biotic and abiotic stresses. Transfer of useful genes is not only time demanding, but extremely expensive and laborious. Besides, mutation within the pathogenic genes due to their rapid evolution overcomes host resistance and renders effectiveness of such introgressed useful genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref060">60</xref>]. Therefore, exploitation of non-conventional approaches, such as the use of endophytic microorganisms for stress management and nutrients availability offers an attractive strategy. Symbiotic-interaction between endophytic fungi and higher plant has been documented in past that clearly defines the role of endophytes in plant host tolerance during stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref062">62</xref>]. Endophytic fungi may act as a main source to secrete phytohormones and thus enhances the growth of associated plants during stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref063">63</xref>]. The current work was also focused on the isolation and screening of IAA producing endophytic fungi from the root of halophytic plant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>surattense</italic> and its role in stress resistance and growth-promotion of the crop plants under heavy metal stress.</p>
<p>Initial screening of the endophytic strain revealed a significant increase in the growth of wild maize kernel (<italic>Dek18</italic>) as compared to the–ive control that confirmed the presence of phytohormone, IAA. Several researches has supported the symbiotic relationship of endophytic fungi with host plant roots, where host plant can provide shelter to the endophytes and the endophytes in turn release phytoharmones to help the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref064">64</xref>]. The association of endophytes with host plant will not only help them under normal conditions, but also under high stress conditions, including metal stress. That is the reason, endophytic fungi increases the host plant capacity to hyper accumulate heavy metals by either direct or indirect mechanisms. The endophytes can assist the host plant directly by enhanced mobilization of heavy metals, thus alleviate toxicity level of metals in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref066">66</xref>], or indirectly by improving plant growth and stress tolerance as observed in the current study. Besides plant growth promoting properties, the endophytes may benefit the host plant by rising its ability to absorb essential nutrients from the contaminated soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref067">67</xref>]. Furthermore, endophytes may degrad the pollutants present in the contaminated soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref068">68</xref>] and convert them in to a non-toxic form. Here the isolated fungal strain CGF-1 has proved to help the wheat plant under heavy metal stress and alleviate toxicity. Moreover, auxins produced by endophytes can be a contributing factor in host plant development, especially under stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref069">69</xref>]. The exogenous supply of the phytohormones by endophytes can bring about positive physiological changes in host plant to stand the stress conditions. In addition to phytohormones, biofertilization ability of endophytic fungi can increase the availability of nutrients to the host plant in heavy metal contaminated soil through solubilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref070">70</xref>]. Contamination of soil with heavy metals pollutants is mainly attributed to wastewater irrigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref041">41</xref>]. The result of this study also indicated that concentration of heavy metals like Ni, Cd Cu, Zn, and Pb in soil sample were higher from reference soil and World Health Organization permissible limits. The concentration of heavy metals observed in soil sample treated with waste water in the present experiment is in full agreement with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref071">71</xref>].</p>
<p>Correspondingly, the inoculation of CGF-1 had a positive effect on the overall growth parameters and photosynthetic pigments (Chla, Chlb and carotenoids) in inoculated wheat plants under wastewater treatment. Likewise, in osmoregulation of wastewater treatment endophytes can play an important role by stimulating proline production, as it promotes plant growth and avoids metal stress. Proline contents in inoculated plants were higher as compared to non-inoculated plants, which is an indication to avoid stress and toxicity. Endophytic colonization also helped in improving nutrients uptake such as P and N and increased plant productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref072">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref073">73</xref>]. Among the minerals, the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> was higher in non-inoculated plants as compared to the CGF-1 inoculated plants under salt stress. This might be due to increased absorption of K<sup>+</sup> and restriction of Na<sup>+</sup> by CGF-1 inoculated plants under salt stress. The increased uptake of K<sup>+</sup> leads to a high K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio, which is an indication of plant resistance to high salt stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref074">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref075">75</xref>].</p>
<p>Antioxidant enzymes (APX, CAT, POD and reduced glutathione GSH) can scavenge the accumulated ROS in plants to favor its defense mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref076">76</xref>]. Oxidative stress in plants can be recognized by elevated activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, APX SOD and reduced glutathione GSH) under stress conditions. So, in the current study, the isolated fungal strain CGF-1 has assisted the wheat plants to produce large amounts of antioxidant enzymes under heavy metal stress. The release of these enzymes scavenged the ROS, thus enable the plant to grow normally under toxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref077">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref078">78</xref>]. Besides, the production of antioxidant enzymes, the CGF-1 colonized host plants has reduced the heavy metals uptake and consequently lowered the concentration in shoot and root tissues. The concentration of accumulated metals (Ni, Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb) in non-inoculated plants was significantly higher than those having endophytic fungal association. Similar observations concerning the low accumulation of heavy metals in endophyte associated plants have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref079">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0208150.ref080">80</xref>]. Microscopic observation has revealed the presence of inoculated fungus in pericycle and cortex region of the root, which indicates the role of endophytes in metal uptake by host plants. However, further research is required to clarify the detailed mechanisms behind this phenomenon.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current study concerning the use of isolated endophytic strain CGF-1 has given promising results in growth promotion of wheat plants under heavy metals stress that limited the absorption of heavy metals by host plants. Furthermore, the inoculated fungus also provided protection to the host plants from heavy metals stress by taking up the heavy metal in fungal mycelium leading to immobilization of metals. Keeping the results of the present study in view, it is highly recommended that similar approaches may be implemented to achieve sustainable agriculture on arid, saline as well as heavy metal contaminated areas.</p>
