<abstract>
<p>Epidemic methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) imposes an increasing impact on public health. Due to multi-antibiotics resistance in MRSA strains, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics such as effective monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MRSA infections. <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> surface protein A (SasA), a large surface-located protein (~240 kDa), is one of MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) and a potential target for immunotherapeutic approaches against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections. In the present study, we analyzed the sequence of SasA with bioinformatics tools and generated a protective monoclonal antibody (2H7) targeting the conserved domain of SasA. 2H7 was shown to recognize wild-type <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and promote opsonophagocytic killing of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. In both sepsis and peritoneal infection models, prophylactic administration of 2H7 improved the survival of BALB/c mice challenged by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strain USA300 and ST239 (prevalent MRSA clones in North America and Asian countries, respectively) and enhanced bacterial clearance in kidneys. Additionally, 2H7 prophylaxis prevented the formation of intraperitoneal abscess in a murine model of peritoneal infection and therapeutic administration of 2H7 showed protective efficacy in a murine sepsis model. Our results presented here provide supporting evidences that an anti-SasA mAb might be a potential component in an antibody-based immunotherapeutic treatment of MRSA infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, one of the most important human pathogens, causes a variety of infections, including skin, soft tissue, and bone infections and life-threatening sepsis, endocarditis and pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref001">1</xref>]. The high proportions of methicillin-resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (MRSA) indicate an increased public health risk and a need for second-line antibiotics, which increase costs and exert problematic side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref004">4</xref>]. Therefore, the development of an alternative treatment option for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections, particularly immunotherapeutic approaches, is being extensively investigated. One such strategy is to develop effective monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MRSA infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Many antigens of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> have been tested as candidate targets for mAbs against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections, including secreted toxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref010">10</xref>], microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref017">17</xref>], lipoteichoic acid (LTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref018">18</xref>] and quorum sensing peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref019">19</xref>]. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> surface protein A (SasA), one of MSCRAMMs, is also known as Srap (serine-rich adhesin for platelets) as it mediates the direct binding of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> to platelets and contributes to infective endocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref020">20</xref>]. SasA is composed of 2,271 amino acids and belongs to the serine-rich repeat proteins (SRRPs) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref021">21</xref>]. Consistent with a previous report that SRRPs are potential vaccine candidates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref021">21</xref>], active immunization with SasA can induce a specific antibody response and protect BALB/c mice against staphylococcal lethal challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref022">22</xref>]. Of note, SasA is prevalent among clinical <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains. In one study, the SasA gene was present in 100% of disease isolates (n = 155) and carriage isolates (n = 179) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref023">23</xref>]. Additionally, by bioinformatics analysis, we showed here that there exists a conserved region of SasA among a diverse range of clinical <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains. Moreover, SasA is expressed during <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections in vivo. IgG titers against SasA in serum obtained from patients convalescing from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections were higher than those obtained from healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref023">23</xref>]. Taken together, we envision that SasA can be regarded as a potential target for a mAb-based immunotherapy against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections.</p>
<p>In this study, we analyzed the sequence of SasA with bioinformatics tools and generated a mAb targeting the conserved region of SasA. This mAb (2H7) was characterized in vitro and its protective efficacy was evaluated in vivo. Passive immunization with a single dose of 2H7 conferred protection against murine sepsis and peritonitis caused by MRSA challenges. Data presented here imply that an anti-SasA mAb might be a potential component in an antibody-based immunotherapeutic treatment of MRSA infections.</p>

<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> USA300 FPR3757 (BAA-1556™) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). USA300 is one of the most prevalent MRSA clones in North America and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref024">24</xref>]. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strain ST239, isolated in 2013 from a patient hospitalized with pneumonia in the 306 Hospital of People’s Liberation Army (Beijing, China), is a clinical MRSA strain and belongs to multilocus sequence type 239. ST239 is the predominant hospital-acquired MRSA clone in Asian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref025">25</xref>]. Overnight cultures of Staphylococci were diluted 1:100 into tryptic soy broth (TSB) and grown to OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.8 at 37°C. PBS-washed Staphylococci were adjusted to an appropriate concentration.</p>

<title>Recombinant proteins</title>
<p>The SRR1 region (48–229 aa), NRR region (230–751 aa), NRR1 region (230–540 aa), NRR2 region (490–751 aa) and SRR1-NRR1 region (48–540 aa) of the full-length SasA were amplified from USA300 FPR3757 (BAA-1556™) genomic DNA by PCR. The primers used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149460.s003">S1 Table</xref>. The PCR products were cloned into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> vector pET21a (+) (Novagen) and transformed into <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) for the expression of recombinant fusion proteins containing an N terminal six-histidine-residue tag. The purified proteins were isolated by Q Sepharose Fast Flow and HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare) chromatography.</p>

<title>Preparation of monoclonal antibodies</title>
<p>The murine monoclonal antibodies targeting SRR1-NRR1 (48–540 aa) were generated by the standard hybridoma method described in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref026">26</xref>], followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot screening. Antibodies were purified by protein G affinity chromatography. IgG subclass was identified using the Rapid Antibody Isotyping Kit (Thermo Scientific).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title>
<p>The purified antigens (SRR1, NRR, NRR1, NRR2 and SRR1-NRR1) were coated onto microplates (96-well) in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at a concentration of 2 μg/ml overnight at 4°C. The plates were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated with serial dilutions of mAbs for 1 h at 37°C. The secondary anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling) was then applied for an additional hour at 37°C. The plates were washed and incubated with 3, 3’, 5, 5’-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (Sigma) as the substrate. The A450 was measured using a Spectra Max photometer (Molecular Devices). To detect the binding of SasA mAb to wild-type <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, the formalin-fixed USA300 was diluted in PBS containing 0.25% glutaraldehyde to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.15 and coated onto microplates. Rabbit serum (1%) was added to reduce the non-specific interactions between murine mAbs and protein A expressed on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>.</p>

<title>Mouse platelets binding assay</title>
<p>Purified SRR1 and NRR were conjugated with Cy3 (GE Healthcare). Formalin-fixed Mouse platelets were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref020">20</xref>]. To measure the binding of SRR1 and NRR to platelets, 10<sup>5</sup> fixed mouse platelets were incubated with FITC-labeled anti CD-41 antibody (BioLegend) and increasing concentrations of SRR1-Cy3 or NRR-Cy3 (20 nM, 100 nM and 500 nM) at room temperature for 1 h. For the binding competition assay, 2000 nM NRR was mixed with 100 nM NRR-Cy3 to test whether the binding of NRR-Cy3 to mouse platelets was affected. Additionally, 2000 nM 2H7 or control mAb was incubated with 100 nM NRR-Cy3 overnight at 4°C to examine whether 2H7 could inhibit the association between NRR-Cy3 and mouse platelets. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur).</p>

<title>Opsonophagocytic killing assay</title>
<p>In the ex vivo whole-blood killing model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref015">15</xref>], blood was taken from anesthetized BALB/c mice (female, 6-week-old) by cardiac puncture and collected in a vial containing Heparin (Sigma). PBS-washed USA300 was adjusted to a concentration of 3×10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml. Then, 100 μl of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> was mixed with 200 μl of pooled mouse blood containing 10 μg/ml 2H7 or isotype control antibody. In addition, a control experiment was conducted to address the possibility that antibodies mediate bacterial aggregations and result in a drop in apparent CFUs.

To remove the cross-reactive antibodies, serum was incubated with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> USA300 (4°C for 30 min), centrifuged and filter-sterilized. The assay was performed in a 96-well plate containing 1×10<sup>4</sup> CFU USA300, 1×10<sup>5</sup> viable differentiated-HL60 cells, 4% complement serum and 10 μg/ml 2H7 or isotype control antibody. The mixed samples were incubated at 37°C with shaking. At 0 and 60 min, 10 μl aliquots were removed and diluted with 0.5% saponin-PBS. Then, the samples were sonicated briefly to disrupt bacterial aggregates and plated on TSA to determine the viable CFU numbers. The relative killing was calculated as the percent difference in CFU between samples at 0 min and 60 min.</p>

<title>Sequence analysis of SasA</title>
<p>SasA is a high-molecular-weight protein (~240 kDa) and the difficulties in construction of full-length recombinant SasA limit its immunotherapeutic application. Therefore, sequence analysis of SasA is an essential step for the development of protective mAbs. We screened 36 whole-genome sequences of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains that are publicly available. These strains can be classified into 19 different sequence types and represent a diverse range of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> clonal population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149460.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149460.s004">S2 Table</xref>). We found that all of these strains carry the SasA gene. We analyzed the full-length amino acid sequence of SasA (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> USA300 FPR3757) with bioinformatics tools (Motif scan, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/motif_scan" xlink:type="simple">http://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/motif_scan</ext-link>). Two serine-rich repeat regions (SRR) were found, and a non-repeat region (NRR) was found between these SRRs. The amino acid sequences of SRR1, NRR and SRR2 represent 48–229 aa, 230–751 aa and 752–2213 aa of full-length SasA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149460.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Next, we conducted the sequence homology analysis by using a multi-alignment method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref028">28</xref>]. SRR1, NRR and SRR2 display 75.8%, 90.4% and 49.3% identity at the amino acid level, respectively, suggesting that NRR is the most conserved region of SasA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149460.s004">S2 Table</xref>). Moreover, we prepared different recombinant fragments of SasA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149460.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and showed that immunization with SRR1 (48–229 aa) and NRR1 (230–540 aa) generated protective immunity against lethal infection with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149460.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The full-length amino acid sequence of SasA was analyzed using bioinformatics tools. SasA is mainly composed of a short serine-rich repeat region (SRR1), a non-repeat region (NRR), a second long serine-rich repeat region (SRR2) and a C-terminal cell wall anchor motif (CW). Sequence homology analysis showed that NRR is the most conserved region of SasA. Different regions of SasA were expressed and purified. These are indicated below the full-length SasA.</p>

To examine if 2H7 enhance bacterial clearance in the murine model, BALB/c mice (n = 9) were passively immunized with 2H7 (15 mg/kg) or isotype control mAb IgG1 (15 mg/kg) 24 h prior to challenge by intravenous injection with 1×10<sup>7</sup> CFUs of USA300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149460.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) or by intraperitoneal injection with 1×10<sup>9</sup> CFUs of USA300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149460.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). On day 2 following intraperitoneal challenge and day 4 following intravenous challenge, the infected mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, and both kidneys were homogenized. In the intravenous challenge model, staphylococcal loads of 7.45±0.26 log10 CFU/g were isolated from the renal homogenates of control mice. Compared with mice treated with isotype mAb IgG1, the mice that received 2H7 displayed a reduction of 1.54±0.64 (p = 0.0294) log10 CFU/g in the staphylococcal burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149460.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MRSA, a bacterial that resistant to multiple antibiotics, is considered as a “superbug” and is responsible for several life-threatening infections in humans. In an era of MRSA epidemic and lack of new classes of antibiotics, immunotherapeutic approaches directed against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> have been broadly investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref005">5</xref>]. MAbs are attractive antibody-based therapeutic reagents because of their homogeneity, stability, low-immunogenicity and amenability for engineering to improve various preferred characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref032">32</xref>]. Therefore, mAbs are well poised to be important candidates in a new age of antimicrobial therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref033">33</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that an anti-SasA mAb is effective for the prevention and treatment of MRSA infections in murine models. Considering that SasA is prevalent and the NRR region of SasA is conserved among clinical <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains, SasA is a promising target for mAb-based immunotherapy against MRSA infections.</p>
<p>Compared with other cell wall-associated proteins of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, such as iron-regulated surface determinant B (IsdB) (~72 kDa), Staphylococcal protein A (SPA) (~50 kDa), clumping factor A (ClfA) (~110 kDa) and fibronectin-binding protein A (FnbpA) (~112 kDa), SasA is a relatively large surface-exposed protein (~240 kDa). It is difficult to construct full-length recombinant SasA. Based on the sequence analysis (the overall structure, sequence conservation and immunoprotective domain), we selected the SRR1-NRR1 (48–540 aa) region of SasA as the immunogen and generated mAb 2H7. The data showed that the binding epitope of 2H7 is within the NRR1 region (230–540 aa) and 2H7 can recognize the conserved NRR region of SasA. The structure of the NRR region was recently determined, revealing that the N terminus of NRR (245–492 aa) is extended outward by a relatively rigid structure of the C terminus of NRR (492–751 aa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref034">34</xref>]. Thus, NRR1 (230–540 aa) is likely to be located within the surface-exposed region of SasA, which is consistent with the result that 2H7 is able to bind native SasA expressed on the surface of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. It has been reported that SasA can mediate the binding of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> to platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref020">20</xref>]. However, 2H7 is not capable of inhibiting the binding of SasA to mouse platelets, suggesting that 2H7 may not provide protection in a staphylococcal endocarditis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref020">20</xref>]. In line with previously reported mAbs targeting surface proteins of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (immunodominant staphylococcal antigen A (IsaA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref014">14</xref>], IsdB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref012">12</xref>] and SPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref015">15</xref>]), 2H7 can enhance the opsonophagocytic killing of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> by both mouse and human neutrophils.</p>
<p>We evaluated the protective efficacy of 2H7 in both a murine sepsis model and a murine peritoneal infection model. These models mimic staphylococcal infections of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing dialysis. Chronic dialysis patients are vulnerable to MRSA infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref036">36</xref>]. It is estimated that the prevalence of MRSA colonization is 7.2% in hemodialysis patients and 1.3% in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref035">35</xref>]. Notably, colonized patients have a much higher risk of developing MRSA infections than noncolonized patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref035">35</xref>]. In agreement with an earlier report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref008">8</xref>], in our study, a large number of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (2–4×10<sup>9</sup> CFU) were required to develop lethal disease in the intraperitoneal challenge model. In contrast, intravenous injection of 1–2×10<sup>8</sup> CFU of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> was lethal in mice.</p>
<p>In the sepsis model, prophylactic administration of 2H7 at a dose of 15 mg/kg was sufficient to confer protection against USA300 and ST239 challenge, with a protection rate of 50% and 60%, respectively, compared with 90%-100% mortality in the control group. This protective efficacy is comparable to results obtained from prophylactic treatment with mAbs targeting IsdB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref016">16</xref>], ClfA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref011">11</xref>], IsaA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref017">17</xref>] and alpha-hemolysin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref014">14</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref009">9</xref>]. Only a few studies evaluated the therapeutic potential of mAbs in murine models for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> sepsis. It has been reported that an mAb to IsdB provided protection when dosed 1 h prior to challenge but is unable to confer protection when dosed 1 h post challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref012">12</xref>]. In our study, therapeutic administration (1 h post challenge) of 2H7 significantly improved the survival of mice, despite the fact that the survival rate was lower than that obtained from prophylactic administration. However, the therapeutic window can’t be extended beyond 3 h, which is consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref017">17</xref>]. In the peritoneal infection model, prophylactic administration of 2H7 at a dose of 15 mg/kg was sufficient to confer protection against lethal challenges with both USA300 and ST239. Earlier work indicated that alpha-Hemolysin is an important virulence factor in the peritoneal infection model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref008">8</xref>]. However, passive immunization of an Hla-neutralizing mAb didn’t prevent the formation of abscess lesions in the peritoneal cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref008">8</xref>]. In our study, 2H7 prophylaxis was able to offer protection against staphylococcal abscess lesions in the peritoneal infection model. Of note, in both the sepsis model and the peritoneal infection model, passive immunization of 2H7 can reduce the staphylococcal loads in kidneys.</p>
<p>We don’t expect that an anti-SasA mAb can be the single component of an immunotherapy that designs to combat against MRSA infections in all conditions. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> harbors divergent virulence factors for tissue adhesion, evasion of host immune defense and cell lysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref037">37</xref>]. For example, Alpha-Hemolysin is a pore-forming cytotoxin of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and Hla-neutralizing mAbs mediate protection against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> pneumonia, peritonitis, sepsis and skin abscess [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref009">9</xref>]. SpA enables <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> to resist host immune responses and anti-SpA mAbs prevent <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> disease in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref015">15</xref>]. The variance and redundancy of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> virulence factors call for immunotherapy against multiple antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149460.ref038">38</xref>]. Passive immunization with combined antibodies, such as the combination of a SasA-specific mAb, an anti-SpA mAb and an Hla-neutralizing mAb, is likely to provide enhanced protective efficacy against MRSA infections.</p>
<p>In summary, this work demonstrated that passive immunization with 2H7 was able to confer protection against murine sepsis and peritonitis caused by USA300 and ST239, which are prevalent MRSA clones in North America and Asian countries, respectively. The protective efficacy of 2H7 indicates that SasA is a novel candidate target for a mAb-based immunotherapy against MRSA infections. Further study of the therapeutic activity of a humanized version of 2H7 and its possible synergistic effect with antibiotics or other mAbs will help to relate this immunotherapy strategy to the clinical context.</p>
