<abstract>
<p>Oomycetes are microorganisms that are distantly related to true fungi and many members of this phylum are major plant pathogens. Oomycetes express proteins that are able to interact with plant cell wall polysaccharides, such as cellulose. This interaction is thought to be mediated by carbohydrate-binding modules that are classified into CBM family 1 in the CAZy database. In this study, the two CBMs (1–1 and 1–2) that form part of the cell wall glycoprotein, CBEL, from <italic>Phytophthora parasitica</italic> have been submitted to detailed characterization, first to better quantify their interaction with cellulose and second to determine whether these CBMs can be useful for biotechnological applications, such as biomass hydrolysis. A variety of biophysical techniques were used to study the interaction of the CBMs with various substrates and the data obtained indicate that CBEL’s CBM1-1 exhibits much greater cellulose binding ability than CBM1-2. Engineering of the family 11 xylanase from <italic>Talaromyces versatilis</italic> (<italic>Tv</italic>XynB), an enzyme that naturally bears a fungal family 1 CBM, has produced two variants. The first one lacks its native CBM, whereas the second contains the CBEL CBM1-1. The study of these enzymes has revealed that wild type <italic>Tv</italic>XynB binds to cellulose, via its CBM1, and that the substitution of its CBM by oomycetal CBM1-1 does not affect its activity on wheat straw. However, intriguingly the addition of CBEL during the hydrolysis of wheat straw actually potentiates the action of <italic>Tv</italic>XynB variant lacking a CBM1. This suggests that the potentiating effect of CBM1-1 might not require the formation of a covalent linkage to <italic>Tv</italic>XynB.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although plant cell walls constitute the most abundant source of renewable carbon on Earth, the industrial extraction of their constituent sugars is difficult, because the polysaccharides are chemically complex, structured and interlinked, and are embedded in a matrix of lignin, which is a high molecular weight, amorphous polyphenolic polymer [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To overcome these difficulties, microorganisms that degrade plant cell walls in natural ecosystems have developed a number of strategies, which include plant cell wall-specific enzymes and related proteins that together surmount the many natural obstacles that confer recalcitrance to plant cell wall [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) are a diverse group of protein modules that are mainly found appended to carbohydrate-acting enzymes (CAZymes). Within the Carbohydrate Active enzyme database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cazy.org/</ext-link>), CBMs are classified into 71 families (as of July 2015) based on amino acid sequence similarity [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among the reported targets of CBMs, several have been shown to bind to crystalline cellulose, while others bind to amorphous cellulose, chitin, β-1,3-glucans, xylan, mannan, galactan or starch, with association constants ranging from 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>–1</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>–1</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137481.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this context, the main proposed role for CBMs is to bind to polysaccharides, thus increasing effective enzyme concentration and enhancing enzyme activity [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137481.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, it was also demonstrated that CBMs can potentiate enzyme activity by targeting polymers other than the substrate of the catalytic domain [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This study suggests that the possession of a CBM would confer an advantage for polysaccharide degrading enzymes in the context of complex substrate (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. lignocellulosic biomass).</p>
<p>The family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM1) is mostly found in fungal cellulose-degrading enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] where they are thought to efficiently direct cellulose binding to crystalline cellulose structure [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several studies have shown that CBM1 alone disrupts the crystalline structure of cellulose and facilitates hydrolysis by rendering the substrate more accessible [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Accordingly, the removal of a CBM1 from fungal cellulases frequently leads to reduced ligand affinity and to diminished hydrolytic activity on insoluble substrates [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137481.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. CBM1s are also detected in fungal xylanases (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic> GH10 and GH11), either at the N- or C-terminus [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The presence of CBM1s in fungal xylanases does not always appear to be beneficial for the degradation of soluble and insoluble xylans [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the exact role of this module in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrates is still poorly understood and requires further investigation.</p>
<p>Structural studies have revealed that all known CBMs display one of three binding site topologies (type A, B or C) [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Regarding type A CBMs, which are all small domains (32 to 36 aa long), structural analysis of the family 1 CBMs belonging to the cellobiohydrolase I from <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> has revealed that these binding domains display a wedge-shaped structure that is characterized by a flat hydrophobic surface composed of three aromatic residues (Y5, Y31 and Y32) that, along with polar residues (Q7 and N29), form the polysaccharide binding interface [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, CBM1s contain four cysteine residues forming two disulfide bridges that are required for the correct folding of the domain [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Overall, it is thought that these two structural features are common to all fungal CBM1s [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Although most CBM1s are of fungal origin, some are produced by oomycetes [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], fungal-like, filamentous microorganisms that are actually more closely related to the heterokont algae (i.e., diatoms, brown algae) than to true Fungi. The Oomycota phylum contains more than 800 species that occupy terrestrial or aquatic environments and includes some of the most devastating plant pathogens (e.g. the causal agent of potato blight <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> or the sudden oak death pathogen <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Unlike the cell-wall degrading enzymes from true Fungi, many of those isolated from oomycetal species do not possess CBM1s [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137481.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the other hand, in oomycetal species CBM1s have been detected as single domains, or as part of multidomain proteins [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137481.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Regarding the latter, these are often proteins that are composed of CBM1s that are appended to a so-called PAN/Apple module, a protein domain that can fulfil diverse biological functions by mediating protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Significantly, although CBM1s of oomycetal origin display some specific features, they also share conserved cysteines and aromatic residues with the CBM1s of fungal origin [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The <underline><bold>c</bold></underline>ellulose-<underline><bold>b</bold></underline>inding <underline><bold>e</bold></underline>licitor <underline><bold>l</bold></underline>ectin (<bold>CBEL</bold>) from <italic>Phytophthora parasitica</italic> represents the best described oomycetal CBM1-containing protein. This non-enzymatic cell wall glycoprotein harbors two homologous, but non-identical copies of CBM1-PAN/Apple association, with the two repeats being separated by a threonine/proline-rich linker region [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This glycoprotein is described as an elicitor due to its capacity to trigger plant immune responses [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, CBEL has been shown to bind to tobacco cell walls and crystalline cellulose (i.e. Avicel) [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Previous findings show that CBEL is a lectin that acts as a structural protein in the cellulosic cell wall of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> and mediates the attachment of the microorganism to host surfaces [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Structural prediction using <italic>in silico</italic> modelling has shown that oomycetal CBM1s harbour five cysteines, four of these being engaged in two disulphide bridges, and has suggested that amino acids F25, Y51 and Y52 in CBM1-1 and Y162, F187 and Y188 in CBM1-2 are surface-exposed and confer cellulose binding ability to CBEL [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, experimental work has revealed that the affinity for cellulose and the elicitor activity of CBEL are both significantly diminished when Y52 and Y188 (located in CBM1-1 and CBM1-2 respectively of the glycoprotein) were mutated to alanine [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, apart from this study it is clear that so far CBM1s from oomycetes have been much less characterised than their fungal counterparts.</p>
<p>In this study, we set out to better characterize CBEL and in particular it’s CBM1s. The motivation underlying this study was a desire to better understand the polysaccharide binding capabilities of the oomycetal CBM1s and to determine whether these could be useful to enhance the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. To reach these aims, the CBEL-associated CBM1s were characterized using a variety of techniques and were also linked to a fungal xylanase using a protein engineering strategy. Overall, the data described in this work confirm the polysaccharide binding ability of the oomycetal CBM1s and reveal the potential of these protein modules for the development of biomass degradation strategies.</p>

<p>CBEL from <italic>Phytophthora parasitica</italic> (GenBank ID: X97205) and variants thereof (CBEL<sub>Y52A_Y188A</sub>, CBEL<sub>Y52A</sub>, CBEL<sub>Y188A</sub>) were expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain BL21 DE3 as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, protein expression was induced by adding isopropylthio-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (500 μM final) to a bacterial culture (incubated at 37°C with shaking) when an absorbance (600nm) reading of 0.5 (approximately 3 h after inoculation) was achieved. The culture was pursued for a further 4 h at 37°C and then the cells were recovered by centrifugation (5000 g, 20 min, 4°C) and lyzed to extract protein inclusion bodies. Urea-solubilized inclusion bodies were dialyzed at 4°C against 10 L of sodium acetate buffer (100 mM, pH 5.2) and applied to a CM-Sepharose chromatography column equilibrated in the same buffer. Proteins were separated by applying a NaCl gradient (0 to 1 M) and eluted proteins were combined and neutralized by exhaustive dialysis (100 volumes) at 4°C for 48 h against water.

After recovery of a cell pellet by centrifugation (5000 g, 20 min, 4°C) and cell lysis by sonication (10 min, using pulses of 0.5 s), the cell supernatant containing the soluble protein fraction was applied to a cobalt affinity chromatography column (Talon) in 20 mM Tris-Hcl pH 8.0 300 mM NaCl buffer (Talon buffer). His-tagged proteins were eluted using a gradient of imidazole (0 to 200 mM) and then all fractions containing the recombinant protein were combined and dialyzed against 100 volumes of 20mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 buffer at 4°C for 24 h. The purified enzymes were adjudged homogeneous after examination of a SDS-PAGE and stored at 4°C. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and applying the Lambert–Beer equation.

<p>Adsorption assays to Avicel cellulose were performed in 0.1 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5. Proteins at concentrations in the range 0–25 μM were incubated under continuous agitation (1100 rpm, thermomixer Biorad) for 16 h at 25°C with 2.5% Avicel, before recovery of a supernatant and a solid fraction using centrifugation (10 min, 10, 000 g, 22°C). Upon removal of the supernatant, the solid fraction was once again submitted to centrifugation in order to ensure that the entire liquid fraction was recovered and then the concentration of the unbound, soluble protein fraction (i.e. in the supernatant) was determined using the Bradford method (Protein Reagent Assay, Bio-Rad). The bound protein concentration was then deduced by subtracting the unbound concentration from the initial protein concentration.

<p>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were conducted at 25°C in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 using a Microcal ITC200 instrument (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). To ensure minimal buffer mismatch, prior to the experiment the proteins were dialyzed against the buffer and the ligand molecules were directly solubilized in it.

A previous mutagenesis study has provided evidence that Y52 and Y188 located on the surface of CBM1-1 and CBM1-2 respectively are important for cellulose binding, since the double mutant CBEL<sub>Y52-Y188</sub> was deprived of binding ability [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Since the binding properties of CBEL were studied exclusively with regard to elicitor activity, we decided to better characterize and quantify the binding properties of CBEL, using the double mutant CBEL<sub>Y52-Y188</sub> and the single mutants: CBEL<sub>Y52A</sub> and CBEL<sub>Y188A.</sub></p>

<title>Solid state depletion assay</title>
<p>A solid state depletion assay using Avicel was performed in order to quantify CBEL binding to this crystalline cellulose. In this assay, wild type CBEL displayed ability to bind the ligand, while use of the double mutant, CBEL<sub>Y52A_Y188A,</sub> failed to reveal any detectable binding, consistent with the previous finding that the aromatic residues confer binding ability to CBEL (<xref rid="pone.0137481.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, a variant of CBEL bearing a single mutation in its CBM1-1 (CBEL<sub>Y52A</sub>) also displayed 15-fold decreased binding to Avicel. This is in sharp contrast to the binding ability displayed by the other single mutant CBEL<sub>Y188A</sub> (mutated in CBM1-2), which was similar to that of wild type CBEL (<xref rid="pone.0137481.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of CBM-ligand interactions</title>
<p>To further investigate the binding properties of the CBEL variants, the interaction of these with cellulose nanocrystals was studied using fluorescence spectrophotometry. The advantage of using cellulose nanocrystals was that these are water soluble and mimic the cellulose surface [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137481.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In these experiments, the calculated value for <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> was 2.5 g.L<sup>-1</sup> for CBEL, but binding was not detected in the case of CBEL<sub>Y52A_Y188A</sub>, a result that is once again consistent with the other data reported in this study (<xref rid="pone.0137481.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Likewise, as before the binding ability of the single mutant CBEL<sub>Y52A</sub> was found to be severely reduced with the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value being increased approximately 40-fold, while that of CBEL<sub>Y188A</sub> was only increased 6-fold (<xref rid="pone.0137481.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Together, these data support the view that CBEL binding to cellulosic compounds is mainly driven by CBM1-1 and that the binding ability of CBM1-2 is much lower. In this respect it is noteworthy that the binding ability of CBM1-1 to Avicel is comparable to that of fungal CBM1s and that residue Y52 in CBM1-1 appears to be a functional homolog of Y32 in the CBM1 of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>reesei</italic> cellobiohydrolase I, the latter being known to be a cellulose binding determinant [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137481.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

CBEL induced the release of a small, but significant amount of reducing sugars (905 μM), compared to the BSA control (103 μM). Although the activity of PAN/Apple domains on the substrate could not be excluded in this assay, this result supports the view that CBM1s from CBEL somehow modify cell wall polysaccharides. However, we were unable to pursue and complete this study, because it proved impossible to produce CBM1-1 on its own in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in order to evaluate its impact on wheat straw.

<title>Appendage of CBM1-1 onto a fungal endoxylanase</title>
<p>Addition of xylanases to cellulose mixture has been reported to enhance glucose release by increasing the accessibility of the cellulose to cellulases through the removal of hemicellulose [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137481.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover the precise role of CBM1s appended to fungal xylanases in the hydrolysis of lignocellulose is unclear, even if it is known that CBMs potentiate enzyme action on plant cell walls by targeting polymers that are in close vicinity to the partner enzyme’s substrate [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this context we investigated whether oomycetal CBM1s can potentiate the action of a fungal xylanase on wheat straw.

Importantly, all of the enzymes were optimally active in the pH range 3.0–3.5 with a maximum activity at pH 3.0, which is relatively low, but not unusual for fungal endoxylanases [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and at 55°C. However, at 55°C the enzymes described in this study were less stable (loss of 25% activity after 30 minutes) than <italic>Tv</italic>XynB expressed in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, experiments were actually performed at 40°C, thus ensuring that the enzymes would remain stable for at least 24h (data not shown). This difference in thermostability of recombinant <italic>Tv</italic>XynB expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> might be due to glycosylation, which was proven to be extensive in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic>, but totally absent in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Regarding specific activity, all three enzymes <italic>Tv</italic>XynB, <italic>Tv</italic>XynBΔCBM and <italic>Tv</italic>XynB-CBM1-1 exhibited similar behaviour (1515 ± 162 IU. mg<sup>-1</sup> protein) on birchwood xylan (BWX) (<xref rid="pone.0137481.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Similarly, kinetic analysis revealed almost identical values for <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0137481.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), confirming that neither the presence of the wild type CBM1 nor that of the CBEL-derived domain modulated the activity of the catalytic domain on BWX. This result is consistent with previous findings that indicate that CBM1s generally target cellulose, even when they are appended to catalytic modules that do not hydrolyze cellulose [<xref rid="pone.0137481.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137481.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This conclusion was supported by depletion assays, which revealed that both the wild type <italic>Tv</italic>XynB and the variant <italic>Tv</italic>XynB-CBM1-1 were able to bind to Avicel, whereas the <italic>Tv</italic>XynBΔCBM did not (<xref rid="pone.0137481.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, binding to Avicel was not identical, since the wild type <italic>Tv</italic>XynB bound more strongly than <italic>Tv</italic>XynB-CBM1-1. Moreover, gel retardation assays using the wild type enzyme and <italic>Tv</italic>XynB-CBM1-1 failed to reveal interactions of any of the proteins with sugar beet arabinan, wheat arabinoxylan or mixed-linkage β-(1, 3) (1, 4)-<sc>d</sc>-glucan (data not shown).</p>

<title>Wheat straw hydrolysis by <italic>Tv</italic>XynB and its variants, and the influence of CBEL</title>
<p>Using wheat straw as the substrate, hydrolytic properties of the <italic>Tv</italic>XynB-CBM1<sub>-</sub>1 were further investigated, comparing performance with that of the wild type enzyme and <italic>Tv</italic>XynBΔCBM respectively. After 24-h hydrolysis, the amount of reducing sugars released by <italic>Tv</italic>XynBCBM1-1 was generally higher than that observed with <italic>Tv</italic>XynB. At low enzyme loadings this increase in activity was roughly 10% but was more significant (16, 18 and 16%) at higher (0.5, 1 and 2.5 mg/g) loadings respectively (<xref rid="pone.0137481.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Therefore, this confirms that CBM1-1 can at least restore wild type activity in XynΔCBM and at best can enhance activity beyond wild type levels. Presumably this effect can be attributed to the binding of CBM1-1 to cellulose, which is in intimate contact with cell wall arabinoxylans.</p>

<p>To complete this study, wheat straw hydrolysis was also performed using a combination of either <italic>Tv</italic>XynBΔCBM, <italic>Tv</italic>XynBCBM1-1, or <italic>Tv</italic>XynB, and CBEL (<xref rid="pone.0137481.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). This revealed that the reaction procured a yield of soluble reducing sugars that was similar to the one involving <italic>Tv</italic>XynB-CBM1-1. If one assumes that the PAN/Apple domains play no role here, this observation is both intriguing and confusing, since it might imply that potentiation of the activity of the xylanase module by the CBM1-1 does not require a covalent linkage. Alternatively, the binding of CBEL (via its CBM1-1) to cellulose might provoke amorphogenesis that in turn leads to the non-specific solubilisation of components that are not covalently bound in the cell wall. To pursue this investigation, and better understand the underlying phenomena, it will be necessary to renew efforts to obtain an isolated recombinant form of CBM1-1.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study provides new insight into the cellulose binding properties of CBM1s from the oomycetal protein CBEL and reveals that CBM1-1 is probably the major determinant of CBEL’s interaction with cellulose. Moreover, this work has demonstrated that the CBM1-1 from <italic>Tv</italic>XynB somehow potentiates the action of the xylanase, although exactly how this is achieved remains unclear. Indeed, although appending the CBM1-1 to the catalytic module of <italic>Tv</italic>XynB enhanced activity compared to the equivalent enzyme lacking a CBM, a similar result could be obtained by combining <italic>Tv</italic>XynBΔCBM with free CBEL. Therefore, although this study has shown that CBM1-1 could be interesting for the creation of chimeric enzymes, it also tantalizingly raises a number of new questions that require further investigation.</p>
