<abstract>
<p>The Multidrug Resistance 1 (<italic>MDR1;</italic> alternatively <italic>ABCB1</italic>) gene product P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATP binding cassette transporter, extrudes multiple endogenous and exogenous substrates from the cell, playing an important role in normal physiology and xenobiotic distribution and bioavailability. To date, the predominant animal models used to investigate the role of P-gp have been the mouse and rat, which have two distinct genes, <italic>Abcb1a</italic> and <italic>Abcb1b.</italic> In contrast, the human has a single gene, <italic>ABCB1,</italic> for which only a single isoform has been validated. We and others have previously shown important differences between Abcb1a and Abcb1b, limiting the extrapolation from rodent findings to the human. Since the guinea pig has a relatively long gestation, hemomonochorial placentation and neuroanatomically mature offspring, it is more similar to the human, and may provide a more comparable model for investigating the regulation of P-gp in the brain and placenta, however, to date, the <italic>Abcb1</italic> gene in the guinea pig remains to be characterized. The placenta and fetal brain are barrier sites that express P-gp and that play a critical role of protection of the fetus and the fetal brain from maternally administered drugs and other xenobiotics. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR (QPCR) to sequence the expressed isoforms of guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic>, we demonstrate that like the human, the guinea pig genome contains one gene for <italic>Abcb1</italic> but that it is expressed as at least three different isoforms via alternative splicing and alternate exon usage. Further, we demonstrate that these isoforms are more closely related to human than to rat or mouse isoforms. This striking, overall similarity and evolutionary relatedness between guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> and human <italic>ABCB1</italic> indicate that the guinea pig represents a relevant animal model for investigating the function and regulation of P-gp in the placenta and brain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Up to 96% of pregnant women are administered at least one prescription drug during gestation. Where the fetus is not the intended target of treatment, there is significant risk of drug exposure in the developing fetus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Andrade1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Glover1">[2]</xref>. Blood-barrier sites such as the placenta and the fetal blood brain barrier (BBB) play a key role in fetal protection. The placenta is the primary barrier between maternal and fetal circulations. Multidrug Resistance 1 (MDR1; alternatively ABCB1 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp)) has been shown to limit the transplacental passage of substrates (endogenous and exogenous) into the fetal compartment and as such protects the fetus from potentially harmful compounds present in the maternal circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Smit1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Petropoulos1">[5]</xref>. Another level of fetal protection is found at the BBB. Similar to the placenta, Abcb1 in endothelial cells of the brain microvasculature limits the passage of substrates across the BBB and therefore minimizes the entry of substrates into the fetal brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Petropoulos2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Hembury1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>In most mammalian species including human, P-gp is generated from a single gene, whereas in many rodent species including the hamster, rat and mouse, two genes, <italic>Abcb1a</italic> and <italic>Abcb1b</italic>, encode distinct P-gp proteins. These exhibit overlapping and distinct substrate specificity and organ distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Croop1">[8]</xref>, resulting in tissue-specific functions that bear similarity to those of human ABCB1. Nevertheless, many differences regarding expression and function of Abcb1a and Abcb1b are known. For example, Abcb1a is primarily expressed in the brain, whereas Abcb1b is primarily expressed in the placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Kalabis1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, mouse <italic>Abcb1a</italic> and <italic>Abcb1b</italic> promoters share minimal homology with that of the human <italic>ABCB1</italic> promoter, suggesting alternative transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Cserr1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Piekarz1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Studies examining the function of P-gp in the human are limited due to low availability of normal tissues for functional studies. Rodents (rats and mice) are currently widely used to examine the expression and function of P-gp <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, given the reported differences between the rodent and human with regard to ABCB1, these <italic>in vivo</italic> models are not optimal. The guinea pig represents an excellent model in which to examine the role and regulation of Abcb1 in placenta and developing BBB, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro.</italic> The guinea pig has a relatively long gestation (approximately 70 days), it has hemomonochorial placentation and it gives birth to neuroanatomically mature offspring. However, the guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> gene has not been previously characterized in detail. In the present study, we aimed to identify the guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> gene(s). The identification of a single <italic>Abcb1</italic> gene in the guinea pig, as in the human, indicates that this species may provide a powerful model to screen xenobiotics and gain insight into the regulation of Abcb1, particularly in the context of development.</p>

<title>Animals, tissue collections and ethics statements</title>
<p>Female guinea pigs (Hartley strain, Charles River Canada, St-Constant, Quebec, Canada) were housed and bred in our animal facility as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Dean1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Dean2">[13]</xref>. All studies were performed according to protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Toronto in accordance with the Canadian Council for Animal Care. Pregnant guinea pigs were anesthetized using isofluorane (Baxter Corp., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and euthanized by decapitation on gestational day 50 (GD50; for placental collection; term ∼68 days) or allowed to deliver at term (for brain collection). Placentae from separate litters (n = 3) were collected and immediately frozen. Brains were isolated from postnatal day 14 (PND14) animals; euthanasia by decapitation following isofluorane inhalation followed. Brains (n = 2) were placed on ice-cold Medium 199 (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, California, USA) and microvessels (MVs) extracted as we have described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Iqbal2">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Human term placental samples (n = 4; 37–39 weeks of gestation) were collected by the Mount Sinai Hospital Research Centre for Women's and Infants' Health, RCWIH BioBank (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Collections were performed following guidelines found in “Standard Operating Procedures in the Collection of Perinatal Specimens” (available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biobank.lunenfeld.ca" xlink:type="simple">http://biobank.lunenfeld.ca</ext-link>) and informed consent was written. Tissue samples were stored at −80°C.</p>
<p>All studies were performed according to protocols approved by the Mount Sinai Hospital, the University of Toronto and the McGill University Institutional Review Boards. Regarding human brain samples, in all cases, family members or next of kin of the deceased subjects provided signed consent. Ethics approval nos. are: 26573 (animals), A02-M16-12B (human placentae) and A07-M76-13A (human brain).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>RNA extraction</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from guinea pig placental and brain MV and human placental samples (25–50 mg/sample) using TRIzol (LifeTechnologies) as per the modified TRIzol protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-HaimovKochman1">[15]</xref>. RNA pellets were resuspended in RNase/DNase-free water (LifeTechnologies) or in Millipore water and stored at −80°C. RNA quantity and purity was assessed using NanoDrop ND 1000 spectrophotometry and 1% gel electrophoresis. RNA samples for massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) underwent further bioanalysis to establish satisfactory quality at the Genome Quebec and McGill University Innovation Centre (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The minimal RNA integrity value for placental and brain MV RNA used for RNA-seq was 6.1.</p>
<p>Human brain RNA samples (n = 4, 1–2 µg each), isolated from Brodmann's Area-18 (BA18)-enriched occipital cell samples prepared from the occipital regions of healthy young (15–26 years of age) men having committed suicide, were kindly provided by Dr. Gustavo Turecki (Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, MUHC, Montreal, Canada). Brain RNA samples were stored at −80°C.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>RNA-seq</title>
<p>RNA-seq, selected for its high-throughput capacity and base-level resolution, was undertaken at Genome Quebec and McGill University Innovation Centre. Briefly, poly-A enrichment was performed using poly-T oligo-bound magnetic beads (Sera-Mag Magnetic Oligo(dT) Beads) and fragmented using divalent cations at 94°C. First strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was copied using random pd(N)<sub>6</sub> primers and SuperScript II (LifeTechnologies). Second strand was copied using Phusion DNA polymerase I and RNaseH (Finnzymes, now ThermoScientific, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Fragments were end-repaired using Klenow fragment (3′ to 5′ exo minus), adenylated, ligated to adapters using T4 ligase, gel extracted using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) and amplified via PCR using Phusion DNA polymerase I. cDNA libraries were sequenced using the technologies available at the time (Illumina Next Generation Sequencing for placenta; IlluminaHiSeq 2000 for brain) and 108 bp paired-end reads. Paired-end reads gives additional sequence and positional information, thereby improving library and alignment efficiencies. It was therefore the method of choice since potential alternate splice junctions were to be tracked and since the guinea pig genome is not fully annotated.</p>
<p>RNA-seq reads from guinea pig placenta and brain samples were aligned to the Feb 2008 <italic>Cavia porcellus</italic> draft (Broad Institute cavPor3) using TopHatv1.3.1 (pmid: 19261174; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Langmead1">[16]</xref>). The average RNA-seq read coverage depths for guinea pig placental and brain MV samples were 18x and 40x, respectively. Identification of probable transcripts was performed using Cufflinks software v1.0.3 using default settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Roberts1">[17]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>RT-PCR and QPCR validation experiments</title>
<p>RNA for subsequent RT-PCR and QPCR (following reverse transcription) validation experiments (below) was DNase I treated (1U DNase I per µg of RNA; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were re-purified using column clean-up (RNeasy Kit, QIAGEN) and re-quantified using NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometry and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p>Re-purified RNA samples (1 µg) were reverse transcribed using random pd(N)<sub>6</sub> primers and Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) Reverse Transcriptase (Roche, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Syntheses began with an initial denaturation of the RNA in the presence of the random primers at 70°C for 10 min followed by a 5 min incubation on ice. Reverse transcription master mixes were added and pre-incubated at room temperature (10 min). Samples were then incubated (42°C, 1 h) prior to inactivation (95°C, 10 min). cDNA samples were stored at −20°C.</p>
<p>cDNA (∼20 ng) was used to amplify the reference <italic>Gapdh</italic> gene or the target <italic>Abcb1</italic> amplicons. Primers were then optimized for specificity and annealing temperature using a thermal cycler (Biometra, Goettingen, Germany) and standard PCR conditions (one cycle at 95°C for 10 min, 35 cycles of 95°C for 10 sec; 60°C for 10 sec, 72°C for 10 sec; and one cycle at 72°C for 10 min). The reaction mixture was composed of the following: 2 µl of cDNA, 0.5 µl each of 10 µM forward and 10 µM reverse primer, 0.5 µl of dNTP mix (10 mM each), 0.2 µl of Hot Star Taq Plus polymerase (5 U/µl), 2.5 µl of 10X buffer and 18.8 µl RNase/DNase free water (25 µl, total reaction volume). 10 µl of the reaction volume were loaded onto an appropriate density (2–3%) agarose gel for 45 min or 2 h, respectively, to confirm RT-PCR results. Gels were stained using an ethidium bromide solution (0.5 µg/ml) for 10 min, visualized and photographed using an AlphaImager and Nikon camera. Experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>
<p>Since RNA-seq 5′ (start) reads were absent, transcripts were considered partially incomplete (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). A diagram characterizing guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> following corrections from validation (described below) and used to describe all following primer designs is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g001">Fig. 1</xref>.</p>

<p>In order to complete the 5′ sequence of the guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> transcripts, primers for RT-PCR were designed toward the 5′ sequence of the <italic>Abcb1</italic>-like mRNA complete coding DNA sequence (CDS) recently identified in guinea pig intestine (Accession no. JX312084.1), which demonstrated an additional 57 bp in the 5′ end. Primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, left and Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s007">File S1</xref>, <italic>5′ end validation</italic>) were designed following basic principles (these may be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.premierbiosoft.com/tech_notes/PCR_Primer_Design.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.premierbiosoft.com/tech_notes/PCR_Primer_Design.html</ext-link>). PCR conditions were optimized for temperature and RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels of appropriate density, stained and photographed to confirm target specificity and lack of background noise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).

<p>Additional primers were designed to verify via amplification and sequencing that sequences were the same as those identified via RNA-seq: amplicons spanned exons 3–4 (containing the additional 57 bp mentioned above) or exons 4–5 (not containing the 57 bp), respectively, whereas the reverse primer was designed to span exons 6–7, common to both amplicons. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, 242 and 195 bp amplicons).</p>
<p>RNA-seq established that exon 29 of guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> (containing both coding sequence and the majority of the 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR)) is 2,781 bp. Given its unusually large size, an RT-PCR genewalk strategy was selected as the method of choice to validate findings. The sequences of the long terminal exon and its immediate 5′- and 3′- flanking exons were combined and used for primer design. 5′- to 3′- stepwise overlapping RT-PCR amplicons across the gene (“genewalk”) were designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) using exon junction-spanning primers when possible (e.g. 422 and 457 bp amplicons). Primer sequences and amplicon characteristics are presented in Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s007">File S1</xref> (<italic>Genewalk</italic>).</p>

Briefly, five amplicons were designed: (1) a long 2,679 bp amplicon to validate isoform 1, where the forward is specific for the 5′ end of exon 29 and the reverse primer is specific for exon 30; (2) a shorter 398 bp amplicon to validate this same isoform but where the forward primer is specific for the 3′ end of exon 29; (3) a 214 bp amplicon to validate isoform 2 where the forward primer is specific for the 5′ end of exon 29 and the reverse primer is specific for exon 31; (4) a set of primers to confirm that no transcript results from splicing that joins a region in exon 29 present in isoform 1 to exon 31 present in isoform 2, hence this primer pair was not expected to result in a product; and (5) a 117 bp amplicon to specifically validate the splice site joining exons 29 and 31 of isoform 2.

<p>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QPCR) using a LightCycler480 and accompanying software (Roche) was used to quantify isoform expression in guinea pig placental and brain MV samples. cDNA (∼20 ng) was used to amplify sequences specific to the 3′ termini of isoforms 1 or 2 using SYBR Green (Life Technologies) as per the manufacturer's protocol. In an independent experiment, isoforms 1 and 3 were quantified to determine the relative abundance of each in the placenta and brain MVs. Due to the large exon 29 in isoform 1, RT-PCR to simultaneously quantify all three isoforms was not possible. Primers (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s007">File S1</xref>) were designed to have the same Ta of 60°C and produce amplicons with similar amplification efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). QPCR conditions were as follows: 10 min at 95°C followed by 45 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 60°C and 30 sec at 72°C. Melting curves were generated and products were electrophoresed on agarose gels and viewed using AlphaImager as described above to confirm the presence of a single band of the expected molecular weight. Statistical analyses were undertaken using Prism GraphPad and the significance was set at p&lt;0.05.</p>

<title>RNA-seq identification of one guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> gene with three transcripts</title>
<p>From RNA isolated from guinea pig placental and brain microvessel (MV)-derived tissues, five transcripts were identified as potential <italic>Abcb1</italic> transcripts using Cufflinks software, but only three of these were found to bear significant homology to Abcb1 with multiple species including human, so only these were therefore retained for further study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The two transcripts that were excluded from analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>) were built from scaffolds other than scaffold 11 and shared greater homology to other members of the ABC superfamily, more specifically <italic>Abcb11</italic>, <italic>Abcb4</italic>, and <italic>Abcb8</italic>. Reads for these transcripts were also on average 20-fold less abundant than other reads corresponding to <italic>Abcb1</italic> transcripts. One transcript (Cuff5730.1) was derived from brain MV and aligned to scaffold 3; the other transcript (Cuff10687.1) was derived from placenta and aligned to scaffold 10. Relevant sequence alignments using phylogeny.fr (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phylogeny.fr/version2_cgi/simple_phylogeny.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://www.phylogeny.fr/version2_cgi/simple_phylogeny.cgi</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Dereeper1">[20]</xref> are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>.

<p>Absence of higher amplitude peaks at the most 5′ end and absence of a start codon (AUG) indicated that all three RNA-seq transcript sequences were missing their first exons, hereon designated exons 3 and 4 due to their high homology with human exons 3 and 4 of the placenta RNA-seq transcript or exons 3, 4 and 5 of the brain RNA-seq transcript. These 2–3 exons and start codon are known to be present in human, rodent, and nearly all other vertebrate species for which sequences have been reported. Hence, we hypothesized that our RNA-seq-derived guinea pig transcripts were incomplete at their 5′ ends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). A comprehensive diagram is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. This diagram was used to guide RT-PCR and QPCR primer designs toward the validation of RNA-seq-derived sequences and to identify short missing sequences.</p>

<title>RT-PCR validation of guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> sequences</title>
<p>Experiments in which the forward primer was designed to hybridize to the 5′ region and start codon of a guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> transcript recently identified from guinea pig intestinal tissue (accession no. JX312084.1) succeeded in identifying the AUG codon. Two different anchoring reverse primers were used such that two amplicons of different molecular weights (295 and 462 bp amplicons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s007">File S1</xref>, <italic>5′ end validation</italic>) were amplified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Sequencing showed that products were identical to RNA-seq and to the guinea pig genome assembly sequences except for nucleotides +1 to +57, which did not align to any reported guinea pig sequence. Sequences upstream to the AUG could not be determined as the guinea pig genome is currently incomplete in this region.</p>
<p>Given that a large <italic>Abcb1</italic> exon 29 (2,781 nt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) was identified by RNA-seq but had not previously been described in the guinea pig or other species, validation was necessary. Seven sets of primers were designed to amplify stepwise overlapping regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>; Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s007">File S1</xref>, <italic>Genewalk</italic>). Amplicons 1–4 were specific to both placenta- and brain-derived RNA-seq sequences for exon 29, since the transcript identified in the brain (isoform 3) contains an exon sharing the first 553 of the 2,781 bp long exon contained in isoform 1. The remaining amplicons 5–7 were expected to be amplified only from placenta-derived cDNA samples. All primer sets were found to amplify the target molecular weight product in all three placental samples (example shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s003">Fig. S3</xref>, B). Both brain MV samples consistently amplified amplicons 1–4 (data not shown). However, one brain MV sample also amplified the remaining amplicons, consistent with the molecular weight and sequence of isoform 3, albeit at a lower intensity than that found in placenta. None of the no-reverse-transcriptase-controls were found to be positive, supporting mRNA-derived signals, not DNA-contaminants. Further RT-PCR experiments using primers flanking the border of isoform 3′s sequence confirmed that the last base of isoform 3 is nucleotide 553 of exon 29 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s003">Fig. S3C</xref>, right).</p>
<p>All three <italic>Abcb1</italic> isoforms are comprised of exons 3 through 28 but differ at the 3′ end (exons 29, 30 and 31) due to alternate exon usage and alternative splicing with a donor splice junction in exon 29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). These differences are the basis for three differently sized mRNAs (6,527, 3,819 and 4,168 nt, for isoforms 1, 2 and 3, respectively). All isoforms have a stop codon (UAG) at position 3,817, only isoform 1 has a long 3′UTR. We first designed primers against isoform 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>; Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s007">File S1</xref>, <italic>3′ end validation</italic>). Amplification of the 398 bp amplicon was possible in all samples albeit at a much lower intensity for brain MVs. Amplification of the 2.8 kb RT-PCR product was possible in all three placental samples but only in trace amounts in one of the two brain MV samples (agarose gels, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s003">Fig. S3C</xref>), consistent with previous genewalk results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>, right). We then designed primers against isoform 2 such that the reverse primer hybridizes to the splice acceptor site in the intron just upstream from the 24 bp terminal exon 31 (117 bp amplicon; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s003">Fig. S3D</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of these experiments were integrated with the RNA-seq transcripts to complete and correct the isoform sequences and have been schematized to scale in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g001">Fig. 1</xref>.</p>

</sec><sec id="s3f">
<title>Differences at the C-terminus between isoforms</title>
<p>All three guinea pig mRNA transcripts have distinct 3′ ends resulting from alternative exon splicing and alternate exon usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). More specifically, isoforms 1 and 2, detected primarily in placenta, differ only at their 3′ ends (exons 29–31). Isoform 1 has a particularly long exon 29 (2,781 bp) and an average sized exon 30 (118 bp), while isoform 2 has an average sized exon 29 (180 bp), no exon 30, and a small exon 31 (24 bp). Hence, these three isoforms were expected to result in two proteins, because isoforms 1 and 3 utilize the same ORF and stop codon (UAG), whereas this stop codon is spliced out of isoform 2 (i.e. isoform 2 utilizes another UAG stop codon further downstream to the one utilized by isoforms 1 and 3) and consequently, a slightly different ORF. mRNA transcripts were translated <italic>in silico</italic> using the <italic>Ex-Pasy Translate Tool</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.expasy.org/translate/" xlink:type="simple">http://web.expasy.org/translate/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Gasteiger1">[21]</xref>). Translation of isoforms 1 and 3 (Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s007">File S1</xref>) results in a single protein while that of isoform 2 results in another, having a slightly different sequence. The difference stems from the last four C-terminal amino acid residues: GARR for the protein translated from isoforms 1 and 3, RAKT for the protein translated from isoform 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), whereas the human residues are TKRQ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s005">Fig. S5B</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>in silico</italic> translated guinea pig protein sequences were compared to homologous protein sequences of human, mouse, rat and other species using the <italic>NCBI Protein Blast Sequence Alignment Tool</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" xlink:type="simple">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>). Guinea pig Abcb1 proteins share a closer identity to human ABCB1 (86%) than to mouse, rat or hamster Abcb1a or Abcb1b, however both bear a closer identity to Abcb1a from all rodent species than to Abcb1b (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111135-t001">Table 1</xref>, <italic>Proteins</italic>).</p>
<p>This difference, affecting the last four C-terminal amino acid residues of isoforms 1–3, is both adjacent to one of the two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and adjacent to cytoplasmic proteins and/or plasma membrane proteins. When analyzed further using BLASTp or the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (cDART; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml</ext-link>), the last 4 amino acids (aa) are not part of a recognized domain. Rather, they are different one from another with regard to charge and pH/isoelectric point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s005">Fig. S5C</xref>). In particular, the predicted protein product of isoform 2 has one additional uncharged amino acid (T/threonine) compared to the predicted protein of isoform 1.</p>

<title>Summary of guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> isoform characteristics</title>
<p>Differences due to alternative splicing and alternate exon usage are the basis for three different mRNA isoforms in the guinea pig. A summary of these differences may be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111135-t002">Table 2</xref>. While isoforms 1 and 3 are highly different one from the other at the 3′ end regarding mRNA length and sequence, their sequences generate the same protein. In contrast, the placenta expresses an additional (distinct) protein, translated from isoform 2. Overall, in the placenta, isoforms 1 and 2 are predominantly expressed; in the brain, isoform 3 is predominantly expressed, although the relative MV expression level is very low.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Studies described in this manuscript demonstrate that in the guinea pig, <italic>Abcb1</italic> exists as a single gene, akin to the human and 58 other species (among 62 species for which <italic>Abcb1</italic> has been annotated; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111135-t003">Table 3</xref>). In addition, phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that guinea pig Abcb1 is more closely related to its human homolog than to its rodent homologs. These results, together with the developmental similarities between the guinea pig and the human, including long gestation, hemomonochorial placentation and neuro-anatomically mature offspring, provide strong support for the use of the guinea pig as a comparable animal model, superior to that of the rodent, toward the study of the regulation and function of ABCB1. This is important in light of the fact that rodent studies have been used extensively to extrapolate the crucial toxicological data regarding drug transfer due to the many limitations of human research.</p>
<p>Further, we now provide evidence that three distinct <italic>Abcb1</italic> mRNA isoforms are expressed in the guinea pig placenta and brain during development and that isoform expression is tissue-specific: <italic>ABCB1</italic> isoforms 1 and 2 are predominantly expressed in the placenta, isoform 3 is predominantly expressed in the brain. These differences may have important consequences on mRNA expression and regulation and on protein structure and predicted function.</p>
<p>Regarding mRNA expression and regulation, another novel finding from this study is the length (2,781 bp) of guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> exon 29 and its correspondingly long 3′UTR, transcribed in isoform 1. Compared to isoform 2, isoform 1 requires a longer transcription time, which may result in differential temporal expression and increased cellular energy between isoforms. It may also play a role in the secondary structure and/or stability of the mRNA, potentially via polyadenylation signals or microRNA response elements (MREs) influencing post-transcriptional gene expression.</p>
<p>Adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (AREs) are found in the 3′UTR of many mRNAs and influence the mRNAs steady-state level by influencing degradation. The human <italic>ABCB1</italic> 3′UTR is AU-rich with approximately 38 AREs within a 386 bp UTR (or approximately 10%) with several of these similar to those found in c-<italic>Myc</italic>, c-<italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>lymphokine</italic> mRNAs, and known to cause tissue-specific RNA rapid decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Prokipcak1">[22]</xref>. Guinea pig isoform 1 (but not 2 or 3) is similar in that it also contains many AU sequences (including at least 7 AUUUA consensus sequences). While these sequences may cause the accelerated decay of isoform 1 relative to that of other isoforms, this remains to be determined. However, the human <italic>ABCB1</italic> 3′UTR does not behave as an active destabilizing element in HepG2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Prokipcak1">[22]</xref> and does not reduce the mRNA half-life in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, even when the most common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants are tested <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Gow1">[23]</xref>, suggesting that even if these AU elements had any role in the guinea pig it is not necessarily relevant to all human tissues. It remains to be seen whether the AU elements play any regulatory role in human tissues.</p>
<p>MicroRNAs are known to repress expression of target genes containing microRNA response elements (MREs) within them, and MREs are most often within 3′UTRs. Very little is known regarding the conservation of MREs across species. In an attempt to discover whether the guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> isoform 1’s 3′UTR contains MREs, the reverse complement of several human <italic>ABCB1</italic>-specific miRs validated to reduce <italic>ABCB1</italic> mRNA expression and ABCB1 activity (miR223 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Yang1">[24]</xref>, miR508-5p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Shang1">[25]</xref>, bta-miR145 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Ikemura1">[26]</xref>, miR381 and miR-495 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Xu1">[27]</xref>) were searched via BLAST alignment for extrapolation to guinea pig; however, none were found. Further work is required to determine if miRs play a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>Abcb1</italic> in the guinea pig, with a particular emphasis on the very long 3′UTR found in this study. The human miR cluster at 14q32.31, an imprinted region, containing miR-381 and miR-495, contains over 20 miR sequences, several known to inhibit <italic>ABCB1</italic> in human, and there is 90% homology (BLAT) between this region and a 31 kb region in the guinea pig genome, on the plus strand of scaffold 111, therefore representing a candidate region for miR discovery.</p>
<p>The possibility that the long 3′UTR plays a role in the co-transcriptional translation exists, since other, smaller and silent sequence variations (SNPs translated into synonymous codons) have been shown to cause ribosomal stalling, giving nascent ABCB1 proteins greater freedom to make additional transient interactions between amino acid side chains, and resulting in the alteration of the substrate binding cavity and altered substrate specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-KimchiSarfaty1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Regarding protein structure and function, all computational protein model predictions created using MODBASE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/index.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/index.cgi</ext-link>), Swiss-Model (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://swissmodel.expasy.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://swissmodel.expasy.org/</ext-link>) or Phyre2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index</ext-link>) were partially (at least 4%) incomplete (not covering approximately 52 amino acids, minimum), and most importantly, did not cover the C-termini because X-ray crystals are not currently available for modeling the C-terminus. While resulting models, albeit incomplete (96% coverage), did show a striking similarity to known P-gp proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>), structural differences between isoforms could not be estimated. Nevertheless, given the different biochemical characteristics of the carboxy termini, it is plausible that different protein-protein interactions may be made with neighbouring proteins, either in the cytoplasm where the C-terminus bathes or within the plasma membrane. It is also possible that the RAKT sequence in Abcb1 isoform 2 is a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation site, and that phosphorylation regulates isoform 2-derived protein activity, leaving the protein derived from isoform 1 unaffected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111135-Feinmesser1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>There is currently limited information pertaining to the structure-function relationships regarding the C-terminus of P-gp. As such, it is difficult to speculate which P-gp characteristics (including ATP-binding, substrate specificity, rate of extrusion, coupling of substrate transport to ATP hydrolysis, signal transduction, structural flexibility, structural stability or degradation) may be affected by the differences observed in isoforms 1 and 3 compared to isoform 2.</p>
<p>Guinea pig <italic>Abcb1</italic> has two additional exons downstream to exon 29 (exons 30–31). Several lines of evidence exist pointing toward the possibility that human <italic>ABCB1</italic> transcripts may also be comprised of more than 29 exons. More precisely, several exons downstream to the reported 3′UTR have been observed following long RNA-seq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>; Long RNA-seq track from Cold Spring Harbour Lab). In fact, human <italic>ABCB1</italic> reportedly has a total of 58 exons according to the European Bioinformatics Institute website (ENBL-EBI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/" xlink:type="simple">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/</ext-link>). We therefore aimed to determine whether or not <italic>ABCB1</italic> transcripts in our 8 human placenta or brain samples contained these sequences in <italic>ABCB1</italic> splice products. We used RT-PCR with two different anchor forward primers, one in exon 28 and another in exon 29, in combination with reverse primers in sequences representing hypothetical exons 30, 31 and 32, found using the UCSC Genome Browser (option: “Whole Cell PolyA-RNAseq Contigs Pooled from ENCODE/CSHL”). We found no such evidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s006">Fig. S6</xref>, Table S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111135.s007">File S1</xref>).</p>
<p>No evidence of human <italic>ABCB1</italic> mRNA isoforms derived from brain or placenta and bearing resemblance to these novel guinea pig isoforms (i.e. variable 3′ ends due to long exon 29, alternative splicing or alternate exon usage) was found following searches conducted using multiple different databases (AceView, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>; “mRNA and EST” and “expression” tracks at UCSC genome browser Human Dec. 2013 Assembly, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>; Sequence Read Archive, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra</ext-link>; Human Body Map 2.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.info/blog/2011/05/24/human-bodymap-2-00-data-from-illumina/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ensembl.info/blog/2011/05/24/human-bodymap-2-00-data-from-illumina/</ext-link>; DataBase of Alternative Transcripts Expression, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatica.uniroma2.it/cgi-bin/DBATE" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinformatica.uniroma2.it/cgi-bin/DBATE</ext-link>; Alternative Splicing and Transcript Diversity database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/astd" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/astd</ext-link>; FastDB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fast-db.com/fastdb2/frame.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.fast-db.com/fastdb2/frame.html</ext-link>; ECgene, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ewha.ac.kr/ECgene/" xlink:type="simple">http://genome.ewha.ac.kr/ECgene/</ext-link>; Exon Intron Database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mcb.harvard.edu/gilbert/EID" xlink:type="simple">http://mcb.harvard.edu/gilbert/EID</ext-link>). RNA-seq data from 40 human brain samples derived from the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex (BA24) were also visualized using Integrated Genomics Viewer 2.3 (IGV2.3), and again, no such evidence was found (data not shown). This does not necessarily negate similar functions of ABCB1 in the human and guinea pig since potential alternative transcripts in the human may be different than those found in guinea pig. Moreover, RNA-seq data from purified human brain MVs or from human placental samples enriched for the fetal component or for trophoblasts have yet to be reported.</p>
<p>The locus for guinea pig <italic>Abcb4</italic> is not currently known with certainty and may co-localize with <italic>Abcb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The alignment of guinea pig <italic>Abcb</italic> genes, a complex task due to their inherent homology, to this date remains incomplete. Currently, only one predicted (i.e. pending validation) guinea pig sequence for <italic>Abcb4</italic> (XM_005008654.1) has been reported on scaffold 31, not scaffold 11 where we have localized Abcb1. However, other potential loci, including the one on scaffold 11 (represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111135-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) exist. It is therefore not currently possible to determine whether or not <italic>Abcb1</italic> and <italic>Abcb4</italic> co-localize at this time. Nevertheless, the last exon (exon 31) of <italic>Abcb1</italic> aligns to a region approximately 250 kb downstream of its 5′ end, in a region homologous to predicted <italic>Abcb4</italic> sequences, making the <italic>Abcb1</italic> locus much larger than previously thought.</p>
<p>In conclusion, evolution has resulted in differences between Abcb1 isoforms in the guinea pig and human. Nevertheless, overall similarity and evolutionary relatedness remain between these species. As such, the guinea pig would appear to represent a superior model for investigating Abcb1 function and regulation in comparison with other rodents. This holds in the context of human placental and brain development, and in the more general context of pharmacological, oncological, and toxicological studies. Further experimentation is required to investigate these isoforms in tissues other than the placenta and brain, and to further determine the structural and functional differences between the isoforms. Understanding regulation of Abcb1 function in the placenta and fetal blood-brain-barrier will enhance ability to protect the fetus from maternally administered therapeutics and environmental pollutants, as well as facilitate development of new drug delivery strategies for the mother and fetus.</p>
