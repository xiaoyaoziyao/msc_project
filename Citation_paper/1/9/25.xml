<abstract>
<p>We identified Mrpl44 in a search for mammalian proteins that contain RNase III domains. This protein was previously found in association with the mitochondrial ribosome of bovine liver extracts. However, the precise Mrpl44 localization had been unclear. Here, we show by immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation that Mrpl44 is localized to the matrix of the mitochondria. We found that it can form multimers, and confirm that it is part of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. By manipulating its expression, we show that Mrpl44 may be important for regulating the expression of mtDNA-encoded genes. This was at the level of RNA expression and protein translation. This ultimately impacted ATP synthesis capability and respiratory capacity of cells. These findings indicate that Mrpl44 plays an important role in the regulation of the mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Almost all eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria, double membrane-enclosed structures that are crucial for the production of energy, in the form of ATP, by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The OXPHOS system, encoded by genes within both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes (mtDNA and nDNA), is comprised of 88 protein subunits that assemble into five multi-subunit complexes (Complex I—V), to form the electron transport chain at the inner membrane of the mitochondrion [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The system functions to link the oxidation of reduced coenzymes (NADH at Complex I, and FADH<sub>2</sub> at Complex II), with proton pumping (at Complex I, III and IV) to generate the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>). Complex V then utilizes the ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> by mechanically coupling the flow of protons through the complex down their electrochemical gradient, driving ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate.</p>
<p>The mitochondrion is thought to have evolved from free-living bacteria engulfed by an ancestral archaeal cell. The presence of the mtDNA supports this theory [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The mammalian mtDNA is a circular, double-stranded genome that encodes for 13 open reading frames (ORFs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The 13 ORFs encode for proteins that are integral subunits of the OXPHOS system [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Defects in mtDNA transcription and translation are associated with numerous classical mitochondrial diseases including: chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia; mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes; Leigh syndrome; myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibres; mitochondrial neuro-gastro-intestinal encephalomyopathy; and Pearson syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Apart from the mtDNA-encoded proteins, the majority of the proteins found in the mitochondria are nuclear-encoded. This includes proteins crucial for mtDNA replication, transcription and translation as well as proteins associated with the mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome), including proteins known as mitochondrial ribosomal proteins [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The mammalian mitoribosome is made up of a large subunit (39S), comprising the mtDNA-encoded 16S rRNA and 52 nuclear-encoded proteins (Mrpl), including a mitochondrial valine tRNA (tRNA<sup>Val</sup>), a crucial structural component, and a small subunit (28S), containing the mtDNA-encoded 12S rRNA and 31 nuclear-encoded proteins (Mrps) [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Until recently, Drosha and Dicer were the only two known RNase III proteins in animals. These play important roles in the biogenesis of small non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. RNase III proteins are divalent metal ion-dependent phosphodiesterases that specifically bind to and cleave double stranded (ds) RNA. The RNase III domain dimerizes to form a structure that binds dsRNA and cleaves the phosphodiesters on each strand, resulting in products with characteristic 2 nucleotide (nt) 3’- overhangs [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This step, essentially the processing of dsRNA by RNase III enzymes, is crucial for the maturation and decay of both coding and non-coding RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the function of a poorly characterized protein previously identified as a component of the mitoribosome. We show that Mrpl44 has a role in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression and ultimately in the regulation of OXPHOS.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Murine fibroblast (NIH3T3), mammary epithelial (CommaD P24), neuronal (N2A) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin and sodium pyruvate.</p>
<p>HEK293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate method for co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, and for producing retroviral/lentiviral supernatants. MSCV-based retroviruses encoding FLAG or GFP-tagged constructs or lentiviruses encoding shRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were then transduced into the various cell lines. Short hairpin (sh) RNAs targeting the sequences at the 3’ UTR (<monospace>5’TCTCTTACACACTGGTTTATTACT-3’</monospace>) and the open reading frame (<monospace>5’-GGAAAGAGCTCTTTGAGATGT-3’</monospace>) were employed to knockdown Mrpl44. The murine sequence was employed for all constructs.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>Cells expressing free GFP or Mrpl44GFP fusion were grown on gelatin-coated coverslips. MitoTrackerRed was added to the cultures 30min prior to harvesting to stain the mitochondria. The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with paraformaldehyde, then stained with an αGFP antibody (#2956, Cell Signaling Technologies). DAPI was used to visualize the nucleus. Images were captured on a DeltaVision Elite widefield fluorescence microscope.</p>

<title>Subcellular fractionation</title>
<p>Cells were fractionated into nuclei, cytosol (± heavy membranes), mitochondria and mitochondrial components. Nuclear versus cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The mitochondrial fraction was extracted with digitonin, as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

<title>Co-immunoprecipitations (Co-IP)</title>
<p>Transiently transfected HEK293T cells and stably transduced NIH3T3 cells were used for analyses. Heavy membrane fractions were obtained by digitonin permeabilization and lyzed in KALB lysis buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA). Supernatants were either co-IPed with M2 αFLAG agarose beads (Sigma), with a mouse αGFP antibody (1A12-6-18, produced in house), or with a rabbit αMrpl44 antibody (Proteintech) followed by Protein G sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Details of the antibodies used are provided in <xref rid="pone.0134326.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>. For the analysis of protein-RNA interactions, RNA was extracted with TriSure (Bioline) following the washing of the beads.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial translation assay</title>
<p>The analysis of mitochondrial gene translation was performed as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In brief, NIH3T3 cells were plated such that they reached a confluency of 75 to 90% on the day of the experiment. The cells were washed in PBS and pre-incubated with methionine/cysteine-deficient DMEM, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The addition of emetine was used to inhibit cytoplasmic translation. EasyTag Expre<sup>35</sup>S<sup>35</sup>S Protein Labeling Mix [<sup>35</sup>S] (&gt;1,000Ci/mmol) (Perkin Elmer) was then added to the wells and incubated for 120mins, with samples collected at 0, 30, 60 and 120mins. Protein was quantified by Micro-BCA (Thermo Scientific), and resolved on a 10–16% gradient gel (Biorad). The proteins were then electrotransferred to PVDF membrane for autoradiography. Quantification of radioactive counts was performed with ImageQuant TL 8.1 (GE Healthcare).</p>

<title>Measurement of ATP synthesis and bioenergetics</title>
<p>ATP synthesis rates were measured in technical duplicates as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, the cells were diluted 10 fold in ATP synthesis buffer containing 50μg/ml digitonin and substrates with/without addition of the following substrates and inhibitors: succinate (10mM), malonate (1mM), glutamate (10mM), malate (10mM), rotenone (2.5μM). After 20min, the reactions were stopped with perchloric acid on ice, and neutralized with potassium hydroxide and MOPS. ATP concentration in the samples was determined by ATP Bioluminescence Assay (Roche).</p>
<p>The oxygen consumption (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) were measured using the Seahorse XF-24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The various parameters were determined following the inhibition or uncoupling of the OXPHOS system components: rotenone (Complex I inhibitor), oligomycin (Complex V inhibitor), FCCP (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> uncoupler), and Antimycin A (Complex III inhibitor).</p>

<title>Mrpl44 is a putative RNase III enzyme</title>
<p>In an attempt to identify additional RNase III enzymes in animals, we performed a search for proteins with sequence homology to the RNase III domain and double-stranded RNA-binding motif (dsRBM) of murine Drosha (<xref rid="pone.0134326.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). This analysis yielded a small protein, Mrpl44, which has a predicted molecular weight of 38kDa and is structurally similar to bacterial RNase III (<xref rid="pone.0134326.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Mrpl44 is a protein that was previously identified as part of the large subunit of the mitoribosome in bovine mitochondrial extracts [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is conserved across a wide range of species and homologues can be found in yeast, nematodes, flies and humans, but not in bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the RNase III domain itself does not appear to be as well conserved as the RNase III domains of Drosha and Dicer [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, <italic>MRPL44</italic> was recently found to be the gene mutated in a sib-pair with mitochondrial infantile cardiomyopathy [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This resulted in reduced MRPL44 expression levels in heart and skeletal muscles, with reduced MRPL44 expression appearing to affect assembly of the large ribosomal subunit and stability of the 16S RNA [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

<title>Mrpl44 is localized to the mitochondria</title>
<p>The conservation of MRPL44 across a wide range of organisms suggests that it plays an important function in cells. While MRPL44 was originally found to be associated with the mitochondria, it has also been captured with a wide variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear baits suggesting that it may not be specifically localized to the mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
<p>To better define the cellular localization of Mrpl44, we generated an Mrpl44GFP fusion construct and transduced it into the cell lines NIH3T3, CommaD P24 and N2A cells. Mrpl44GFP co-localized with MitoTrackerRED in all cell lines examined (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). We also examined for co-localization with PD1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and phalloidin, which binds filamentous actin, but found no co-localization (data not shown). This indicates that Mrpl44GFP is specifically localized to the mitochondria. In contrast, untagged GFP showed no specific localization (<xref rid="pone.0134326.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>)</p>

<p>(A) Shown are NIH3T3 fibroblasts, CommaD P24 mammary epithelial cells and N2A neuronal cells expressing an Mrpl44GFP fusion. The cells were co-stained with MitoTrackerRed along with DAPI and analyzed by wide-field microscopy (400X magnification). (B) NIH3T3 cells were sub-fractionated into the following fractions: cytosol and heavy membranes (C+HM), nuclear (N), cytosol (C), mitochondrial outer membrane and intermembrane space (IO) and mitoplast (MP). Whole cell extract (WCE) is also shown. Fractions were blotted with antibodies against Mrpl44 as well as Grp75, a known mitochondrial protein, Drosha, a nuclear protein, and β-actin, a cytoskeletal protein.</p>

<p>We further confirmed that endogenous Mrpl44 is localized to the mitochondria. NIH3T3 fibroblasts were sub-fractionated into nuclear, cytosol plus heavy membrane, cytosol only, mitochondrial outer membrane and intermembrane space (IO) and the mitoplast (MP, mitochondrial inner membrane plus matrix). The presence of endogenous Mrpl44 was analyzed by Western blotting. We found that Mrpl44 was present in all fractions containing mitochondria, but was predominantly localized to the MP fraction (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Mrpl44 forms multimers as part of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome</title>
<p>RNase III proteins typically form dimers that bind to and cleave dsRNA [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To determine whether Mrpl44 might form dimers or multimers, FLAG-tagged Mrpl44 (Mrpl44FLAG) was co-transfected with Mrpl44GFP into HEK293T cells. As a negative control, Mrpl44GFP was co-transfected with FLAGBak, another mitochondria-localized protein. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with αFLAG beads to capture Mrpl44FLAG or FLAGBak, then Western blotted to determine if Mrpl44GFP was co-immunoprecipitated. Indeed, Mrpl44GFP was found to interact with Mrpl44FLAG but not FLAGBak (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). This suggests that Mrpl44 can exist in dimers or multimers.</p>

(B) NIH3T3 whole cell extracts were fractionated by HPLC on a Superose 6 column.

Endogenous Mrpl44 was found to elute as two different complexes, predominantly one of greater than 670kDa and another smaller one that eluted in the &lt;158 kDa range (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Both correspond to complexes that are much larger than predicted Mrpl44 dimers. The elution of the larger Mrpl44 complex follows Mrpl12 and Mrps15, known components of the mitoribosome. However, it is also possible that Mrpl44 dimer/multimers may exist separately from the mitoribosome, either independently or in complex with subcomponents of the mitoribosomes [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
<p>To confirm that Mrpl44 is indeed part of the mitoribosome, Mrpl44FLAG and FLAGBak, as a negative control, were captured with αFLAG beads and the bound RNA was extracted. The presence of mitochondrial rRNA was then determined by quantitative RT-PCR. We found that both the 12S and 16S rRNAs were co-IPed with Mrpl44 (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). In addition, Mrpl12, another component of the large subunit of the mitoribosome, co-IPed with Mrpl44, along with Mrps15, a component of the small subunit (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). This confirms that Mrpl44 is indeed associated with the mitoribosome.</p>

<title>Expression of mtDNA-encoded genes is compromised by Mrpl44 knockdown in NIH3T3 fibroblasts</title>
<p>Given the localization of Mrpl44 to the matrix of the mitochondria and its association with the mitoribosome, we sought to determine if Mrpl44 is required for the expression of the mtDNA. We investigated the impact on mtDNA-encoded RNA and protein expression levels in NIH3T3 cells following perturbation of Mrpl44 levels. Knockdown of Mrpl44 by stably transduced shRNAs resulted in decreased levels of mtDNA-encoded RNA. 16S rRNA, ND2, ND4 and ND5 mRNA transcripts, in particular, were significantly decreased (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). On the other hand, when Mrpl44 was overexpressed, mtDNA-encoded RNA was increased (<xref rid="pone.0134326.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). These results indicate that Mrpl44 affects the level of RNA within the mitochondria.</p>

<p>The downregulation in mitochondrial RNA levels corresponded to decreased protein levels of the mtDNA-encoded protein ND6, OXPHOS system Complex IV (COX IV), and another protein associated with the large subunit of the mitoribosome, Mrpl11 (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). However, expression of the small subunit of the mitoribosome Mrps15 and the nDNA-encoded mitochondrial protein Grp75 were unaffected. Mrpl44 overexpression did not affect mitochondrial protein expression (<xref rid="pone.0134326.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). These results indicate that Mrpl44 plays a role in the regulation of mitochondrial-encoded protein expression.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial genome copy number is unaffected by altered Mrpl44 expression</title>
<p>It is possible that impact on mitochondrial gene expression caused by altered Mrpl44 level may be via changes in mitochondrial genome copy number. To examine this, genomic DNA was extracted from NIH3T3 cells over-expressing Mrpl44GFP or knocked down for Mrpl44. qRT-PCR analysis for mitochondrial versus nuclear DNA found that altered Mrpl44 expression had no impact on the mitochondrial DNA content of cells (<xref rid="pone.0134326.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, Mrpl44 appears to regulate mitochondrial genome expression rather than copy number.</p>

<title>Mrpl44 affects immature mitochondrial RNA transcript levels</title>
<p>We next investigated whether altered Mrpl44 levels might impact the maturation of mitochondrial genome-encoded transcripts by measuring expression of the immature mitochondrial RNA transcripts (i.e. polycistronic transcripts that are yet to be processed). This was down by qRT-PCR with using primers flanking the 5’ and 3’ ends of mitochondrial tRNAs. We found that knockdown of Mrpl44 resulted in the accumulation of the tRNA Glu junction (<xref rid="pone.0134326.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>), while overexpression resulted in reduction in a range of tRNA junctions (<xref rid="pone.0134326.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). This suggests that the presence of Mrpl44 reduces the amount of immature mitochondrial RNA transcripts. This could potentially be by enhancing transcript maturation.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial translation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts is impaired by Mrpl44 knockdown</title>
<p>We next examine whether Mrpl44 might also regulate mitochondrial translation, rather than just affecting transcript maturation. A mitochondrial translation assay was performed. <sup>35</sup>S-methionine was used to radiolabel mitochondrial translation products in the presence of emetine, which inhibits cytosolic translation. Knockdown of Mrpl44 resulted in a clear decrease in overall mitochondrial protein translation, with fewer proteins being labeled during the time course (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Further quantification revealed that the subunits ND3, ND4, ND5, ND6 and COIII were below detection limits with Mrpl44 knockdown (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Of the proteins detected during the time course, the rate of translation was decreased as well, with the subunits ND1, ND2, CytB and COI being labeled 30 min later, at the 60 min time point, compared to control cells (<xref rid="pone.0134326.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>).

<title>Mrpl44 knockdown impairs Complex I- and Complex II- dependent ATP synthesis</title>
<p>The regulation of mitochondrial protein translation by Mrpl44 is likely to impact mitochondrial function. To determine if altered Mrpl44 expression affects ATP synthesis, we measured the maximal capacity of Complex I- and Complex II-dependent ATP synthesis in digitonin permeabilised NIH3T3 cells with altered Mrpl44 levels. These measurements were obtained under optimal substrate conditions: i) with the Complex I-dependent substrates glutamate and malate, in the presence or absence of the Complex I inhibitor rotenone; or ii) with the Complex II-dependent substrate succinate (with rotenone to force forward electron transfer from Complex II), in the presence or absence of the Complex II inhibitor malonate. Rates were then normalized to the control Complex II-dependent rate (succinate + rotenone) in each experiment.</p>
<p>Knockdown of Mrpl44 resulted in a reduction in Complex I- and Complex II-dependent rates of ATP synthesis (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). This correlates with the reduced assembly of the OXPHOS Complexes I, III, IV and V. For both Mrpl44 KD and control cells, the Complex I and Complex II-dependent ATP synthesis were abolished by the appropriate inhibitors (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>), confirming that measurement of ATP synthesis was “substrate-specific”.

<title>Mrpl44 expression level affects mitochondrial respiratory capacity</title>
<p>To better characterize the impact of altered Mrpl44 expression on OXPHOS, we analyzed the OCR of cells in culture. Consistent with impaired ATP synthesis, the resting OCR, maximal OCR (MRR), and spare respiratory capacity (SRC) were reduced with the KD of Mrpl44 (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). Interestingly, although we could not detect an impact of Mrpl44 overexpression on ATP synthesis, OCR, MRR and SRC were increased (<xref rid="pone.0134326.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). We also monitored the ECAR as an indirect measure of glycolytic activity, but found no impact of altering Mrpl44 expression (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0134326.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). This is consistent with Mrpl44 affecting the expression of the mtDNA-encoded components of the OXPHOS system. The OCR to ECAR ratio (OCR/ECAR) is an indication of the preference of the cell to utilize OXPHOS versus glycolysis to generate ATP. This ratio was reduced in Mrpl44 KD fibroblasts; the heavier reliance on glycolysis is not surprising as OXPHOS is severely compromised in these cells (<xref rid="pone.0134326.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). This again confirms that Mrpl44 is critical for expression of the mtDNA-encoded components of the OXPHOS system.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mitochondrial disorders represent a large number of diseases and are generally caused by OXPHOS dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As the OXPHOS subunits are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes, inheritance of OXPHOS diseases can either be due to sporadic mutations, autosomal recessive or dominant, X-linked or maternal [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In recent years, it has become clear that defects in mitochondrial gene transcription and translation underlie many of these syndromes [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Mitochondrial defects caused by mtDNA-encoded genes are generally easy to identify. However, the mitochondrial transcription and translation machinery is primarily encoded by the nuclear genome (apart from the rRNAs). And until recently, mapping the mutations in these nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes has been difficult. With the advent of high throughput sequencing techniques, an increasing number of these mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For instance, autosomal recessive mutations in translation elongation factors cause phenotypes such as encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy (TSFM) and leukoencephalopathy (TUFM) [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
<p>A number of mutations that affect mitochondrial translation have been identified. This include mutations in the core MRPs, including MRPS16 [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], MPS22 [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]and MRPL12 [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as well as in several accessory proteins, such as ObgH1 [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and C7orf30 [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Mutations in MRPS16 and MRPS22 appear to affect the stability of the mitoribosome [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], while MRPL12 appears to be involved in the recruitment of elongation factors as well as the modulation of mitochondrial gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Impaired translation can affect the assembly of all or only specific complexes within the OXPHOS pathway [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]indicating that mitochondrial genome translational is a highly regulated process. In the case of MRPL44, it is clear that altered expression levels affect overall mitoribosome levels. However at present, it is unclear if it at the level of assembly or stability of the large mitoribosome subunit. The decrease in the 16S rRNA suggests perhaps a defect in the assembly of the large subunit. This is correlates with previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A defective large subunit of the mitoribosome is thus consistent with the impairment of translational observed when the loss of Mrpl44.</p>
<p>As putative RNase III protein, whether Mrpl44 has a role in RNA processing remains unclear. The mitochondrial infantile cardiomyopathy caused by MRPL44 mutation in humans has been localized to the p.L156R residue within the RNase III domain [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Comparative analysis of MRPL44 to the solved RNase III structure of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aeolicus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] suggests that L156R is not involved in RNA binding, but potentially important for maintaining protein structure [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It was predicted that the mutation causes incorrect folding of MRPL44 and thus reduced expression. This, unfortunately, does not inform us of the function of the RNase III of Mrpl44. However, it clearly indicates the importance of this protein for mitochondrial function. It is quite possible that other mutations that impart partial loss of function, rather than just affect expression levels, may contribute to other mitochondrial syndromes.</p>
<p>Given the structural similarities between Mrpl44 and RNase III in bacteria, we hypothesized that it might exist in dimeric form. Our data indicates that Mrpl44 may indeed form dimers or multimers. The key question is whether Mrpl44 has a role in the processing of dsRNAs like all other RNase III proteins. The associations with mitochondrial RNAs that we observed are consistent with a potential function in RNA processing. A possible role of Mrpl44 could be in the regulation or maturation of mtDNA-encoded RNA products. While bioinformatics analysis showed that the critical residues for RNase activity are missing in mammalian Mrpl44 [<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134326.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], whether this is truly enzymatically dead remains to be determined. More detailed characterization of the Mrpl44 interacting factors or the analysis of mitochondrial-wide RNA processing products in Mrpl44 mutant cells may be illuminating. Regardless, given the implications on mitochondrial infantile cardiomyopathy, further investigations into the function of Mrpl44 are clearly warranted.</p>
