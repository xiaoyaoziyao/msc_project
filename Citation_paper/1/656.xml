        <p>The NHERF (Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger regulatory factor) family has been proposed to play a key role in regulating transmembrane protein localization and retention at the plasma membrane. Due to the high homology between the family members, potential functional compensations have been a concern in sorting out the function of individual NHERF numbers. Here, we studied <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> NRFL-1 (C01F6.6) (nherf-like protein 1), the sole <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> orthologue of the NHERF family, which makes worm a model with low genetic redundancy of NHERF homologues. Integrating bioinformatic knowledge of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> proteins into yeast two-hybrid scheme, we identified NRFL-1 as an interactor of AAT-6, a member of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> AAT (amino acid transporter) family. A combination of GST pull-down assay, localization study, and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the binding and characterized the PDZ interaction. AAT-6 localizes to the luminal membrane even in the absence of NRFL-1 when the worm is up to four-day old. A fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis suggested that NRFL-1 immobilizes AAT-6 at the luminal membrane. When the <italic>nrfl-1</italic> deficient worm is six-day or older, in contrast, the membranous localization of AAT-6 is not observed, whereas AAT-6 tightly localizes to the membrane in worms with NRFL-1. Sorting out the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> NHERF protein, we found that NRFL-1, a PDZ-interactor of AAT-6, is responsible for the immobilization and the age-dependent maintenance of AAT-6 on the intestinal luminal membrane.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Proper localization and maintenance of transmembrane proteins in the plasma membrane are essential for appropriate cellular function. Transmembrane proteins often participate in a functional macromolecular complex with other transmembrane or membrane-associated proteins. One of the mechanisms regulating such protein localization and complex formation is via scaffold proteins that possess single or multiple protein-protein interaction domains and serve as scaffold to assemble and/or stabilize proteins. Among the most commonly encountered protein-protein interaction modules is the PDZ (Post-Synaptic Density-95/Discs Large/Zonula Occludens-1) domain. Typically, PDZ domains achieve selective bindings by recognizing the carboxyl terminal four to seven residues of target proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Harris1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Tonikian1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The mammalian NHERF (Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger regulatory factor) family, which consists of NHERF1, NHERF2, PDZK1 and IKEPP, is a family of PDZ proteins. NHERF1 and NHERF2 have two PDZ domains in tandem, whereas PDZK1 and IKEPP have four tandem PDZ domains. They have overlapping tissue and subcellular distributions; the four members are found in the brush border membrane of the intestine and the renal proximal tubule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Donowitz1">[4]</xref>. The highly homologous primary structures of their PDZ domains allow them to share some of the target proteins such as CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Wang1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Wang2">[7]</xref>, NHE3 (sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Weinman1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Zachos1">[10]</xref> and organic solute transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Anzai1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Noshiro1">[13]</xref>. This redundancy in expression profile and interaction, consequently yielding potential functional compensations between the family members, has made it difficult to separate the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of individual NHERF family proteins. Indeed, deletion of <italic>nherf</italic> genes in mouse associates with mild phenotypic changes; NHERF1-null male mice develop healthy but females show increased mortality or weakness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Morales1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Shenolinkar1">[15]</xref>; NHERF2 or PDZK1-deficient mice appear normal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Broere1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Kocher1">[17]</xref>. Only recently, researchers have started addressing this issue by generating multiple-gene knockout animals. Broere et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Broere1">[16]</xref> and Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Singh1">[18]</xref> suggested that the NHERF family members play differential, rather than compensatory, roles in CFTR regulation. This observation seems inconsistent with findings from the single-knockout studies as the knockout animals would demonstrate more noticeable phenotypes if no or little compensations take place.</p>
      <p>To better understand the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of scaffold proteins of NHERF family members, we looked at <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> NRFL-1 (C01F6.6) (nherf-like protein 1). Because NRFL-1 is the single worm orthologue of NHERF family, studies in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> should be less susceptible to the redundancy problem that we encounter in the mammalian NHERF family. In the present study, NRFL-1 was identified as a binding partner of AAT-6 (T11F9.4) (amino acid transporter 6). AAT-6 is one of the transporters with PDZ-binding motif in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> AAT (amino acid transporter) family that consists of nine genes. This family is closely homologous to the mammalian SLC7 family of amino acid transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Veljkovic1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Veljkovic2">[20]</xref>. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> is a transparent model organism amenable to genetic manipulation and live-animal imaging. Taking advantage of these properties, we examined the role of PDZ interaction in the localization of AAT-6 in the plasma membrane. Similar to NHERF-mediated interactions in polarized cell lines such as OK cells and MDCK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Cha1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Haggie1">[22]</xref>, we show that NRFL-1 scaffolds AAT-6 to be less mobile in the plasma membrane through a PDZ interaction in living worm. Besides, as an age-associated property of NHERF-related protein, NRFL-1 is found to be responsible for the retention of AAT-6 on the intestinal luminal membrane in aged but not in young worm, suggesting a protective role of NRFL-1 against the deterioration of membranous localization AAT-6 with age.</p>

Next, the proteins were screened for intestinal expression because our preliminary expression analysis suggested that AAT-6 is expressed in the intestine. Expression data sets were provided by WormBase and NEXTDB (The Nematode Expression Data Base; nematode.lab.nig.ac.jp/). Sixteen proteins were selected as intestinal PDZ proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043050-t001">Table 1</xref>). For candidates with multiple splice variants such as C01F6.6, we sub-grouped the variants in terms of PDZ domain identity. The variants are classified into the same sub-group if the variants are identical with respect to the number and the primary structures of their PDZ domains (e.g., “single-domain” and “double-domain” groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). For each sub-group, one of the variants was tested for potential interaction. Each of the sixteen candidates (prey) was examined for potential interaction with the AAT-6 <italic>C</italic>-terminus tail (bait) in the yeast two-hybrid system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Fields1">[25]</xref>. Through the matching process, C01F6.6a appeared strongly positive and so was C01F6.6b but to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043050-t001">Table 1</xref>). C01F6.6a (NRFL-1) was, thus, subjected to further investigation.</p>

        <p>The <italic>nrfl-1</italic> gene encodes C01F6.6a in ten exons. The <italic>nrfl-1</italic> mRNA is trans-spliced to the spliced leader SL1 with two bases of cytosine between the spliced leader and the start codon (yk1663b04, NEXTDB). The 3′UTR contains a putative polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, 15 nucleotides upstream of the poly-A tail (yk1651h10, NEXTDB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Reciprocal BLAST searches against worm proteins using the NHERF family protein sequences as queries also found NRFL-1 as the most related <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> protein. This bidirectional homology assessment suggested that NRFL-1 is a <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> orthologue of the NHERF family proteins. Individual NRFL-1 PDZ domains were compared with the domains of NHERF1 and NHERF2.

        <title>NRFL-1 Mainly Binds AAT-6 with PDZ II Domain</title>
        <p>To analyze further the interaction between AAT-6 and NRFL-1 found in the yeast two-hybrid matching, we first tested the involvement of AAT-6 <italic>C</italic>-terminal PDZ binding motif (-T-R-M) in the interaction. The yeast two-hybrid and the GST pull-down assay demonstrated that the deletion of the PDZ binding motif (-T-R-M) abolished the interaction of AAT-6 with NRFL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>), showing its participation in the interaction. Next, to identify which PDZ domain of NRFL-1 is responsible for the interaction, we disrupted the PDZ domains of NRFL-1 by introducing mutations into the conserved carboxylate-binding loop: G26A/Y27A for PDZ I, E154A/F155A for PDZ II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Doyle1">[27]</xref>. When both domains were mutated, the mutant was unable to bind with GST-AAT-6, further confirming the involvement of PDZ interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The mutation in PDZ I alone retained the binding, whereas the mutation in PDZ II alone greatly impaired the binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Collectively, the <italic>C</italic>-terminus of AAT-6 preferentially binds to the PDZ II domain of NRFL-1.</p>

However, neither of the variant markers matched. This observation motivated us to consider the possibility that the NRFL-1 protein is post-translationally modified. To test the idea, we used phosphatase inhibitors to inhibit endogenous phosphatases and examined the expected band-shift due to dephosphorylation by incubating the fresh worm lysate at 37°C in the presence or absence of the phosphatase inhibitors. In the absence of the inhibitors, the bands gradually shifted to a position which corresponded to that of the recombinant C01F6.6a marker toward the end of inclubation, while the bands largely stayed at the original position in the presence of the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>). This migration shift likely reflected progressive dephosphorylations of NRFL-1 and/or removal of modifications of NRFL-1 which is mediated by a separate protein in phosphorylation-dependent manner. The ∼72 kDa band, which was dominant <italic>in vivo</italic>, was, thus, due to posttranslational modifications of NRFL-1.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In splice variants of NRFL-1, the double-domain isoform was identified as the dominant <italic>nrfl-1</italic> gene product in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g003">Fig. 3F and G</xref>). We found that AAT-6, a member of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> AAT (amino acid transporter) family (an orthologue of the mammalian SLC7 family), binds to the PDZ II domain of NRFL-1. In mammals, it has been shown that the PDZ binding motif -D-S/T-X-L has particularly high affinity to the PDZ I domains of NHERF1 and NHERF2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Hall1">[32]</xref>. In contrast, the PDZ binding motif (-C-T-R-M) of AAT-6 preferentially binds to the PDZ II domain of NRFL-1 which is the less homologous to the PDZ domains of mammalian NHERF1 and NHERF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043050.s004">Table S1</xref>). It is interesting that the PDZ II domain of NRFL-1 may be more adapted to ligands relatively uncommon for mammalian NHERFs such as amino acid transporters.</p>
      <p>Immunoblot analysis revealed that NRFL-1 is multiply-phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>), similar to NHERF1 which is constitutively phosphorylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Hall2">[33]</xref>. Phosphorylation of NHERF1 has various consequences in its function and localization. Phosphorylated NHERF1 is more localized in the cytoplasm rather than to the plasma membrane and has weaker affinity to ligands such as CFTR, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, and β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Voltz1">[34]</xref>. Phosphorylation of NHERF1 regulates the intramolecular interaction in which the <italic>C</italic>-terminus of NHERF1, which also constitutes a PDZ-binding motif, binds to the second PDZ domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Li1">[35]</xref>. While the significance of phosphorylation in NRFL-1 is left to future studies, it is possible that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of NRFL-1 have some functional relevance through the regulation of protein-protein interactions and macromolecule complex building.</p>
      <p>The advantage of <italic>C. elegans</italic> NRFL-1 in the study of PDZ scaffold is that NRFL-1 is the single worm orthologue of NHERF family, so that the studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> should be less susceptible to the redundancy problem which we encounter in mammals.

The viability of the <italic>nrfl-1</italic> mutants is an obvious advantage because we are able to study a NHERF-related protein throughout development in a system with low genetic redundancy.</p>
      <p>In this study we found that NRFL-1 regulates AAT-6 in two aspects: maintenance of its membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043050.s002">S2</xref>) and immobilization on the luminal membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Until early breeding stage (up to four-day old), AAT-6 stays on the membrane with or without NRFL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043050.s002">S2</xref>), and NRFL-1 immobilizes AAT-6 on the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). In late breeding stage (six-day old), in contrast, NRFL-1 is crucial in retaining AAT-6 at the apical membrane; the absence of NRFL-1 causes the internalization of AAT-6. In further advanced age (ten-day old), the deterioration of the membranous localization of AAT-6 occurs in the majority of worms carrying NRFL-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043050.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), suggesting that such deterioration is a natural course. Localization index, which measures how tightly AAT-6 is membrane-localized, declines with age in the <italic>nrfl-1</italic>mutants; it is not the case with the control worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g005">Fig. 5C and S</xref>2C). This suggests that a loss of AAT-6 membranous localization is accelerated with age and that NRFL-1 protects AAT-6 from such aging process. When the interaction with NHERF proteins is disrupted, some membrane proteins are susceptible to internalization and degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Cao1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Li2">[43]</xref>. As for NRFL-1/AAT-6 complex, the protein amount of AAT-6 remains unchanged in <italic>nrfl-1</italic>;<italic>aat-6</italic> worm even at six days old, suggesting that the loss of NRFL-1 does not cause the degradation of AAT-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Without NRFL-1, AAT-6 somehow stays intracellularly without being degraded. While the mechanism underlying age-dependent maintenance of AAT-6 on the intestinal luminal membrane has yet to be clarified, NRFL-1 with two PDZ domains may further bind unidentified proteins essential to keep AAT-6 in the intestinal apical membrane in aged phase.</p>
      <p>Taking advantage of the amenability of live-animal imaging in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, a FRAP analysis was applied to the NRFL-1/AAT-6 complex <italic>in vivo</italic> to further examined the role of NRFL-1 in the maintenance of AAT-6 in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first report to apply FRAP analysis <italic>in vivo</italic> to the study of PDZ interactions involving NHERF proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Cha1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Wheeler1">[44]</xref>. In the presence of NRFL-1, the fluorescence recovery of AAT-6 reaches to plateau in 30 s, leaving ∼95% of immobilized fraction. The absence of NRFL-1 results in an increased fluorescence recovery of ∼35% in 5 min, suggesting that AAT-6 is immobilized by NRFL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043050-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). For human parathyroid hormone receptor PTH1R, it was proposed that the receptor in the plasma membrane is immobilized by NHERF1 anchored to the actin cytoskelton through ERM (Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Wheeler1">[44]</xref>. The distribution of the worm orthologue ERM-1 completely overlaps with NRFL-1: the excretory canal and the luminal surface of the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Gbel1">[45]</xref>, where ERM-1 participates in brush border formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Gloerich1">[46]</xref>. The physical association between NRFL-1 and ERM-1 in a yeast two-hybrid experiment has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Li3">[47]</xref>. Recently, it was revealed that ERM proteins recognize the <italic>C</italic>-terminal 13 residues of NHERF1 or 2 for interaction and that the binding sequence is characterized as Motif-1: MDWXXXXX(L/I)FXX(L/F), where X denotes any amino acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Terasaki1">[48]</xref>. NRFL-1 has a <italic>C</italic>-terminal 13-residue similar to Motif-1: MSLNEKYQLVSNM, underpinning the yeast two-hybrid finding. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that NRFL-1 immobilizes AAT-6 through the interaction with ERM proteins such as ERM-1.</p>
      <p>The NHERF-interacting CFTR, whose <italic>D</italic>-value (diffusion coefficient) was estimated to be 0.99±0.09×10<sup>−10</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s, has a half time recovery of 1–1.2 min for a bleached circle of ∼5 µm diameter in MDCK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Haggie1">[22]</xref>. In contrast, AAT-6 does not reach a 50% recovery in 5 min of observation for ∼2 µm bleached circle. AAT-6 shows a much slower recovery in worm than CFTR does in MDCK cells. Our experiment was performed at 25°C, a physiological temperature for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, whereas the CFTR diffusion was measured at 37°C. The temperature is a considerable determinant of molecular motility since the viscosity heavily depends on the temperature. A temperature hike from room temperature (∼25°C) to 37°C observes two to four-fold increases in the diffusion coefficients of plasma membrane proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor in MDCK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Meder1">[49]</xref>. Differences in the apical surface architecture between MDCK cell and worm intestinal epithelium should also be taken into account. Estimating from cross-section images, worms have 4–6 microvilli in a 1-µm segment of the intestinal brush border <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-Altun1">[50]</xref>, whereas in MDCK cells there are as few as 1 or 2 microvilli in 1 µm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0043050-MariscalGonzalez1">[51]</xref>. The abundance of microvilli in worm is likely a topological constraint hindering molecular diffusions along the membrane. Otherwise, though it is not mutually exclusive, yet unidentified molecules which limit the motility may be involved in this phenomenon.</p>
      <p>In summary, we found that NRFL-1, the sole <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> orthologue of mammalian NHERF family, is crucial in protecting AAT-6 from the decrement in the intestinal luminal membrane associated with aging as well as in immobilizing the transporter on the membrane. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, which is transparent and has a fast life cycle, facilitated observations of the age-associated change in localization of a transporter supported by scaffold protein. Since NRFL-1 has two PDZ domains, it likely has more binding partners. There might be interactors which interplay with NRFL-1 in an age-dependent manner.</p>

The bacteria were lysed by sonication in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). The lysate was centrifuged at 5,000×<italic>g</italic> for 15 minutes to remove debris. The supernatant was further ultracentrifuged at 353,000×<italic>g</italic> for 15 minutes. The supernatant was applied to a chromatography column (Poly-Prep Chromatography Columns, BioRad) packed with Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare).

The final product (GST-AAT-6), supplemented with glycerol (final concentration 10% (v/v)), was stored at −80°C until use.

        <p>The construct for NRFL-1 was prepared in two steps. The cDNA for full-length wild type NRFL-1 was first ligated into p3×FLAG-myc-CMV-24 (Sigma-Aldrich) as a HindIII-NotI fragment. The fragment including 3×FLAG coding region and NRFL-1 cDNA was next ligated into pGEX-6P-1 as a BamHI-XhoI fragment. The construct was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 to express the recombinant protein GST-3×FLAG-NRFL-1. Only a small fraction of the recombinant protein (∼5%) appeared soluble. The supernatant after ultracentrifuge, which contained the soluble fraction of the protein, was GST-affinity purified as described above. For GST-tag removal, the GST fusion protein was treated with PreScisson protease (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.01% NP-40 at 4°C overnight. The resulting 3×FLAG-NRFL-1 protein remained soluble and was stored at −80°C until use. For the constructs of NRFL-1 mutants (G26A/Y27A, E154A/F155A, and G26A/Y27A/E154A/F155A), the conventional PCR-based mutagenesis technique was applied using pGEX-6P-1 3×FLAG-NRFL-1 as a template.
