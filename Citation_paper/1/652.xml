      <abstract>
        <p>Caytaxin is a highly-conserved protein, which is encoded by the <italic>Atcay/ATCAY</italic> gene. Mutations in <italic>Atcay</italic>/<italic>ATCAY</italic> have been identified as causative of cerebellar disorders such as the rare hereditary disease Cayman ataxia in humans, generalized dystonia in the dystonic (dt) rat, and marked motor defects in three ataxic mouse lines. While several lines of evidence suggest that Caytaxin plays a critical role in maintaining nervous system processes, the physiological function of Caytaxin has not been fully characterized. In the study presented here, we generated novel specific monoclonal antibodies against full-length Caytaxin to examine endogenous Caytaxin expression in wild type and <italic>Atcay</italic> mutant mouse lines. Caytaxin protein is absent from brain tissues in the two severely ataxic <italic>Atcay<sup>jit</sup></italic> (<italic>jittery</italic>) and <italic>Atcay<sup>swd</sup></italic> (<italic>sidewinder</italic>) mutant lines, and markedly decreased in the mildly ataxic/dystonic <italic>Atcay<sup>ji-hes</sup></italic> (<italic>hesitant</italic>) line, indicating a correlation between Caytaxin expression and disease severity. As the expression of wild type human Caytaxin in mutant <italic>sidewinder</italic> and <italic>jittery</italic> mice rescues the ataxic phenotype, Caytaxin’s physiological function appears to be conserved between the human and mouse orthologs. Across multiple species and in several neuronal cell lines Caytaxin is expressed as several protein isoforms, the two largest of which are caused by the usage of conserved methionine translation start sites. The work described in this manuscript presents an initial characterization of the Caytaxin protein and its expression in wild type and several mutant mouse models. Utilizing these animal models of human Cayman Ataxia will now allow an in-depth analysis to elucidate Caytaxin’s role in maintaining normal neuronal function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Caytaxin is a neuron-restricted protein encoded by the gene <italic>Atcay/ATCAY.</italic> Mutations in the human <italic>ATCAY</italic> gene cause the rare neurological disorder Cayman ataxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>, which is a congenital, non-progressive form of cerebellar ataxia characterized by marked motor defects and mental retardation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-KumarAK1">[2]</xref>. While Caytaxin expression has not been characterized in individuals with Cayman ataxia, mutations in <italic>Atcay</italic>/<italic>ATCAY</italic> are predicted to decrease or eliminate Caytaxin expression within the nervous system. Despite this evidence, which suggests a critical role for Caytaxin in normal brain activity and motor control, the function of the Caytaxin gene protein product remain unknown.</p>
      <p>Three ataxic mouse mutants have been identified that harbor unique mutations in the mouse homologue of <italic>ATCAY</italic> (<italic>Atcay)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>. These mutations all arose spontaneously in different regions of the gene, and resulted in similar but distinct phenotypes. <italic>Atcay<sup>ji</sup></italic> (<italic>jittery</italic>) is caused by a B1 element (retrotransposon) insertion in exon 4 of the <italic>Atcay</italic> gene, which is predicted to result in a reduction of mRNA levels and truncation of Caytaxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>. Mice homozygous for the mutation display severe trunk and limb ataxia which hinders their ability to mate and access food and water, often resulting in starvation and dehydration soon after weaning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-DeOme1">[3]</xref>. <italic>Atcay<sup>swd</sup></italic> (<italic>sidewinder</italic>) mutants are phenotypically similar to <italic>jittery</italic> but harbor a 2 base pair deletion in exon 5 of <italic>Atcay,</italic> which, is expected to produce a truncated non-functional protein due to a frame shift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>. This also leads to a drastic reduction in mRNA, likely due to nonsense-mediated decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>. <italic>Atcay<sup>ji-hes</sup></italic> (<italic>hesitant</italic>) mutant mice differ from <italic>jittery</italic> and <italic>sidewinder</italic> in that they display a mild form of ataxia accompanied by dystonia. These mice have a normal life span and are able to reproduce and rear offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Kapfhamer1">[4]</xref>. <italic>hesitant</italic> mutant mice are hypomorphs due to an intracisternal A particle (IAP) insertion in intron 1 of <italic>Atcay</italic>, which affects splicing. Similarly, the mutant <italic>dystonic</italic> rat strain (SD-dt:JFL) also harbors an IAP insertion in intron 1 of the <italic>Atcay</italic> rat homologue, resulting in a marked reduction of cerebellar Caytaxin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Xiao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Lorden1">[6]</xref>. While these known rodent and human <italic>Atcay/ATCAY</italic> mutations differ in gene location and how they affect the genomic sequence and its protein product, each results in pronounced defects in motor coordination. Although all mouse <italic>Atcay</italic> mutations are predicted to decrease or eliminate Caytaxin protein expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>, the effects of different mutations on Caytaxin expression has not been characterized.</p>
      <p>While the role of Caytaxin in the nervous system remains poorly understood, protein homology mapping has identified highly conserved domains that may be critical for its function. The most notable of which is the BNIP-2/Cdc42GAP homology (BCH) domain, which is involved in a wide range of cellular functions through its interaction with small GTPases, such as GAPs and GEFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Zhou1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Low1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Zhou2">[9]</xref>. Phylogenetic analysis of various vertebrate Caytaxin orthologs indicates a high level of amino acid conservation within the BCH domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Gupta1">[10]</xref>, which suggests a potentially shared physiological function across species. Several studies have characterized Caytaxin protein-protein interactions, which depend on its conserved domains and which may provide clues into its physiological role within the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Aoyama1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Buschdorf1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Buschdorf2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Grelle1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Itoh1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Buschdorf <italic>et al.</italic> have identified both peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase (Pin1) and kidney-type glutaminase (KGA) as proteins that directly bind Caytaxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Buschdorf1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Buschdorf2">[13]</xref>. Pin1, a factor that is known to affect structure, phosphorylation status, and stability of proteins involved in cell cycle control, interacts with the Caytaxin protein during neuronal differentiation through MEK2 (MAPK kinase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Buschdorf1">[12]</xref>. Additionally, Aoyama <italic>et al.</italic> have shown that kinesin light chain (KLC) directly binds and transports Caytaxin along axons towards distal regions of neurons by a microtubule- and kinesin-dependent mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Aoyama1">[11]</xref>. Investigations into the localization of Caytaxin protein have confirmed preliminary results by Bomar <italic>et al.</italic> that predicted Caytaxin expression predominantly in the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Buschdorf2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Hayakawa1">[16]</xref>, and also found Caytaxin protein concentrated at presynaptic sites of GABAergic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Buschdorf2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Hayakawa1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While these data suggest that Caytaxin plays an important role at synapses and/or during neuronal differentiation, it remains unclear how mutations in the <italic>Atcay</italic> gene affect the ability of Caytaxin to properly function and maintain normal motor control. To date, there has been no published characterization of Caytaxin expression in mutant <italic>Atcay</italic> mouse models that provide insight into the function of Caytaxin <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>In advancing toward an understanding of how Caytaxin normally functions within the nervous system, we sought to characterize Caytaxin expression in the <italic>sidewinder, jittery,</italic> and <italic>hesitant</italic> mouse lines using novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for Caytaxin. We also investigated the potentially conserved function of Caytaxin by rescuing the ataxic phenotype in transgenic <italic>sidewinder</italic> and <italic>jittery</italic> mice through over-expression of human <italic>ATCAY</italic>. Through the use of mouse models, which display an assayable phenotype resulting from mutations in <italic>Atcay</italic>, we demonstrate that a more link between Caytaxin expression and function can be established. Further investigation into motor defects in these mouse models represents a promising approach in elucidating the physiological function of Caytaxin within the nervous system.</p>

        <title>Monoclonal Antibodies Generated Against Full-length Caytaxin Detect Multiple Protein Bands</title>
        <p>To examine Caytaxin protein expression, mAbs were generated against full-length human Caytaxin protein (described in Materials and Methods). A human Caytaxin fusion protein was expressed and purified from bacteria, which was subsequently used as an immunogen in mice to ultimately generate anti-Caytaxin secreting hybridoma cell lines. Using SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and a Western blot-based screen, whole brain lysate from wild type C57BL/6J mice were probed with hybridoma cell line supernatants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050570.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), and compared to polyclonal antiserum that was obtained from the immunized mouse used for the generation of hybridoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050570.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, lane 2). This polyclonal antiserum reacts with three distinct protein bands ranging in size from 50–60 kDa and an additional protein band of approximately 67 kDa. Hybridoma cell line supernatants 1E2, 4E3, and 8F4 all react with the same three 50–60 kDa protein bands, which are also detected by the polyclonal anti-Caytaxin antiserum, but did not react with the 67 kDa band (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050570.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, lanes 3–5). As none of the 3 independent mAbs recognizes this 67 kDa protein and as no transcripts potentially encoding a 67 kDa Caytaxin isoform have been detected or described, we assume that it represents an antigen that is recognized by the polyclonal antiserum and is not related to the Caytaxin protein.</p>
        <p>Based on their amino acid sequences, the calculated molecular weights for human and mouse Caytaxin are 42.12 kDa and 42.18 kDa, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Gasteiger1">[17]</xref>. The three protein bands, which are detected by the polyclonal antibody and the three selected hybridoma supernatants, have apparent molecular weights that are not only larger than 42.18 kDa, but appear as three distinct bands. The two larger protein species are 58 kDa and 55 kDa in apparent molecular size and the smallest protein band is around 50 kDa. Since all three of these bands were not recognized by control hybridoma supernatants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050570.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, lanes 6 &amp; 7), we hypothesized that the three selected hybridoma supernatants are specific for Caytaxin and detect three different Caytaxin isoforms. Thus, hybridoma cell lines 1E2, 4E3 and 8F4 were sub-cloned and further investigated as potential candidates for secreting antibodies specific for the Caytaxin protein.</p>

        <title>Caytaxin Protein Expression is Absent or Reduced in Homozygous Atcay Mouse Mutants</title>
        <p>We next sought to determine the specificity of our selected mAbs and to confirm that all three protein bands, detected by the hybridoma supernatants, represent Caytaxin protein. The mutant <italic>Atcay</italic> mouse lines, <italic>sidewinder</italic>, <italic>jittery</italic>, and <italic>hesitant</italic> each harbor unique mutations in the mouse <italic>Atcay</italic> gene, which were predicted to affect Caytaxin protein expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>. Homozygous <italic>jittery</italic> and <italic>sidewinder</italic> mutant mice display a severely ataxic phenotype (Movie S1) and were predicted to produce a truncated non-functional Caytaxin protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>. In contrast, homozygous <italic>hesitant</italic> mutant mice exhibit a mild ataxic/dystonic phenotype (Movie S2) and due to a defect in RNA processing, were expected to have a reduced level of Caytaxin protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>.</p>
        <p>A comparison of the Caytaxin protein expression pattern of wild type versus affected littermates from these mutant lines strongly suggests that all three protein bands detected by our mAbs are indeed Caytaxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The Western blot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> contains total brain lysates from wild type (wt/wt), heterozygous (<italic>swd</italic>/wt), and mutant (<italic>swd</italic>/<italic>swd</italic>) littermates from the <italic>sidewinder</italic> mouse line respectively. In wild type mice, all three putative Caytaxin protein isoforms are strongly expressed, but are absent in severely ataxic homozygous <italic>swd</italic>/<italic>swd</italic> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, lanes 1 &amp; 3). Caytaxin protein expression was decreased in heterozygous littermates, which harbor one normal allele but do not show signs of ataxia nor dystonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, lane 2). This result demonstrates that each of the three bands detected by our mAbs is Caytaxin protein.</p>

        <title>The Two Largest Caytaxin Isoforms Originate from Alternative Methionine Start Sites</title>
        <p>Western blot analyses consistently detect Caytaxin as three distinct protein isoforms in unique, species-specific patterns. Therefore, we tested whether these three Caytaxin protein isoforms are the result of either RNA splicing or co- or post-translational protein modifications. Potential protein modifications were predicted based on the amino acid sequences of both mouse and human Caytaxin using online tools to search sites vulnerable for sumoylation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.abgent.com/tools/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.abgent.com/tools/</ext-link>), glycosylation, sulfation, phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Blom1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-AoLi1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Monigatti1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Kiemer1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Johansen1">[22]</xref>.

        <p>To elucidate the origin of the multiple Caytaxin protein isoforms, we employed a mammalian <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation protein expression system. Using this system eliminates most post-translational protein modifications or differential RNA splicing processes, thus identifying only native unmodified Caytaxin protein. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcripts were generated from plasmid constructs containing the entire mouse or human <italic>Atcay/ATCAY</italic> open reading frame under control of an SP6 promoter.

        <p>These results, combined with the high similarity of the protein sequences in various Caytaxin orthologs, suggest that the origin of the protein isoforms resides in the DNA/mRNA or protein sequence. An amino acid alignment of human and mouse Caytaxin protein sequences revealed two highly conserved methionine residues (Met1 and Met10) at the predicted amino terminus separated by 8 amino acids (approximately 5.5 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Both ATG codons adhere to Kozak consensus sequence predictions and could account for two separate protein translation start sites. Given the consistency of expression and the conserved apparent molecular weight of the two largest protein isoforms, we sought to determine whether these methionine residues could both serve as protein translation start sites.</p>
        <p>Using site-directed mutagenesis, we created single and double nucleotide changes in the Met1 and Met10 methionine-encoding ATG codons in mouse <italic>Atcay</italic> cDNA by converting them to ACG codons (threonine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Each mutation was designed to abolish the ability of the respective methionine residue(s) to serve as (a) translation start site(s), thereby resulting in the absence of the corresponding protein band(s). Three mutant <italic>Atcay</italic> cDNA constructs (Met1Thr, Met10Thr, and the double mutant Met1+10Thr) were tested in the coupled transcription/translation system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), with wild type mouse <italic>Atcay</italic> cDNA serving as a positive control. Caytaxin protein translated from the Met1Thr construct (mutation of the first methionine Met1) abolished the largest Caytaxin band, as expected, however only the second largest protein band remained visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, lane 3). Translation from the Met10Thr construct (mutation of the second methionine Met10) produced a Caytaxin product lacking only the second largest Caytaxin band. However, the Met10Thr mutation was also accompanied by an upshift of the size of the third protein species compared to the corresponding band in wild type <italic>Atcay</italic> cDNA construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, lane 4 compared to lane 1). Finally, consistent with results from the single-mutant constructs, the construct harboring both mutations Met1+10Thr failed to produce any detectable Caytaxin protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, lane 5).</p>
        <p>Common non-methionine start sites, leucine (Leu) and valine (Val), downstream of the second conserved methionine were identified as potential alternative start codons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Kozak1">[23]</xref>, and were also examined (Leu24, Val34, Leu37, and Val41). Similar to methods used to test Met1 and Met10, point mutations were created to disrupt each potential non-methionine start site and the cDNA was processed <italic>in vitro</italic> to observe the resultant translated protein. While the point mutations did have some effect on the apparent molecular weight and/or intensity of this third Caytaxin protein band, none of the sites tested could be confirmed as a starting amino acid of the third variable isoform (data not shown). Additionally, employing a similar method to cleave 58 residues from the C-terminus of Caytaxin, excluded whether the third isoform was produced from C-terminal protease cleavage of either of the larger isoforms as no effect on the third Caytaxin protein band was observed (data not shown).</p>

        <p>We found no significant differences in the ratio of each isoform relative to the others upon examination of Caytaxin protein expression in major brain regions from wild type mice (Fig.S2) or among different neuronal cell types. Therefore, we analyzed Caytaxin levels from postnatal day 1 throughout adulthood to examine whether the expression of the three isoforms is subject to regulation throughout postnatal development.</p>
        <p>Protein lysates were prepared from whole brains of wild type mice at various ages ranging from post-natal day 1 to 10 months, and analyzed by Western blots. Caytaxin protein levels were determined relative to tubulin protein expression from the same sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, A &amp; B). All Caytaxin protein isoforms were consistently expressed at comparable ratios at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Although amount of total Caytaxin varied somewhat between individual mice for most time points, a steady temporal pattern was maintained overall.

        <title>The Function of Mouse and Human Caytaxin is Conserved</title>
        <p>The Caytaxin family of proteins shares a high degree of amino acid sequence conservation, including a well-preserved BCH domain, which appears to play important roles in protein-protein interactions and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Zhou1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Low1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Zhou2">[9]</xref>. An amino acid alignment of the mouse and human Caytaxin protein sequences reveals a 91% overall sequence similarity and a 96% sequence similarity between BCH domains (not shown). This high degree of sequence homology suggests that the physiological function of mammalian Caytaxin proteins may also be conserved.</p>
        <p>To examine this hypothesis, we performed genetic complementation tests to assess the ability of human <italic>ATCAY</italic> DNA to rescue the severe ataxic phenotype of <italic>Atcay</italic> mouse mutants. Transgenic mice were generated that express a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) containing <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> chromosome 19 clone CTB-171N13, which includes the complete coding region for the human <italic>ATCAY</italic> gene and at least 20 kb of upstream sequence; this is expected to be sufficient to direct tissue-specific expression irrespective of insertion location. These mice were bred with the two severely ataxic lines <italic>sidewinder</italic> and <italic>jittery</italic> to obtain two different transgenic BAC lines homozygous for the respective mutant alleles and positive for two independent BAC integrations (<italic>swd</italic>/<italic>swd</italic> BAC<sup>+</sup> &amp; <italic>ji/ji</italic> BAC<sup>+</sup>). These mice did not express mouse Caytaxin, but over-expressed human Caytaxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes 3 &amp; 4) with no ectopic expression in non-neuronal organs, such as heart, lungs, liver, kidney, or spleen (data not shown). In lanes 3 &amp; 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g005">Figure 5</xref>, minor protein bands are visible and we attribute these additional bands to non-specific protein degradation that is caused by the overexpression of the Caytaxin protein. The pattern of the Caytaxin isoforms expressed from the BAC was consistent with the human Caytaxin protein pattern as detected in human neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, lane 2). However, the size of the Caytaxin protein from BAC transgenic mice was slightly larger than endogenous Caytaxin from human neuronal cell lines. This was caused by a duplication of exon 10 in human <italic>ATCAY</italic> DNA, likely during the bacterial cloning phase of the BAC (data not shown). This duplication of exon 10 results in an insertion of 9 amino acids at the C-terminus of Caytaxin, but does not affect the reading frame. As a preliminary mapping of the epitopes that are recognized by the anti-Caytaxin mAbs places them further upstream, this duplication should have no impact on the staining intensity in the Western blot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>.</p>

The experimental setup was designed to examine both motor coordination and learning functions, two major phenotypic aspects displayed by human individuals with Cayman ataxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-KumarAK1">[2]</xref>. We recorded the length of time that individual mice stayed on an accelerating rotating rod, with each mouse tested three times per day over a total of three days. Homozygous mutant mice that do not express the human <italic>ATCAY</italic> BAC are completely unable to coordinate grip, walk, or balance (Movies S1). Additionally, without special housing conditions and specific accommodations to allow access to food and water, these mice usually die after 3 weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Kapfhamer1">[4]</xref>. As <italic>swd</italic>/<italic>swd</italic> mutant mice are unable to stay on a static rod for the required 30 seconds prior to the start of the testing period, it was not possible to test their performance in this experimental paradigm.</p>
        <p>Results obtained from the rotarod tests confirmed our earlier phenotype observations. We detected no significant difference (p&gt;0.05 in each trial) in either motor coordination or learning and memory in <italic>swd</italic>/<italic>swd</italic> BAC<sup>+</sup> mice when compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). <italic>swd</italic>/<italic>swd</italic> BAC<sup>+</sup> mice were not only capable of maintaining their balance, but they were also able to adjust their balance when the rod began to accelerate. Their total time on the rotating rod was comparable to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). In addition, rotarod performance for both wild type and BAC-rescued mice significantly increased between the first and third day of testing, reflecting their ability to learn from previous testing experiences.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Individuals suffering from Cayman ataxia are homozygous for two mutations in the <italic>ATCAY</italic> gene and display marked motor and cognitive defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-KumarAK1">[2]</xref>. However it is unknown how these two mutations that are always found in all affected individuals affect protein expression and cause ataxia. Genetic data gathered from this rare disease have been instrumental in discovering Caytaxin, a neuronal protein important for normal nervous system function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-KumarAK1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Xiao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Nystuen1">[24]</xref>. While work has been published that characterizes Caytaxin protein localization and its interactions with other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Zhou1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Low1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Zhou2">[9]</xref>, the biological function of Caytaxin remains largely unknown.</p>
      <p>We report the use of monoclonal antibodies specific for Caytaxin to investigate Caytaxin protein expression in mutant <italic>Atcay</italic> mouse models. Our results demonstrate that mutations in the <italic>Atcay</italic> gene cause decreases in Caytaxin expression, and that the severity of ataxia is correlated with Caytaxin protein expression. Additionally, our data from transgenic <italic>Atcay</italic> mutant mice over-expressing the human <italic>ATCAY</italic> gene suggest that the high sequence homology between human and mouse Caytaxin also reflects a conservation of protein function.</p>
      <p>While two of our monoclonal antibodies are specific for Caytaxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), their utility is limited to detecting Caytaxin protein on Western blots. <italic>In vivo</italic> staining experiments indicated that the third anti-Caytaxin monoclonal antibody 4E3 might also cross-react with unidentified protein(s) and we therefore did not use this antibody for further analyses (data not shown). Previous reports utilized anti-Caytaxin polyclonal antibodies that were raised against small regions of the Caytaxin protein or antibodies against affinity-tagged Caytaxin. These reports found Caytaxin protein to be expressed as one or two bands on Western blots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Xiao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Aoyama1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Buschdorf1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Buschdorf2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Itoh1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Hayakawa1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Concepcion1">[25]</xref>, with the doublet hypothesized to be a result of protein post-translational modifications (PTM) or RNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Itoh1">[15]</xref>. Our analysis reveals that in one avian and several mammalian species, Caytaxin is actually expressed as three distinct isoforms of approximately 58, 55, and 50 kDa, which are all derived from a single transcript. Due to the small difference in size between these protein bands, complete resolution of all three Caytaxin isoforms requires large SDS-PAGE gels (∼10″ long separating gel), high acrylamide concentrations (10–12%), and a longer run-time at a constant current (15–30 mA). It may be for these reasons that the multiple isoforms of the Caytaxin protein have not been identified previously.</p>
      <p>Our initial investigation into the origin of these three Caytaxin isoforms revealed that Caytaxin is one of few proteins consisting of multiple isoforms that are generated by different methionine translational start sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g003">Fig. 3C &amp; D</xref>). This phenomenon is more often found in yeast proteins as well as in transcription factors and oncogenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Spotts1">[26]</xref> such as the cell-regulation gene c-Myc, which encodes three c-Myc protein isoforms originating from non-AUG and AUG codons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Hann1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Hann2">[28]</xref>. We identified two independent AUG start codons directly responsible for the production of the two larger Caytaxin isoforms. Although we were unable to identify the source of the smallest Caytaxin isoform, the results of our <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assays strongly suggest that it is not the result of mRNA splicing or processing. Further examination into the origin of the third variable isoform ruled out a third ATG start site, non-specific post-translational protease degradation, and specific carboxy-terminal cleavage of a larger Caytaxin protein species (data not shown).</p>
      <p>Common non-methionine start sites downstream of the second conserved methionine were also examined, but yielded inconclusive results (data not shown). Interestingly, the size of the smallest isoform varies between species, pointing to the possibility of proteolytic processing. Since the expression of the smallest isoform appears highly dependent on N-terminal Caytaxin sequence and the translation of the largest protein forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), we hypothesize that translation of this isoform depends on protein folding and/or the accessibility of specific protease cleavage sites during this folding process. The significance of three distinct proteins produced from a single transcript remains unknown. It will be of interest to elucidate whether the different Caytaxin protein isoforms differ in molecular function, protein-protein interactions, and/or subcellular localization. Once the nature of the third Caytaxin isoform has been revealed, it should be possible to introduce each isoform separately into transgenic mice and to analyze its individual ability to rescue Caytaxin loss-of function conditions.</p>
      <p>Assessment into whether expression of total Caytaxin protein is modulated during mouse postnatal development revealed consistent expression of individual isoforms, but variation in total protein levels from postnatal day 1 throughout adulthood. The peaks observed in Caytaxin protein expression throughout development closely follow developmental milestones and major mouse life events such as eye opening at Day 13, weaning at Day 21, and sexual maturity at 5 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, lanes 4–8) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Silver1">[29]</xref> – all of which induce changes in neuronal gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Kho1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Curley1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Meaney1">[32]</xref>. Reports from Hayakawa <italic>et al.</italic> also found disparity between mRNA levels and Caytaxin protein expression upon examination of <italic>Atcay</italic> mRNA levels throughout development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Hayakawa1">[16]</xref>; this indicates that our observed fluctuations in protein levels may be due to protein processing or degradation. Further investigation towards understanding the underlying pathways, which regulate the Caytaxin gene and its protein product, will be instrumental for pinpointing the role of this protein in nervous system development.</p>
      <p>Previous studies examining Caytaxin protein expression and phenotype in animal models have been limited to a single report in the dystonic rat line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Xiao1">[5]</xref>. Our group sought to expand the availability of representative models through the characterization of the three <italic>Atcay</italic> mutant mouse lines. While the level of severity of the ataxic phenotype has been described in these mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Bomar1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Kapfhamer1">[4]</xref>, there has been no published molecular characterization of Caytaxin that linked protein expression with the observed phenotype. We report that all three mice represent appropriate models for studying Caytaxin protein due to their unique mutations and corresponding Caytaxin expression. The <italic>jittery</italic> and <italic>sidewinder</italic> mice, which display a severe ataxic/dystonic phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Kapfhamer1">[4]</xref>, do not produce any Caytaxin protein. These mice usually die at an age of 3 to 4 weeks. If they are provided with softened, easily accessible food, they can survive considerably longer (data not shown). In contrast, the low levels of normal <italic>Atcay</italic> RNA expressed by the mildly ataxic/dystonic <italic>hesitant</italic> mice are sufficient for producing small amounts of normal Caytaxin protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). As described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Kapfhamer1">[4]</xref>, the phenotype of <italic>hesitant</italic> mice is affected by the genetic background and varies from barely noticeable ataxia to strikingly severe dystonia. Yet it is always considerably milder than in <italic>jittery</italic> or <italic>sidewinder</italic> mice. This was also observed in the complementation test when the <italic>hesitant</italic> allele was crossed onto a <italic>jittery</italic> background reducing its genetic contribution by half <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Kapfhamer1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This correlation between Caytaxin expression and phenotype severity is also observed in our humanized transgenic <italic>sidewinder</italic> and <italic>jittery</italic> mice, which overexpress human Caytaxin and no longer display early lethality or the severe ataxic phenotype. Based on our Western blot data and quantitative PCR analysis, these transgenic mice harbor ∼12 copies of the <italic>ATCAY</italic>-containing BAC and over-express human Caytaxin protein by approximately 11-fold compared to wild type controls (data not shown). This over-expression does not appear to result in any leaky expression in non-neuronal tissues (data not shown) or aberrant gain-of-function phenotype (Movie S3). However, whether Caytaxin expressed from a single copy of the <italic>ATCAY</italic> transgene is sufficient to rescue the ataxic phenotype, similar to <italic>sidewinder</italic> and <italic>jittery</italic> heterozygotes, remains unclear. It should be noted that while our transgenic mice express <italic>ATCAY</italic> containing a duplication of exon 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), the insertion occurs downstream of the BCH domain and does not affect the amino acid composition of this region (data not shown). However, it cannot be excluded that a small detrimental effect of the exon 10 duplication might be masked or compensated for by the overexpression of the protein. Conservation of the BCH domain appears to maintain Caytaxin function as these mice shown no indication of Cayman ataxia disease symptoms such as decreased motor coordination and learning functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-KumarAK1">[2]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
      <p>Data obtained from the three <italic>Atcay</italic> mutant mouse models indicate that Caytaxin is critical for normal nervous system function, but a relatively small Caytaxin expression level is sufficient for normal functionality. Heterozygous sidewinder mice display decreased levels of Caytaxin compared to homozygote wild type littermates with no obvious effect on phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050570-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The data from the <italic>hesitant</italic> mice suggest that even a 10-fold reduction in Caytaxin protein does not alter motor control, coordination, or survival post-weaning. This suggests that a minimum level of Caytaxin protein is required and sufficient for normal nervous system function. Additionally, analysis of the transgenic BAC mice indicates a conservation of Caytaxin function between human and mice. Phylogenetic and evolution mapping of BNIP proteins and the BCH domain of Caytaxin suggest that this protein may play a similar role within the nervous systems of many related vertebrates and potentially also invertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050570-Gupta1">[10]</xref>. Thus, the conserved function of Caytaxin may extend beyond <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> to include other Caytaxin orthologs as potential animal models.</p>
      <p>This report introduces new tools and methods to examine Caytaxin expression and function in complex animal systems. These approaches revealed that Caytaxin is actually expressed as multiple isoforms. It remains to be elucidated whether these multiple Caytaxin isoforms also impart multiple protein functionalities. Our report also represents the first study characterizing Caytaxin expression in mutant <italic>Atcay</italic> mice and demonstrates that the severity of their ataxia is correlated with Caytaxin protein levels. The conservation of function between human and mouse Caytaxin confirms the validity of mouse models for use in understanding the etiology of Cayman Ataxia as a human neurological condition.</p>

No. A-100) against both mouse Caytaxin from whole brain lysates and human Caytaxin from SH-SY5Y cell line lysates. Ubiquitin protein was included as a positive control (Mammalian Ubiquitin, Boston Biochem® Cat. No. U-100). Samples were run on a large, 22% urea gel, and detected with ECL. For determining the Caytaxin protein phosphorylation status, Caytaxin protein was immunoprecipitated from wild type mouse brain lysates using anti-Caytaxin monoclonal antibody 4E3 and Protein G beads. Samples were treated with lambda phosphatase (Lambda protein phosphatase, New England Biolabs, Cat. No. P0753S) at 200U/reaction, and then separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blot analysis using ECL. For a positive control, anti-S6 Kinase antibodies were used on insulin-stimulated HEK293 cell lysates.</p>

        <title>Rotarod</title>
        <p>Animals were required to perch on a stationary rod for approximately 30–60 seconds to accustom themselves to the environment. The animals that were comfortable staying on the rod were allowed to run with a constant speed of 5 rpm for approximately 60 seconds. Animals that fell after three trials with constant low speed rotation (2 rpm) were removed from the experiment. When test animals were able to stay on the rod for approximately 30 seconds, they were allowed to return to their home cage. Animals were trained again after at least 2 hours of rest or the following day. During the third training session, the rod was allowed to accelerate until the animal fell. Those mice that passed initial testing requirements underwent testing with 3 trials per day over 3 days, for a total of 9 runs. 7 wt/swd BAC<sup>-</sup> and 10 swd/swd wtBAC<sup>+</sup> mice were tested, ages 3–5 months with mixed gender, and time on the rod for each test animal was recorded.</p>
