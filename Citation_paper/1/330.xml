        <p>Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small protein that consists of 76 amino acids about 8.5 kDa. In ubiquitin conjugation, the ubiquitin is majorly conjugated on the lysine residue of protein by Ub-ligating (E3) enzymes. Three major enzymes participate in ubiquitin conjugation. They are – E1, E2 and E3 which are responsible for activating, conjugating and ligating ubiquitin, respectively. Ubiquitin conjugation in eukaryotes is an important mechanism of the proteasome-mediated degradation of a protein and regulating the activity of transcription factors. Motivated by the importance of ubiquitin conjugation in biological processes, this investigation develops a method, UbSite, which uses utilizes an efficient radial basis function (RBF) network to identify protein ubiquitin conjugation (ubiquitylation) sites. This work not only investigates the amino acid composition but also the structural characteristics, physicochemical properties, and evolutionary information of amino acids around ubiquitylation (Ub) sites. With reference to the pathway of ubiquitin conjugation, the substrate sites for E3 recognition, which are distant from ubiquitylation sites, are investigated. The measurement of F-score in a large window size (−20∼+20) revealed a statistically significant amino acid composition and position-specific scoring matrix (evolutionary information), which are mainly located distant from Ub sites. The distant information can be used effectively to differentiate Ub sites from non-Ub sites. As determined by five-fold cross-validation, the model that was trained using the combination of amino acid composition and evolutionary information performs best in identifying ubiquitin conjugation sites. The prediction sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are 65.5%, 74.8%, and 74.5%, respectively. Although the amino acid sequences around the ubiquitin conjugation sites do not contain conserved motifs, the cross-validation result indicates that the integration of distant sequence features of Ub sites can improve predictive performance. Additionally, the independent test demonstrates that the proposed method can outperform other ubiquitylation prediction tools.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small protein that consists of 76 amino acids about 8.5 kDa. Ubiquitin conjugation sites of protein (Ubiquitylation), which is an essential post-translational modification, is a sequential process that involves a group of enzymes known as E1 (activating enzyme), E2 (conjugating enzyme) and E3 (ubiquitin ligase). The ubiquitylation system is well-known for the selective degradation of serveral short-lived proteins in eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Hershko1">[1]</xref>. The attachment of a ubiquitin or poly-ubiquitin chains to proteins influences serveral cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, development, apoptosis, endocytosis, and cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Ou1">[2]</xref>. Ubiquitin is mostly conjugated on the lysine residue of a protein by Ub-ligating (E3) enzymes. The E3 ligase must be sufficiently specific and must act only on a defined subset of cellular targets to ensure signal fidelity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Hicke1">[3]</xref>. Another enzyme, E4, has that can stabilize and extend a poly-ubiquitin chain, has also been found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Gilon1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>With the development of high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the number of studies of the comprehensive identification ubiquitylated proteins and their conjugated sites is increasing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Peng1">[5]</xref>. UbiProt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Chernorudskiy1">[6]</xref> identified all experimentally verified ubiquitin-conjugated sites from the publicly literature. Some of the entries include information about enzyme data obtained by enzyme purification and isolation. The entries supply annotations of the ubiquitin-conjugated and the exact positions of the ubiquitin-conjugation sites. UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Boeckmann1">[7]</xref> is a comprehensively annotated protein database. Both experimentally validated and putative ubiquitin-conjugated annotations can be obtained from the post-translation modification annotations in the database.</p>
      <p>Experimental identifications of ubiquitin-conjugation sites on ubiquitylated proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> are the foundation for understanding the mechanisms of ubiquitination dynamics. However, these experiments are commonly time-consuming, labor-intensive and expensive. the <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of ubiquitin-conjugated sites with high predictive performance could be promising for preliminary analyses and could greatly reduce the number of potential targets that require further <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> confirmation. UbiPred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Tung1">[8]</xref> used an algorithm for mining informative physicochemical properties from protein sequences to train SVM-based ubiquitylation site prediction system. Based on leave-one-out cross-validation, the SVM model that is trained with 31 physicochemical properties was evaluated. It was found to improve the predictive accuracy from 72.1% to 84.4%. Recently, Radivojac <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Radivojac1">[9]</xref> have investigated that the sequence biases and structural preferences around known ubiquitination sites are similar to those of intrinsically disordered protein regions. Additionally, Radivojac <italic>et al.</italic> developed a random forest predictor of ubiquitination sites, UbPred, that could reach a balanced accuracy of 72%.</p>
      <p>Given the importance of ubiquitin conjugation in biological processes, this investigation presents a method, UbSite, in which an efficient radial basis function (RBF) network is utilized to identify protein ubiquitin conjugation (ubiquitylation) sites. The experimentally verified ubiquitylated proteins and ubiquitylation sites are collected from UbiProt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Chernorudskiy1">[6]</xref> and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Boeckmann1">[7]</xref>. Not only amino acid composition, but also structural characteristics, physicochemical properties, and evolutionary information of amino acids around the ubiquitylation (Ub) sites are investigated. With reference to the pathway of ubiquitin conjugation, which is by sequential process that involves a group of enzymes, E1 (activating enzyme), E2 (conjugating enzyme) and E3 (ubiquitin ligase), the distant sequence features of ubiquitylation sites for E3 recognition are investigated. A position specific scoring matrix (PSSM), which is generated by PSI-BLAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Altschul1">[10]</xref> search against a non-redundant database of protein sequences, is utilized to study the evolutionary information surround the ubiquitin conjugation sites. The constructed PSSM is regarded as a measure of residue conservation in a window of a given length. Based on the measurement of F-score in a large window size (−20∼+20), the statistically significant amino acid composition and evolutionary information, which are mainly located at positions distant from the ubiquitylation sites, can be utilized effectively to differentiate ubiquitylation sites from non-ubiquitylation sites. An evaluation of the trained models based on five-fold cross-validation revealed, that the prediction sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 65.5%, 74.8%, and 74.5%, respectively. The independent test demonstrates shows that UbSite outperform previous ubiquitylation prediction tools.</p>

      <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017331-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, the proposed approach, UbSite, is composed of three major analytical steps - data collection and preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training and evaluation. This investigation comprehensively analyzes the structural characteristics and physicochemical properties that surround the ubiquitin conjugation sites. The details of the analysis are described as follows.</p>

        <title>Data collection and preprocessing</title>
        <p>Experimentally confirmed ubiquitin conjugation sites are collected from UbiProt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Chernorudskiy1">[6]</xref> and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Boeckmann1">[7]</xref>. UbiProt consists of 158 experimentally confirmed ubiquitin-conjugation sites. Then, we extracted the sequences from release 57.0 of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot if the sequences are annotated as ‘ubiquitin’ in the ‘MOD_RES’ fields. We also removed the sites that are annotated as “by similarity”, “potential” or “probable”. A total of 337 entries are annotated as ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, and they include 416 ubiquitylation sites. After removing the redundant data from UbiProt and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, a total of 442 experimental ubiquitylation sites associated with 350 ubiquitylated proteins are obtained. In this work, the 442 experimental ubiquitylation sites are regarded as the positive dataset.</p>
        <p>To prevent overestimation of the predictive performance, homologous sequences are removed from the training data by using a window size of 2<italic>n</italic>+1 for ubiquitylation sites. With reference to the reduction process in MASA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Shien1">[11]</xref>, two ubiquitylated protein sequences with more than 30% identity were defined as homologous sequences. Then, two homologous sequences were specified to re-align the fragment sequences using a window length of 2<italic>n</italic>+1, centered on the ubiquitylation sites using BL2SEQ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Tatusova1">[12]</xref>. For two fragment sequences with 100% identity, when the ubiquitylation sites in the two proteins are in the same positions, only one site was kept. The homologous negative data were also reduced by using the same approach.</p>
        <p>With respect to classification, the predictive performance of the trained models may be overestimated because of the over-fitting of a training set. To estimate the real predictive performance, the experimental ubiquitylation sites, whose annotated dates are after April 4 2006, are selected as the independent test set. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0017331-t001">Table 1</xref>, the data in the non-homologous training set include 385 positive sites (ubiquitylation) and 12582 negative sites (non-ubiquitylation) in 301 ubiquitylated proteins. The data of the non-homologous independent test set include 57 positive sites and 3502 negative sites in 49 ubiquitylated proteins. Following the evaluation by five-fold cross-validation, the trained model with the highest accuracy was further evaluated based on independent test data. The independent test sets were utilized to test not only the proposed method but also the previously proposed ubiquitylation prediction tools, UbiPred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Tung1">[8]</xref> and UbPred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Radivojac1">[9]</xref>.</p>

          <p>Since most of the experimental ubiquitylated proteins do not have corresponding protein tertiary structures in PDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Berman1">[16]</xref>, an effective tool, RVP-Net <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Ahmad1">[17]</xref>, was used to compute the ASA value based on the protein sequence. The computed ASA value is the percentage area of each amino acid on the proteins that is accessible to the solvent. RVP-net applies a neural network to predict real ASA values of the residues based on neighborhood information, with a mean absolute error of 18.0–19.5%, defined as the absolute difference between the predicted and experimental values of relative ASA per residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Ahmad1">[17]</xref>. Full-length protein sequences with experimental ubiquitylated sites are input to RVP-Net to compute the ASA value for all residues.

          <p>PSIPRED <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-McGuffin1">[18]</xref> was utilized to compute the secondary structure that surrounds the ubiquitylation sites from the protein sequence. PSIPRED is a simple and reliable method for predicting secondary structure, which applies two feed-forward neural networks to analyze the output obtained from PSI-BLAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Altschul2">[19]</xref>. PSIPRED 2.0 achieved a mean Q<sub>3</sub> score of 80.6% across all 40 submitted target domains without obvious sequence similarity with structures that are present in PDB; accordingly, PSIPRED has been ranked as the best of 20 evaluated methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Bryson1">[20]</xref>. The output of PSIPRED is “H,” “E” or “C”, which stand for helix, sheet and coil, respectively. The full-length protein sequences with ubiquitylation sites are inputted to PSIPRED to determine the secondary structure of all residues. The orthogonal binary coding approach is adopted to transform the three terms that specify the secondary structure into numeric vectors. For instance, helix is encoded “100;” sheet is encoded “010,” and coil is encoded “001.”</p>

        <p>In this work, the QuickRBF package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Ou3">[22]</xref> has been employed to construct radial basis function network (RBFN) classifiers. As presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017331.s001">Fig. S1</xref> (See Supplementary Materials), the general architecture in an RBFN consists of three layers, namely the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer.

        <title>Amino acid composition of ubiquitin conjugation sites</title>
        <p>This investigation focuses on the analysis of ubiquitin conjugated lysine. In ubiquitin conjugation, the region of the ubiquitin-conjugated lysine residues is in directly contact with the E3 ligase catalytic center. Since E3 ubiquitin ligase enzymes have a substrate binding specificity, whether the region of ubiquitin-conjugated lysine conserved amino acid motifs for E3 ubiquitin ligase recognition must be explored. After the duplicated sequences of experimental ubiquitylation sites are removed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017331-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, the amino acids composition that flanked the ubiquitin-conjugated lysines (ubiquitylation site centered at position 0) are graphically visualized as a 41-mer sequence logo. WebLogo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Crooks1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Schneider1">[29]</xref> is adapted to generate the graphical sequence logo for the relative frequency of the amino acid at each position around the ubiquitylated sites. The conservation of amino acids around the ubiquitylation sites can then be easily investigated. Based on the sequence logo representation, the most abundant residues of the ubiquitylation sites are the charged and polar amino acids, including Aspartic acid (D) and Glutamic acid (E). The amino acids around the modified sites are not obviously conserved, a slight difference between the preferences of amino acids for the ubiquitylation and non-ubiquitylation sites.</p>

        <p>Since the representation of sequence logos involves different preferences of amino acids for ubiquitylated and non-ubiquitylated sites, the statistical difference in the distribution of amino acids around ubiquitylated (Ub) and non-ubiquitylated (non-Ub) lysines is calculated. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017331.s002">Figure S2</xref> (See Supplementary Materials) displays the compositional differences between Ub and non-Ub sites. The more abundant amino acids at the Ub sites are Alanine (A), Aspartic acid (D), Glycine (G) and Isoleucine (I), and the depleted hydrophobic residues around these sites include Cysteine (C) and Leucine (L) around Ub sites. Moreover, the Lysine (K) and Serine (S) are less abundant around Ub sites. The amino acid sequences around the ubiquitin-conjugated sites can be alternatively grouped by various methods to generalize the sequence feature because amino acid classification is hierarchical.

The amino acids (AA) and accessible surface area (ASA) around the ubiquitylated sites are encoded using a BLOSUM62 matrix and the RVP-Net-computed ASA values, respectively. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0017331-t002">Table 2</xref> presents the predictive performance achieved using various training features, based on five-fold cross-validation.

However, the model that is trained with the secondary structure underperforms prediction based on ubiquitylation sites. According to the F-score of distant sequence features, the amino acid composition and evolutionary information (PSSM) at several flanking positions are statistically differently distributed between ubiquitylation sites and non-ubiquitylation sites. Therefore, the effects of combining informative features are evaluated.

        <title>Predictive performance of independent testing</title>
        <p>To determine whether the models (are over-fitted to their training data, independent sets of data concerning Ub sites and non-Ub sites are constructed and used to test the model that was trained with the combination of amino acid composition and the PSSM profile of non-redundant fragment sequences of Ub sites, which have the highest predictive accuracy. Independent test sets include 57 ubiquitylation sites and 3502 non-ubiquitylation sites, According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0017331-t003">Table 3</xref>, are used to determine the predictive sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the proposed method, which were 57.9%, 72.4%, and 72.2%, respectively. Generally, the performance in an independent test approaches that of cross-validation. Whereas cross-validation outperforms independent testing, the performance of the trained model may be overestimated. The independent test establishes that the constructed RBF model does not over-fit the training data. The independent test sets were used to test other ubiquitylation predictors. The predictive sensitivity and specificity of UbiPred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Tung1">[8]</xref> were 52.6% and 52.6%, respectively, indicating balanced predictive performance. However, the independent test also indicates that UbiPred does not perform as well as its developers claimed. The predictive sensitivity and specificity of UbPred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Radivojac1">[9]</xref> were 42.1% and 68.7%, respectively, indicating poor sensitivity for an independent test set. In UbiPred and UbPred, the data source of experimental ubiquitylation sites is collected from UbiProt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Chernorudskiy1">[6]</xref>, which mainly stored the yeast ubiquitylation data. However, UbSite integrates the experimental ubiquitylation sites from UbiProt and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Boeckmann1">[7]</xref>, which accumulated the ubiquitylation data from multiple species. This could partially explain the low sensitivities of UbPred and UbiPred on these independent test data which come from multiple species.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>This investigation proposes a method, UbSite, which incorporates the efficient radial basis function (RBF) network to identify ubiquitin conjugation sites on protein sequences. Not only the amino acid composition but also the structural characteristics, physicochemical properties, and evolutionary information of amino acids around the ubiquitylation (Ub) sites are explored. With reference to the pathway of ubiquitin conjugation, which involves a sequential process with a group of enzymes known as E1 (activating enzyme), E2 (conjugating enzyme) and E3 (ubiquitin ligase), the substrate sites for E3 recognition, which are distant from ubiquitylation sites, are examined. According to the measurement of F-score in a large window size(−20∼+20), most of the statistically significant amino acids and evolutionary information (PSSM), which can be used effectively to differentiate Ub sites from non-Ub sites, are located at large distances from Ub sites. To prevent any overestimation of predictive performance, duplicated sequences are removed using a window size determined by the collected data sets. Although the amino acid sequences around the ubiquitin conjugated sites do not contain a conserved motif, cross-validation results indicate that the integration of the evolutionary information around the sites can improve predictive performance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0017331-t003">Table 3</xref> compares proposed method with other ubiquitylation prediction tools, in terms of materials, method, training features, number of training data, window length, and proposed predictive performances. Furthermore, the independent test demonstrates that UbSite can outperform other ubiquitylation prediction tools.</p>
        <p>Although the proposed method is accurate and robust, according to independent tests, some issues remain to address in the future. Firstly, the structural preferences of ubiquitin conjugation sites preferred structures at ubiquitin conjugation sites must be examined in greater detail because flanking residues are not conserved. In addition to the solvent-accessible surface area and the secondary structure, the B-factor, intrinsically disordered region, protein linker region, and other factors should be explored experimentally at ubiquitylation sites in the protein regions with PDB entries. Following work done previously on phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Zanzoni1">[38]</xref>, the local 3D structure of ubiquitylation sites may be extracted for further analysis. Secondly, with reference to the pathway of ubiquitin conjugation, the ubiquitylated proteins may contain a substrate site is distant from ubiquitylation lysine and useful in E3 recognition. Therefore, the distant sequence features of ubiquitylation sites should be investigated in more detail. For instance, using the motif discovery tool, like MEME <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017331-Bailey1">[39]</xref>, to explore the significant motifs which may be the substrate sites of E3 recognition.</p>
