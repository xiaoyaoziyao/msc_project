<abstract>
<p>Whereas <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies of RNA-Seq data are being published for a growing number of species across the tree of life, there are currently no broadly accepted methods for evaluating such assemblies. Here we present a detailed comparison of 99 transcriptome assemblies, generated with 6 <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers including CLC, Trinity, SOAP, Oases, ABySS and NextGENe. Controlled analyses of <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> transcriptomes provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of transcriptome assembly strategies. We find that the leading assemblers generate reassuringly accurate assemblies for the majority of transcripts. At the same time, we find a propensity for assemblers to fail to fully assemble highly expressed genes. Surprisingly, the instance of true chimeric assemblies is very low for all assemblers. Normalized libraries are reduced in highly abundant transcripts, but they also lack 1000s of low abundance transcripts. We conclude that the quality of <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assemblies is best assessed through consideration of a <italic>combination</italic> of metrics: 1) proportion of reads mapping to an assembly 2) recovery of conserved, widely expressed genes, 3) N<sub>50</sub> length statistics, and 4) the total number of unigenes. We provide benchmark Illumina transcriptome data and introduce <italic>SCE</italic>RNA, a broadly applicable modular protocol for <italic>de novo</italic> assembly improvement. Finally, our <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaf transcriptome revealed ~20 putative <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes lacking in the current annotation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Massively parallel second generation sequencing technologies (SGS syn. NGS—next generation sequencing) have substantially reduced the cost of generating transcriptome sequence data, driving a rapid expansion of sequencing data resources[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref001">1</xref>]. The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is growing at an exponential rate and at the beginning of 2015 the total number of bases exceeded 3.8x10<sup>15</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref002">2</xref>]. Although the vast majority of sequence data is dedicated to exploring genomes, transcriptomics is growing fast[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref003">3</xref>]. This increase correlated with increased availability of high performance <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assemblers. Given these developments, there is a growing need for standardization of benchmarks and metrics used to evaluate transcriptome assemblies.</p>
<p>RNA-Seq has been leveraged with <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly to learn about plant innovations including parasitism[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref007">7</xref>] and C4 photosynthesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref008">8</xref>], plant processes including fruit ripening[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref009">9</xref>], drought response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref010">10</xref>], and flavonoid biosynthesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref011">11</xref>], chemical defenses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref012">12</xref>], and the evolution of sex chromosomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref013">13</xref>]. The recent boom of RNA-Seq studies involving <italic>de novo</italic> assembly has motivated innovations in assemblers developed specifically for RNA-Seq data (Velvet[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref015">15</xref>], Oases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref017">17</xref>] (includes Velvet[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref018">18</xref>]), SOAPdenovo[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref029">29</xref>], SOAPdenovo-Trans[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref030">30</xref>], CLC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref031">31</xref>], ABySS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref032">32</xref>], Trinity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref038">38</xref>]). Comparison of <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembler performance is hindered by lack of widely used standard quality metrics[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref039">39</xref>] or rigorous evaluation of a comprehensive selection of assemblers with a transcriptome from a high quality reference genome. Reference-dependent metrics have been proposed that include accuracy, completeness, contiguity, chimerism and variant resolution[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref040">40</xref>] which, in large part, rely upon arbitrary thresholds to inform assembly quality (e.g. the number of genes covered &gt;80%). Often the length statistics reported for <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies reveal that the number of unigenes (singletons, contigs and scaffolds—collectively “unigenes”) is far greater than the expected number of transcripts and that the total length of the assembly (total number of bases) also differs from the expected transcriptome length. Evaluation of an assembly output typically includes: 1) N<sub>50</sub> (the unigene length at which the cumulative assembled base pairs reaches 50% of the total assembly length), 2) the number of unigenes (n) greater than length <italic>x</italic>, and/or 3) the proportion of sequencing reads that map back to an assembly. While these can be informative statistics for relative comparisons, individually they fall short of adequately informing absolute quality. For instance, a high rate of mis-assembly resulting in chimeras could inflate the N<sub>50</sub> and length statistics. Similarly, a high rate of non-assembly of low-moderate abundance transcripts may inflate the N<sub>50</sub> and length statistics.</p>
<p>Estimation of assembly success by reporting the relative frequency of hits to expected sequences (e.g. conserved gene sequences in external databases) by itself can be rather arbitrary and fails to inform how well the assembly represents the data and thus the transcriptome, especially when the search parameters are not consistent from study to study. Reporting the recovery of one or more conserved sets of genes has been used[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref046">46</xref>] as a metric for sampling effort and assembly success, but the extent to which conserved genes serve as a proxy for the whole transcriptome remains unknown. Transcript annotation efforts are largely aimed at reporting the number of unigenes with hits in an external database such as NCBI’s non-redundant protein sequences database[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref002">2</xref>] (NR), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref047">47</xref>] (KEGG), Swiss-Prot[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref048">48</xref>], Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref002">2</xref>] (COG) and The Gene Ontology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref049">49</xref>] (GO). Sequence comparisons against these databases could elucidate chimeras but there are no established criteria for using alignment metrics to evaluate assembly quality.</p>
<p>Here we describe an in-depth comparison of 99 assemblies (software in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146062.t001">Table 1</xref>) of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaf transcriptome leveraging the 10<sup>th</sup> generation <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome as ground truth. Our analysis focuses on data produced by Illumina sequencing technology for 3 reasons: 1) this technology contributes the majority of new data to NCBI’s sequence read archive, 2) the cost per base provides a clear price advantage over other technologies and 3) many of the current <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers are designed to assemble Illumina data. We also evaluated the accuracy of measurements of expression levels extracted from <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies by interrogating the same RNA samples with NimbleGen Multiplex microarrays and qRT-PCR.</p>

<p>The coverage of each <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> gene (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s023">S2 Table</xref> for definitions of assembly metrics) was determined by mapping quality-trimmed reads to the longest splice variant of the detected TAIR10 cDNAs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the distribution of cDNA read-level coverage for each of the sequencing data sets in this study. Average cDNA coverage was highest in the Normalized Illumina library at 79.7%. The average coverage from the non-normalized Illumina libraries was 76% (±0.21), or 80.7% when combined. The greatest average cDNA coverage was obtained from the combination of the two non-normalized Illumina libraries. Although the normalized Illumina transcriptome had the greatest proportion of high coverage cDNAs (at 99–100% coverage) it also lacked reads for a large number of transcripts that were detected in one or more of the other libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In contrast, the combined non-normalized datasets (BR12) captured reads for nearly every gene in the detected gene set.</p>

<p>We predicted the sequencing statistics of the non-normalized Illumina biological replicate one (BR1) data set using ESTCalc at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fgp.huck.psu.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://fgp.huck.psu.edu</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref056">56</xref>]. This simulation indicated that BR1 would provide tags for all expressed genes. We found that the non-normalized BR1 library (4.2 Gbp of sequence data) generated tags for 96.2% of the detected gene set. Doubling the sequence data amount with Illumina BR2 tagged an additional 966 genes, bringing the total to 99.9% of detected genes tagged. Since mean transcript coverage was not substantially increased in the BR12 combined dataset, BR1 was deemed sufficient to represent the transcriptome for most practical purposes and unless noted, was used for all analyses described below.</p>

<title>Assembly reference definition and data choice for <italic>de novo</italic> assembly</title>
<p>The TAIR10 cDNA reference-based assembly (with Mosaik-<italic>SCE</italic>RNA–see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec033">methods</xref>) of BR1 contained unique assembled unigenes that represented 20,176 cDNAs (79.1% of the detected gene set). 17,723 (87.8%) of these transcripts were covered &gt;50%. 5,336 (20.9%) of the detected cDNAs were not represented in the Mosaik assembly, indicating insufficient cDNA coverage (e.g. low expression) to support even a reference-based assembly. When we included a second data set of equivalent size and quality (Illumina BR2), the number of Mosaik unigenes increased to 20,840 (81.7%). The number of assembled transcripts covered &gt;50% increased to 18,596 (89.2%), while the number of missing genes decreased to 4,672 (18.3%).</p>
<p>An important distinction between the cDNA reference and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly reference is between detection and reconstruction, respectively. While we <italic>detected</italic> 25,512 genes, the number of reconstructed genes (&gt;50% coverage) is closer to 18,000, as indicated by the number of genes represented in our reference-based transcriptome assemblies of BR1 with Mosaik.</p>

<title>Primary assembly statistics</title>
<p>Primary assemblies are the most basic, or minimal, output of a given assembler (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146062.t003">Table 3</xref>). Compared to the Mosaik assembly, the primary assembly statistics display variable patterns of performance. For instance, all of the assemblies have a greater number of assembled unigenes than the Mosaik assembly, and many are larger (N<sub>50</sub> Mbp), suggesting fragmented and duplicated transcripts. The N<sub>50</sub> lengths are all below Mosaik’s 1,838 bp, indicating <italic>de novo</italic> vs. reference-guided assembly results in fewer full-length sequences, or an inflation of small subsequences. Some assemblies (SOAPdenovo, Velvet, ABySS) garner a small proportion of mapped reads, indicating that these <italic>primary</italic> assemblies may be less representative, highly fragmented, or especially incomplete compared to the Mosaik standard. The assembly with the number of unigenes most similar to Mosaik is NG IT. This assembly has good statistics (see unigene count, N<sub>50</sub> length) but is the second smallest assembly and middle of the pack in terms of RNA-Seq correlations (RNA-Seq SCC and PCC with Mosaik, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146062.t003">Table 3</xref>), suggesting a less complete assembly. Yet, the NG IT primary assembly garners the greatest proportion of mapped reads. The CLC primary assembly is one of the larger assemblies (N<sub>50</sub> Mbp), but has the lowest N<sub>50</sub> length and the most unigenes while having outstanding RNA-Seq correlation statistics. Together this indicates the CLC assembly is highly fragmented yet highly representative of the input data. The Inchworm assembly has excellent length statistics and good RNA-Seq correlations, yet it has &gt;50,000 unigenes, which is ~2.5 times the number of unigenes found in the Mosaik assembly. These conflicting patterns suggest that the output of each assembler is quite variable and that simple length and read-mapping statistics do not sufficiently describe assembly quality. Recent variants of CLC (CLCscaf), SOAPdenovo (SOAPtrans) and NG MO (NG IT) are improvements, and show that additional steps beyond those implemented with basic De Bruijn graph methods have value.</p>

<title>Post-processed assembly statistics</title>
<p>The goal of post-processing is to improve key aspects of an assembly (e.g. length-statistics and unigene counts) without diminishing other important features such as the proportion of mappable reads (e.g. for <italic>de novo</italic> RNA-Seq). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146062.t003">Table 3</xref> the landscape of assembly statistics appears much more even after refinement by post-processing with the Velvet-Oases, Inchworm-Chrysalis-Butterfly (Trinity), or our modular <italic>SCE</italic>RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g002">Fig 2</xref>) post-processing tools. The similarity is greater when length cutoffs are imposed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), revealing comparatively large differences between the assemblies that are contained in short rather than long unigenes. The number of unigenes was reduced in all assemblies by <italic>SCE</italic>RNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146062.t003">Table 3</xref>), and the length statistics are generally improved, some dramatically so. Even the Mosaik reference-based assemblies were improved with SCERNA post-processing. The RNA-Seq correlations were not substantially changed nor were the proportions of mappable reads. For a comprehensive summary of post-processing effects on all <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> assemblies see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s016">S1 File</xref>. All assemblies are improved by post-processing, though as expected, none of the <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies are as good as Mosaik-S assemblies of the same data.</p>

<title>Evaluation of <italic>de novo</italic> assembly via a genome (cDNA) standard</title>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Error rates</title>
<p>The error statistics of each primary and post-processed assembly reveal the occurrence of fragmented, incomplete or incorrect assemblies. By estimating various types of error we can begin to explain the differences of each <italic>de novo</italic> assembly compared to the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> cDNA reference. Base call error rates were &lt;0.5% in all post-processed assemblies and base call error rates were improved (or nominally changed) by post-processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s016">S1 File</xref>). The proportion of unigenes with alignment gaps (to TAIR10 cDNAs) ranged from 0.001% for Mosaik-S to 0.005% for Inchworm-S, Velvet-S and CLC-S.</p>
<p>We reported two key error types that inform assembly failures. Type I errors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref057">57</xref>] indicate failure to assemble (fragmentation) and Type II errors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref057">57</xref>] indicate annotation ambiguity (with a subcategory, Case I, that is most indicative of chimerism) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The number of transcript assembly gaps between 2 unigenes (Type I Case I) ranged from 16,931 for Mosaik-S to 8,964 in Oases-VO. Type I Case II counts (overlap ≤<italic>kmer</italic>-1) were very low in Mosaik-S at 56 and ranged from 5,637 in CLC-S to 1,227 in ABySS-S. Fragmentation that occurs despite an overlap &gt;<italic>kmer</italic>-1 (Type I Case III) was also low in Mosaik-S at 256 and higher in the <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies ranging from 7,819 in CLC-S to 1,381 in Oases-VO.</p>
<p>Type II error occurs when a unigene cannot be unambiguously assigned to a single reference cDNA. This may indicate that a unigene matches two closely related loci, or that an assembly error has occurred resulting in a chimera. We first examined pairs of closely related genes because these may be likely to be misassembled due to high sequence similarity. We plotted the Ks values for gene pairs (reciprocal best hits) found in each assembly plus those found in our detected gene set and TAIR10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The Mosaik-S assembly plot showed a lack of pairs with low Ks values compared to the plot for the detected gene set, indicating that <italic>closely related</italic> gene pairs were preferentially excluded. To determine if the difference was due to sampling bias (in which one mate of the pair is expressed at a level sufficient for assembly and the other is not) or due to limitations of assembly (highly similar reads from closely related gene pairs are ambiguous) we examined the read count statistics for the 2,080 gene pairs lacking from the Mosaik-S plot relative to the detected gene set plot. For the majority of missing gene pairs (1,607, ~75%) there were insufficient reads for assembly, or only sufficient unique reads (SFB ≥0.1; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146062.t002">Table 2</xref>) for one mate of the pair, and these genes tended to have higher Ks values among the missing genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). This is consistent with previous work indicating that older paralogous gene pairs (higher Ks) are less likely to be co-expressed than younger paralogous gene pairs (lower Ks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref062">62</xref>]. 473 expressed gene pairs (EGP) had sufficient read depth for assembly and provided us with a list of co-expressed genes with high sequence similarity.</p>
<p>The instance of successful assembly (BS &gt;1.5; See <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146062.t002">Table 2</xref>) of both mates of the EGPs was very low for Mosaik-S at only 0.8% (4 EGPs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Roughly half of the EGPs were represented by both mates in the Mosaik-S assembly, though ~74% of these were very short (25% length). Generally, the <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies contained about the same number of high quality pairs with Inchworm-S and Velvet-S at 1.5% to NG MO-S and Trinity-ICB at 0.6%. The primary difference was in the total number of high quality (&gt;1.5BS) unigenes. All <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers produced more high quality EGP unigenes than Mosaik-S. All together, this produced a reciprocal pattern of “hit/no hit” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) of EGP genes in the <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies. Between 66–76% of the EGPs were represented by only one mate of the pair in all <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies. This pattern was far less pronounced in the Mosaik-S assembly with multiple low quality unigenes that represent more pairs, though fewer total EGP genes. This complex pattern shows that <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers tend to assemble higher quality unigenes representing one mate, while Mosaik-S assembles lower quality unigenes that represent more pairs. Taken together with the very low Type II error rates for most of the assemblies, this analysis of the closely related genes strongly suggests that the instance of true chimeric unigenes is very low. Thus it seems that loci whose shared sequence is <italic>less than</italic> the read length are resolved accurately while traversing the graph with reads, and loci whose shared sequence is <italic>greater than</italic> the read length seem to resolve with only a single accurate unigene (one of the pair), not a chimera.</p>
<p>We next examined the global occurrence of Type II errors and subdivided Type II errors into 5 cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In our analysis Type II Case I represents a special case that was most reliable in identifying chimeric unigenes compared to cases II-V. In Case I, the matching regions (e.g. two distinct loci) do not overlap, indicating a potential false join, whereas in cases II-V the matching regions overlap, indicating ambiguity between two loci. We excluded Type II errors reported for adjacent genes based upon a detailed analysis of Type II Case 1 errors in BR1 assemblies (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s017">S2 File</xref>). We verified that adjacent genes were accurately co-assembled (one unigene with 2 full length open reading frames (ORFs)) by aligning unigenes to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. All cases of Type II Case 1 error reported for adjacent genes in assemblies of BR1 were simply co-linear or overlapping genes with excellent full-length alignments to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s017">S2 File</xref>). These are cases of co-assembly and do not represent assembly failure, but rather limitations of the data (i.e. not strand specific) and the relative position and orientation of genes in the genome. Furthermore, post processing will easily report two distinct open reading frames (ORFs) for such co-assembled genes, therefore removing any ambiguity. Type II Case 1 errors of non-adjacent genes were often ambiguous alignments to closely related or duplicated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s017">S2 File</xref>) and were not chimeric. In fact, unambiguous cases of chimeric unigenes were exceedingly rare, with a substantial portion of Type II Case 1 errors reported consisting of what appear to be trans-spliced transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s017">S2 File</xref>).</p>
<p>The Type II error rates for post-processed assemblies of BR1 were all 0.0–0.07% except the highly fragmented CLC-S assembly at 0.26% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s016">S1 File</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s024">S3 Table</xref>). The Trinity-S Type II Case I error count was 4, the count for Mosaik-S was 3 and NGMO-S had only 1. The highest number of Case 1 assembly errors in post-processed assemblies of BR1 was in CLC-S at 56, yet this was still only 0.07% of all unigenes in the assembly. The proportion of Type II Case I errors were consistently less than half of all Type II errors, with many much lower. This indicates a rate of chimeric assembly that is very low across all assemblies and an order of magnitude lower than a previous estimate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref030">30</xref>]. Our annotation strategy relied on BLASTn alignments to TAIR10 cDNAs and the majority of Type II errors are likely due to ambiguous unigene alignments rather than erroneous assemblies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s017">S2 File</xref>).</p>

<title>cDNA coverage statistics in <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies</title>
<p>The average <italic>sequencing read</italic>-level cDNA coverage of the detected gene set in BR1 was 75.8%, while the average <italic>unigene</italic>-level cDNA coverage of the Mosaik assembly of BR1 was 65.3%. While we estimated coverage of cDNAs (mature mRNA transcripts) in an attempt to learn about the accuracy and efficiency of reconstruction of the input RNAs, it is important to note that the coverage of the coding sequence (CDS) in each transcript is very likely to be greater than, or equal to, the cDNA (mature transcript) coverage. As expected, all primary and post-processed <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies yielded poorer coverage statistics than the respective TAIR10 cDNA reference-based Mosaik assembly. The differences among all <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies were not dramatic and illustrate a subtle gradation in terms of completeness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Inchworm-S and CLC-S had the best unigene-level coverage statistics, yet were only slightly better in coverage than other assemblies which still yielded many thousands of unigenes that, cumulatively, covered reference transcripts &gt;75%.</p>

<title>Integration of quality metrics</title>
<p>The beneficial effects of post-processing tools like those integrated into Velvet-Oases, Trinity and <italic>SCE</italic>RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g002">Fig 2</xref>) are seen in all assembly metrics presented thus far. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g003">Fig 3</xref> we summarize the effect of <italic>SCE</italic>RNA post-processing on the Mosaik reference assembly and CLC, plus the effect of the Trinity pipeline on the intermediate output generated with Inchworm. The direction of change varies for certain categories. For instance, we expect that successful post-processing should reduce error rates and unigene numbers, but increase length statistics. These changes would indicate error correction and consolidation of information resulting in a smaller, more concise, lower error and more contiguous assembly. A summary of the effect of post-processing on assemblies is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s016">S1 File</xref>.</p>

<p>The Mosaik assembly is generated by aligning reads to the reference set of cDNAs, thus the effect of post processing should be minimal because each unigene is reference checked during assembly. Very complete yet highly fragmented assemblies like CLC should benefit greatly from post-processing, while high performance transcriptome assemblers like those implemented in the Trinity suite should show more modest gains during post-processing. The effect on the Mosaik assembly is minimal with the exception that the Type II error rate is reduced to 0.025% and the number of genes missing from the assembly was slightly increased. The effect on the CLC assembly was pronounced with substantial improvement of error rates, yet small changes in length statistics and unigene count. The changes for the Trinity assembly from the intermediate Inchworm output were more modest, and generally showed improvement in all categories.</p>

<title>Visualizing the complex assembly landscape</title>
<p>Despite a rigorous examination of numerous assembly quality metrics, none completely capture the key differences among the assemblies. Assemblers like CLC produce very comprehensive, yet highly fragmented transcriptome assemblies. Others like Trinity produce concise assemblies by excluding portions of the transcriptome that are difficult to resolve, as evidenced by the lower error rates and relatively greater number of missing genes. It is easy to make comparisons and see the effect of post-processing in individual categories, yet the fate of each gene needs to be considered to draw conclusions about transcriptome-wide assembler performance.</p>
<p>To track the fate of each gene in an assembly, we integrated our read mapping data (sequenced fragments/basepair—SFB) and BLAST-based sequence identification (bit score/basepair—BS) to reveal how the quality of <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly changes across the dynamic range of expression in the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> young leaf transcriptome. Our approach selects a single unigene with the highest BLASTn alignment bit score to a given TAIR10 cDNA, normalizes this score by cDNA length and then plots it against the normalized read depth (SFB). The ideal BS (alignment bit score normalized for sequence length) is 2.0 for a perfectly matched alignment. However, the BS for even a perfectly matched alignment may be slightly less than 2.0, due to variations in nucleotide base frequency, and thus the likelihood of transitions at a given position[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref063">63</xref>]. For example, a unigene that aligns to a 1000 bp transcript with 2 BS and 0.2 SFB is represented in the assembly by a unigene identical to the reference, and 200 sequenced fragments (pairs and/or orphans) map to the unigene. In this example, the average depth of sequence is roughly 30x, though we caution against the use of “depth of sequence” as a descriptor of transcriptome data sets, since read depth across genes and even across the length of individual reference transcripts varies by orders of magnitude[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref064">64</xref>].</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g004">Fig 4</xref> the results of this integrated approach are presented for all post-processed assemblies of BR1. Lowly expressed genes are represented in all assemblies by low quality (i.e. incomplete) unigenes. The accumulation of reads results in a rapid increase in unigene quality from 0.05 to 0.1 SFB for the Mosaik-S assembly, indicating that for an average gene (1000 bp), 50 76x76 bp paired-end Illumina reads is a practical lower limit for full length and accurate reference-based assembly.</p>

<p>The read depth threshold for high quality unigenes is greater for <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. With the exception of the NG MO-S assembly, the read use efficiency at lower sequencing depths was more or less equivalent among assemblers, with a sequencing depth between 0.1 and 1 SFB routinely producing long and accurate unigenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g004">Fig 4</xref>). To further reveal read-use characteristics of each assembly, a white trend line is plotted in each graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g004">Fig 4</xref>. This trend line shows the normalized read depth inflection point at which an assembly accumulates more contiguous and accurate unigenes. Except for NG MO-S, the trend of increasing quality as read depth increases is highly similar, with the most dramatic differences seen above 10 SFB. This analysis shows that most <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers rapidly accumulate long and accurate unigenes at 0.1–0.2 SFB, indicating that for an average 1,000 bp transcript, 100–200 reads (76x76 bp paired end) is a practical lower limit for successful <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. Generally, for genes in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> quartile of expression level, the assemblies are indistinguishable, yet the differences in the 1<sup>st</sup>, and especially the 4<sup>th</sup>, quartile of expression level are dramatically different.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, increasing sequence depth does not result in high quality assembly for all genes. This counterintuitive pattern is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g004">Fig 4</xref> as a persistence of <italic>lower</italic> quality unigenes at a normalized read depth above 0.1 SFB. The assemblies CLC-S, Oases-VO, Velvet-S, SOAPdenovo-S and ABySS-S all fail to assemble highly expressed transcripts at &gt;10 SFB (&gt;10,000 reads for 1,000 bp transcript), while more robust assemblers like Inchworm-S, Trinity-ICB, CLCscaf-S, SOAPtrans-S, NG MO-S and NG IT-S continue to efficiently produce unigenes for highly expressed transcripts, though some of these are of lower quality. This surprising pattern is also seen in primary assemblies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s018">S3 File</xref>) and is not a result of post-processing.</p>
<p>These results lead to the unexpected finding that the most highly expressed genes may be entirely missing from some <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies (Velvet-S, Oases-VO, SOAPdenovo-S, ABySS-S). In contrast the Inchworm-S, Trinity-ICB, CLCScaf-S, SOAPtrans-S, NG IT-S and NGMO-S are resistant to assembly failure at high read depth. NGMO-S is inefficient, yet the implementation of an iterative approach (NG IT-S, designed to control for extreme sequencing depth) substantially improves assembly efficiency and contiguity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g004">Fig 4</xref>). That the CLC-S assembly failed at high sequencing depth, but still has an excellent RNA-Seq correlations and high reference cDNA coverage suggests that many of the fragmented transcripts are from highly expressed genes.</p>
<p>To illustrate the challenge of distilling tremendous variation into concise unigenes representing a single locus, we aligned unigenes from 4 assemblies of BR1 (Inchworm, Trinity-ICB, CLC and CLC-S) with the genomic DNA, cDNA and CDS of AT1G31330.1, which encodes the highly expressed Photosystem I Subunit F (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In this extreme case the SFB of this gene in BR1 was 128 (&gt;121,000 reads). The Inchworm primary assembly produced two unigenes that matched the AT1G31330.1 cDNA. The post-processed Trinity-ICB assembly produced a single perfect unigene that extended the 3’ and 5’ UTR’s by 72 bp and 74 bp, respectively. In contrast, the primary CLC assembly produced 623 distinct unigenes that aligned to the AT1G31330.1 cDNA. Even after post-processing, the CLC-S assembly contained 96 unigenes that aligned to AT1G31330.1. The alignments of CLC unigenes reveal numerous single base-pair and structural differences including a unigene that contains the intron (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s007">S7C and S7D Fig</xref>). Depending upon research goals, it may be desirable to examine the numerous differences for AT1G31330.1 displayed in CLC assemblies or, alternatively, extract a single perfect unigene from another assembly for downstream analysis.</p>

<title>Is normalization a useful strategy to improve transcriptome assemblies?</title>
<p>Our analysis of the <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies reveals that the dynamic range of transcript abundance is a primary hurdle to full-length and accurate transcript assembly, often resulting in missing or fragmented transcripts. Normalization via Duplex Specific Nuclease (DSN) is designed to enzymatically reduce the frequency of the most abundant transcripts and should directly address assembly errors arising from extreme sequencing depth for highly expressed genes. An important distinction between DSN normalization and e-normalization (like that offered by Trinity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref050">50</xref>]) is that the former reduces the abundance of highly expressed transcripts, while the latter is a strategy to reduce memory requirements during graph construction by reducing the frequency of highly abundant k-mers. Since the failure of <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies seems to be driven by extreme read depth it is unlikely that e-normalization will impact Type II error rates. Manual digital normalization, like that implemented in NG IT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref004">4</xref>], improves assembly but is extremely labor intensive and therefore not practical.</p>
<p>The normalized Illumina transcriptome provided the highest average coverage for any single dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g001">Fig 1</xref>), yet also lacked any reads for &gt;2000 of our detected genes, more than double the number missing from BR1 or BR2. This was unexpected since the process of normalization removes highly abundant transcripts thus <italic>increasing</italic> the likelihood of detecting less abundant ones. The result should be a <italic>more</italic> diverse library along with an increase in average transcript coverage. We hypothesized that this apparent dichotomy was due to the removal of lowly expressed genes along with highly expressed and very similar relatives; this could result from sloppy complementary base-pairing leading to digestion by the DSN during normalization. To test this we first identified two distinct gene sets, the Ultra-Conserved Orthologs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref065">65</xref>] (UCOs, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compgenomics.ucdavis.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://compgenomics.ucdavis.edu/</ext-link>) and a subset of our EGPs, which we termed the Closely Related Genes (CRGs—the 300 most closely related EGPs, Ks &lt;0.2). We then correlated the read counts from the normalized Illumina library and the average read counts from the combined non-normalized Illumina libraries and highlighted the UCOs and CRGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). The results of this analysis do not support our hypothesis that the basis for aberrant removal of transcripts is due to high sequence similarity of CRGs since read counts for CRGs, compared to the UCOs and all other detected transcripts, are not substantially affected in the normalized library. Despite the aberrant removal of transcripts from sequencing libraries, the increase in average cDNA coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g001">Fig 1</xref>) indicates that normalization was successful in its primary purpose.</p>
<p>Since we verified that normalization was successful in increasing cDNA coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), it stands to reason that <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of these data should improve since removal of excess reads directly addresses assembly failure at very high levels of expression (SFB &gt;10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The assembly of normalized read data does increase the number of full length and accurate transcript assemblies (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s016">S1 File</xref>) by ~15% in the Mosaik and Trinity assemblies, and by a larger margin in the CLC assembly (~25%). Similar gains were observed in Oases and ABySS assemblies, though NG MO and SOAPdenovo assemblies were notably poorer, due possibly to structural changes in the data following the removal of SMART adapter sequences (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec033">Materials and Methods</xref>). SOAPdenovo was the only assembler considered here that <italic>required</italic> untrimmed input data, yet removal of the SMART adapters from was essential and could not be avoided. The structural data requirement of SOAPdenovo is a drawback since the user cannot tune the assembly based on quality trimming.</p>

<title>Read Titration Analysis</title>
<p>In principle, if an assembly is accurate and complete (i.e., it represents all of the raw data), then a large proportion of those reads should map back to the assembly. In addition to the proportion of reads that map back to an assembly, a measure of completeness, in terms of number of genes detected, is necessary. To evaluate the degree of read saturation present in a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, we calculated gene accumulation curves for each post-processed assembly of BR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This analysis calculates the rate of gene detection (estimated using the number of unique unigenes observed) as a function of sampling effort (number of sequence reads). Analogous to the species accumulation curves used to estimate species richness in biodiversity inventories, similar approaches have been used to evaluate gene capture in transcriptome studies for systems without a reference genome sequence[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref046">46</xref>]. This approach allows us to qualitatively and quantitatively assess whether we have sequenced to sufficient depth to capture all of the genes present in a sample.</p>

<p>The read titration analysis shows that superior assemblies (like Trinity-ICB) are representative of the read data and capture a large amount of sample diversity before approaching saturation, at which point a large proportion of the data are sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g006">Fig 6</xref>). It is clear that NG IT-S, NG MO-S, Inchworm-S, Trinity-ICB, CLCscaf-S and SOAPtrans-S reach saturation at ~110–150% of the expected gene count, while CLC-S has more than 3 times the expected number of sequences. We don’t expect a typical plant transcriptome to contain 60,000 genes, easily excluding CLC-S since the proliferation of unique sub-sequences causes an inflation of “unique tags” in the read titration analysis. Nor do we expect that only a small fraction of reads will map to a high quality <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, excluding Velvet-S, Oases-VO, ABySS-S and SOAPdenovo-S since they garner a very small proportion of reads before reaching saturation. However the plot of NG IT-S is quite similar to the Mosaik-S assembly, closer in fact than Inchworm-S, which we know to be a better assembly. This is a reflection of the highly accurate but inefficient and exclusive nature of NG IT-S assemblies. The unigenes that NG IT-S produces are very accurate and tend to require more reads for assembly while at the same time excluding conflict and many lowly expressed genes, effectively lowering the assembly diversity.</p>
<p>The relative sharpness of the inflection point informs assembly quality in that a more contiguous assembly will have a sharper inflection point (e.g., Mosaik-S). This is due to rapid detection of new unigenes in the assembly, that are quickly exhausted, and a switch to re-sampling high coverage unigenes. In assemblies that fail to reconstruct highly expressed genes, like Velvet-S, the inflection point is sharper due to the absence of highly expressed genes that lowers assembly unigene diversity. On the other end of the spectrum, CLC-S assemblies reconstruct highly expressed genes as a fragmented collection of unigenes resulting in the more gradual detection of unique, though highly expressed unigenes.</p>
<p>The results of this type of analysis will reveal which assemblies represent the read data well, while at the same time providing a measure of assembly diversity. In theory, a good assembly should produce a number of sequences that reflect the estimated transcript number. However, the choice between leading assemblers is not clear, as in the case of NG IT-S, NG MO-S, Trinity-ICB, Inchworm-S, CLCscaf-S and SOAPtrans-S. To make a more informed choice we should not only estimate the number of expected sequences, but also look for specific genes (e.g. broadly conserved genes) we expect to find.</p>

<title>Ultra Conserved Orthologs (UCOs) as a proxy for the whole transcriptome</title>
<p>Our read level analyses suggest that UCOs are among the ~60% of genes expressed at moderate levels in the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> young leaf transcriptome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).

Therefore, it follows that assembly of UCOs can be an indicator of <italic>de novo</italic> assembly quality since moderately expressed genes with low sequence similarity to other genes are likely to be assembled and represented by single high quality unigenes.

Combined with the read titration analysis we can now exclude NG IT-S and NG MO-S since the exclusive and inefficient nature of these assemblers results in an inferior complement of UCOs; NG IT-S lacks &gt;100 UCOs covered at &gt;90% and ~45 UCOs covered at &gt;99% compared to the leading assemblies, while NG MO-S lacks even more.

<p>The <italic>SCE</italic>RNA processed Inchworm assembly of both biological replicates (BR12) of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> young leaf produced only marginally more (3.6%) unigenes above 1.5 BS than the assembly of one biological replicate (BR1), despite doubling the amount of sequencing data (from 4.2 to 8.4 Gbp).

Nipponbare[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref069">69</xref>] that was structurally similar to our <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> young leaf transcriptome data. A large proportion (76.5%) of the raw reads mapped back to the Rice cDNAs. Our subsampled assembly analyses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> predicted that the rice data set, which was 1.4 Gbp of quality filtered data, would be sufficient to reconstruct a substantial fraction of the rice young leaf transcriptome, allowing us to gauge the efficiency and accuracy of leading assemblers with select informative analyses.</p>
<p>Our rice assemblies showed patterns similar to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> assemblies (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s009">S9 Fig</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g008">Fig 8</xref>).

The difference in the number of genes above 1.5BS in the reference-based assembly vs. the best <italic>de novo</italic> assembly for rice was 4,186. The same comparison with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transcriptome data revealed a smaller gap of 3,268 genes, but considering the smaller and less complex nature of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transcriptome, this is not surprising.

<title>Microarray and RNA-Seq analysis of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> young leaf transcriptome</title>
<p>We reasoned that we could improve the coefficient of gene expression between Microarray and RNA-Seq approaches by masking the RNA-Seq signal from all but microarray probe regions. We improved the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) between classic RNA-Seq (reads mapped to TAIR cDNAs) and the NimbleGen Multiplex Microarray from R<sup>2</sup> = 0.817 (average Log<sub>2</sub> RPKM vs. average Log<sub>2</sub> Array intensity) to R<sup>2</sup> = 0.853 (average Log<sub>2</sub> reads/probe vs. average Log<sub>2</sub> Array intensity). These results are an improvement over previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref070">70</xref>] and consistent with Malone and Oliver[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref071">71</xref>], albeit with fewer RNA-Seq replicates. However, only ~2.5% of the Illumina reads map to the array probe sequences, excluding a majority of the read data.</p>
<p>The PCC between experiments using TAIR10 cDNAs and the Mosaik-S assembly revealed high similarity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.74) with the TAIR10 reference, which captures more reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s010">S10 Fig</xref>); this is expected because the TAIR reference is more complete. We correlated read counts from all <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies against a reference-based assembly of the same data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146062.t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s016">S1 File</xref>).

<p>Classic RNA-Seq and the NimbleGen Microarray reported very different expression levels for some genes.

Outside of the dynamic range of the array, qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq agreed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).

<title>Transcriptome evidence for new <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes</title>
<p>The <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana de novo</italic> assemblies include unigenes that do not align with annotated <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> cDNA sequences.

At this threshold a substantial number of unigenes remain unassigned due to low quality alignments or low sequence complexity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s014">S14 Fig</xref>). 357 unigenes from all post-processed assemblies of BR1 had best hits to fungal genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s014">S14 Fig</xref>) indicating low levels of contamination in the transcriptomes of the greenhouse-grown plants.

Of these 20, none are represented by TAIR10 cDNAs.

<title><italic>De novo</italic> assembler selection</title>
<p>The top performing assemblers were reassuringly good, and in many aspects competitive with the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> reference based Mosaik assemblies. Two of the top performers, Trinity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref050">50</xref>] and SOAPdenovo-trans[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref052">52</xref>], are open source, while the third, CLCscaf[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref051">51</xref>], must be purchased, yet it offers a more intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface option combined with many other useful features. Although we did not examine computational speed in this study, no substantial differences were noticed between the top three performers (CLCscaf, Trinity and SOAPtrans) with our dataset. The run time and memory footprint of some of the assemblers evaluated here have been explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref073">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref074">74</xref>], and the computational intensity can vary greatly between data sets. A distinguishing feature of Trinity is the ability to estimate transcript isoforms. However, given the structural limitations of the data (read length and library fragment length &lt;&lt; transcript length) the estimation is really of alternative splice <italic>junctions</italic> because short read data cannot capture complete transcript variants. Additionally, because expressed gene sets from different organisms can vary substantially in their gene duplication, isoform, heterozygosity, and repeat profiles, studies similar to this one in non-plants would have merit, especially as it relates to evaluating assemblies in non-model systems.</p>
<p>Our extensive list of assembly quality metrics falls into two categories 1) reference-dependent and 2) reference-independent. With a carefully controlled set of quality metrics, assembly parameters, and evaluation criteria we were able to identify superior assemblies in our reference-dependent evaluations. Once we identified the superior assemblies, we were able to choose reference-independent metrics that identified the same superior assemblies. Generally, when the assemblers were ranked based on a single metric, a subtle gradation in performance was revealed, rather than substantial differences. Using a wide range of assemblers, we observed the surprising result that all but the best <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assemblers (Trinity, SOAPtrans, CLCscaf) failed to assemble <italic>highly expressed genes</italic>. This observation indicates that both insufficient <italic>and</italic> excessive sequencing depth can cause assembly failure.</p>
<p>Examination of each reference based quality metric invariably led to questions about the useful combinations or relative power of each. To that end, we developed an analytical approach that reports unigene quality as a function of sequencing depth for each <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> transcript. Length statistics, which can inform unigene contiguity, are integrated with the frequency of all other errors (e.g. mismatches, gaps, insertions/deletions, and Type I and II errors). This method penalizes chimeric assemblies since the normalized score (BS) for an alignment to a reference cDNA will be low; only the matching portions will align leaving the remainder of the unigene unmatched. Finally, by considering the sequencing depth for each unigene, we can visualize the spectrum of sequencing depths and correlate that with highly accurate and contiguous unigenes to see how assembly quality changes over the dynamic range of gene expression. This key analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g004">Fig 4</xref>) allowed a definitive ranking of assemblers that we recapitulated with reference-independent metrics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Comments on the top 3 assemblers: CLCscaf-S, Trinity-ICB and SOAPtrans-S</title>
<p>Generally the statistics were fairly even among CLCscaf-S, Trinity-ICB and SOAPtrans-S assemblies of in terms of assembly size (~13.5 Mbp), N<sub>50</sub> (~1550) and unigene count (~30,000). The differences among CLCscaf-S, Trinity-ICB and SOAPtrans-S were generally minor but indicate that SOAPtrans-S was more exclusive yet more accurate, and CLCscaf-S and Trinity-ICB more inclusive, possibly by more efficient resolution of variation in the transcriptome read data. One assembly does get an honorable mention along with a note of caution—NG IT-S. On the surface this assembly appeared to be very similar to our reference assembly controls with Mosaik. Yet after looking beyond the good N<sub>50</sub> statistics, high proportion of mappable reads and other signs of a superior assembly we dug deeper to find that the assembly lacked many lowly expressed genes. It also lacked full-length unigenes (&lt;99% cDNA coverage) for ~100 UCOs compared to the superior assemblies Together this indicates low read-use efficiency in NG IT-S and highlight the pitfalls of focusing on too few metrics of assembly quality. The substantial improvement over the NG MO-S assemblies resulted directly from manual removal of reads for highly expressed genes, supporting our conclusion that excessive sequencing depth poses a primary hurdle to <italic>de novo</italic> assembly.</p>
<p>Importantly, these leading assemblers displayed low Type II error rates. Our results show that previous estimates of error, specifically Type II error or instance of chimeric assemblies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref075">75</xref>], were artificially high, often by an order of magnitude or more. Part of this is due to the use of a loose definition of “chimera” in prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref070">70</xref>], but also to the use of a reference genome from a different rice cultivar that contributed to an inaccurate count of chimeric unigenes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref030">30</xref>]. In the present study, we reserve the term chimera for clear cases of erroneous assembly of two distinct loci. We classified unigenes by aligning them to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, and found that a majority of Type II errors were simply cases of alignment ambiguity (matches to multiple genome locations), where Xie et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref030">30</xref>] broadly mis-classified these as chimeric. In fact they represent limitations of annotating closely related genes by aligning unigenes to a reference sequence, especially one from a <italic>related</italic> organism.</p>

<sec id="sec028">
<title>Which genome reference-<italic>independent</italic> metrics identify the leading assemblers?</title>
<p>The reference-independent metrics that were most useful to identify superior assemblies were selected based on reference-based evaluations. Only the <italic>combination</italic> of 1) a high proportion of reads that map to an assembly 2) efficient recovery of conserved genes, 3) expected N<sub>50</sub> length statistics, and 4) <italic>more</italic> unigenes than expected transcripts, is indicative of superior state-of-the-art assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Inconsistent with the expectation that superior assemblies produce the expected number of unigenes, superior assemblies produced <italic>more</italic> unigenes than the expected transcript number (~18,000). This is due to Type I assembly errors for very lowly <italic>and</italic> very highly expressed genes, both of which inflate the number of unigenes and depress N<sub>50</sub> length statistics. Imposing length cutoffs to estimate N<sub>50</sub> lengths reveals consistent and high values for leading assemblers. So, paradoxically, superior assemblies have more unigenes than transcripts since the large dynamic range of gene expression poses assembly challenges at <italic>both</italic> extremes. The reduction in Type I error rates by adding more data (Trinity-ICB assemblies of BR1 vs BR12) was small and accompanied by a concurrent increase in Type II error rates. This indicates that the 4.2 Gbp of BR1 was sufficient to reconstruct a majority of the transcriptome and approaches a point of diminishing returns as more data is collected.</p>
<p>An important reference-independent analysis was the read titration plot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This analysis displays two important metrics that are useful to identify superior <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies: 1) proportion of mappable reads, and 2) unigene count. More subtle qualitative information is contained in the <italic>shape</italic> of the curve, with relative sharpness indicating relative assembly contiguity. The unigene number and proportion of mappable reads are easy to extract from other analyses, yet the read titration plot allows the researcher to examine <italic>relative</italic> transcriptome wide changes during iterations of assembly. For instance, the <italic>relative</italic> difference between two assemblies may be unigene contiguity, rather than unigene number or mappable reads. In the absence of excellent reference sequences to verify improved unigene contiguity, the read titration plot can reveal this improvement without a reference. It is important to note that absolute contiguity is more difficult to estimate without reference sequences, especially when assembly errors that reduce the effective transcriptome complexity can also indicate increased contiguity. Therefore, careful consideration of this integrated analysis with the other metrics is critical.</p>
<p>A strategy that has been implemented to evaluate <italic>de novo</italic> assembly is the detection of broadly expressed, highly conserved, single copy genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref046">46</xref>]. A scan for genes expected to be present in the transcriptome (i.e. ultra conserved orthologs—UCOs or conserved single copy genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref058">58</xref>]) can inform assembly efficiency and completeness. In our comparison, a strong indicator of assembly quality was UCO coverage which, in leading assemblies, tagged &gt;70% of the UCOs with unigenes covering &gt;90% of the reference cDNA. As an exclusive indicator UCO coverage was not ideal since assemblies that fail at extreme transcript abundance may still assemble a large majority of UCOs since these genes tend to be moderately expressed (i.e. see the assembly Oases-VO BR1 in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g009">9</xref>).</p>
<p>We did not attempt to generate a single score by integrating the above 4 metrics. Reduction of these into a single dimension would require weighting of each metric. Because research goals vary, and the ability to leverage <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly may depend on differential weighting of these metrics, we instead have emphasized which aspects of assembly each metric informs to promote goal-specific assembly optimization.</p>

<title>Are Strategies for Sequencing and Assembly Improvement Warranted?</title>
<p>We have shown that post-processing of assemblies is a critical step in generating superior assemblies. The Trinity and Velvet-Oases pipelines, and our collection of modular post-processing tools called <italic>SCE</italic>RNA, improved <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies in key categories while minimizing negative effects, such as increased Type II error rates (i.e. chimeric unigenes). <italic>SCE</italic>RNA had minimal effects on Mosaik assemblies indicating that high quality assemblies would not be compromised. The most dramatic improvement in our analysis was the implementation of the Iterative NextGENe assembly method[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref004">4</xref>] which brought NextGENe from a last place ranking to fifth place. This approach was labor intensive, but directly addressed assembly failure for highly expressed genes.</p>
<p>A common approach to improve the detection rate for lowly expressed transcripts is normalization. Our comparison revealed that the normalized Illumina library had increased average transcript coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s006">S6 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s018">S3 File</xref>) and assembly quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s018">S3 File</xref>) reflecting that abundant transcripts were reduced in frequency. However, we also observed that genes were erroneously removed during normalization. This, together with the cost of normalization, the loss of gene expression information, and the high value of replicated RNA-Seq data suggests the benefit of normalization is eclipsed by the benefits of deeper sampling and more biological replicates. If the sequencing goal is to discover the largest possible number of genes from an organism and obtain full length assemblies of even highly expressed genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref007">7</xref>], this is one time when the addition of whole-organism (i.e. mixture of multiple tissue samples) normalized libraries may provide a significant <italic>addition</italic> along with non-normalized libraries. This approach adds a transcriptome in which highly expressed transcripts are reduced in coverage, thereby increasing the chances for assembly of these transcripts.</p>
<p>It should be possible to avoid extremes of coverage by targeting specific tissues or “batch assembling” data to avoid assembly failures at extreme sequencing depths, yet this would require a novel meta-assembly strategy. Furthermore, in recent reports, dramatic gene expression differences were seen across fine tissue types (obtained by laser microdissection) in the developing maize leaf[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref076">76</xref>], tomato fruit[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref009">9</xref>], and even parasitic plant haustoria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref005">5</xref>]. These global differences in gene expression likely extend to gene expression patterns of duplicated genes and UCOs. Even though recently diverged genes (i.e. lower Ks) tend to be co-expressed while older duplicate genes (greater Ks) have evolved divergent expression patterns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref062">62</xref>], these dramatic cell type differences may indicate a challenge to these observations. Also while UCOs tend to be broadly and moderately expressed in whole organ samples like our young leaf samples, increased sampling granularity may influence the recovery of UCOs if their expression profile is highly cell-specific.</p>
<p>Thus, in the absence of complementary data types, it may be possible to improve assembly by isolating difficult-to-assemble transcripts by fine sampling. Similar to the addition of normalized libraries to decrease reads for highly expressed genes, high sample granularity increases the number transcripts with data amounts in the optimum range (SFB ~0.1–1.0) for successful assembly. The loss of low abundance transcripts from a fine granularity approach would be mitigated by assembly of all the data together; an approach that effectively increases the coverage of low abundance transcripts. However, implementation of a multiple assembly strategy creates the need for a meta-assembly approach to merge or cluster unigenes from the same locus, or a selection strategy to supplement the easily assembled transcripts with those that are more challenging to assemble.</p>
<p>From strictly a cost-per-base perspective, Illumina sequencing is attractive. However, longer read technologies (e.g. Sanger, 454, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore) are attractive since they provide complementary data structure to capture entire transcripts. Recent reports have shown that excellent <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies can be generated by leveraging existing sequence resources with fresh SGS data, like those that exist for wheat[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref077">77</xref>] and tomato[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref009">9</xref>]. However, we recognize many plant genomes are first examined by a pilot Illumina transcriptome (e.g. NSF’s AToL initiative[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref078">78</xref>] and the 1000 Plants initiative[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref079">79</xref>]), thus researchers must rely solely on the SGS data created in these studies.</p>
<p>Important situations where long reads should improve the assembly quality are in the assembly of highly expressed genes and closely related genes (CRGs). We examined CLC assemblies of a combination of 454 and Illumina (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s016">S1 File</xref>) to see if structurally different data improved assembly. Compared to a CLC assembly of Illumina-only, assembly metrics were nominally improved; a similar improvement was achieved by implementing the overlap layout assembler CAP3 with only Illumina data. Importantly, our hybrid assemblies were inferior to the leading Illumina-only assemblies, which include CLCscaf-S. Surprisingly, the <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies generally outperformed the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome based assemblies (using Mosaik) by reconstructing a greater proportion of high quality (&gt;1.5 BS) mates of CRGs.</p>
<p>The global pattern of CRG pair expression was examined by Ks plot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) revealing that most CRGs detected by read mapping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s003">S3 Fig</xref> “Detected gene set”) were not sufficiently expressed for assembly of both mates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). In the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly plots the abundance of pairs with very low Ks (the negative exponential on the left side of the plot) likely results from very similar subsequences or transcript isoforms. The plot of ABySS Multi-K-S (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), the largest and consequently the most redundant assembly, is an extreme example of this. The post-processing tools in the Velvet-Oases and Trinity pipelines outperform <italic>SCE</italic>RNA in this regard, yet the assembly that was most improved by <italic>SCE</italic>RNA (CLC) shows a plot which is nearly identical to the reference based assembly. Since <italic>SCE</italic>RNA was optimized for improving CLC assemblies, which were the most complete but most fragmented assemblies, this result suggests that post-processing may benefit from platform specific tuning. The Ks analysis is useful as an indicator of relative assembly quality, but the variable detection rate of differentially expressed genes imposes limitations for using the Ks plot as an indicator of absolute quality. Indeed, a meta-assembly strategy where sufficiently diverse transcriptomes are sampled to capture virtually all transcripts may enhance the utility of this type of analysis.</p>

Curiously the genome reference-based Mosaik returned ~5x more unigenes with Type II errors.

<p>RNA-Seq has emerged as a powerful tool for gene expression analysis, yet the availability of a high quality read mapping reference is essential.

This analysis reveals that a potentially useful way to test the accuracy of genome annotations, as well as the probe set on an array, is to correlate the analog array probe signal with the digital signal from RNA-Seq masked for all but the probe sequences. Even though our sample size was small, we were able to identify problematic probe sequences and identify potential annotation errors in the best plant genome.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> young leaf transcriptome has shown that, compared to a reference guided assembly, reconstruction of the transcriptome is reassuringly good. The leading assemblies were Trinity-ICB (and the highly similar Inchworm-S), CLCscaf-S and SOAPtrans-S and generally the unigenes produced by each were highly accurate while assembly errors were largely restricted to fragmentation and non-assembly. The reference based transcriptome assembly metrics revealed that a large dynamic range of expression poses assembly challenges at both extremes. Superior assemblies accurately reconstruct transcripts efficiently at low transcript coverage depth and continue to generate accurate assemblies at high coverage depth. Paradoxically, the superior state-of-the-art assemblies routinely produced more unigenes than expected transcripts due to assembly failure at both extremes of expression. Type I error rates, which are due to insufficient coverage of lowly expressed genes and, presumably, to conflict and error in extreme coverage depths, are a dominant form of assembly error. The rates of all other types of error, including chimeras, were low. The reference-independent metrics we examined, when considered together, can inform absolute assembly quality. Existing prior knowledge about the characteristics of a given transcriptome, e.g. gene number, are important to assessing assembly quality and each plant transcriptome has unique differences. Also, highly tissue specific sampling will influence the transcriptome that is captured compared to a tissue pool that consists of more cell types. The characteristics of a superior transcriptome assembly include: 1) a high proportion of mappable reads (e.g. &gt;65%), 2) unigenes that number roughly ≥150% of the expected transcript count, 3) expected N<sub>50</sub> (e.g. 1200), and 4) high recovery of Ultra Conserved Orthologs. Only this <italic>combination</italic> of reference-independent metrics was useful to identify superior assemblies.</p>
<p>The minimum coverage required for successful assembly is notoriously hard to estimate since transcript abundance spans several orders of magnitude. Indeed, a minimum depth for assembly of highly expressed genes is easy to reach in a very modest (i.e. 500 Mbp) dataset while the required depth of coverage for successful assembly of lowly expressed genes may be practically unreachable. Our analyses suggest that 4–5 Gbp is a good minimum target for a representative plant transcriptome, since substantial gains are made at 1 Gbp increments from 1–4 Gbp, but beyond that (i.e. ~8 Gbp in BR12) the returns diminish in terms of yield of additional transcripts, though more data may be required for larger transcriptomes, as seen in rice. It is very important to note that more data can simultaneously improve the assembly of lowly expressed genes while increasing the frequency of mis-assembly of highly expressed genes. The intractiblity of sequencing each transcript in the sweet spot may require custom digital normalization schemes combined with meta-assembly of tissue specific data, or “batch assembly” of transcriptome data. Such an analytical strategy, in combination with effective use of 3<sup>rd</sup> generation sequencing technologies, could address the remaining weaknesses of state-of-the art <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers in a world with exponentially growing transcriptome data.</p>

Low-quality bases (&lt;Q20) were trimmed from the ends of 454 single-end and Illumina paired-end reads using the <italic>quality_trim</italic> program of CLC Assembly Cell version 3.2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref051">51</xref>] requiring additionally that the remaining read must be &gt;50% original length with each remaining base having &gt;Q20. SnoWhite[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref083">83</xref>] (version 1.1.4), a sequence-cleaning pipeline, was used to remove normalization adapter (sub-)sequences from the normalized read files. SnoWhite was originally implemented for 454 data, and requires sequences in fasta format (and optionally base qualities in base-quality fasta format). Since Illumina sequences are typically provided in fastq format, Biopython[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref084">84</xref>] was used to convert the Illumina-fastq to standard-fastq, and then the resultant standard-fastq to fasta and base-quality fasta format before clipping adapters. After running Snowhite the read files were converted back to fastq format using Biopython, paired-end read files were reconstructed and single-end read files were written (for orphaned reads) using a custom script.</p>

<p>The trimming of low-quality bases and adapter clipping can compound insert size estimation by read mapping. To estimate insert sizes required for subsequent analysis steps, test assemblies were run for all three Illumina paired-end reads libraries BR1, BR2 and NORM using CLC Assembly Cell (Version 3.2). Then all paired reads were uniquely mapped to each lllumina library and its respective large contigs (≥600 bp) using version 0.12.7 of Bowtie[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref087">87</xref>].

The insert sizes for biological replicate one (BR1), biological replicate two (BR2), and normalized (NORM) libraries were 134 bases (sd = 15.06), 140 bases (sd = 18.15), and 217 bases (sd = 19.45) respectively.</p>

ABySS, Oases (Velvet), SOAPdenovo, SOAPdenovo-trans and CLC Assembly Cell + Scaffolding produced scaffolds, while CLC Assembly Cell and Trinity (Inchworm) produced contigs. All assemblies were performed using trimmed reads except for SOAPdenovo non-normalized assemblies, which became more fragmented as result of trimming. Trimmed normalized reads were used in SOAPdenovo assembly because the untrimmed normalized reads were contaminated with adapter (sub-)sequences. To investigate the effect of a mixture of 454 and Illumina reads a 454-Illumina-hybrid assembly was performed using reads from BR1 with CLC Assembly Cell. For the NextGENe Maximum Overlap (NG MO) assemblies we used NextGENe to quality filter the raw fastq data to remove reads with a median quality score of less than 22, trim reads at positions that had 3 consecutive bases with a quality score of less than 20, and remove any trimmed reads with a total length less than 40 bp. The quality-filtered data was assembled <italic>de novo</italic> using the Maximum Overlap assembler in NextGENe. The NextGENe Interative assemblies (NG IT) were done as described in Wickett et al. 2011[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref004">4</xref>]. We attempted to improve the BR1 hybrid 454 + Illumina CLC assembly using the overlap consensus assembler CAP3[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref089">89</xref>], using a minimum overlap length of 30 (<italic>k-value</italic> -1) and at least 97% identity, to merge contigs with significant overlap that had not been assembled into contiguous sequences (due either to single base mismatches in the reads or path ambiguity in the graph). Illumina BR1 reads were also assembled over a range of <italic>k</italic>-<italic>values</italic> (25–74) using ABySS (ABySS Multi-K) and these assemblies were merged to remove redundancy as described in Robertson G, Schein J, et al. 2010[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref090">90</xref>].</p>

These assembly post-processing tools address specific aspects of an assembly with the goal of generating high confidence sequences for downstream analysis. <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies had different entry points into the post-processing pipeline depending upon the output of each assembler (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146062.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Paired-end information of Illumina reads was used to scaffold and extend CLC Assembly Cell and NextGENe contigs with SSPACE[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref091">91</xref>] (version 1.0) because assembly algorithms of these two assemblers do not have built-in scaffolding functions and thus tend to produce more fragmented sequences (CLC now has a built in Scaffolding feature—designated herein CLCscaf see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s023">S2 Table</xref>). A minimum of 5 links (read pairs) were required to join two contigs into a scaffold and at least 30 bases of overlap (<italic>k-value</italic> -1) and a minimum of 20 reads were required for contig extension. Similar parameters were set for the assembly programs with built-in scaffolding capabilities, whenever possible. In order to bridge some of the gaps introduced in transcripts during scaffolding, paired-end reads were utilized with SOAPdenovo’s <italic>GapClose</italic>r program (overlap length set at 30 bases (<italic>k-value</italic> -1)) to either close or reduce the size of gap opening in all <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies except for the gapless transcripts produced by Trinity. ESTScan 2.0[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref092">92</xref>] using HMM models built with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> was used to identify translatable sequences.

Using UCLUST, a global alignment-clustering algorithm of USEARCH, scaffolds (or contigs where applicable) were clustered at 97% identity for each <italic>de novo</italic> assembly into non-redundant sets. The longest sequence in each cluster was selected as the best representative for a given putative locus in the final post-processed assembly. Additionally, the longest translatable sequences-per-cluster were selected from non-redundant natively clustered Oases (Oases-VO) and Trinity (Trinity-ICB) assemblies for comparison with assemblies clustered with UCLUST.</p>

<title>Completeness of Coverage</title>
<p>A commonly used criterion to assess the optimality of a <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcriptome of species that has previously determined gene models is how well it recapitulates the models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref094">94</xref>]. Using BLASTn[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref095">95</xref>], with an e-value threshold of 1e-10, each assembly was aligned (using cluster representatives) to the set of 25,512 detected genes as determined by read mapping (described above). Only the most significant locus (least e-value) for each assembled sequence was recorded (with the exception of alignments for Type II error rate evaluation, where two most significant loci recorded). Using custom scripts the alignments were parsed to compute the breadth of sequence coverage, mismatch and gap-opening rates, Type I and Type II error rates across gene models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0146062.ref057">57</xref>]. For each reference gene model, the breadth of sequence coverage was determined by computing the percentage of bases covered by unigenes from each assembly. The mismatch and gap-opening rates for each assembly was determined by computing the ratio of mismatches to total aligned bases and the ratio of gap-openings to total aligned bases respectively.</p>

<title>Type I error estimation</title>
<p>Contigs corresponding to the same locus, but which fail to assemble together were classified as Type I errors. We quantified these error rates in each assembly by determining regions with no overlap (i.e. gap between scaffolds not spanned by unigenes, Case I), insufficient overlap regions (overlap &lt; <italic>k-value</italic>, Case II), and regions with conflicting overlaps (≥<italic>k-value—1</italic>, Case III) in BLASTn alignments of unigenes for each locus as (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s002">S2 Fig</xref>)</p>

<sec id="sec060">
<title>Type II error estimation</title>
<p>Mis-assemblies (Type II errors) in each assembly were quantified by determining the ratio of all ambiguously aligned sequences to all reference-aligned unigenes. We determined potential mis-assembled unigenes in the BLASTn alignments if, with at least 99% sequence identity, different segments of an assembled sequence align to at least two non-adjacent annotated gene loci (= “genes”) (Case I), an assembled sequence aligns equally to two genes (Case II), an assembled sequence aligns to a gene model and its subsequence aligns to a different gene (Case III), an assembled sequence whose alignments to two gene overlap with more than 80% of the sequence length (Case IV), and an assembled sequence whose alignments to two genes overlap with at most 80% of the sequence length (Case V) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s002">S2 Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>We verified that excluding adjacent genes was appropriate by manually examining all unigenes with Type II errors (hits to adjacent <italic>and</italic> non-adjacent loci) in the BR1 CLCscaf primary assembly (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s017">S2 File</xref>). With BLASTn we aligned each unigene to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genomic sequences to verify that adjacent genes were accurately co-assembled (i.e. 1 unigene with 2 intact, accurate, and correctly oriented ORFs). After excluding poor alignments (&lt;90% identify, &gt;1e-10 e-value) the extensive manual curation of these alignments revealed that, predominantly, Type II Case 1 errors identified chimeras, whereas Cases II-V did not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s017">S2 File</xref>). Thus, using the manually curated learning data, we designed and ran a custom Perl script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146062.s017">S2 File</xref>) to parse <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genomic alignments of all Type II Case 1 BR1 post-processed unigenes to identify chimeras. These results agreed very well (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.87) with our original estimates of Type II Case 1 errors. In fact, our algorithm to identify Type II errors reports an overestimate of true chimeric unigenes.</p>

<title>Assembly Read Mapping Evaluation</title>
<p>The proportion of reads that can map back to an assembly is a useful criterion for the quality assessment of a given <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. Bowtie was used to map Illumina paired-end reads back their respective assemblies retaining only one best alignment for each read.

<title>Quality versus Depth plots</title>
<p>The BLASTn results (see above “<bold>Completeness of Coverage</bold>”) and read counts (see above “<bold>Assembly Read Mapping Evaluation</bold>”) were used to determine how well each detected transcript was reconstructed in each assembly. For a given locus, the bit score of the best BLASTn alignment produced from a given assembly was normalized by cDNA length producing the value for “BS” (normalized bit score). The expression signal for each detected gene was determined by summing reads from all unigenes that mapped to that locus. The read counts were then normalized by cDNA length to produce the value for “SFB” (sequenced fragments per base pair). This approach excluded alignments of equal or lower quality (≤bit score) than the best alignment for each locus. In this way we simulate the ability to identify a “best hit” when working without a genome reference and can report the ability of each assembler to reconstruct each locus into a single, contiguous and error free unigene. These two values were plotted against each other to show how each assembly accumulates accurate and contiguous unigenes as a function of sequencing depth.

<p>Type I assembly reports cases of incomplete assemblies where a given transcript is not assembled into a single sequence (Case I = gap, Case II = Insufficient overlap). Type I error can also consist of failure to bring contigs together (Case III) with sufficient overlap, presumably due to conflict.

For this highly expressed gene, Trinity is able to distill extensive variation into a single perfect unigene, whereas subsequences with minor differences (often single nucleotides) are maintained as numerous unigenes in the CLC primary and post-processed assemblies, including unigenes that seem to contain introns (middle portion of C and D).</p>

<title>The quality of assembled sequences as a function of sequencing depth for all Illumina assemblies.</title>
<p>The units for “Assembly Quality” are Normalized Bit Score (BS, maximum of 2) and the units of “Sequence Depth” are Sequenced Fragments/bp (SFB). The number printed in the plot area is the number of assembled sequences with normalized Bit Score above 1.5. A BS of 1.5 is an arbitrary threshold, yet represents long and accurate assemblies, and is used to illustrate the difference in the high density region seen in most plots near BS 1.75–2. For instance, a transcript that was reconstructed to 75% of the reference cDNA length with no errors would result in an alignment with a BS of 1.5. Since the rate of base call errors, alignment gaps and Type II errors are low, the BS reports primarily alignment length.</p>
