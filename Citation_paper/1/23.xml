<abstract>
<p>Plant cell walls are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, collectively known as lignocellulose. Microorganisms degrade lignocellulose to liberate sugars to meet metabolic demands. Using a metagenomic sequencing approach, we previously demonstrated that the microbiome of the North American porcupine (<italic>Erethizon dorsatum</italic>) is replete with genes that could encode lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. Here, we report the identification, synthesis and partial characterization of four novel genes from the porcupine microbiome encoding putative lignocellulose-degrading enzymes: β-glucosidase, α-L-arabinofuranosidase, β-xylosidase, and endo-1,4-β-xylanase. These genes were identified via conserved catalytic domains associated with cellulose- and hemicellulose-degradation. Phylogenetic trees were created for each of these putative enzymes to depict genetic relatedness to known enzymes. Candidate genes were synthesized and cloned into plasmid expression vectors for inducible protein expression and secretion. The putative β-glucosidase fusion protein was efficiently secreted but did not permit <italic>Escherichia coli (E</italic>. <italic>coli)</italic> to use cellobiose as a sole carbon source, nor did the affinity purified enzyme cleave <italic>p</italic>-Nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside (<italic>p</italic>-NPG) substrate <italic>in vitro</italic> over a range of physiological pH levels (pH 5–7). The putative hemicellulose-degrading β-xylosidase and α-L-arabinofuranosidase enzymes also lacked <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme activity, but the affinity purified endo-1,4-β-xylanase protein cleaved a 6-chloro-4-methylumbelliferyl xylobioside substrate in acidic and neutral conditions, with maximal activity at pH 7. At this optimal pH, <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>, V<sub>max</sub>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> were determined to be 32.005 ± 4.72 μM, 1.16x10<sup>-5</sup> ± 3.55x10<sup>-7</sup> M/s, and 94.72 s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Thus, our pipeline enabled successful identification and characterization of a novel hemicellulose-degrading enzyme from the porcupine microbiome. Progress towards the goal of introducing a complete lignocellulose-degradation pathway into <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> will be accelerated by combining synthetic metagenomic approaches with functional metagenomic library screening, which can identify novel enzymes unrelated to those found in available databases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The production of bio-ethanol from the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass has been proposed as a sustainable solution to the energy crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref002">2</xref>]. Lignocellulose is made of three carbohydrate polymers; lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose, with lignin being the most abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref003">3</xref>]. Lignin polymers are covalently linked to the other structural polysaccharides, hindering the ability of carbohydrate acting enzymes (CAZymes) to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref004">4</xref>]. Current industrial extraction methods include subjecting lignocellulose to high temperatures, high pressures, and strong acids and bases to remove lignin and enable processing of hemicellulose and cellulose polysaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref005">5</xref>]. Environmental microbiologists have investigated the microbial communities in landfill leachate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref006">6</xref>], forest decomposition layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref008">8</xref>], and in the microbiomes of termites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref009">9</xref>] and ruminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref012">12</xref>] to co-opt efficient microbial enzymes for lignocellulose degradation.</p>
<p>The North American Porcupine, <italic>Erethizon dorsatum</italic>, is a hind-gut fermenter with an enlarged cecum packed with microbes that aid digestion of lignified plants, coniferous and deciduous cambium (inner bark), and flowers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref013">13</xref>]. For this reason, we characterized the microbiome of the porcupine as an attractive source of enzymes for biomass conversion. Using metagenomic and 16S sequencing approaches with the KEGG database, the undergraduate 2016 Dalhousie international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) team determined that the porcupine microbiome is replete with genes that could encode proteins similar to known lignocellulose-degrading enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref014">14</xref>]. This report provided strong genetic evidence for these enzymes but did not provide direct experimental evidence for enzyme activity. To address this knowledge gap, we, the 2017 Dalhousie iGEM team, created a synthetic metagenomic pipeline which allowed us to identify four candidate CAZyme genes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose degradation; β-glucosidase, α-L-arabinofuranosidase, β-xylosidase and endo-1,4-β-xylanase. These putative enzymes were analyzed alongside their 22 closest homologs using phylogenetics to ensure that the catalytic domain was conserved. These genes were synthesized, cloned into expression vectors and affinity-purified; activity of purified enzymes was measured using matched substrates. Among these, we demonstrated that the microbial endo-1,4-β-xylanase could hydrolyse xylobioside linked to a fluorescent molecule at pH 7. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide functional characterization of a CAZyme from the porcupine microbiome.</p>

<title>Identification and cloning of putative microbial enzymes via a synthetic metagenomic pipeline</title>
<p>We used a metagenomic sequencing pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) to identify four microbial genes from porcupine fecal samples predicted to encode putative cellulose- or hemicellulose-degrading enzymes; a β-glucosidase, an α-L-arabinofuranosidase, a β-xylosidase, and an endo-1,4-β-xylanase (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g002">2A</xref>). In brief, shotgun sequences were trimmed and assembled into contigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Open reading frames (ORFs) with upstream bacterial ribosome binding sites were identified on the compiled contigs. ORFs were translated <italic>in silico</italic> and identified by similarity of predicted primary amino acid sequences to conserved domains from known enzymes found in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We specifically queried β-glucosidase enzymes that catalyze the final step in cellulose degradation by converting cellobiose disaccharides to glucose monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), and α-L-arabinofuranosidase, β-xylosidase, and endo-1,4-β-xylanase enzymes that catalyze sequential steps in the degradation of hemicellulose to xylose monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This collection of putative enzymes is insufficient to achieve full degradation of complex lignocellulose substrates, but their synthesis and characterization served as an important test of our synthetic metagenomic pipeline.</p>

<title>Identification of four genes from the porcupine microbiome with putative cellulose- and/or hemicellulose-degrading activity using a metagenomic sequencing pipeline.</title>
<p>The bioinformatic pipeline (A) began with Illumina MiSeq data previously collected from a porcupine fecal DNA sequencing project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref014">14</xref>]. Reads were checked for quality and trimmed, concatemerized via MegaHit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref015">15</xref>], and open reading frames were identified using Prodigal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref016">16</xref>]. Protein sequences of interest were identified by pHMMER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref017">17</xref>] using various protein databases and were selected for matches of interest based on e-value selection.

<title><italic>In silico</italic> analysis of putative enzymes</title>
<p>Metagenomic sequencing sequences all genetic material present in a microbiome rather than individual microbial genomes. To determine the genetic origin of the genes of interest, the predicted primary amino acid sequence of each candidate gene was queried against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref018">18</xref>]. Each of the four putative enzymes from the porcupine microbiome were most closely related to enzymes encoded by anaerobic bacteria, which was expected because the gut is an anaerobic environment. Specifically, the putative β-xylosidase was 75% identical (100% coverage) to a β-xylosidase from <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> sp. CAG:318. The putative β-glucosidase was 73% identical (99% coverage) to a β-glucosidase encoded by <italic>Bacteroides faecis</italic> MAJ27. The putative α-L-arabinofuranosidase was 63% identical (92% coverage) to a glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 43 protein encoded by <italic>Prevotella</italic> sp. CAG:732. The putative endo-1,4-β-xylanase was 55% identical (99% coverage) to a hypothetical protein BHV73_02415 encoded by <italic>Bacteroides</italic> sp. 44_46 and predicted to contain GH10 and GH43 domains. We concluded that the four genes we selected for study were novel but nevertheless closely related to previously identified genes from anaerobic bacteria encoding known cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes.</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis of all four putative gene products was performed using the 22 closest homologs for each (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209221.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The putative endo-1,4-β-xylanase and β-glucosidase enzymes clustered closely with their homologs in a clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These clades were strongly supported by high bootstrap values (100 and 100, respectively) on each node, generated from compiling 100 separate trees. The putative α-L-arabinofuranosidase did not fall into a clade, but did cluster with its closest homologs, whereas β-xylosidase clustered poorly. Next, predicted amino acid sequences of all four putative enzymes were aligned with closest homologs to determine conservation of key catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209221.s002">S1A–S1D Fig</xref>). A key aspartic acid is conserved in the catalytic domain of the putative β-glucosidase; this residue was conserved across all 22 proteins analyzed, with 4 examples aligned to the putative enzyme in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209221.s002">S1A Fig</xref> By contrast, the catalytic domain of endo-1,4-β-xylanase consists of two conserved aspartic acids and a glutamic acid; all three residues were perfectly conserved amongst all 22 proteins analyzed and 4 example sequences were aligned to the putative endo-1,4-β-xylanase in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209221.s002">S1B Fig</xref> α-L-arabinofuranosidase similarly has two conserved aspartic acids and a single glutamic acid in the active site that is perfectly conserved amongst all proteins analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209221.s002">S1B Fig</xref>). The putative β-xylosidase showed low conservation from amino acids 190–230, but the conserved catalytic domain requiring the two conserved aspartic acids and a single glutamic acid were also found to be conserved amongst all analyzed sequences. Identifying and confirming the catalytic sites provided evidence that these proteins may function in a biological system and require functional assays to determine activity by <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of these open reading frames.</p>

<title>Synthesis, expression and secretion of putative enzymes in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic></title>
<p>The four putative microbial enzymes were synthesized and cloned into the pET26b(+) vector to enable IPTG-inducible gene expression in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Because directed secretion of enzymes provides access to extracellular lignocellulosic substrates, each candidate gene was cloned as a fusion protein bearing an amino-terminal PelB motif required for periplasmic localization and subsequent secretion.

Log-phase <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cultures were treated with IPTG to induce transgene expression, followed by harvest of cell supernatant, periplasm and total cell fractions.

<p>Treatment of transformed log-phase <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cultures with IPTG caused accumulation of our putative microbial β-glucosidase and the control β-glucosidase DesR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref021">21</xref>] at predicted molecular weights; both proteins were affinity purified and detected using a total protein stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Dalhousie 2016 iGEM team previously demonstrated that the porcupine microbiome is a potentially rich source of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref014">14</xref>]. We developed a synthetic metagenomic pipeline to mine the porcupine microbiome for novel enzymes with useful properties. Using stringent selection criteria to maximize our chances of discovering <italic>bona fide</italic> cellulose/hemicellulose-degrading enzymes, we identified and synthesized four novel genes encoding putative cellulose- and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes from the porcupine microbiome: a β-glucosidase, an α-L-arabinofuranosidase, a β-xylosidase, and an endo-1,4-β-xylanase. These putative enzymes were thoroughly analyzed by phylogenetics and key conserved residues in proposed catalytic sites were identified. These putative enzymes were affinity purified, and we demonstrated clear <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of a purified putative endo-1,4-β-xylanase, with optimal activity at pH 7, consistent with the neutral pH of the porcupine cecum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref023">23</xref>]. This marks the first discovery of a functional hemicellulose-degrading enzyme from the porcupine microbiome, and it demonstrates the power of our synthetic metagenomic approach.</p>
<p>The microbial genome that encodes our novel endo-1,4-β-xylanase is unknown, but this gene has a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) Sequence commonly found in bacterial genes, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that it is most closely related to uncharacterized proteins with glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 10 and 43 domains from <italic>Bacteroides spp</italic>. as described by the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes Database (CAZy, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cazy.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref024">24</xref>]. GH10 domains have been linked to endo-1,4-β-xylanase, endo-1,3-β-xylanase, tomatinase and/or xylan endotransglycosylase activity, while GH43 domains are commonly found in β-xylosidase and/or α-L-arabinofuranosidase enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref024">24</xref>]. Because our candidate endo-1,4-β-xylanase cleaved a modified xylobiose substrate <italic>in vitro</italic>, we inferred that the GH10 domain was functional in the context of the affinity-purified fusion protein, despite the addition of an amino-terminal PelB domain and carboxy-terminal 6XHIS affinity purification tag. This enzyme displayed activity across a wide range of pH values (pH 4–7.5) but lacked thermostability, losing activity after 30 min incubation at a range of temperatures as low as 37°C, despite the fact that the porcupine deep core body temperature is approximately 37°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref025">25</xref>]. This thermo-instability makes our novel endo-1,4-β-xylanase less useful for industrial applications compared to known thermophilic endo-1,4-β-xylanases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref026">26</xref>]. Enzyme thermostability can be improved via directed evolution; Stephens <italic>et</italic>. <italic>al</italic>. used error-prone PCR to increase endo-1,4-β-xylanase thermostability, creating a superior variant with a single amino acid substitution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref027">27</xref>]. Advances in computational prediction and protein folding models can also inform rational mutagenesis strategies to increase enzyme thermostability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref030">30</xref>]. Such approaches may be used to enhance the thermostability of our novel endo-1,4-β-xylanase.</p>
<p>We calculated a turnover rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) of 94.7 s<sup>-1</sup> for our novel endo-1,4-β-xylanase, which compares favorably with other known enzymes. Using beechwood xylan as a substrate, He <italic>et</italic>. <italic>al</italic>. reported that an endo-1,4-β-xylanase isolated from the fungus <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> had a relatively high <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of 139.7 s<sup>-1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref008">8</xref>]. Using the same substrate, Xu <italic>et</italic>. <italic>al</italic>. reported a lower rate of turnover of 47.34 s<sup>-1</sup> for a microbial xylanase containing a GH10 family domain isolated from the feces of the black snub-nosed monkey (<italic>Rhinopithecus bieti</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref031">31</xref>]. A GH11 family endo-1,4-β-xylanase isolated from the fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> also had a low rate of turnover (0.27 s<sup>-1</sup>) of RBB-xylan substrate, a chromogenic derivative of beechwood xylan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref032">32</xref>]. Like other kinetic constants, turnover rates are substrate-specific. Because we were the first to use CMU-X<sub>2</sub> to calculate kinetic constants for an endo-1,4-β-xylanase, we cannot directly compare our findings to studies that employ beechwood xylan or RBB-xylan. Future studies should characterize kinetic constants of our endo-1,4-β-xylanase on more conventional substrates such as beechwood, birchwood, and oat-spelt xylan.</p>
<p>Among the other three putative enzymes identified in this study, the β-glucosidase accumulated to high levels, translocated to the periplasm and was efficiently secreted, yet it lacked <italic>in vitro</italic> activity in <italic>p</italic>-NPG or <italic>p</italic>-NPNAG assays. The putative α-L-arabinofuranosidase was also efficiently secreted but it lacked <italic>in vitro</italic> activity. By contrast, β-xylosidase was difficult to purify and was often retained in the insoluble pellet fraction. Insolubility can occur when a protein aggregates before it can fold properly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref033">33</xref>]. To promote proper folding and solubility of our putative β-xylosidase, we reduced IPTG levels from 1.0 mM to 0.1 mM and reduced the culture temperature to 20°C during the time of induction. Despite these precautions, the amount of affinity purified β-xylosidase remained insufficient for subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme assays. It is possible that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> lacks appropriate chaperone activity required to efficiently fold this enzyme.</p>
<p>Metagenomic shotgun sequencing allowed us to characterize all genetic material in the porcupine microbiome but did not reveal which organism encoded the gene of interest. However, diverse bacterial populations are known to secrete enzymes into the gut that work cooperatively to degrade lignocellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref035">35</xref>]. Our goal was to provide a platform to discover these cooperative enzymes from different microbes. Our pipeline allowed the discovery of putative cellulolytic enzymes from the entire microbiome, including unculturable species. We believe that enzyme discovery using our synthetic metagenomic pipeline will provide opportunities to reverse-engineer lignocellulose degradation pathways for industrial applications.</p>
<p>Our synthetic metagenomic pipeline is a powerful tool for discovery, but it infers functional relationships from homology to previously characterized sequences in a database. Thus, the pipeline will likely fail to identify greatly divergent proteins with desirable properties. It may also identify putative enzymes that appear to have conserved functional domains but lack the function predicted by homology. By contrast, functional metagenomic library screens rely on functional assays for gene discovery. Thus, functional metagenomics provides a convenient approach to new gene discovery that nicely complements sequence-based approaches, but with greater potential for discovery of truly novel genes that don’t resemble those in existing databases. Recently, using functional metagenomics, Cheng, <italic>et</italic>. <italic>al</italic>. discovered three novel β-galactosidase enzymes, two of which had conserved domains, and one of which was part of a previously undiscovered enzyme family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref036">36</xref>]. To complement our synthetic metagenomics approach, we plan to create and screen a functional metagenomic library from porcupine microbiome DNA to discover novel lignocellulose-degrading enzymes.</p>

Prodigal was used to identify open reading frames (ORFs) by searching sequences in six frames across both DNA strands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref016">16</xref>]. A ‘-c’ command modifier in Prodigal was used to ensure the program only detected ORFs with both start and stop codons present. Prodigal was instructed to search for Shine-Dalgarno sequences required for ribosome binding to prokaryotic mRNAs, and non-canonical start codons CUG, GUG and ACG which are typically found in up to 10% of prokaryotic ORFs; these products are often overlooked by conventional searches and absent from many databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref038">38</xref>]. These restrictions were expected to largely limit our hits to prokaryotic genes regulated by Shine-Dalgarno sequences.</p>

<p>Candidate genes were PCR-amplified from IDT gBlock gene fragments with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase according to manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, MA, USA). PCR products were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit protocol (Qiagen Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0209221.t001">Table 1</xref>) and cloned into the pET26b(+) expression plasmid (MilliporeSigma); this plasmid enables the creation of fusion proteins with PelB leader sequences required for translocation to the periplasm after which they can be secreted into the extracellular space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref043">43</xref>]. Thus, by fusing our putative enzymes to PelB we increased the likelihood of secretion to the extracellular space to access lignocellulosic substrates. Candidate genes and pET26b(+) were digested with restriction endonucleases (NEB) indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0209221.t001">Table 1</xref> for 1 hour at 37°C.

<p>The pET26b(+) vector contains a carboxy-terminal 6xHIS tag downstream from the multiple cloning site (MCS). Initially, the candidate genes were cloned with a translation stop codon that interrupted the 6xHIS tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to delete the stop codon, restoring the 6xHIS tag. The constructs were amplified using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase according to manufacturer’s instructions (NEB). Fractions of each PCR product were electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel to confirm size. PCR products was purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). After purification, the 6xHIS tagged constructs were ligated using T4 DNA ligase for 1 hr at 37°C (NEB).</p>

<title>Inducible protein expression</title>
<p>All pET26b(+) 6xHIS tagged candidate genes were transformed into BL21(DE3) <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to enable inducible protein expression. Selected colonies were inoculated into 5 mL of LB broth and incubated at 37°C in a shaker (220 RPM) overnight. The overnight culture was diluted 1:100 in 2.5 mL LB broth and incubated in a shaker until the OD<sub>600</sub> of the culture reached 0.5–0.8. Once in log phase, 0.1 mM IPTG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was added to induce protein expression. After 3 hours of shaking incubation at 37°C, bacteria were pelleted at 16000 x g for 2 min, supernatant was collected, and pellets were harvested in 2x electrophoresis sample buffer (ESB) or subjected to periplasmic fractionation. Protein was collected from the supernatant as previously described by Sarty <italic>et al</italic>. with some modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref045">45</xref>]. Specifically, 2.5 mL of clarified supernatant was passed through 0.2 μm PEL syringe filter and placed on ice for 10 min before trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The periplasmic fraction was isolated using previously described cold osmotic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref019">19</xref>]. Briefly, after the bacteria were pelleted, supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 625 μL Cell Fractionation Buffer 1 (0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 g/L sucrose, 0.1 M EDTA) then incubated at 4°C for 20 min with regular inversion. After incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 16000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 625 μL Cell Fractionation Buffer 2 (0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.005 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 20 min at 4°C with regular inversion. The suspension was centrifuged as before, and the supernatant was collected as the periplasmic fraction. TCA precipitation was done to concentrate the protein. The vector pET26b(+) (EV) was used as a negative control. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PDVF and immunoblotted using a mouse anti-penta-HIS antibody (Qiagen, Cat. 34660).</p>

After initial incubation, 1 mL of culture was used to inoculate 100 mL of fresh LB broth with 25 μg/mL kanamycin and 1mM IPTG for overnight induction at 30°C, shaking. After induction, the cultures were centrifuged at 3220 x g for 20 min and supernatant was decanted from pellet. The cell pellets were resuspended in Wash Buffer (20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and sonicated for a total of 6 min in 30 sec intervals on ice, then centrifuged at 8000 xg for 30 min at 4°C. Subsequently, supernatant was loaded into a column containing HisPur Cobalt Resin (Thermofisher) pre-equilibrated with Wash Buffer. The column was washed with six volumes of Wash Buffer, followed by elution in Elution Buffer (150 mM imidazole, 20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). Glycerol was added to the purified protein at a final concentration of 10% to maintain proper protein folding.</p>
<p>Recombinant strain pET26b(+)-β-xylosidase was difficult to purify and a modified protocol was used as previously described by Zimmermann <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0209221.ref046">46</xref>]. Briefly, 1L of LB broth (no antibiotic) was inoculated with 5 mL of saturated overnight pET26b(+)-β-xylosidase culture (containing kanamycin). The culture was shaken at 37°C at 220 rpm until the OD<sub>600</sub> was between 0.4 and 0.7. Once an appropriate optical density was reached, the culture was incubated at 42°C for 10 min, recovered at 37°C for 20 min, placed on ice for 30 min, and recovered again at 37°C for 30 min. Following heat- and cold-shock treatments, the culture was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG and incubated overnight at 20°C while shaking.

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> enzyme assays</title>
<p>The activity of candidate β-xylosidase, β-glucosidase, and α-L-arabinofuranosidase enzymes was tested using <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol (pNP) derivatives <italic>p</italic>NP-β-D-xylopyranoside, <italic>p</italic>NP-β-D-glucopyranoside, and <italic>p</italic>NP-α-L-arabinofuranoside, respectively. When cleaved by active enzyme, these compounds release pNP which can be measured by absorbance at 410 nm wavelength. General experimental procedure combined 900 μL of 5 mM pNP derivative in buffer, which was used to blank the spectrophotometer (Nanodrop One, Thermo Scientific), once 100 μL of appropriately diluted enzyme was added, the absorbance was measured at 410 nm every minute for 15 or 30 min. Optimum pH for β-xylosidase was determined using 2 different 50 mM buffers: citrate buffer at pH 5, and phosphate buffer at pH 6. Optimum pH for β-glucosidase was determined by using three different buffers (50 mM) at pH 5: citrate buffer, pH 6: phosphate buffer, and pH 7: phosphate buffer. Optimum pH for α-L-arabinofuranosidase was determined using three different 50 mM buffers: citrate buffer for pH 5 and 5.5, and a phosphate buffer for pH 6. β-glucosidase was assessed for <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase activity using <italic>p</italic>NP-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide as described above.</p>
<p>The activity of endo-1,4-β-xylanase was determined using 6-chloro-4-methylumbelliferyl xylobioside (CMU-X<sub>2</sub>). When cleaved by an active enzyme, 6-chloro-4-methylumbelliferyl is released from xylobiose and can be excited to fluoresce at 450 nm. 100 μM CMU-X<sub>2</sub> was added to 0.6 μg of affinity-purified endo-1,4-β-xylanase in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 4, 5, 5.5, 6) or sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5, 7, 7.5) in a 96-well plate (Grenier). Fluorescence was measured (Excitation 365 nm, Emission 450 nm) at 37°C using a plate reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax M2) immediately and every minute for 30 minutes to determine optimal pH for enzyme activity. Fluorescence at optimal pH was then compared to a commercial β-glucosidase (DesR) as a negative control as above. Thermostability of the putative endo-1,4-β-xylanase was determined by incubating samples containing 0.6 μg of enzyme for 30 minutes at 37°C, 50°C, 60°C, or 70°C prior to addition of CMU-X<sub>2</sub>. Samples were then read as before. Control is unincubated endo-1,4-β-xylanase. To calculate kinetic constants, initial rate of product formation (cleavage of CMU from xylobiose) was calculated for 0.6 μg of endo-1,4-β-xylanase incubated with 10 μM, 15 μM, 20 μM, 40 μM, 100 μM, 150 μM, 200 μM, and 250 μM CMU-X<sub>2</sub> substrate. Kinetic constants <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for the putative endo-1,4-β-xylanase were determined and represented on a Lineweaver-Burk plot.</p>
