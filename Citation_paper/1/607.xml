<title>Background</title>
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen with no approved therapeutics and only limited diagnostics available. To address this gap, six mouse single-chain antibodies (scFvs) to ZIKV envelope (E) protein were isolated rapidly and efficiently from a ribosome-displayed antibody library constructed from the spleens of five immunized mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Results</title>
<p>In this report, we have generated a panel of mouse scFvs to ZIKV E protein using ribosome display. The six scFvs demonstrated no cross-reactivity with DENV2 NGC envelope protein, suggesting specificity for ZIKV E protein. These scFvs showed differences in their affinity: two (scFv45-3, scFv63-1) of them were dominant after four rounds of panning, and showed higher affinity (an apparent Kd values from 19 to 27 nM) than the other four (scFv5-1, scFv7-2, scFv38-1, and scFv51-2). All six scFvs showed ZIKV-neutralizing activity in the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay and their neutralizing activity was positively correlated with their affinities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>The scFvs (45–3 and 63–1) with highest affinity may have dual utility as diagnostics capable of recognizing ZIKV E subtypes and may be further developed to treat ZIKV infection. Our approach has the added advantage of generating Fc receptor-deficient antibodies, minimizing concern of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The recent ZIKV outbreak is a health crisis with global repercussions. Rapid spread of the disease within the epidemic regions coupled with migration of infected persons has underscored the need for rapid, robust and inexpensive diagnostic tools and therapeutics. There are very few readily available monoclonal antibodies for ZIKV, severely limiting development of antibody-based diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref001">1</xref>]. Experimental antibody-based therapeutics in animal models have shown that some antibody preparations are protective, but others enhance ZIKV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref004">4</xref>]. This is due to the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which non-neutralizing antibodies enhance viral infection via interaction of the antibody constant region with cellular Fc receptors. Additional concerns exist regarding potential ZIKV mutants, which may not be detected by or treated with specific monoclonal antibodies. Currently, there is no approved vaccine or therapeutic for ZIKV infection. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop neutralizing anti-ZIKV single -chain antibodies (scFvs) for potential diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p>Ribosome display of antibody libraries has provided a powerful tool for the selection of mAbs and scFvs to important viral pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref007">7</xref>]. This display technology allows for rapid <italic>in vitro</italic> selection and evolution of antigen-specific antibodies from large antibody libraries in a cell-free system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref011">11</xref>] and high affinity antibodies with desired specificity can be isolated by panning on the antigens of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref013">13</xref>]. Because of small size, homogeneity and ease of genetic manipulation, scFvs offer significant benefits over traditional monoclonal antibodies, such as speed of development, consistency, and ease of optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref017">17</xref>]. Additionally, concerns over ADE are eliminated with scFvs, since they lack the Fc region that is required for enhanced disease. However, their utility may be limited by the presence of HAVH autoantibodies in many patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we generated six unique neutralizing scFv antibodies against the ZIKV E protein from the spleens of immunized mice by antibody ribosome display technology. The resulting antibodies have been characterized in a range of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays which demonstrate diagnostic and therapeutic potential.</p>

<title>Antibody library construction</title>
<p>Total spleen RNA was prepared as described by Azizi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref020">20</xref>]. Mice spleens were minced and homogenised in 10 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen). The total RNA pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 500 μl of nuclease-free water (stored at -80°C). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from approximately 25 μg of total RNA using a SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) following the manufacture’s instructions provided.</p>
<p>For antibody library construction, the PCR primers were based on published sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref020">20</xref>] with minor modifications (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205743.s002">S1 Table</xref>). The primers were designed to introduce in-frame NcoI and NotI restriction sites to the 5’ end of the heavy-chain (VH) sequence and to the 3’ end of the light-chain (VL) sequence, respectively. The VH_F/VH_R and VL_F/VL_R sets of primers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205743.s002">S1 Table</xref>) were used for PCR amplification of VH and VL gene segments using the cDNA template. The VH_R and VL_F set of primers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205743.s002">S1 Table</xref>) were used to introduce overlapping sequences which enabled the scFv gene fragments to be assembled by overlap extension PCR and these primers encode a 20 amino acid linker sequence (G<sub>4</sub>S)<sub>4</sub>. Amplified VH and VL PCR products were gel purified and pooled. An aliquot of VH and VL templates was subjected to overlap extension PCR amplification using Link to introduce Strep II tag and Kozak sequence on the 5’ end and an overlap extension on the 3’ end to facilitate joining to the variable heavy-chain libraries using MVKR and KzSTREPII. Finally, the PCR product encoding all the variable heavy-chain and light-chain combinations was amplified with primers RDT7 and MVKR to introduce T7 site into Strep tag II-conjugated VH-VL library and to produce the DNA encoding the anti-ZIKV immunoglobulin scFv libraries. The initial PCR amplification reactions were performed at a 52°C annealing temperature with 30 cycles, and the subsequent library assembly step used 16 cycles with <italic>GoTaq</italic> DNA polymerase and 20 pmol of each primer pair per reaction. DNA fragments were resolved by gel electrophoresis on 1% (wt/vol) agarose gels. DNA isolation from agarose gels was carried out following QIAquick DNA gel purification kit instructions. The final purified PCR product ~0.8 kb is a template for Ribosome Display.</p>

<title>Cell-free ribosome display technology</title>
<p>To select specific antibody fragments, we have used a modified eukaryotic ribosome display with slight modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref021">21</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription and translation reaction was based on a coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega’s TNT quick-coupled transcription-translation system) and performed according to the supplier’s protocol. The PCR-generated DNA library of antibody-coding genes derived from the spleens of five mice were expressed in this lysate system. Briefly, 50 μl of transcription/translation mixture containing 40 μl of TNT T7 Quick Master Mix, 2 μl of DNA library (0.1 to 1.0 μg), 1 μl (1 mM) of methionine, 1 μl of DNA enhancer, and 6 μl of water were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 90 mins. Then, 5 μl of RNase-free DNase I (Roche) (2,000 U/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 mins at 30°C (in order to remove the DNA template so that subsequent PCR only picks up pulled down RNA sequences).</p>
<p>To select specific antibody fragments the 0.5 ml PCR tubes were coated with 1 μg/ml of the recombinant ZIKV E protein in 100 μl PBS at 4° C overnight. Protein coated tubes were washed with PBS and blocked with 100 μl of molecular biology grade bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS (10 mg/ml) (New England Biolabs) for 1 hour at room temperature. The translation/transcription mixture [containing the protein-ribosome-mRNA (PRM) complexes] was added to the washed and blocked protein-coated tubes and incubated on ice for 1 hour. The PCR tubes were washed three times with ribosome display washing buffer (PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20, 5 mM Mg acetate and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) and two times quick wash with ice-cold RNase-free water, and the retained RNA (antibody sequences) subjected to the following recovery process; <italic>in situ</italic> Single-Primer RT-PCR Recovery was performed in the PCR tubes carrying selected ARM complexes using a SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA). The obtained cDNA was amplified in a 25 μl PCR mixture for 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 65°C, and 1 min at 72°C, and 10 mins at 72°C with MKR and KzStrep II using <italic>GoTaq</italic> DNA polymerase (Promega, USA). The RT-PCR product from a single round of ribosome display was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified PCR products were used for the next round of ribosome display.</p>

<sec id="sec012">
<title>Cloning, expression and purification of an anti-ZIKV E scFvs</title>
<p>The RT-PCR product from a fourth round of ribosome display was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (T-Cloning Kit, Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ligation products were transformed in pGEM-T Easy vector <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells (XL1-Blue) and positive colonies (~100) were chosen by blue-white selection and confirmed by DNA sequencing using T7 and SP6 standard primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205743.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Based on the sequencing results, the clones in right reading frame without stop codon were chosen for prokaryotic expression.</p>
<p>For the construct of scFvs, DNA was amplified with the forward primer, KzStrepII <monospace>5’CGAATTCCA<bold><underline>CCATGG</underline></bold>CCTGGAGCCATCCGCAGTTCGAGAAGACCGGCAGCGG3’</monospace> (with an NcoI restriction sequence highlighted in bold) and the reverse primer, MVKR <monospace>5’AGT<bold><underline>GCGGCCGC</underline></bold>ATCAGCCCGTTTTATTTCCAA3’</monospace> (with an Not I restriction sequence highlighted in bold). Both set of primers allow these two amplicons to be subcloned into a pET32a-His vector and were transformed into Rosetta Gami (DE3) <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain and plated onto LB agar plate with 100 μg/ml of carbenicillin, and grown at 37°C for 16 hours. The molecular weight and isoelectric points were predicted using ExPASy bioinformatics resource portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/" xlink:type="simple">http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref022">22</xref>]. Next day, five colonies were inoculated in 3 ml of LB media with the same antibiotics and grown at 37°C with 225 rpm shaking for 16–18 hours and the positive clones were selected by restriction analysis with NcoI and NotI and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The 3 ml overnight culture was used to prepare a glycerol bacterial stock and inoculated into 200 ml of LB medium containing the same antibiotics and grown at 37°C with shaking at 225 rpm until OD<sub>600</sub> reached between 0.4–0.6. The culture was briefly chilled on ice to 25°C and the cells were induced by the addition of IPTG (final concentration 1 mM) and were incubated for 12 hours at 25°C with shaking.

Cells were lysed by sonication on ice (6x30 seconds), and were centrifuged at 14,000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 mins to remove cellular debris. The soluble fraction was filtered through 0.2μm filters and applied to HisTrap excel 1ml column (GE Life Sciences, USA). The column was equilibrated and washed with 20 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole pH 8.0 and the sample was eluted 20 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0 in one elution step. The purification was carried out at a constant flow of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected through the elution step. The purified protein fractions were kept at 4°C.</p>

<title>Analysis of purified scFvs</title>
<p>Binding specificity and cross-reactivity of anti-ZIKV scFv antibodies was determined in ELISAs. Nunc Polysorp ELISA plates were coated with target ZIKV E or DENV2 envelope protein antigens (200 ng/well) overnight at 4°C, blocked with 2% BSA at 37°C for 1 hour and incubated with anti-ZIKV scFvs in 1% BSA. Anti-ZIKV E antibody (Alpha Diagnostic Intl Inc., USA) and anti-Dengue Virus Type II Antibody were used against ZIKV E and DENV2 (NGC) E proteins as positive controls, respectively. Mouse anti-EBOV scFv4-2 (unpublished data) was used as negative control. After 1 hour incubation at 37°C, plates were washed five times and scFv was detected with 3:10 000 dilution of HRP-conjugated Rabbit anti-strep tag II polyclonal antibody (Genscript, USA) in PBS containing 1% BSA and incubated at 37°C for 30 mins. After washing and tap drying, 100 μl of TMB substrate was added to each well and the plate was allowed to incubate for 15–30 mins at 25°C. The reaction was stopped with 0.18M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and absorbance reading was measured at 450nm and these values were transformed using GraphPad Prism 5 software.</p>
<p>To determine binding affinity (an apparent Kd), scFvs were tested for binding to the protein ZIKV E (200 ng/well) at a concentration range of 200 nM to 0.01 nM. ELISAs were performed as described above.</p>

<p>Vero-E6 cells were seeded onto 12-well plates and incubated at 37°C for 12–24 hours to 90% confluency. A 50–100 pfu/200 ul dilution of ZIKV (Asian genotype, strain PRVABC59) in media in sterile Eppendorf tubes was made in media and mixed with equal volumes of 2-fold dilutions of scFvs. This mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1–1.5 hours, added to cells, and incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Media was aspirated from the wells, and cells washed once with PBS. 1 ml/well of viral overlay media (equal volumes of 2% Agarose and 2 X Modified Eagle’s Media with serum) was overlayed on cells, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 5–7 days. The cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for at least 2 hours. After aspiration, the plate was turned upside down and the agarose overlay gently teased loose with a metal spatula and discarded without damaging the cell monolayer. The monolayer was gently washed with water to remove residual agarose. 0.5% Crystal violet was added to well for 1–2 min, the wells dried, and plaques counted manually.

<p>We have identified six promising scFv clones (5–1, 7–2, 38–1, 45–3, 51–2 and 63–1) by indirect ELISA; all other scFv antibodies were negative (data not shown). To determine whether the recombinant scFvs could bind specifically to their corresponding ZIKV E protein, we examined the six soluble, purified scFv antibodies by ELISA assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205743.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). They reacted only with the specific ZIKV E protein that was used to screen the library and did not cross-react with the flavivirus DENV2 virus NGC strain E protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205743.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). scFvs 45–3 and 63–1 showed the highest reactivity while scFv 5–1 showed the lowest reactivity. The reactivities of 7–2, 38–1 and 51–2 ranked lower than those of 45–3 and 63–1, in that order.</p>
<p>Sequence analysis indicated that many unique specific scFv clones were isolated by ribosome display selections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205743.s002">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205743.s003">S2 Table</xref>). The heavy chain and light chain gene families of the isolated clones (5–1, 7–2, 38–1, 45–3, 51–2 and 63–1) were designated based on VBASE2 Ig database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dnaplot.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.dnaplot.com</ext-link>), indicating all the sequenced clones are mouse immunoglobulin genes and germline-derived (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205743.s003">S2 Table</xref>). The heavy chains of scFv 38–1, 45–3 and 63–1 belong to the VJ558 VH1 gene family and that of 5–1 and 51–2 belongs to the VSM7 VH14 gene family, whereas 7–2 belongs to the VSM7 VH14 gene family. The light chain of scFv7-2 and 63–1 belongs to IGKV2 subgroup and those of 5–1, 38–1, 45–3 and 51–2 belong to IGKV1, IGKV12/13, IGKV4/5, and IGKV21 subgroups, respectively. scFv5-1 and scFv51-2 have the same VH sequences (heavy chain), but they have different VL sequences. As expected, most of the clones represented different germline VH segments and also had somatic hypermutations; these clones had distinct combinations of heavy and light chains.

<title>ZIKV plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to measure neutralizing scFv antibody activity</title>
<p>The six scFvs were characterized for ZIKV neutralization by a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Three hundred microliters of ZIKV (Asian genotype (PRVABC59) were incubated with an equal volume of media containing each scFv at varying concentrations at room temperature for 1 hour. After addition of the ZIKV/scFv mix, cells were cultivated for 5–7 days, and plaques were visualized and counted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205743.s004">S3 Table</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205743.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows the results of PRNT using each scFv. All six scFvs showed neutralizing activity against ZIKV, whereas an irrelevant control scFV antibody did not block ZIKV infection. scFvs 45–3 and 63–1 completely inhibited the ZIKV infection at a concentration of 50 μg/ml and reduced the number of plaques by 80% at a concentration of 20 μg/ml whereas 7–2, 38–1 and 51–2 completely blocked the ZIKV infection at a concentration of 100 μg/ml and reduced the number of plaques by 80% at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. scFv5-1 did not inhibit completely ZIKV infection at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. The scFvs were thus able to potently inhibit ZIKV infection, with 50% inhibition occurring at titers of 68.7 μg/ml (for scFv5-1), 20.1 μg/ml (for scFv7-2), 14.5 μg/ml (for scFv38-1), 12.9 μg/ml (for scFv45-3), 17.0 μg/ml (for scFv51-2) and 10.1 μg/ml (for scFv63-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205743.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A diverse set of mouse scFvs can be obtained rapidly and efficiently from a ribosome antibody library generated from immunized mice. In this study, we isolated six different ZIKV neutralizing mouse scFvs (5–1, 7–2, 38–1, 45–3, 51–2, and 63–1) by ribosome display of the antibody library generated from the spleens of five mice immunized with ZIKV. The scFvs 5–1, 7–2, 63–1, 38–1 and 45–3 have highly homologous VL sequences, whereas 51–2 has a ~35% different VL sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205743.s001">S1 Fig</xref><bold>)</bold>. Importantly, these scFvs have markedly divergent VH sequences including CDRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205743.s002">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205743.s003">S2 Table</xref>), and also showed binding and neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205743.g004">Fig 4</xref>) against the PRVABC59 strain of the Asian lineage (from the current outbreak). Therefore, these mouse scFvs may recognize different ZIKV epitopes with differential affinity that differ in accessibility or in their roles during infection. Indeed, the six scFvs demonstrated good ZIKV-binding capability and specificity (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205743.g003">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205743.g004">4A</xref>). scFv63-1 and scFv45-3 had the highest and second highest affinity, respectively, whereas scFv38-1 and scFv51-2 had moderate affinity and scFv5-1 and scFv7-2 antibody had the lowest affinity, reflecting that the panning was efficient in selecting a range of clones. These six clones didn’t show cross-reactivity with other flavivirus DENV2 E protein, suggesting specificity for ZIKV E protein. Zhao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref023">23</xref>] reported that five of the mAbs (ZV-2, ZV-48, ZV-54, ZV-64, and ZV-67) bound to recombinant ZIKV E DIII (domain III of ZIKV envelope protein) in a direct ELISA and were ZIKV-specific and in contrast, ZV-13 was cross-reactive to DENV1-4. Importantly, without <italic>a priori</italic> need of converting to full length IgG molecules, all six mice scFv antibodies neutralized live ZIKV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205743.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). A commercially available neutralizing anti-ZIKV antibody (ZKA64, Absolute Antibody, Oxford, UK, catalog # Ab00779-2.0) completely inhibited ZIKV MR766 infection in LLC-MK2 cells at the concentrations from 2 to 40 μg/ml, as demonstrated by Paul <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref004">4</xref>]. This is in good agreement with our findings, as we observed that scFvs 45–3 and 63–1 completely inhibited ZIKV infectivity at concentrations between 20 to 50 μg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205743.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Our approach has the added advantage of generating Fc receptor-deficient antibodies, minimizing concern of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.</p>
<p>ScFvs have been utilized against other infectious diseases. scFvs derived from vaccinated cynomolgus macaques were protective against the Ebola-related Marburg virus when tested in infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref024">24</xref>]. Similarly, a human scFv provided protection to mice infected with influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref025">25</xref>]. scFvs are also promising candidates for anti-cancer therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205743.ref026">26</xref>]. Therefore, scFvs are a potential therapeutic for ZIKV, due to their resistance to ADE, and could be used in diagnostics that can rapidly be generated as viruses evolve.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The antibody ribosome display technology is a versatile platform that allowed the rapid (4 weeks) identification and isolation of six high-affinity scFvs to ZIKV E protein. These antibodies bind with affinities between 19 and 514 nM an apparent Kd as measured by ELISA. These scFvs recognized neutralization site(s) on the ZIKV E protein with differential antigen-binding affinities. The scFvs (45–3 and 63–1) with highest affinity could be used in therapeutic settings or diagnostics.</p>
