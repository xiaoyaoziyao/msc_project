<abstract>
<p>Over the past century, personality theory and research has successfully identified core sets of characteristics that consistently describe and explain fundamental differences in the way people think, feel and behave. Such characteristics were derived through theory, dictionary analyses, and survey research using explicit self-reports. The availability of social media data spanning millions of users now makes it possible to automatically derive characteristics from behavioral data—language use—at large scale. Taking advantage of linguistic information available through Facebook, we study the process of inferring a new set of potential human traits based on <italic>unprompted</italic> language use. We subject these new traits to a comprehensive set of evaluations and compare them with a popular five factor model of personality. We find that our language-based trait construct is often more <italic>generalizable</italic> in that it often predicts non-questionnaire-based outcomes better than questionnaire-based traits (e.g. entities someone likes, income and intelligence quotient), while the factors remain nearly as <italic>stable</italic> as traditional factors. Our approach suggests a value in new constructs of personality derived from <italic>everyday human language use</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>What are the fundamental characteristics that make a person uniquely him or herself?</italic> Psychology has long tried to answer this question by deriving the latent factors that distinguish people, are relatively stable across time and populations, and predict meaningful outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref004">4</xref>]. While several different models of human personality exist, the most dominant model is the Big 5 or Five Factor Model, in which personality characteristics generally group into five factors: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism/ emotional stability, and openness/ intellect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref006">6</xref>]. The Big 5 is meant to summarize, at a broad level, characteristic behaviors that distinguish a person throughout different contexts of their daily life. It is typically assessed through a questionnaire, in which a person reflects on their typical thoughts and behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref005">5</xref>]. Such questionnaires only indirectly capture actual behavior and also suffer from systematic response biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>The rise of big data offers opportunities to study everyday behavior at a scale never before possible. Each day, people reveal aspects of their lives through words expressed online through social media, such as Facebook and Twitter. Leveraging this linguistic information, we derive a trait model based on everyday linguistic behavior. Our approach analyzes the words and phrases of tens of thousands of users and their millions of messages to infer a set of traits.</p>
<p>In line with trait theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref009">9</xref>], we seek a small number of generalizable and stable traits that capture meaningful differences between people. We call these <italic>behavior-based linguistic traits (BLTs)</italic>. Our method does not rely on any hand-crafted lexica or questionnaires and it scales well to leverage the large amount of data available on social media. While some have leveraged social media and open-vocabulary techniques to assess <italic>existing</italic> trait models—e.g., Big 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref005">5</xref>] of bloggers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref010">10</xref>] or Facebook users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref011">11</xref>], the dark triad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref012">12</xref>] using Facebook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref013">13</xref>]—to the best of our knowledge, none have attempted to <italic>infer</italic> the latent traits themselves.</p>
<p>We evaluate BLTs along two criteria:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p><bold>Generalizability</bold>: The factors need to be generalizable across a large variety of predictive tasks.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><bold>Stability</bold>: The factors should be relatively stable over time and populations. The factor scores of users over time should be correlated, at levels similar to cross-time and cross-population correlations of the Big 5.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The overall goal of this study is to determine if it is feasible to derive <italic>generalizable</italic> and <italic>stable</italic> traits from the behavior of social media language use. We produce <italic>BLTs</italic> using methods of matrix factorization. Then, we evaluate the extent to which the <italic>BLTs</italic> meet this criteria by considering their predictive validity, test-retest validity, dropout reliability, face validity, and ability to predict psychological variables (D<sc>epression</sc> S<sc>cores</sc>) and social-demographic variables (IQ, I<sc>ncome</sc> and L<sc>ikes</sc>).</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Personality theory and research has a long history of finding characteristics, factors, and aspects that distinguish people from each other. Although personality has been used in a myriad of ways, much of the research can generally be classified into two purposes: (a) Identifying the major constructs and factors that consistently distinguish groups of individuals, and (b) Predictive models that either predict personality traits from other characteristics or use personality to predict other variables. We further discuss each of these themes below.</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Modeling personality</title>
<p>Personality psychologists have long sought to identify fundamental characteristics that ideographically distinguish individuals yet also adequately cluster across groups of individuals to reveal consistent patterns of behavior. While there are multiple approaches for studying individual differences, the most dominant approaches are rooted in the lexical hypothesis, which suggests that key features of human personality will become a part of the language that we use to describe ourselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref014">14</xref>]. The importance of language in psychology is underscored by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref015">15</xref>]:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Language is the most common and reliable way for people to translate their internal thoughts and emotions into a form that others can understand. Words and language, then, are the very stuff of psychology and communication.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Consequently, a long line of work in personality psychology has sought to characterize individual differences based on words that people use. The Big 5 model arose by having people rate themselves across dictionary-based adjectives (e.g., I see myself as extraverted, enthusiastic; reserved, quiet), and then using factor analysis to group responses into a small number of factors. Early on, a lexicon of 18, 000 words that distinguish one person from another based on an English dictionary was proposed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref001">1</xref>]. Participants rated themselves on these characteristics, and numerous factor analyses revealed anywhere between three and 16 major factors. Other lexica and lists of adjective descriptors have also been developed and tested over the past century. Although there are some exceptions, across multiple questionnaires, cultures, and temporal periods, the Big 5 factors consistently appear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>As such, the dominant approach towards characterizing personality is based on hand-crafted lexica and dictionaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref004">4</xref>]. Psychologists have developed a variety of questionnaires that capture these personality traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref016">16</xref>]. People can easily reflect on their own personality, or others can provide an evaluation of that person’s personality using these questionnaires.</p>
<p>The five factors are hierarchical in nature, with the five factors underscored by aspects which are comprised of specific traits or facets, which reflect habitual behaviors, thoughts, emotions, and ways of responding to situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref017">17</xref>]. Personality questionnaires are meant to summarize everyday behavior, but represent a reflection based on self (or other) perceptions, rather than directly assessing everyday behavior as it occurs. Underlying characteristics better predict outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref018">18</xref>], but also are less consistent across individuals. As the Big 5 do successfully predict important life outcomes, they are useful in providing broad representations of relatively stable individual differences, at the expense of capturing behaviors that occur in everyday life.</p>
<p>Other approaches to personality assessment exist. For instance, narrative approaches to personality (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref019">19</xref>]) successfully provide rich idiographic descriptions of a person within their everyday context. However, such approaches are time and resource intensive, and thus only occur at small scale, making it a challenge to find common nomothetic constructs.</p>
<p>An initial attempt was made to use an open-ended approach to learn personality traits by extracting common themes from self-narrative texts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref020">20</xref>]. Using a dataset of 1, 165 open-ended self-descriptive narratives, a factor analysis was performed on the most frequently used adjectives to reveal latent factors. Latent factors were shown to correlate moderately with the Big 5 factors and suggested psychologically meaningful dimensions. The current study extends this work at much larger scale.</p>

<title>Predictive models of personality</title>
<p>Personality is interesting in part because it is predictive of meaningful life outcomes, including education and job success, social relationships, physical and mental health, and longevity (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref022">22</xref>]). Personality can also be predicted by other biological, social, psychological, and behavioral measures.</p>
<p>With recent advances in computational social science, researchers have sought to predict personality, as well as other psychosocial and demographic differences, amongst users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref031">31</xref>]. In this paper, we focus on work related to the description and prediction of personality from language on social media.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have analyzed social media data, including Facebook posts, text messages, and Twitter tweets, finding correlates of the Big 5 and other individual characteristics with language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref032">32</xref>]. Park et al. developed a language-based personality assessment based on Facebook language that predicted personality at similar levels to other methods of personality assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref029">29</xref>]. Golbeck et al. proposed a method to predict personality of a user based on their posts on Twitter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref026">26</xref>]. Sumner et al. proposed a method to predict dark personality traits, based on Twitter language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref027">27</xref>]. Plank and Hovy analyzed 1.2 million Tweets and proposed a model to predict Myers-Briggs personality types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>While successful, studies increasingly suggest various complexities. Iacobelli et al. analyzed bloggers and found that the best performing model combined multiple linguistic features, including stemmed bigrams and common words [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref010">10</xref>]. Notably, they also highlighted the need for more refined and complex linguistic features. Recent works show that moving beyond words and incorporating complex features like distributed sentence representations improve personality prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref031">31</xref>]. As a whole, studies suggest that language can predict personality, but simplistic models might fail to adequately capture the complexities of the human psyche.</p>
<p>While existing studies begin with personality models as the ground truth, the current study harnesses the power of social media data to examine traits that arise from the language itself.</p>

<title>Datasets</title>
<p>We used a dataset of 20,356,117 Facebook status messages over 152,845 distinct users obtained using a custom application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref033">33</xref>]. We filtered out all users who posted less than 1000 words overall, are over 65 years of age, or who claimed that they are not from the US. Additionally, we filtered out all messages that are not English.</p>
<p>Among these users, 49,139 have data on age, gender and their Big 5 personality scores (B<sc>ig</sc>5), based on 20 personality items from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref034">34</xref>] which comprises our final data set. A few sample messages are shown below:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p><monospace>goodbye to anybody i didn’t get to catch up with before i go away.</monospace></p>

<p>About 62.8% of the users in our dataset are female. The age distribution is skewed towards younger people with the median age of 22 years and a mean age of 25.49 years. While we believe that our derived latent factors should capture various ages and genders, we also investigate residualizing out demographic factors (age and gender). All messages were tokenized and stop-words (very frequent words like “the” or “is”) were removed in the pre-processing stage.</p>

<title>Factor generation</title>
<p>We considered several methods to learn our latent factors. Before describing our proposed method, we discuss a few alternative methods that we considered to learn the latent factors.</p>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Alternative methods</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p><bold>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)</bold>: We first modeled the compiled linguistic information from each user as a document and latent factors as topics. LDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref035">35</xref>] enables us to learn these factors (i.e., topics) that represent each person based on the corpus of the user’s text. Each user is then represented as a mixture over the learned factors. We used the MALLET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref036">36</xref>] toolkit to learn LDA factors, set <italic>α</italic> = 5, and enabled hyper-parameter optimization. We optimize the hyper-parameters every 20 iterations with a burn-in of 10 iterations. LDA represents each user as a probability distribution over topics (factors). Since factor scores are always non-negative and bounded by summing to 1, the scores per person have the undesirable quality that they are always negatively correlated with each other (e.g. a single person could never be high or low in all factors, a constraint that does not occur in typical factor analyses or reflect personality theory). This motivated us to explore approaches without such a bound for this first exploration of modeling a small number of traits from social media.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><bold>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)</bold>: We next considered SVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref037">37</xref>]. We specified a user-set (<inline-formula id="pone.0201703.e001"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0201703.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0201703.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M1"><mml:mi mathvariant="script">U</mml:mi></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>) and a finite set of vocabulary terms corresponding to those users (<inline-formula id="pone.0201703.e002"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0201703.e002g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0201703.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M2"><mml:mi mathvariant="script">V</mml:mi></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>). We constructed a term-user matrix <italic>M</italic> and computed a low-rank approximation of <italic>M</italic> using SVD.</p>
<p>While SVD does not have the drawbacks of LDA, we observed that a more general version of dimensionality reduction, “factor analysis (FA)”, demonstrates better empirical performance on predictive tasks and motivates FA as our proposed method to capture traits. As such, our proposed methodology draws on FA, rather than LDA or SVD.</p>
</list-item>

</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Proposed method: Factor analysis (FA)</title>
<p>Factor Analysis (FA) has long been a part of psychological research and the development of psychometric assessments. The method seeks to represent a set of variables as linear combinations of a small number of latent factors. Formally, given a matrix <italic>M</italic>, factor analysis seeks to learn latent factors <italic>F</italic> and a loading matrix <italic>L</italic> such that:
<disp-formula id="pone.0201703.e003"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0201703.e003g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0201703.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="block" id="M3"><mml:mtable displaystyle="true"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="right"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi>F</mml:mi> <mml:mi>L</mml:mi> <mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math></alternatives> <label>(1)</label></disp-formula>
where <italic>E</italic> represents an error matrix. While SVD seeks to learn factors that account for all of the variance, FA is more general and learns factors that account for the common variance but allows for some unexplained residual variance. In fact, SVD can be interpreted as a special case of Factor Analysis (FA) under the conditions of isotropic noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Typically in psychology, factors are estimated and then rotated to find the best fitting solution. We chose to use FA as an approach to identify latent user factors. We applied FA on the User-Term matrix and investigated various rotations of the loading matrix L to obtain potentially more interpretable factors. In our final models, we used a promax (oblique) rotation with equa-max rotation for all our experiments.</p>
<p>Using factor analysis, we extracted 5 factors. While we noted that a Scree test using acceleration suggested 3 factors, we consider 5 factors, so that we can make a fair comparison against Big5. We chose to extract 5 factors as a direct comparison to the Big5 model. For comparison, we also extracted 10 and 30 factors (aligning with 10 underlying aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref017">17</xref>] and 30 facets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref005">5</xref>]; results of these models are available in the Supplemental Information section. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201703.g001">Fig 1</xref> illustrates word clouds corresponding to the most and least correlated words for each factor (i.e., different language analysis; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref011">11</xref>]). The factors capture emotion words such as <monospace>life, heart, happiness, love</monospace> (see FA:F1(+)) and non-emotion words such as <monospace>week-end, school, work, tomorrow, tonight</monospace> (see FA:F1(-)). These observations suggest that our factors capture a variety of behavioral and psychological cues.</p>

<title>Differential analysis and convergent validity</title>
<p>We next explore how our derived factors relate with one another and with the B<sc>ig</sc>5, using Pearson correlation coefficients (r). If the factors are capturing real personality characteristics, they should be correlated to some extent with the personality factors that have dominated personality research. But if they capture unique variance, then correlations should only be low to moderate. They should also minimally correlate with one another. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201703.g002">Fig 2</xref>, the factors most strongly correlate with extraversion and openness. F4 demonstrates the strongest correlation, reflecting lower levels of conscientiousness. The F4 words are similar to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref032">32</xref>], with numerous swear words on the positive side and family, work, and relaxation words on the negative side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref032">32</xref>].</p>

<p>We also report the correlation of each individual factor with outcomes which we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201703.g003">Fig 3</xref>. In general, we note that each individual factor correlates slightly with outcomes but we also observe stronger correlations. Observe for example, that Factor F2 which appears to capture the behavior of teenagers correlates negatively with income. Furthermore, observe how Factor F4, which captures people who are offended (and use swear words) is negatively correlated with Satisfaction with Life (SWL).</p>

To give a couple of examples, Factor F1 captures traits of people who have a rich vocabulary and like to engage in deeper conversations. Note that people with these traits also like philosophy and like D<sc>alai</sc> L<sc>ama</sc>, T<sc>he</sc> A<sc>lchemist and</sc> TED. On the other hand, people with a low factor F1 score are not interested in theoretical discussions, have difficulty understanding abstract ideas, and like animated movies such as F<sc>inding</sc> D<sc>ory</sc>. Similarly note that factor F5 also captures openness and a liberal outlook, where people who have a rich vocabulary tend to vote for liberal political parties and watch/listen to NPR, PBS and T<sc>he</sc> D<sc>aily</sc> S<sc>how</sc>.</p>

<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201703.g005">Fig 5</xref> illustrates the effect of rotation on the factor structure.

For questionnaire-based outcomes, the B<sc>ig</sc>5 factors better predict SWL and depression than our factors. This is driven by strong correlations of SWL and depression with extraversion and neuroticism. The B<sc>ig</sc>5 also outpredicts our factors for the size of the friend network, which again is driven by strong correlations with extraversion. Notably, correlations are equivalent for the B<sc>ig</sc>5 and FA5 in predicting the additional personality questions (Big5Questions). In contrast, as highlighted in the table, our factors better predict income, IQ, and the user likes. For example, on the task of predicting L<sc>ikes</sc>, FA with 5 factors outperforms the baseline by 7 percentage points (60.11–52.6). It is worth emphasizing here that the task of predicting L<sc>ikes</sc> is a challenging task—it essentially involves 20 different classification tasks. Consequently, an improvement of 7 percentage points on this task is promising. Also note that adding age and gender as covariates improves predictive performance (compare FA5+D<sc>emog</sc> with FA5).</p>

<title>Stability</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201703.g006">Fig 6</xref> shows the factor correlations at subsequent time periods with the factor scores at the initial point (<italic>t</italic> = 0) over a common set of users. Four of the five factors demonstrate strong correlations, with some decline over subsequent periods, but generally are fairly stable. The exception is F3. The words in this factor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201703.g001">Fig 1</xref>) reflect Facebook behavior (e.g., paste, your status, repost) versus offline behavior (e.g., tomorrow, tonight, sleep, excited). In this case, we believe this factor is capturing less of a trait and more of a temporary “new Facebook user” state.</p>

<p>Finally, for the dropout analysis we computed the mean correlation among factors obtained over multiple runs where a random sample of 20% were dropped before learning the factors. We used the Hungarian algorithm to infer the mapping between factors across multiple runs. There was a very strong average correlation (0.94) among corresponding factors across multiple runs.</p>
<p>Both the test-retest analysis and dropout analysis supports the endurance of the factors across time and sub-populations.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>In this first exploration of deriving traits from human behavior manifest on social media, we left many questions unanswered. Our latent traits capture human behavior as revealed in the context of Facebook over 49, 139 US users which may not be generalizable across the globe. We leave it to future work to explore whether similar traits are observed in other contexts. Furthermore, while traditional methods suffer from response biases, our methods have others—for example, although Facebook is used by a majority of Americans there is still no doubt some selection biases in who is on it and people may be projecting how they want to be seen. We see such an approach as a supplement to traditional techniques. Finally, we did not directly address interpretability of our learned factors and did not explicitly impose stability constraints (and revealed we had one more dynamic state-like factor). On the other hand, our goal has been to determine the feasibility of deriving traits from social media behavior, rather than to propose a specific set of traits, akin to the big five, to be used across all contexts. We leave it to future work to rigorously analyze and address these aspects.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We proposed a method based on <bold>factor analysis</bold> to infer latent personality traits from the everyday language of users on social media. A person is “an organized, dynamic, agentic system functioning in the social world”, with characteristics, behaviors, feelings, and thoughts that are both consistent and variable across time and situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201703.ref043">43</xref>]. Individual differences have often been based on questionnaire items, which may not capture the richness of everyday human behavior.</p>
<p>Our method infers latent factors from linguistic behavior in social media—a medium that allows access to large sample sizes; unprompted access to user’s thoughts, emotions, and language; and data-driven approaches. We derived five factors from the language, and demonstrated that these factors are <italic>generalizable</italic> with good predictive power, and <italic>stable</italic> across time and sub-populations. We see this as a stepping stone to deriving a supplement to the popular Big Five personality traits based on large-scale behavioral data rather than questionnaire self-reports. We have demonstrated it is feasible to produce factors from social media language that have predictive and face validity, stability and sometimes generalize better than the Big Five.</p>
