<title>Background</title>
<p>While neural systems are known to respond to chemical and electrical stimulation, the effect of mechanics on these highly sensitive cells is still not well understood. The ability to examine the effects of mechanics on these cells is limited by existing approaches, although their overall response is intimately tied to cell-matrix interactions. Here, we offer a novel method, which we used to investigate stretch-activated mechanotransduction on nerve terminals of sensory neurons through an elastomeric interface.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>To apply mechanical force on neurites, we cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons on an elastic substrate, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), coated with extracellular matrices (ECM). We then implemented a controlled indentation scheme using a glass pipette to mechanically stimulate individual neurites that were adjacent to the pipette. We used whole-cell patch clamping to record the stretch-activated action potentials on the soma of the single neurites to determine the mechanotransduction-based response. When we imposed specific mechanical force through the ECM, we noted a significant neuronal action potential response. Furthermore, because the mechanotransduction cascade is known to be directly affected by the cytoskeleton, we investigated the cell structure and its effects. When we disrupted microtubules and actin filaments with nocodozale or cytochalasin-D, respectively, the mechanically induced action potential was abrogated. In contrast, when using blockers of channels such as TRP, ASIC, and stretch-activated channels while mechanically stimulating the cells, we observed almost no change in action potential signalling when compared with mechanical activation of unmodified cells.</p>

<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>These results suggest that sensory nerve terminals have a specific mechanosensitive response that is related to cell architecture.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mechanical force is known to affect a diversity of physiological areas at the cellular level including cardiac, fibroblast, bone, and vascular cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Wang1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Wang2">[3]</xref>. Mechanotransduction is a topic of increasing research interest, particularly to those in the neural sciences, due to the ability of physically based forces to induce neuronal changes that are directly responsible for a host of complex and integrated responses. Mechanoreceptors of sensory neurons localize in specialized or encapsulated nerve terminals, providing a mechanism of response to pain, touch, pressure, vibration, vessel stretch, and propriocecption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Gillespie1">[4]</xref>. However, while initial evidence suggests that mechanobiology applies strictly to nerve terminals in neurons, the manner in which these terminals sense and respond to mechanical signals is still not well understood. Furthermore, previous studies investigating the molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction in sensory neurons (by adopting neurite-free neurons to stimulate nerve terminals) used mechanical forces such as compression and hypo-osmotic stretch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Cho1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Drew1">[6]</xref>. This stimulus was applied directly on the soma of acute dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and generated an inward current detected via patch clamp recording <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Cho1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Drew3">[10]</xref>. Two recent studies measured pressure-activated currents on nerve terminals through the use of a glass pipette or a pressure jet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Hu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Sanchez1">[12]</xref>. As this is a nonspecific means of mechanically stimulating neural cells, this does not replicate a direct link to structural interactions, e.g., focal adhesions, found in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Geiger1">[13]</xref>. To our knowledge, no research attempt has been reported that examined stretch-activated mechanotransduction on neurites in dissociated neurons through a specific adhesion mechanism while providing control over the cell-matrix mechanical properties.</p>
<p>In our study, we first focused on developing an <italic>in vitro</italic> method to probe stretch-activated mechanotransduction and cytoskeletal structural links for nerve terminals in neurons. This allowed us to investigate the coupled behavior of mechanical stimulation and substrate interactions, with respect to cell structure, for affecting the critical neural function of action potential (AP) firing. To provide control over the mechanical stimulation and the cell-matrix interactions, we used polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has a highly cross-linked three-dimensional structure, and offers high elongation properties with a relatively low modulus. PDMS is composed of a silicone T-resin cross-linked by a mixture of vinyl-terminated PDMS (base) and trimethylsiloxy-terminated polymethylhydroxosiloxane polymers (curing agent) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Choi1">[14]</xref>. PDMS can be modified to have various elasticity properties, which is useful when using force as an influential parameter to understand cell signaling, since it allows for precise modulation of the PDMS down to a single kPa, an elasticity similar to that found in native tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Goffin1">[15]</xref>. The ability to modulate elasticity in the PDMS also provides for control over the amount of deformation that the substrate, and cells attached to the substrate, might experience under controlled deformations. We have, through this simple approach, leveraged material characteristics to emulate physiologically relevant interactions in nerve terminals experiencing mechanical stimulation for probing mechanotransductive response in DRG neurons.</p>

<title>Probing mechanotransduction in neurites through elastomeric matrix control</title>
<p>One goal was to build a PDMS culture-recording setup that allows for distal force application to nerve terminals through an elastic deformation with simultaneous recording of the consequent AP response on a neuron soma. To provide a system that would allow us to impose these mechanical forces, we first needed to successfully integrate our cell culture methodology with the indentation pipette force procedure and AP measuring techniques. First, PDMS substrates with low stiffness were fabricated to provide an elastic connection similar to what has been observed in living organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Balaban1">[16]</xref>. Next, we coated the PDMS with either fibronectin or poly-L-lysine and cultured neurons on the modified elastic surface; neurite out-growths were observed using this approach. To impose mechanical force, we used a micromanipulator to bring a blunt pipette into contact with the PDMS and deform the PDMS through a vertical displacement of the pipette at a location that was near to, but not on, the neurite. Through this approach, we mechanically stimulated the neurite extension, but did not impose non-specific mechanical stimulation on the cells; a schematic of this method is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g001">Figures 1a and 1b</xref>. While the displacement of the pipette was vertical, the deformation of the substrates caused a stretching of the cell along its cell-substrate interface, as the cell was attached to the substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004293.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Mechanical stimulation on this single neurite increased with increases in the indentation depth (the relationship of indentation depth to force application is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004293.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Thus, we were able to apply force on DRG neurites via specific attachments due to the molecular coating-substrate interactions. This also minimized direct probe interaction with the cells, which could be detrimental to cell function. We next demonstrated that the condition of whole-cell patch recording was stable and reliable when the PDMS was indented. The effect of indentation on serial or input resistance was minimal (&lt;30%). In addition, the indentation did not rupture the soma or neurites via visualization with lucifer yellow (n = 5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004293.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Before and during the application of mechanical stimulation, we recorded the evoked AP or the change of membrane potential on the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g001">Fig. 1c,d</xref>).</p>

<title>Experimental setup for using elastomeric substrates to probe mechanotransduction in neurites.</title>
<p>a,Schematic of the mechanical stretching imposed on neurites in the recording chamber. DRG neurons cultured on a PDMS substrate were recorded with a recording pipette. Force on the neurites was generated by indenting the PDMS substrate with a glass pipette. The force from the indenting pipette was transmitted through the substrate to the cell. The signal from a DRG neuron was recorded through a whole-cell patch clamp set-up. b, An image of the system used to record stretch-evoked AP from neurites. The recording was performed in a recording chamber (asterisk) constantly perfused with ACSF. The neuron was connected to a recording pipette (white arrowhead) that was attached to a pre-amplifier. The neurites were stretched by the pipette (white arrow) indentation that was controlled with a micromanipulator. c, When the indentation pipette (white arrow) was placed on the surface of PDMS substrate near the neurite, no AP was generated (inset). d, As the pipette indented the PDMS through a vertical displacement (micromanipulator), a change in intensity in the differential interference contrast (DIC) image at the location of the pipette was observed (black arrow). This indentation, which imposed a force on the attached cell, evoked an AP (inset).</p>

<title>Effect of ECM and neurites on stretch-activated mechanotransduction</title>
<p>The response of cells is often directly related to ECM interactions occurring between the cell and the substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Tom1">[17]</xref>. Thus, we probed these interactions by using poly-L-lysine and fibronectin, which have different cell adhesion characteristics. We found that the specificity of the cell-to-ECM interactions had a pronounced effect on the response of neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). We quantified the AP for cells when cultured with different substrate conditions to probe neurite response (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004293-t001">Table 1</xref>). Only the neurite-bearing neurons can display an evoked AP. In contrast, for neurite-free neurons, neither was an AP evoked nor was membrane potential altered during the application of mechanical stimulation at a 100 µm distance from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Even when the indentation was close to the soma (within 30 µm), the mechanical stimulation only caused limited changes of membrane potential (&lt;10 mV) for neurite-free neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Whole-cell patch recordings were performed in DRG neurons in 2-day culture with poly-L-lysine. All neurons were neurite-free.

<p>We found that mechanical stimulation of neurites cultured on PDMS substrates that were coated with poly-L-lysine induced an AP in only 35% of DRG neurons (n = 40) after day 5 of cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g002">Fig. 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004293-t001">Table 1</xref>). Indentation of the PDMS did not induce an AP in neurons without neurite outgrowth by day 2 (n = 20), although most neurons did not exhibit outgrowth of neurites at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast, we found that fibronectin coating on PDMS substrates largely facilitated neurite outgrowth of cultured DRG neurons, with neurite extensions visible after only 2 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>). Fibronectin on the other hand did not promote an increase in the number of glia cells by day 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004293.s006">Table S1</xref>). Furthermore, at only 2 days of culture on fibronectin-coated PDMS, 26.7% of the DRG neurons (n = 30) had an AP under mechanical stretching, which was an improvement from 7.5% of the DRG neurons (n = 40) after 1 day, even with limited observable neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004293-t001">Table 1</xref>). Not only did DRG neurons cultured on fibronectin extend neurites between days 1 and 2, but the number of them that responded to stretch via AP also increased. Furthermore, a lower threshold for the induction of an AP in these cultures was observed (213 vs. 160 µN). It is noted that although the stretch-induced AP was only found in neurons with neurite-outgrowth, a subset of neurite-bearing neurons (10/18 in D2+F group) did not display either AP induction or a change of membrane potential in response to stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>). Due to a robust AP response found in 44.4% (8/18) of neurite-bearing neurons, we subsequently used fibronectin coating after 2 days for additional studies.</p>

<title>Involvement of cytoskeletal structure</title>

We first investigated microtubules since they are a significant component of neurons and are heavily involved in many signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Dent1">[18]</xref>. We mechanically stimulated neurons and recorded the AP in a manner similar to the previous experiments outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g001">Figure 1</xref>. We then used nocodazole to interfere with the polymerization of microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Rhee1">[19]</xref> and recorded the AP signaling under mechanical stimulation. We observed that nocodazole abrogated the stretch-evoked action potentials in 100% of the tested neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g005">Fig. 5c</xref>). As it was evident that at least one of the cytoskeletal components, i.e., microtubules, influenced AP firing, we then proceeded to examine another major cytoskeletal constituent, actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Rhee1">[19]</xref>. We first mechanically activated the neurons and then incubated them with cytochalasin-D or latrunculin-A, both of which affect the polymerization of actin filaments. The stretch-evoked action potentials were suppressed in all neurons following this actin cytoskeleton modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g005">Fig. 5d,e</xref>). To examine the reversibility of the signal, we followed the addition of the agent and mechanical stimulation with a continuous washing procedure (lasting for 3 minutes) to remove the cytoskeletal modifiers via bath-perfusion as previously published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Piao1">[20]</xref>. We sought to probe the response of the neuron after the wash-out to investigate whether they remained functional for AP signaling. After the washing procedure, we mechanically stimulated the cell again. This time, no AP firing was observed, although the cells were still responsive as determined by a follow-on current injection to the cell, which evoked a well characterized AP response. We further confirmed that the effect of nocodazole, cytochalasin-D, and latruculin-A were due to the depolymerization of the cytoskeleton and not the inhibition of voltage-dependent ion channels, as the neurons were still capable of firing APs through current injection even after being subjected to inhibiting cytoskeletal modifiers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004293.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). None of cytoskeleton modification agents altered the resting membrane potential of neurons.</p>

<title>Effect of mechanosensitive channel blockers</title>
<p>After determining that mechanical response was linked to the specificity of the ECM and the cytoskeleton, we were interested in examining whether there was a link involving mechanosensitive ion channels.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our studies have shown that neural action potential firing through nerve terminals is linked to specific mechanical deformation and extracellular matrix interactions. Since ECM-interfacing neurite outgrowth on soft substrates has been linked to integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Matthews1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Robles1">[29]</xref>, this suggests the potential for the transmission of mechanical stimulation through transmembrane integrins in nerve terminals. The integrin pathways is known to be critical in a diversity of mammalian cells types as being part of the focal adhesion complexes that are linked to mechanotransduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Alenghat1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Ingber1">[31]</xref>. While the exact mechanism for the activation is not known even in highly studied cells in mechanical environments such as endothelial and cardiac cells, the overall link is known to exist due to the signaling pathways such as MAPK that are activated under mechanical stimulation. The presence of direct molecular links to integrins such as with RGD in supporting physiological structures including the basement membrane is one reason for this mechanistic link to be pursued. As the integrins are transmembrane they provide a link from the extracellular interactions directly into the intercellular structures such as the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton has been shown to be linked to the responses in a diversity of cells and responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Wang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Shafrir1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Chien1">[33]</xref>. Thus, disrupting these structural links within living cells often alters or abrogates critical cell functions. This has similarities in AP response where while the exact mechanism has not been demonstrated, the response has been shown to be related to mechanical stimulation and also the cytoskeleton here. While the actin/microtubule inhibitors effectively abolished the stretch-induced AP response in all neurite-bearing neurons, a washout of the drugs did not confer a reversible AP response to stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The reason is that although the drugs were washed out, the effects of the actin/microtubule inhibitors were not reversible in our recording system, which was usually completed in 30 minutes and not reliable beyond 1 hour since actin filaments and microtubules need extended time (hours) to repolymerize into more fully developed and functional forms.</p>
<p>While previous studies on mechanosensory transduction used sensory neurons cultured on coverslips coated with non-specific attachment proteins including poly-L-lysine, such conditions for other cell types have shown significantly different responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Greve1">[34]</xref>. In each of our studies, we found that neurons cultured on PDMS coated with fibronectin promoted neurite extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The neurons in these cultures also exhibited a lower threshold of stretch-activated action potentials when compared to neurons cultured upon a poly-L-lysine coating, implying that cell-ECM interactions are extremely important in neural mechanotransduction.</p>
<p>While displacements on nerve terminals with poly-L-lysine/laminin-coated coverslips have previously been observed to display mechano-sensitive currents 92% of the time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Hu1">[11]</xref>, only 44.4% (8/18 of D2+F) of neurite-bearing neurons cultured on fibronectin-coated PDMS fired AP via distal stretch. The previous study used changes in pressure as the mechanical stimulus and there was not direct contact/linkage to the cell. Thus this approach had very little specificity in terms of ECM interactions. In addition, the discrepancy between these responses and the previously published experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Hu1">[11]</xref> could be due to the intensity of mechanical stimulation. The pressure that was used in the previous stimulation scenario was likely greater than the applied stress levels used in these studies, which may, at least partly, have been due to the stimulation mode(s) chosen (pressure vs. stretch). In addition, the substrate stiffness (glass vs. soft PDMS) could have had an influence, as stiffness has been shown to affect a variety of cell responses from motility to differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Lo1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Engler1">[36]</xref>. Furthermore, while mechanotransduction <italic>in vivo</italic> is functionally executed at the sensory nerve terminals projecting to peripheral tissues and cell bodies of primary sensory neurons have not been shown to be ordinarily mechanosensitive, most of the previous studies used neurite-free DRG neurons to probe the mechanical activation in testing whole-cell current response <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Cho1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Drew3">[10]</xref>. One advantageous manifestation of our culture system is that it implements an elastomeric substrate coated with fibronectin, which likely is more accurate in mimicking the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment for nerve terminals to sense mechanical forces.</p>
<p>In the PDMS culture-recording setup, although D5 groups had the highest response rate for mechanical stimulation when compared with the other groups, the culture condition also show a high density of neurites and glia cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, we using this created a challenge for stretching a single neurite and avoiding the glia cells. In contrast, the neurons of the D2+F group provided two major advantages to probe the distal force-mediated mechanosensory transduction. First, fibronectin promoted neurite outgrowth on PDMS by day 2 and the neurite outgrowth was in a low-density and trackable level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). We could easily stretch a single neurite through a non-contact indentation. Also, the indentation was applied 10–15 µm next to a neurite, so that the neurite would receive similar mechanical forces when the same indentation depth was applied. Second, fibronectin did not promote proliferation of glia cells on PDMS by day 2, since the ratios of glia cells to neurons in D2 and D2+F groups were similar, 2.7 vs. 2.8 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g002">Fig. 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004293.s006">Table S1</xref>). These densities of glia cells allowed us to avoid direct indentation on glia cells and minimize the effect of glia cells on the mechanosensory transduction. Moreover, the mechanical stimulation had little effect on membrane potential change since the indentation was displaced 100 µm away from the soma, in which the distal mechanical force could only alter less than 3 mV of membrane potential on a neurite-free neuron, even the neuron was surrounding with glia cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g003">Fig. 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). When the neurite-free neurons received larger mechanical force as the indentation was closer, they may have a larger change in membrane potential. Nevertheless, the neurite-free neurons only altered less than 10 mV of membrane potential when the indentation was displaced in 30 µm distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Likewise, the effect of distal force on glia cells should be minimal. Although glia cells and neurons were side-by-side on PDMS substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004293-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), when the indentation was displaced adjacent to glia cells, no AP was induced in neurite-free neurons in D2, D1+F, and D2+F groups. However, although unlikely, we still cannot totally exclude a possibility that the mechanotransduction of neurites was an effect of gliatransmitters, which can be released when the glia cells receive enough mechanical stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Newman1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>We conclude that the distal force-mediated mechanosensory transduction we observed in neurites is fibronectin-influenced, and that the cytoskeleton is both involved and required for AP firing. These findings have implications in a diversity of fields including mechanotransduction in neurons, neuron-material interactions, and neural tissue engineering.</p>

<title>Mechanical stimulation</title>
<p>We applied a mechanical force on the PDMS after first confirming that the neuron could be excited through the introduction of a voltage change and measurement of an AP. A flamed polished pipette (tip diameter ∼4 µm) was used to indent the PDMS for the generation of mechanical stimulation through deformation of the substrate. The indentation pipette was located approximately 100 µm away from the main cell body of the recorded neuron and imposed a displacement on the PDMS where there were no glia cells. If a visible neurite was observed, the indentation was displaced adjacent to (∼10–15 µm) the neurite extension, which allowed us to avoid nonspecific contact with the neurite and also provided specific control over the amount of indentation that was imposed on the PDMS for stimulating the cell. Indentation was controlled through the use of a micromanipulator (EMM-3SV, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) positioned at an angle of 45 degrees to the PDMS surface. The displacement was applied with a 10.42 µm step until an AP response occurred or a maximum total displacement of 125 µm was reached. When an indented depth activated an AP response, we always applied the same indentation force again to determine whether the stretch-activated AP was repeatable. The duration of a displacement lasted less than 1 second. A minimum of 30 seconds was used between each indentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004293-Drew2">[7]</xref>.</p>
