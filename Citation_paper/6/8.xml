          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Inhibition of the renin-angiotensinsystem (RAS) in hypertension causes differential effects on central and brachial blood pressure (BP), which has been translated into improved outcome. The objective was to examine if a more complete inhibition of RAS by combining an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and an angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) compared to monotherapy has an additive effect on central BP and pulse-wave velocity (PWV), which are known markers of CVD.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Sixty-seven CKD patients (mean GFR 30, range 13–59 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) participated in an open randomized study of 16 weeks of monotherapy with either enalapril or candesartan followed by 8 weeks of dual blockade aiming at a total dose of 16 mg candesartan and 20 mg enalapril o.d. Pulse-wave measurements were performed at week 0, 8, 16 and 24 by the SphygmoCor device.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Significant additive BP independent reductions were found after dual blockade in aortic PWV (−0.3 m/s, P&lt;0.05) and in augmentation index (−2%, P&lt;0.01) compared to monotherapy. Furthermore pulse pressure amplification was improved (P&lt;0.05) and central systolic BP reduced (−6 mmHg, P&lt;0.01).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Dual blockade of the RAS resulted in an additive BP independent reduction in pulse-wave reflection and arterial stiffness compared to monotherapy in CKD patients.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Markers of arterial stiffness such as aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV) and central blood pressure (BP) are known independent predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Blacher1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Covic1">[3]</xref>. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensinsystem (RAS) with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) has been shown to afford cardio-renal protection beyond the BP lowering effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Yusuf1">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Dahlof1">8</xref>. This may be due to preferential lowering of the central BP by the RAS blockers compared to other antihypertensives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Williams1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Hirata1">[10]</xref>. Central BP, which is markedly influenced by vascular stiffness, has been found to be a better predictor of cardiovascular outcome than the conventional brachial BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Wang1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Pini1">[13]</xref>. Treatment with combinations of ACEI and ARB in full doses would expectedly lead to a more complete blockade of the RAS than can be obtained with either drug group. Such dual blockade has been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on arterial wave reflection and PWV in resistant hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Mahmud1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Anan1">[15]</xref>. Surprisingly, in the recent ONTARGET study no beneficial effect of dual blockade on cardio-renal outcome was found in high risk cardiovascular patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Yusuf2">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, in another recent observational study dual blockade did not reduce cardiovascular death in chronic hemodialysis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Chan1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study it was investigated for the first time whether in CKD patients dual RAS blockade has an additive effect on central pressure waves and arterial stiffness evaluated by pulse-wave analysis (PWA) and PWV respectively, compared to mono RAS blockade, and whether these effects if present are BP independent.</p>

        <title>Study Population</title>
        <p>Sixty-seven patients, all Caucasians, from the outpatient nephrology clinic, Herlev University Hospital, 52 men and 15 women, mean age 60 (range 31–75) were enrolled in this open randomised cross-over trial from September 2005 to September 2009. All patients gave informed consent and the study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Copenhagen County. The authors adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and the study was monitored by the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) unit at Copenhagen University Hospitals, and was registered by EudraCT number 2005-001568-29 and in the public trial registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov" xlink:type="simple">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, registration number NCT00235287.</p>
        <p>The eligibility criteria for patients entering the study were pre-dialysis CKD with plasma creatinine between 150 and 350 µmol/l, plasma potassium below 5.6 mmol/l, systolic BP above 109 mmHg and age between 18 and 75 years. Patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA III-IV), chronic liver insufficiency, amputation of a limb or the presence of cardiac arrhythmia or a pacemaker were not included. None of the patients were to be treated with immunosuppressives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aldosterone antagonists or dual RAS blockade at the entry of the study.</p>
        <p>Seventy-two per cent of the patients were treated with ACEI or ARB before enrolment and thus were known RAS blockade tolerant. Additionally, most were treated with furosemide and non ACEI/ARB antihypertensive therapy, which were continued during the trial. Demographic data and renal diagnoses are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041757-t001">table 1</xref>.</p>

          <p><italic>All patients:</italic> After 16 weeks of monotherapy with either enalapril or candesartan, the complementary drug was added in incremental doses over a period of 5 weeks, aiming at reaching a combination of enalapril 20 mg and candesartan 16 mg and maintaining this full dose dual blockade for an additionally 3 weeks. The therapeutic goal was a systolic/diastolic BP of 130/80 mmHg or below according to the K/DOQI-guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-National1">[19]</xref>. Additional antihypertensive treatment was simultaneously reduced, discontinued or added as needed.</p>
          <p>During the 24 weeks study period, 10 control visits were planned: 4 visits in the laboratory, at which pulse-wave measurements were done and blood samples drawn, at the beginning of the trial and after 8, 16 and 24 weeks; 6 ‘clinical control’-visits in the outpatient clinic, at which BP was measured and blood samples drawn. All the visits were planned with an interval of 2–3 weeks throughout the study, so that 2 ‘clinical control’-visits were placed between two pulse-wave measurements. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated at the first and last visit in the trial by the plasma clearance of <sup>51</sup>Cr-EDTA as described below. Urinary albumin excretion/24 h was measured at each of the four visits of pulse-wave measurements.</p>

          <title>Measurements of pulse-wave analysis and pulse-wave velocity</title>
          <p>Measurements of PWA and PWV were performed using the SphygmoCor© device <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Pauca1">[20]</xref> (version 7.0, Atcor Medical, Sydney, Australia). All measurements were performed in the morning in the supine position after a minimum of 10 min rest in a quiet, temperature-controlled room. Patients were requested to be fasting and abstain from tea, coffee and smoking for 8 h and from alcohol for 24 h. Diabetic patients were allowed a light meal before examination. Study and other morning medication were to be taken 2 hours before measurements. The method of PWA and PWV measurement has been described in detail elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Laurent1">[21]</xref>. Briefly, PWA was done with the use of a validated general transfer function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Gallagher1">[22]</xref>. The central pressure waveform was estimated based on radial pressure waveform recordings, calibrated to a brachial BP on the same arm. PWV was calculated based on the pulse transit time divided by the travel distance. The PWV of the ‘aortic’ segment (aortic PWV) was recorded between the femoral and carotid artery and the PWV of the ‘brachial’ segment (brachial PWV) was recorded between the radial and carotid artery. When determining the aortic PWV, the distance from the carotid recording site to the suprasternal notch was subtracted from the distance between the femoral recording site to the suprasternal notch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Weber1">[23]</xref>. When determining the brachial PWV, the distance from the carotid-suprasternal notch was subtracted from the distance between the radial-suprasternal notch.</p>
          <p>The quality demands of PWA and PWV were followed as suggested by the manufacturer. This included visually acceptable pulse-wave recordings with variations in pulse height, diastole and pulse length ≤5% and the mean pulse height ≥80 mV as expressed by a quality index (%) provided by the software. A quality index ≥80% was accepted. In case of PWV, the time difference between the ECG-signal and the signal from the recording sites should have a SD ≤10% of the mean value. All measurements of PWA and PWV were made in duplicate.</p>

        <p>The brachial BP used for calibration of PWA and all other brachial BPs were measured by use of a mercury sphygmomanometer after at least 10 min of supine rest. The mean of the last two out of three BP measurements were averaged and used for analysis. Plasma creatinine was analyzed using reagents from Vitros Chemistry 5.1, which are compatible with the IDMS method (isotope dilution mass spectrometry). Plasma potassium and other clinical chemistry parameters were measured using standard methods.</p>

The effects of dual therapy and monotherapy on pulse-wave measurements were analyzed by general linear models for repeated measurements.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The main finding of this study is the BP independent reduction in arterial stiffness and pulse-wave reflection after combined treatment with enalapril and candesartan compared to monotherapy in patients with CKD. Furthermore pressure amplification was increased during dual blockade compared to monotherapy.</p>
      <p>Aortic PWV is considered a direct measure of arterial stiffness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Laurent1">[21]</xref> and is a strong independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and events in patients with ESRD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Blacher1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Pannier1">[29]</xref> and CKD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Covic1">[3]</xref>. We found a significant reduction in aortic PWV of 0.3 m/s during dual blockade independent of BP and corrected for age and gender. In contrast no significant change was seen in brachial PWV.</p>
      <p>Pulse-waves are in most studies analyzed by three parameters: central PP, central systolic BP and AIx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Laurent1">[21]</xref> of which all have shown independent predicting value of all-cause mortality in ESRD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-London1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Safar1">[30]</xref>. In one study, for each increase of AIx of 10%, the relative mortality risk was increased by 1,51 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-London1">[2]</xref>. We found a modest but significant reduction in the heart rate adjusted AIx (<email xlink:type="simple">AIx@HR75</email>) of 2% after dual blockade compared to a reduction during mono-blockade of 2% as well. Even after adjustment for known determinants of AIx as diastolic BP, height, gender and age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Laurent1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Lemogoum1">[31]</xref> the reduction in <email xlink:type="simple">AIx@HR75</email> was still significant. This reduction in <email xlink:type="simple">AIx@HR75</email> was related to the change in brachial PWV even though this change did not achieve statistical significance. This indicates that the reduction in the intensity of wave-reflection was the principal mechanism of the change in <email xlink:type="simple">AIx@HR75</email> caused by a dilatation of medium-sized muscular arteries and thereby a reduced brachial PWV. This relationship has been emphasized by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Nichols1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Dual blockade significantly reduced brachial and central systolic BP on average by 7 and 6 mmHg respectively on top of a decrease during monotherapy of 11 and 12 mmHg respectively. A significant increase in PP-amplification was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041757-g003">figure 3</xref>), indicating a larger effect of dual blockade on central BP than on brachial BP. This was despite the lack of proven significant changes in central or brachial PP which were most likely caused by a statistical error type II due to a limited number of patients. A lower pressure amplification indicates a higher left ventricular afterload because of higher central PP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Protogerou1">[33]</xref>. Thus the reduction of PP amplification has prospectively been shown to be a strong independent predictor of all-cause and CV mortality in ESRD and superior to central PP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Safar1">[30]</xref>. RAS-blocking agents have previously been shown to cause increased pressure amplification. London et al. reported an increase in amplification ratio from 1.0 to 1.13 after treatment with perindopril in patients with ESRD for 12 months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-London2">[34]</xref>. In hypertensive patients Dhakam et al. found an increase in PP amplification ratio from 1.38 to 1.42 after treatment with eprosartan for 6 weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Dhakam1">[35]</xref>. In our study, 8 weeks of dual blockade increased amplification ratio from 1.30 to 1.34.</p>
      <p>No previous studies have been conducted on the effects of dual blockade on pulse-wave measurements in CKD patients. A study of 18 hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with ACEI showed that add on valsartan reduced central BP more than brachial BP. A significant reduction in AIx of 13% was found after 2 weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Mahmud1">[14]</xref>. In contrast, the same group observed no further change in amplification in another study of 12 hypertensive patients with normal renal function, comparing the effects of valsartan, captopril and their combination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Mahmud2">[36]</xref>. Significant reductions of both the central and brachial BP were found, but to the same extent. Like us, they observed a BP independent additive reduction of AIx and aortic PWV during combination therapy compared to monotherapy. In a third study in 31 hypertensive patients with normal renal function, combining valsartan and perindopril did also further reduce PWV but without correction for BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Anan1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our patients had moderate to advanced CKD (stage 3–5) where inhibition of RAS can be a challenge due to loss of kidney function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Kamper1">[37]</xref> and hyperkalemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Palmer1">[38]</xref>. Ten patients were withdrawn from the study including two during the dual blockade period. Patients were closely monitored and incidences such as hyperkalemia and unacceptable increases in p-creatinine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Bakris1">[39]</xref> were carefully managed. Thus the full dose study medication of RAS blockers was reduced in 42% of the patients. We have previously reported on the feasibility of dual blockade in the first 47 patients of the study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-FrimodtMoller1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Reduction of BP is known to reduce arterial stiffness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Nichols1">[32]</xref>. The fact that the decrease in aortic PWV and <email xlink:type="simple">AIx@HR75</email> was independent of BP suggests that the decrease in arterial stiffness was caused by the direct effect of the drug on the vascular wall. The common feature of ACEI and ARB appears to be their dilating capacity on especially peripheral muscular arteries and their ability to reduce wave-reflections, as expressed by AIx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041757-Nichols1">[32]</xref>. Combination of ACEI and ARB might produce a more complete inhibition of RAS and enhance bradykinin accumulation resulting in increased endothelial NO production. Furthermore ANGII is known to cause cardiovascular remodelling and vascular hypertrophy, and it therefore seems likely that the action on vascular wall includes chronic inverse remodelling of the small arteries leading to improved viscoelastic properties. Because of the relatively short period of treatment in our study, the additive beneficial effects of dual blockade are probably caused by functional changes, but due to the BP independent findings structural changes cannot be excluded.</p>
      <sec id="s4a">
        <title>Study Limitations</title>
        <p>The cross-over design allowed for comparisons within the same patient. It would, however have been valuable with a control group treated with ACEI/ARB monotherapy parallel to the dual treatment period to rule out the time factor as a confounder. The period of dual blockade was deliberately not randomized, because of the crucial need for a cautious dose titration in each mono-therapy before start of dual blockade in these vulnerable patients, which necessitated the placement of the dual blockade treatment period in the end of the trial.</p>
        <p>There was no statistical difference between randomization arms, which allowed for analysis of data pooled together. We cannot though, exclude the possibility that inter-group differences did exist, but were not found due to small numbers in each randomization group. However, we consider, that by pooling data more powerful results were achieved.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>In CKD patients, combined RAS blockade with enalapril and candesartan caused additive significant BP independent reductions in aortic PWV and <email xlink:type="simple">AIx@HR75</email> compared to mono-therapy. Likewise, central systolic BP was reduced and PP-amplification was increased during dualblockade. As these are all independent predictors of cardiovascular mortality in CKD patients, the beneficial effects of dual RAS blockade found in this study might lead to a favorable effect on cardiovascular outcomes in CKD patients beyond that achieved by monotherapy.</p>
