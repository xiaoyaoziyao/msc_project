        <p>Bacterial chromosomes are organized into polycistronic cotranscribed operons, but the evolutionary pressures maintaining them are unclear. We hypothesized that operons alter gene expression noise characteristics, resulting in selection for or against maintaining operons depending on network architecture. Mathematical models for 6 functional classes of network modules showed that three classes exhibited decreased noise and 3 exhibited increased noise with same-operon cotranscription of interacting proteins. Noise reduction was often associated with a decreased chance of reaching an ultrasensitive threshold. Stochastic simulations of the <italic>lac</italic> operon demonstrated that the predicted effects of transcriptional coupling hold for a complex network module. We employed bioinformatic analysis to find overrepresentation of noise-minimizing operon organization compared with randomized controls. Among constitutively expressed physically interacting protein pairs, higher coupling frequencies appeared at lower expression levels, where noise effects are expected to be dominant. Our results thereby suggest an important role for gene expression noise, in many cases interacting with an ultrasensitive switch, in maintaining or selecting for operons in bacterial chromosomes.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In some species, most notably bacteria, chromosomal genes are arranged into clusters called operons. In operons, the process of transcription is physically coupled: a single pass of the RNA polymerase enzyme reading that region of the chromosome simultaneously produces messenger RNA encoding multiple proteins. So far, we do not have a satisfying explanation for what evolutionary forces have maintained operons on bacterial chromosomes. We hypothesized that different types of interactions between operon-coded proteins affect how strongly operons are selected for between two genes. The proposed mechanism for this effect is that operons correlate gene expression noise, changing how it manifests in the post-translational network depending on the type of protein interaction. Mathematical models demonstrate that operons reduce noise for some types of interactions but not others. We found that operon-dependent noise reduction has an underlying dependence on surprisingly high sensitivity of the network to the ratio of proteins from each gene. Databases of genetic information show that <italic>E. coli</italic> has operons more frequently than random if operons reduce noise for the type of interaction various gene pairs have, but not otherwise. Our study thus provides an example of how the architecture of post-translational networks affects bacterial evolution.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The organization of genes into operons is a prominent feature of bacterial chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Jacob1">[1]</xref> that appear in some eukaryotes as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Blumenthal1">[2]</xref>. An operon is typically characterized as a promoter followed by multiple genes that are cotranscribed so that each transcription initiation event produces a polycistronic messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding multiple gene products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Rocha1">[3]</xref>. Hypotheses explaining the emergence and maintenance of operons include proportional coregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Price1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Price2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Iber1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Ray1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Lim1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Laing1">[9]</xref>, horizontal transfer of intact “selfish” operons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Lawrence1">[10]</xref>, emergence via gene duplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Lawrence2">[11]</xref>, coproduction of physically interacting proteins to speed their association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Pl1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Dandekar1">[13]</xref>, evolvability of co-regulation for interacting protein products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Voigt1">[14]</xref>, and reduction of intrinsic noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Swain1">[15]</xref>. Current evidence favors some hypotheses more than others, but fails to indicate a definitive explanation for how operons are maintained in bacterial chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Price1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Lawrence2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Pl1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Dandekar1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Arising from stochasticity of individual biochemical reactions and low copy numbers of reactants per cell, intrinsic noise plays a central role in network dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-SilvaRocha1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-McAdams1">[17]</xref>. In bacteria, intrinsic noise is most evident in gene expression, caused by translational bursting arising from small numbers of mRNA producing many proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Paulsson1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Berg1">[19]</xref> and transcriptional bursting arising from slow activation-deactivation cycles of transcriptional activity by unknown mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Golding1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Mitarai1">[21]</xref>. Extrinsic noise, caused by uncertainties in global parameters and states including those characterizing transcriptional and translational machinery, also contributes to overall biochemical noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Swain2">[22]</xref>. Noise in protein levels is commonly characterized by coefficient of variation (CV), the normalized root-mean square deviation of the protein levels from their mean value (CV = σ/μ, where σ is the standard deviation and μ is the mean) but other measures such as autocorrelation and covariance between concentrations of different proteins can give additional insights.</p>
      <p>The effects of intrinsic noise on operon maintenance are not well characterized, but covariance between protein levels arising from intrinsic noise depends on transcriptional coupling (co-expression from an operon) of the corresponding genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Swain1">[15]</xref>. The order of genes within an operon may also affect noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Kovcs1">[23]</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesize that noise-related effects contribute to the evolutionary maintenance of operons. Studies of several specific systems corroborate that correlative effects of transcriptional coupling alter posttranslational dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Iber1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Lvdok1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Sneppen1">[25]</xref>. However, it is still not clear how different classes of protein interactions and co-expression from an operon may interact to alter biochemical noise.</p>
      <p>In this study we assessed these effects for different types of posttranslational interaction between gene products. In several types of interactions, the noise difference between cotranscribed and uncoupled configurations was amplified by the existence of a zero-order ultrasensitive switch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Goldbeter1">[26]</xref>. We related the results to an intact naturally occurring system with simulations of cotranscribed and uncoupled configurations of the <italic>lac</italic> operon. To test our predictions bioinformatically, we classified naturally occurring interacting pairs of <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins by their type of interaction and analyzed the effect of chromosomal distance between pairs of genes with interacting products. Finally, we used single-cell protein copy number data to determine differences in operon frequencies at high and low expression levels in <italic>E. coli</italic> for physically interacting protein pairs.</p>

        <title>Operons correlate intrinsic protein fluctuations</title>
        <p>Intrinsic gene expression noise is correlated in a cotranscribed two-gene configuration, but this correlation was not seen in an uncoupled configuration. Relationships between the fluctuations of two proteins can be quantitatively characterized by the covariance of concentrations for proteins <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> (<italic>σ<sub>AB</sub></italic>). Using the linear noise approximation (LNA; see Materials and Methods) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Paulsson1">[18]</xref>, , we calculated a normalized covariance<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002672.e001"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002672.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where angle brackets represent average copy-number of each molecular species, and <italic>τ<sub>mRNA</sub></italic> and <italic>τ<sub>protein</sub></italic> are the characteristic timescales of mRNA and protein decay. Increased covariance of cotranscribed genes is preserved regardless of whether the translation processes are coupled (with a single ribosome binding site for multiple genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>) and regardless of the source of intrinsic noise (from translational bursting only or from both transcriptional and translational bursting; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g001">Figure 1B–C</xref>). We hypothesized that positive covariance can increase or decrease CV in relevant network outputs depending on the nature of the interactions between two proteins.</p>

        <p>We surveyed databases of <italic>E. coli</italic> biochemical networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Kanehisa1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Keseler1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-GamaCastro1">[31]</xref> to identify simple two-gene modules of larger networks that represent different ways that two proteins can directly or indirectly interact. The modules represent simple models of the following interactions: catalysis of subsequent steps in a linear metabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), redundant catalysis of the same metabolic step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), catalysis of diverging reactions following a branch point in a metabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), redundant transcriptional regulation of a downstream gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), physical binding between two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), and covalent modification of one protein by another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). The list may not be fully comprehensive, but represents several classes of interactions between proteins that are building blocks of larger networks. For each module we constructed a mathematical model to calculate CV for interacting proteins transcribed from the same and different operons (hereafter referred to as cotranscribed and uncoupled configurations, respectively). We then determined differences in CV for relevant network outputs between cotranscribed and uncoupled configurations. The simulations were controlled by keeping the same mean and CV for total protein from each gene between configurations. The CV calculations were performed at stationary state, both numerically (stochastic simulation algorithm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Gillespie1">[32]</xref>) and analytically (LNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-vanKampen1">[28]</xref> using Paulsson's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Paulsson1">[18]</xref> normalization). The results of the simulations demonstrate that predicted differences in CV for each metabolic module depend on the type of interaction between proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>For the linear metabolic pathway module, cotranscription of two enzymes from the same operon results in lower CV for metabolic intermediate. Without transcriptional coupling, metabolic intermediate concentrations are prone to large spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s001">S1A, B, J, K</xref>). Notably, no significant differences between cotranscribed and uncoupled configurations are evident in metabolic product CV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that metabolic flux is not significantly different between the two groups. Intuitively, a spike occurs when flux from the upstream enzyme exceeds the maximal flux capacity of the downstream enzyme resulting in large increase of metabolic intermediate concentration. This increase exceeds the saturation point for the enzyme converting it to product, making product concentration insulated from these spikes.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the metabolic modules with redundant enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s001">S1C, L</xref>) and with a branch point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s001">S1D, M</xref>) show an increase in metabolite CV when the two enzymes are in the same operon. In these cases, lower correlations between enzyme fluctuations reduce the chance of simultaneous stochastic drops in concentration of both enzymes.</p>
        <p>Similarly, cotranscription of multiple (redundant) gene regulators from the same operon results in increased CV in the regulated gene as compared to the uncoupled regulator configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s001">S1E, N</xref>). Here, we assumed that the gene regulatory logic was an OR gate (i.e., each regulator by itself or both together would have the same effect). Noise in the output from AND gate logic (i.e., a multi-subunit regulator) is expected to follow the noise pattern of the physical interaction module (below).</p>
        <p>Consistent with a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Sneppen1">[25]</xref>, the physical protein interaction module under transcriptional coupling shows a strong reduction in fluctuations of monomer concentrations.

With strong binding, the concentration of each free monomer changes from nearly zero when its partner is in excess to a finite value when the monomer itself is in excess. These fluctuations are more common when the binding partners are not in the same operon, so the noise is therefore high. Cotranscription slightly increases heterodimer CV compared to the uncoupled configuration (species <italic>AB</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), but to a much lesser extent than its reduction of CV in monomer concentrations. In the limit of strong binding, nearly all of one monomer is bound, so the effect on monomer noise is dominant.</p>

        <p>To summarize, we found that differences in noise between cotranscribed and uncoupled configurations in stochastic simulations are qualitatively consistent with the analytical approach. Notably, in all the cases the magnitude of the differences in CV<sup>2</sup> between two configurations is proportional to the value of covariance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002672.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but in many cases the coefficient of proportionality is very large. This qualitatively suggests posttranslational interactions in some modules are capable of amplifying noise differences between cotranscribed and uncoupled proteins. However, the LNA method likely underestimates the magnitude of non-linear amplification. We further explore these amplification mechanisms in the next section.</p>

        <title>Ultrasensitivity arising in non-redundant protein interactions</title>
        <p>Timecourse simulations predict that uncorrelated fluctuations of the two enzymes in a linear metabolic pathway result in large bursts of metabolic intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). This suggests that higher noise in the transcriptionally uncoupled linear metabolic pathway arises at least in part from the increased probability of occasionally crossing an ultrasensitive threshold. Indeed, a sharp threshold in the intermediate of the linear metabolic pathway arises when the enzyme-mediated consumption of a product saturates, leading to non-linear degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Buchler1">[33]</xref>. The ultrasensitive threshold is crossed when the downstream enzyme saturates, and the flux from the upstream enzyme exceeds its maximal value (<italic>V<sup>+</sup></italic>/<italic>V<sup>−</sup></italic>&gt;1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Because <italic>V<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>V<sup>−</sup></italic> are proportional to their enzyme levels, the numerator and denominator of the ratio fluctuate together when both enzymes are in the same operon. Therefore transcriptional coupling lowers noise in the flux ratio and making it unlikely to cross the threshold <italic>V<sup>+</sup></italic>/<italic>V<sup>−</sup></italic> = 1. When the enzymes are uncoupled, simulations show more variability in the <italic>V<sup>+</sup></italic>/<italic>V<sup>−</sup></italic> ratio, allowing the ratio to cross the threshold with consequent large spikes in metabolic intermediate. Thus, the ultrasensitive switch amplifies noise differences already present between cotranscribed and uncoupled configurations.</p>

        <p>Differences in noise between cotranscribed and uncoupled configurations of all of the non-redundant modules can be amplified by ultrasensitive switches in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The metabolic branch point module undergoes the same type of non-linear degradation effect as the linear metabolic pathway, but in the branch point transcriptionally coupled enzyme pairs are more likely to fluctuate downward and saturate simultaneously than uncoupled enzymes. This effect leads to a higher likelihood of substrate buildup in the cotranscribed configuration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). The physical interaction and covalent modification modules undergo molecular titration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Buchler2">[34]</xref>, resulting in an ultrasensitive switch for monomers (physical interaction module) or unmodified protein (covalent module) that depends on the ratio of protein production fluxes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s002">Figure S2C, D</xref>).

        <p>We simulated three inducer concentrations representing minimal <italic>lac</italic> operon induction (1.39 µM extracellular lactose concentration or 835 molecules/femtoliter), intermediate induction (83.0 µM or 50,000 molecules/femtoliter), and excess inducer with maximal <italic>lac</italic> operon induction (∼5,000 µM or 3×10<sup>6</sup> molecules/femtoliter). Timecourses suggest that transcriptional coupling between <italic>lacY</italic> and <italic>lacZ</italic> (wild-type situation) eliminates the large fluctuations in allolactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s003">S3</xref>) and intracellular lactose (not shown) observed in the transcriptionally uncoupled form of the system.

        <p>At all inducer concentrations, the uncoupled configuration displays higher CV in allolactose than did the cotranscribed configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

At the same time, there is little difference in protein CV between cotranscribed and uncoupled configurations of the model at most inducer levels. In both configurations the CV monotonically decreases with higher expression.</p>
        <p>The primary consequence of cotranscription of <italic>lac</italic> proteins in the same operon is a reduction in fluctuations of intracellular lactose and allolactose. These fluctuations may prevent disruption of other sugar uptake pathways by, for example, interfering with inducer exclusion mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Saier1">[36]</xref>.

Metabolic branch points show a bias toward being uncoupled, but falls just short of being statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.071).

        <title>Higher incidence of cotranscribed interacting proteins at low than high expression levels</title>
        <p>To separate the specific effect of noise from that of other factors affecting selection for operons, such as proportional coregulation, we considered whether the tendency toward operon membership of posttranslationally interacting protein pairs is related to gene expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Kovcs1">[23]</xref>. Intrinsic noise is stronger for genes with low expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Taniguchi1">[43]</xref>, covariance of protein concentrations is more pronounced (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002672.e001">Equation 1</xref>) and the degree of decorrelation is higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s006">Table S1</xref>). Therefore, if noise is an evolutionary factor driving operon formation, levels of gene expression may be inversely correlated with operon patterns. On the other hand, if coregulation of mean expression levels is the dominant factor in selecting for operons, the frequency of transcriptional coupling may be directly correlated with gene expression levels because the cost of differential regulation would be highest at the highest expression levels. As a result, any trend in coupling frequencies with gene expression levels would favor one hypothesis and disfavor the other.</p>
        <p>We used a dataset of average single-cell mRNA and protein copy numbers in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Taniguchi1">[43]</xref> to explore this trend for constitutively expressed physically interacting protein pairs (other network modules have insufficient data for such analysis). Because different conditions can shift gene expression levels and the dataset is only available for one condition, we chose to focus on the subset of interacting proteins that are constitutive, i.e., not predicted to undergo any regulation in RegulonDB. Each gene's protein or mRNA copy number was considered once, along with a binary variable indicating whether or not the protein product interacts with a same or non-same operon protein. Further details are given in Materials and Methods.</p>
        <p>We divided the set into two subsets of expression level, one below and one above the median copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The fraction of protein pairs sharing the same operon is higher in the low-expression subset for protein (bootstrap test <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and mRNA (bootstrap test <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) copy numbers.

        <title>Covariance and noise reduction in non-redundant interactions</title>
        <p>Because enzymes often operate close to saturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Bennett1">[45]</xref>, resolving metabolic flux imbalances may prevent widespread accumulation of intermediate, which is potentially toxic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Fell1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Levine1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Lee1">[48]</xref>. Simulations of a detailed <italic>lac</italic> operon model in our study corroborate the results of the simpler linear metabolic module, suggesting a role for intrinsic noise in selecting for <italic>lac</italic> operon architecture (in addition to the stochastic effects previously examined in this system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-vanHoek1">[49]</xref>). Simulations that include extrinsic noise as a correlating factor indicate that it does not reduce metabolite noise as well as the stronger correlations caused by cotranscription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s017">Text S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Many metabolic operons are large (and with complex evolutionary histories; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Fani1">[50]</xref>), but the length of a metabolic pathway is often longer than that of a typical operon, leading to the question of where optimal operon break points for metabolic pathways may lie. Our results suggest that break points occur predominantly where the intermediate is not toxic or where it is processed by multiple downstream enzymes, such as at branch points and metabolic steps with redundant enzymes. Metabolite spikes could also potentially be buffered by reversibility of catalytic reactions, though the reversible step in the <italic>lac</italic> operon did not prevent intermediate spikes. Furthermore, if portions of metabolic pathways that are divided by intermediates with relatively low toxicity undergo upregulation as needed, there may be a trade-off between reduction of toxic intermediate spikes and just-in-time transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Zaslaver1">[51]</xref> in the evolution of metabolic networks.</p>
        <p>Our analysis suggests that pairs of enzymes after a branch point can have lower noise (CV) if they are not cotranscribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), but with a less consistent CV difference between cotranscribed and uncoupled configurations than the other modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s001">Figure S1</xref> D,M). Therefore, the noise hypothesis predicts patterns of transcriptional coupling to be weaker than in other modules, as we observe to be the case in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002672-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The simple physical protein interaction module in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) may result in one of two different types of physiologically meaningful output variables: an active heterodimer, in which the genes make up subunits of a functional complex, or an active monomer, in which its activity is negatively regulated by the binding partner (as with sigma-antisigma systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Igoshin1">[52]</xref>). In either case reduction in monomer noise is justified; in the latter case, to reduce noise in the physiologically relevant output. In the former case, lower noise represents a reduction in inefficient protein production that can reduce promiscuous interactions with other parts of the network. Heterodimer noise is smaller for the uncoupled configuration because upward fluctuations in its concentration are limited to being no larger than the minimum of [<italic>A</italic>] and [<italic>B</italic>] and those concentrations are less likely to simultaneously fluctuate upward simultaneously.</p>
        <p>The covalent modification system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2F</xref>) in its uncoupled configuration has reduced fluctuations in the unmodified protein (<italic>A</italic>) compared with the uncoupled configuration. Noise effects of transcriptional coupling may therefore be important in covalent modification systems where the unmodified form of the protein is capable of interacting with other systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s015">Text S2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Noise differences in non-redundant modules arise from ultrasensitivity</title>
        <p>A striking feature of the non-redundant protein interaction modules is that they all contain a zero-order ultrasensitive switch, which arises as a side-effect of saturation. This effect amplifies differences in CV between cotranscribed and uncoupled forms of the modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002672.s002">S2</xref>) and may degrade performance when its threshold is crossed.

This trend could be explained by slow protein diffusion in the crowded intracellular environment, as cotranscribed gene products are more likely to be present at the same subcellular location. However even slow diffusion (&lt;1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) across a typical bacterial length of ∼1 µm is much faster than the expected time lag between translation of two proteins given typical ribosomal speeds of 12–21 AA/s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Bremer1">[56]</xref>. Therefore, increased biochemical noise (here, measured as decorrelations between uncoupled proteins) at low expression levels are the most likely explanation of the observed trend. We argue that these noise effects are detrimental to the performance of some protein interaction networks.</p>
        <p>The opposite trend would be expected if proportional expression of mean concentrations or other mechanisms are the primary selective pressure on operon maintenance.

        <title>Redundant proteins and selection against operons</title>
        <p>Partial functional redundancy of proteins allows one protein to compensate for a downward fluctuation in concentration of the other protein, thereby reducing noise with uncorrelated protein fluctuations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002672-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, just as noise minimization may explain operon membership for non-redundant interactions, it may also explain the lack of redundant proteins in operons. Differential regulation of the genes can additionally play an important role in keeping redundant interactions transcriptionally uncoupled. In yeast metabolic pathways, apparently redundant enzymes are differentially expressed in different pathways depending on external conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Ihmels1">[59]</xref>. This type of mechanism, if present <italic>in E. coli</italic>, may also explain why no redundant enzymes are in the same operon.

Further work is necessary to distinguish the noise reduction hypothesis more decisively from differential gene regulation as a selective force in redundant pairs; differential regulation may be physiologically important in some cases and not in others.</p>

        <p>Improvement of dynamic performance of simple networks arising from cotranscription of interacting genes from the same operon raises the question of why operons are rare in eukaryotes.

Nevertheless, such benefits may still be present in some systems, and there are mechanisms that allow correlating gene expression noise in eukaryotic cells without polycistronic loci.

        <title>Concluding remarks</title>
        <p>We have developed a theory predicting that operon membership can increase or decrease noise in different types of protein interactions. Bioinformatic analysis finds that naturally occurring operon patterns in <italic>E. coli</italic> correlate with reduction of biochemical noise. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to explore operon coupling frequencies in bacterial stress response systems known to favor population-level heterogeneity, such as stress responses in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>; the amplification of noise by underlying ultrasensitive switches in non-redundant network modules may be a potential mechanism of population-level heterogeneity.</p>
        <p>The existence of implicit ultrasensitive switches also underscores the idea that dramatic non-linearities are likely present in many simple protein interaction networks. Our results suggest that ultrasensitive switches are likely undetectable in the wild-type configurations of well-adapted systems as a result of selection against them, but may be present in conditions with lower selective pressure, or recent evolutionary events. These switches nevertheless have important implications for genome evolution. Their effects, and the mechanisms for avoiding them, may in turn shape larger biochemical networks by changing global noise properties, and will be an important factor in designing synthetic networks.</p>

      <p>Symbolic manipulations and data analysis were performed in Mathematica 7.0 and 8.0 (Wolfram Research, Champagne, IL). We predicted intrinsic noise characteristics with stochastic simulations at stationary state using the StochKit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://engineering.ucsb.edu/~cse/StochKit/" xlink:type="simple">http://engineering.ucsb.edu/~cse/StochKit/</ext-link>) tau-leaping routine for 10,000 runs of each model (except in the <italic>lac</italic> operon model, for which 1,000 runs of each condition were done). Initial model construction and test runs were done with Copasi (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.copasi.org" xlink:type="simple">www.copasi.org</ext-link>). Simulations with an extrinsic noise representation were done in Copasi as detailed below. All models were represented with elementary reaction steps; in models involving gene regulation, we defined a promoter variable as always present at one copy per cell.</p>

        <title>Stochastic simulations</title>
        <p>Unless otherwise specified, each network module was tested with promoter-mediated noise, represented by promoters switching between “on” and “off” states of mRNA production. This process has estimated switching rates of <italic>k<sub>goff</sub></italic> = 0.0028 s<sup>−1</sup> for switching to the “off” state and <italic>k<sub>gon</sub></italic> = 0.00045 s<sup>−1</sup> for switching to the “on” state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Golding1">[20]</xref>. In models including a gene regulation step, we assumed binding and unbinding of regulators to be independent of promoters switching between on and off states. Without promoter-generated bursting, gene expression noise largely arises from low mRNA copy numbers per cell and the effect of transcriptional coupling is qualitatively similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, analytical results from LNA do not include the effects of bursty transcription, showing that we arrive at qualitatively similar results without transcriptional bursts.</p>
        <p>We distinguish between three types of coupling between production of two proteins in stochastic simulation reaction schemes. Transcription may be coupled or uncoupled (i.e., proteins in the same or separate operons) and when transcription is coupled, proteins may be cotranslated (single ribosome binding site for both) or translationally uncoupled (two ribosome binding sites). These three cases represent simplified extremes; intermediate translational linkage (e.g., read-through from multiple ribosome binding sites) is possible but was not further considered here. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002672-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the three cases with promoter-mediated gene expression noise. For simplicity of presentation, we compare transcriptionally uncoupled with cotranslated models in the main text.</p>

        <p>Bioinformatic analyses used pairs of interacting genes extracted from databases of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 MG1655 as described below. To determine the randomized control, we needed to account for potential biases resulting from dataset size and other features of chromosome organization that we were not attempting to test. For instance, if we randomly assigned genes to extant operons in <italic>E. coli</italic> across the entire chromosome, the less frequently occurring modules would have much less same-operon membership than the modules with larger numbers of members, and would not be a useful control. We chose to randomize the genes extracted from the pairs within each module to set the random control for each class. Thus, for a list of gene pairs<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002672.e034"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002672.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>we determined a randomized case by flattening <bold><italic>g</italic></bold> into<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002672.e035"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002672.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>randomly permuting the order of the genes and then re-pairing them to determine the frequency.

We partitioned the network into pairs of adjacent steps and assigned a value of 1 to each pair in the same operon (using the operon membership dataset from RegulonDB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-GamaCastro1">[31]</xref>) and 0 to each pair in separate operons. This gave a frequency <italic>f<sub>met</sub></italic> of subsequent same-operon metabolic steps. Several metabolic steps were found to be catalyzed by enzymes with subunits from multiple genes. Because such interactions have a large bias in favor of operon membership (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002672-t001">Table 1</xref>), we eliminated them from the analysis to ensure operon membership biases result from metabolic, and not physical, interactions. We then repeatedly randomly assigned the metabolic enzymes to operons to generate a predicted distribution of background operon membership. The resulting distribution is approximately normal, allowing a parametric determination of <italic>f<sub>met</sub></italic> significance (<italic>f<sub>met</sub></italic> = 91/2417 = 0.038; mean μ<sub>r</sub> = 0.0036; standard deviation σ<sub>r</sub> = 0.0011; <italic>p</italic>&lt;&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>).</p>

          <title>Covalent modifications</title>
          <p>Extracting examples of this interaction type from databases is difficult because of the complex nature of the relationship, which requires interaction with subsequent modification. We used the MultiFun Gene Ontology from EcoCyc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002672-Keseler1">[30]</xref> to identify protein-related information transfer systems, each of which we manually checked to eliminate irrelevant cases and identify operon membership of the pair. Forty-six of the 201 pairs (23%) had interactions within the same operon. Because some of the identified members have multiple interaction pairs that could not be identified, the 46/201 fraction is somewhat uncertain. Unlike any of the other interaction modules, this module has pairs that overlap with another module (specifically, the physical interaction module). We used the same randomization procedure as for the metabolic pairs above to test the fraction relative to a randomized case of the covalent modification genes. With μ<sub>c</sub> = 0.0047, σ<sub>c</sub> = 0.0047, and <italic>p</italic>&lt;&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, the true fraction is likely greater than the randomized control.</p>

To ensure a meaningful comparison of expression levels, we considered only genes predicted to be unregulated in RegulonDB. Only the physical interaction module left enough data for analysis. For instance, the number of unregulated pairs in the same operon for the linear metabolic pathway dataset was 5, insufficient to distinguish the established operon membership pattern from noise when partitioned between high and low expression. Each average single-cell mRNA or protein copy number was used, along with physical interaction status (1 = same operon; 0 = non-same operon). Proteins with multiple interaction partners within and between operons were represented twice, once for same-operon and once for non-same-operon interaction. We then divided the set into above- and below-median subsets and compared the fraction of same-operon interactions in the subsets using a standard bootstrap resampling test. We resampled 10,000 times with replacement and computed the difference in coupling frequencies between low and high expression as the test statistic. To compute error bars, we used bootstrapping of each bin by sampling each bin with replacement up to the bin size, repeated 1,000 times.</p>
