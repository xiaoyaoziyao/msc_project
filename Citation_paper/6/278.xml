        <p>The inference of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data is a difficult problem because the performance of the inference algorithms depends on a multitude of different factors. In this paper we study two of these. First, we investigate the influence of discrete mutual information (MI) estimators on the global and local network inference performance of the C3NET algorithm. More precisely, we study <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> different MI estimators (Empirical, Miller-Madow, Shrink and Schürmann-Grassberger) in combination with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> discretization methods (<italic>equal frequency</italic>, <italic>equal width</italic> and <italic>global equal width</italic> discretization). We observe the best global and local inference performance of C3NET for the Miller-Madow estimator with an <italic>equal width</italic> discretization. Second, our numerical analysis can be considered as a systems approach because we simulate gene expression data from an underlying gene regulatory network, instead of making a distributional assumption to sample thereof. We demonstrate that despite the popularity of the latter approach, which is the traditional way of studying MI estimators, this is in fact not supported by simulated and biological expression data because of their heterogeneity. Hence, our study provides guidance for an efficient design of a simulation study in the context of network inference, supporting a systems approach.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The mutual information (MI) is a measure to quantify the non-linear dependency between two random variables <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Shannon1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Li1">[2]</xref>. The most popular strategies for estimating mutual information values are based on a discretized model for continuous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Paninski1">[3]</xref>. This strategy is widely known as the <italic>histogram approach</italic> that approximates the joint probability distribution by their empirical joint frequencies in bins of the two discretized random variables <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Shannon1">[1]</xref>. A variety of different mutual information estimators were developed in order to obtain statistical estimates for data sampled from an underlying distribution. The simplest estimator is the Empirical estimator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Paninski1">[3]</xref> that is computed from the observed cell frequencies of a discretized distribution. However, it has been shown that the Empirical estimator underestimates the entropy due to an undersampling of cell frequencies and of zero cell frequencies which increase with the number of bins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Miller1">[4]</xref>. This is a major problem for practical applications due to finite data and the requirement for a large number of bins for accurate estimates. To account for the induced bias of the MI estimate, a variety of methods were developed that adjust the estimate by a constant factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Paninski1">[3]</xref>, use a shrinkage regularization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Schfer1">[5]</xref> or employ a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint frequencies for the bins from a Dirichlet distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Schurmann1">[6]</xref> to gain more accurate estimates.</p>
      <p>In systems biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Alon1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Vidal1">[10]</xref>, many gene regulatory network (GRN) inference methods use mutual information as an estimator to unveil the interaction structure and the relations among genes in a cellular system from gene expression data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Liang1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Watkinson1">[16]</xref>. One of the first methods based on mutual information for GRN inference was introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Butte1">[17]</xref>. The underlying method, called <italic>relevance network</italic> (RN), assigns edges to gene pairs if the corresponding MI value is above a given threshold. The networks that result from application of RN are association networks because an edge between two genes indicates merely their association but not necessarily a causal effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Pearl1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Verma1">[20]</xref>. A different type of GRN methods are network inference methods that aim to inferring causal interactions among genes and their products which can be experimentally validated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Altay1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Xing1">[26]</xref>. The networks that result from such an inference are called <italic>gene regulatory networks</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-EmmertStreib1">[27]</xref>. So far, there is no generally agreed gold standard to conduct and include the routine of gene regulatory network inference and their analysis for molecular studies. However, necessary preprocessing steps of the data to prepare them for the subsequent inference of a gene regulatory network involve standardized procedures for the normalization of gene expression distributions within and between samples and a summarization step to obtain gene-centric values of the gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Bolstad1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Steinhoff1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The major purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of the MI estimator and the choice of the discretization method on the inference of gene regulatory networks. Despite the enormous popularity of the inference of GRNs this topic has so far only been addressed by a few studies. A notable exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Olsen1">[31]</xref>. There gene regulatory network algorithms were evaluated for different mutual information estimators demonstrating that the choice of the estimator influences the inference performance in a significant manner. It has also been shown that the choice of the discretization and MI estimator is specific for a gene regulatory network inference method. In contrast to this study, there are many investigations that analyze statistical estimators of MI values directly without considering the MI estimator as part of a larger model, like the inference algorithm for a GRN. Usually, such studies assess either the estimates of the probability distribution respectively of the cell frequencies of an estimator, or study the resulting entropies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Hausser1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Nemenman1">[35]</xref>. The first approach is based on the <italic>plug-in</italic> usage of the estimated probabilities whereas the second utilizes the fact that the mutual information can be expressed in terms of entropies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Cover1">[36]</xref>. This can be seen as traditional approach because it places the statistical estimator itself in the focus of the investigation. In addition, another characteristics of these traditional studies is that they make assumptions about the distribution of the data and then assess the statistical MI estimator by means of simulated data, generated in accordance with these assumptions. This allows a thorough statistical analysis because each model parameter can be controlled appropriately, possibly, up to computational limitations.</p>
      <p>The major purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of statistical estimators of the mutual information on the inference of regulatory networks from large-scale gene expression data for the C3NET algorithm using global and local network-based error measures. More specifically, we investigate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> different discretization methods in combination with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> different statistical estimators for mutual information values. We infer networks from <italic>in silico</italic> (simulated) gene expression datasets generated for three Erdös-Rényi networks for various sample sizes and assess the influence of the MI estimators by global and local network-based error measures. In addition, we investigate and define data heterogeneity and discuss general consequences thereof on the simulation approach for network inference methods. This will provide us with general insights and reveals a problem of traditional studies of MI estimators which do not place the MI estimator into a model for which it is intended, but study it in isolation. For this reason, nonlinear effects that are only present for the larger model may lead to unexpected performance results which does not reflect the performance of the estimator in the isolated study. One reason therefore is the violation of assumptions. It is clear that assumptions that reflect real data <italic>appropriately</italic> lead to comparable results for simulated and real data. However, the more these assumptions are violated the more the results may deviate. This is well known, but does not reveal the only problem one encounters by using a statistical estimator within a larger model. The additional problem with the latter is in the specific context we are interested in, namely the inference of GRN from expression data, that the correlation structure within the data is only poorly understood, and, hence, there is no simple way known to simulate the expression of individual genes without simulating the entire gene network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Almudevar1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-EmmertStreib2">[38]</xref>. In the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">results</xref> section of this paper we will show that as a consequence of these correlations among genes, there are many different types of probability distributions present within one gene regulatory network caused by the heterogeneity of the expression data. This makes it practically impossible to reduce the test of a MI estimator to a single probability distribution, but one would need to consider a <italic>distribution</italic> of probability distributions to test a MI estimator. From the presence of the data heterogeneity we conclude that a MI estimator can only be meaningfully studied within a network inference model and genome-wide data. This can be seen as a systems approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-vonBertalanffy1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-vonBertalanffy2">[40]</xref> because reducing either the model to the MI estimator solely or the data to a <italic>fixed</italic> joint probability distribution does not lead to a realistic testing of the biological system.</p>
      <p>This paper is organized as follows. In the next section we introduce the methods used for our analysis. Then we present numerical results of the influence different MI estimators have on the inference performance of C3NET by using global and local error measures. In addition, we analyze the effect of data heterogeneity on the estimation of MI values. The paper finishes with a discussion and conclusions.</p>

        <title>The network inference method C3NET</title>
        <p>The C3NET (conservative causal core) algorithm consists of three main steps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Altay1">[21]</xref>. The first step is for estimating mutual information values for all gene pairs. In the second step, the most significant link for each gene is selected. In the third step, non-significant links, according to a chosen significance level <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, between gene pairs are eliminated by application of a multiple testing correction procedure. The complexity for multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) for C3NET is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, whereas <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponds to the number of genes. The C3NET algorithm selects at most <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> edges and therefore at most <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> multiple tests are required. In comparison, other gene regulatory network inference approaches, e.g., RN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Butte2">[41]</xref>, ARACNE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Margolin1">[25]</xref> or CLR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Faith1">[42]</xref> eliminate non-significant links between <italic>all</italic> possible gene pairs in the first step. This leads to a complexity for multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Some methods often circumvent the more extensive computational effort by applying arbitrarily chosen fixed significance thresholds.</p>
        <p>The inferred edges in a C3NET gene regulatory network correspond to the highest MI value among the neighbor edges for each gene. This implies that the highest possible number of edges that can be inferred by C3NET is equal to the number of genes under consideration. This number can decrease for several reasons. For example, when two genes have the same edge with maximum MI value. In this case, the same edge would be chosen by both genes to be included in the network. However, if an edge is already present another inclusion does not lead to an additional edge. Another case corresponds to the situation when a gene does not have significant edges at all. In this case, apparently, no edge can be included in the network. Since C3NET employs MI values as test statistics among genes, there is no directional information that can be inferred thereof. Hence, the resulting network is undirected and unweighted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029279-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the principle working mechanism of the network inference method C3NET.</p>

        <p>The Empirical estimator gives the maximum-likelihood entropy estimate for a discretized random variable. A main problem of the empirical approach is the underestimation of the true entropy <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> due to undersampling of the cell frequencies with increasing number of bins. A variety of approaches were developed to account for the induced bias that range from correcting the estimate by a constant factor or using a multinomial distribution to model the extend of missing information. In the following we show <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> different MI estimators that are based on a discretized model.</p>
        <p>The Miller-Madow estimator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Paninski1">[3]</xref> accounts for the undersampling bias by adjusting the estimate by a constant factor that is proportional to the bin size and sample size:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e039" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> number of bins and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> number of samples.</p>

        <title>Influence of MI estimators on the global error measure AUC-PR</title>
        <p>First, we compare the impact of the discretization method on the AUC-PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029279-g006">Figure 6</xref>). For all three Erdös-Rényi networks, the <italic>equal width</italic> and the <italic>global equal width</italic> discretization lead to a better inference performance of C3NET compared to the <italic>equal frequency</italic> discretization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029279-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Further, the <italic>equal width</italic> and <italic>global equal width</italic> discretization in combination with the Miller-Madow estimator is better than any other combination of MI estimator and discretization method. The second best MI estimator is the Empirical estimator. The Schürmann-Grassberger estimator and the Shrink estimator perform worse, whereas the Schürmann-Grassberger estimator performs better than the Shrink estimator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029279-g006">Figure 6</xref>). When using the <italic>equal frequency</italic> discretization, all MI estimators perform equally and show no substantial difference, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029279-g006">Fig. 6</xref>. Further, one can see that the network inference performance is decreasing with an increasing edge density. This is reasonable and related to the working mechanism of C3NET. Due to the fact the C3NET allows each gene to contribute at most one edge to the resulting network, the inference of networks that have a higher edge density is systematically disfavored.</p>

        <p>In the previous section we studied MI estimators by using a global error measure. When a global error measure is used, we actually do not obtain information about the performance of individual edges, but only of the average performance of all edges in the network. In order to <italic>zoom in</italic> to local properties of the network, we study in this section the local network-based measure <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This measure allows to divide the edges in a network into two classes, according to the structural neighborhood of an edge, as defined in section ‘Local network-based error measure’. Specifically, this will allow us to gain information about the influence the MI estimators have on edges with a certain structural property. We use the local network-based measure <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to distinguish between two edge classes. The first class represents edges from linearly connected genes (Class I) and the second class represents edges that belong to genes with multiple edges (Class II), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029279-g004">Fig. 4</xref> for a visualization. In the following, we study the influence of the MI estimators on these two edge classes separately. We expect that edges from linear connected genes have only few dependencies that affect the underlying gene expression patterns and thus are more easier to infer. In contrast, edges connected to genes that are influenced by multiple other genes are expected to show more complex gene expression patterns and are therefore more difficult to estimate.</p>
        <p>For the following simulations we use the <italic>equal width</italic> discretization in combination of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> MI estimators for gene regulatory network inference with C3NET.

In general, the Class I edges show a much better inference performance compared to the Class II edges. Also, for the Class I edges the estimators do not have a substantial influence on the inference performance. However, for the Class II edges we observe that the Miller-Madow estimator performs best, followed by the Empirical estimator. The Schürmann-Grassberger estimator and the shrinkage estimator rank last. In contrast to the global error measure (AUR-PR), for edges of Class II the shrinkage estimator performs better than the Schürmann-Grassberger estimator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029279-g011">Figure 11</xref>).</p>

        <title>Influence of data heterogeneity</title>
        <p>Traditionally, when MI estimators are investigated, they are studied by making an assumption about the joint probability distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the two random variables the MI estimator depends on. From this, the marginal distributions <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are obtained. Frequently, normality is assumed but also other probability distributions have been studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Hausser1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Kraskov1">[34]</xref>. Regardless of the actual probability distribution selected, all studies have in common to make an implicate assumption which translates into a <italic>homogeneity</italic> of the data. That mean a MI estimator is investigated with respect to a <italic>fixed</italic> probability distribution from which data are sampled. This may be repeated for several different but <italic>fixed</italic> probability distributions. The crucial point here is that this investigation is done for each probability distribution separately which means that a MI estimator is assessed by using datasets that come from only one underlying distribution. With respect to this distribution, the sampled datasets are homogeneous because no otherwise distributed data are present. In this section we will study different aspects of the homogeneity assumption and consequences thereof. We proceed by, first, investigating various tests about the normality of the data and then consider arbitrarily distributed data.</p>
        <p>We start by testing the null hypothesis if a gene expression profile is normally distributed, by using the Anderson-Darling test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Sheskin1">[51]</xref>. For the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> simulated gene expression datasets, we tested the null hypothesis of normality for the expression profiles. For the three Erdös-Rényi networks with edge density <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> containing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genes, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the genes reject in average the null hypothesis testing for normality. These values are obtained for a significance level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and a Bonferroni correction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Dudoit1">[52]</xref>. We repeated the same analysis for a normalized gene expression dataset from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Faith1">[42]</xref> containing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genes and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> samples to see if our simulated data represent realistic aspects of biological data. Testing each of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genes for normality leads to a rejection of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the tests (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, Bonferroni corrected). This demonstrates, first, that the characteristics of our simulated data is comparable to that of biological data and, second, that there is a non-negligible fraction of genes whose expression is not normally distributed, even after appropriate normalization of the data.</p>
        <p>Next, we investigate the relation between the occurrences of TP and FP edges and the normality of the gene expression values. From testing the null-hypothesis that a gene expression profile follows a normal distribution, using the Anderson-Darling normality test, we obtain p-values for all genes. Combining pairs of p-values with Stouffer's method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Stouffer1">[53]</xref> gives us a p-value we assign to all gene pairs which correspond to edges and non-edges in the reference network. More precisely, we test the null hypothesis for normality of the gene expression profile of a gene using the Anderson-Darling test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Sheskin1">[51]</xref>, as before. Then for each gene pair, their p-values are combined using the Stouffer method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Stouffer1">[53]</xref>. This method, first, transforms individual p-values into z-scores, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Here <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. After this transformation the resulting z-scores are aggregated into a combined z-score, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, from which the combined p-value is obtained. These combined p-values reflect the normality of the genes that enclose an edge (or a non-edge). We estimate these p-values for each of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> datasets.

We call these vectors <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. From the comparison of the inferred network with the reference network we obtain for each dataset a categorization of these p-values into the four categories TP, FP, TN and FN with respect to correctly/falsely identified edges. Considering TP and FP edges only, we obtain two categories which we use in the following. Due to the fact that, usually, the number of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> edges is not equal to the number of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> edges for a given dataset <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we identify their common length,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e167" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(16)</label></disp-formula>and use exactly <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> true positive and false positive hits from this dataset only.

Repeating this procedure for all <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> datasets provides us with two vectors, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e189" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, whose components reflect the frequency with which they occurred in all datasets. For example, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e190" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would mean that the edge ranked at position <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e191" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> appeared <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e192" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> times in the set of TP edges among the first <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e193" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> hits in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e194" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> datasets that were considered. The interpretation for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e195" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the FP edges is analogously. For each set of datasets with sample size <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e196" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the Erdös-Rényi network with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e197" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we compare the ranks of the p-values between TP edges, denoted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e198" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and FP edges denoted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e199" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029279-g012">Figure 12</xref> we show the empirical cumulative distribution functions (ecdf) for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e201" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> calculated for a Erdös-Rényi network with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. One can see that the TP edges are more likely to occupy lower ranked p-values compared to the FP edges. Hence, the distributions corresponding to TP edges have the tendency to show a stronger deviation from normality. In contrast, the curves of the FP edges follow a straight line which indicates the absence of a systematic relation between FP edges and the normality of the data. For the networks with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e203" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we obtain qualitatively similar results.</p>

        <p>Finally, we generalize the above analysis by testing for general probability distributions, to see if there is a systematic relation between the occurrences of TP and FP edges and the distribution of the gene expressions. For this analysis we use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the gene expression distributions for all edge and non-edge gene pairs. For a significance level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (Bonferroni corrected) the equality of the expression distribution was rejected for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e208" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of all gene pairs. For reasons of comparison, we performed a similar analysis for the gene expression dataset from yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Faith1">[42]</xref> and found that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e209" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the tests were rejected. Then we compared the ranks obtained from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests between TP and FP edges, as explained above for the normality test. Again, this procedures was performed for the Empirical, Miller-Madow, Shrinkage and Schürmann-Grassberger estimator for each expression dataset with sample size <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e210" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the Erdös Rényi networks with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e211" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Similar to the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029279-g012">Figure 12</xref>, we find that gene pairs of TP edges are likely to show a more prominent difference between their underlying expression profile (not shown). Hence, this observation is in agreement with the rank comparisons of TP and FP edges obtained from the Anderson-Darling normality test, and demonstrate that TP and FP edges behave quantitatively different, independent of distributional assumptions.</p>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029279-g013">Fig. 13</xref> we summarize our findings about the data heterogeneity graphically. We found that for a given gene regulatory network one can find a multitude of different joint probability distributions, visualized by the different edge colors. Similarly, for gene pairs that are not directly connected by an edge (non-edges) one can also find many different probability distributions. From this one can obtain (discrete) probability distributions of the occurrence of probability distributions, visualized in the bottom part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029279-g013">Fig. 13</xref>. In these two diagrams, each color bar represents one specific probability distribution that can be found for the edges or non-edges.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we presented a comprehensive investigation of the influence the MI estimators have on the inference performance of C3NET. We observed a strong influence of the MI estimators and the discretization methods on the inference performance, revealed by global and local network-based error measures. In summary, we found that the Miller-Madow estimator in combination with the <italic>equal width</italic> and the <italic>global equal width</italic> discretization methods provided the best performance. However, the major influence on the C3NET inference performance was observed for the discretization method itself, whereas the <italic>equal width</italic> and the <italic>global equal width</italic> lead to significantly better results than the <italic>equal frequency</italic> discretization method. Hence, using the <italic>equal frequency</italic> discretization in applications is likely to lead to a reduced performance of C3NET because the inference performance is prominently lower compared to the other two discretization methods. A potential explanation why the Miller-Madow estimator performs better than the other estimators is that the Miller-Madow estimator is the only estimator among the used MI estimators that considers a bias correction, which depends on the sample size and the number of bins that are introduced by the discretization.</p>
      <p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Olsen1">[31]</xref> it was shown that the influence of the discretization method and a MI estimator is method specific, e.g., for ARACNE, CLR and MRNET. In their study, MRNET and ARACNE performed best with the <italic>equal frequency</italic> discretization in combination with the Empirical or Miller-Madow estimator while CLR was observed to be less influenced by different estimators. In contrast to our results for C3NET, the <italic>equal width</italic> discretization method was observed to outperform the <italic>equal frequency</italic> discretization method if used in combination with the Miller-Madow estimator. A major factor that explains the differences of the discretization methods on the network inference performance of our study compared to the study performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Olsen1">[31]</xref> are likely due to the different working mechanisms and characteristics of the statistical principles, employed by the different network inference methods. For this reason it is necessary to identify the optimal combination of a statistical MI estimator and a discretization method for each network inference algorithm individually, as pointed out in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Olsen1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the influences of the different MI estimators found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Olsen1">[31]</xref> are less pronounced than the one we found for the C3NET algorithm. A reason for this may be that the ensemble data used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Olsen1">[31]</xref> consist of only <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> expression datasets for each setting. A large ensemble size of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e227" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> datasets, as used in our study, allows to capture finer variations among the simulated datasets and thus allows more robust comparisons.</p>
      <p>Another factor that could lead to differences, is the simulation strategy used for the simulation of gene expression data. For example, the effect of noise and missing data were studied in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Olsen1">[31]</xref> and it was shown that this is an important influence that needs to be taken into account when assessing the inference performance. However, future studies are necessary to investigate this influence in more detail and also to provide guidance with respect to the selection of a simulation setting.</p>
      <p>Global error measures make the implicit assumption to observe an approximately equal inference performance for all edges in the network. However, for C3NET it was shown that edges of linearly connected nodes, e.g., edges of leaf nodes, have a higher inference performance than edges of highly connected nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Altay1">[21]</xref>. Hence, it is likely that edges of highly connected genes are more difficult to infer due to the more complex expression patterns of the corresponding genes. For this reason, we used in addition to global error measures also local network-based error measures to study the inference performance for edges of linearly connected genes (Class I) and all other edges (Class II). We found that edges from genes with a high degree (Class II) are likely to be underrepresented in the inferred networks because they have a lower (median) true positive rate than edges from Class I. Further, we compared the influence of the MI estimator on the edge classes Class I and Class II. Among the tested combinations of discretization methods and estimators, the Miller-Madow estimator with <italic>equal width</italic> or <italic>global equal width</italic> discretization showed the best performance on the inference performance of C3NET, independent from the edge density and the sample size.</p>
      <p>In order to obtain the above results we simulated gene expression data from underlying regulatory networks, instead of making a distributional assumption to sample data from such a distribution. The latter is the traditional approach to study MI estimators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Hausser1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029279-Kraskov1">[34]</xref>. Despite its popularity and simplicity we demonstrated that in the context of the inference of GRNs this reductionistic approach is not appropriate because of the data heterogeneity. Specifically, we showed that one can find a multitude of different probability distributions in simulated as well as biological expression data which can be represented as a (discrete) distribution of probability distributions, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e228" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for edges and, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e229" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for non-edges. Hence, assuming the presence of merely one probability distribution is not supported by data. For this reason, if one would like to study MI estimators in isolation, one would need to make assumptions not only about the usage of one probability distribution, but of the distribution of probability distributions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e230" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for edges and, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0029279.e231" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for non-edges). In order to avoid this complication, we recommend to simulate expression data from an underlying gene regulatory network because this provides naturally such a distribution of probability distributions.</p>
      <p>In summary, we studied the influence of discrete MI estimators and discretization methods on the inference performance of C3NET and provided suggestions for the most beneficial combination. However, our study may be also useful for the development of novel MI estimators that take the various underlying probability distributions for different edge classes into consideration. Future studies are required to evaluate the vast catalogue of existing and novel MI estimators, the impact of different network structures and the simulation procedures in order to explore the particular factors that are required to understand the influence of different MI estimators on individual inference algorithms to enable an efficient analysis of real biological gene expression datasets.</p>
