<abstract>
<p>Although noisy gene expression is widely accepted, its mechanisms are subjects of debate, stimulated largely by single-molecule experiments. This work is concerned with one such study, in which Choi et al., 2008, obtained real-time data and distributions of Lac permease in <italic>E. coli</italic>. They observed small and large protein bursts in strains with and without auxiliary operators. They also estimated the size and frequency of these bursts, but these were based on a stochastic model of a constitutive promoter. Here, we formulate and solve a stochastic model accounting for the existence of auxiliary operators and DNA loops. We find that DNA loop formation is so fast that small bursts are averaged out, making it impossible to extract their size and frequency from the data. In contrast, we can extract not only the size and frequency of the large bursts, but also the fraction of proteins derived from them. Finally, the proteins follow not the negative binomial distribution, but a mixture of two distributions, which reflect the existence of proteins derived from small and large bursts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Data from many independent experiments show that the abundance of any given protein varies among individual cells of isogenic populations growing under identical conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Balzsi1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Snijder1">[3]</xref>. Early experiments with fluorescent reporters showed that such non-uniformity in protein abundance was due to the inherent stochasticity of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and various forms of cell-to-cell variation (extrinsic noise) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Elowitz1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Ozbudak1">[5]</xref>. The subsequent development of single-molecule techniques has led to deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms generating the noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Raj1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Xie1">[7]</xref>. By measuring the number of mRNAs in single cells, Golding et al. showed that transcription was too bursty to be modeled as a Poisson process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Golding1">[8]</xref>. Cai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Cai1">[9]</xref> and Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Yu1">[10]</xref> developed two different methods for measuring the number of proteins in single cells. The real-time data of both studies showed that protein synthesis was bursty, and the burst size was exponentially distributed. Under this condition, the steady state protein distribution follows the Gamma distribution, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote the mean burst frequency and burst size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Friedman1">[11]</xref>. Cai et al. and Yu et al. showed that the Gamma distribution could fit their steady state data, and the values of the mean burst frequency and size derived from the steady state data agreed well with those obtained from real-time measurements.</p>
<p>Armed with these results, Choi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Choi1">[12]</xref> attacked a long-standing problem. When non-induced cells of <italic>E. coli</italic> are exposed to small concentrations of the gratuitous inducer TMG, the <italic>lac</italic> operon is induced by stochastic switching of individual cells from the non-induced to the induced state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Novick1">[13]</xref>. Choi et al. sought the molecular mechanism of this stochastic switching. To this end, they first quantified the minimum number of LacY molecules required to switch a cell to the induced state, and found this threshold to be 375 molecules. They then suggested a molecular mechanism capable of yielding this threshold by appealing to the known mechanisms of repression and transcription of the <italic>lac</italic> operon. Repression is mediated by the stable DNA loops formed when the Lac repressor is simultaneously bound to the main and auxiliary operators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Transcription can take place either due to <italic>partial dissociations</italic>, which occur when a repressor trapped in a DNA loop dissociates from the main operator, but not the auxiliary operator; or <italic>complete dissociations</italic>, which occur when the repressor dissociates completely from the DNA. Choi et al. hypothesized that since a partially dissociated repressor remains attached to the DNA, it rapidly rebinds to the main operator, thus limiting the number of transcription events. Although the evidence suggests that no more than one mRNA is made during a partial dissociation, it is conceivable that multiple transcripts are made during a partial dissociation despite its short lifetime, thus leading to a <italic>small transcriptional burst</italic>. In contrast, a completely dissociated repressor takes a relatively long time to find an operator, which results in a <italic>large transcriptional burst</italic>. These large transcriptional bursts can provide enough proteins to cross the threshold for stochastic switching.</p>

<p>The repressor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can bind to any of the three operators, namely the main operator <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the two auxiliary operators <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The repressor-free state is enclosed by the lower dashed box. The repressor-bound states, enclosed by the upper dashed box, consist of the following 5 states (clockwise from the left): the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> -bound state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the looped state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> -bound state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the looped state, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-bound state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

Small bursts occur whenever the repressor dissociates from the looped state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to form the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> -bound state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Large bursts occur whenever the repressor dissociates from the DNA to form the repressor-free state.

<p>Choi et al. tested the foregoing hypotheses as follows. The statistics of small transcriptional bursts were obtained with strain SX701, a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> strain that exhibits mostly small bursts. To capture the statistics of large bursts, they deleted the auxiliary operators of their <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cells, thus creating strain SX703 which yields only large bursts. The statistics of the small and large bursts were quantified by measuring the steady-state protein distributions for both strains at various inducer concentrations. They then concluded, based on the model of Friedman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Friedman1">[11]</xref>, that if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote the mean and variance of a protein distribution obtained with strain SX701, then the Fano factor, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the reciprocal of the noise, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, represent the size and frequency of the small bursts. Likewise, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote the mean and variance for SX703, then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the size and frequency of the large bursts. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Analysis</xref> of the data for SX703 with this method showed that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> did not change with inducer levels, but <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increased dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>), thus confirming their hypothesis that large bursts can generate enough proteins to trigger stochastic switching. Surprisingly, analysis of the data for SX701 also yielded similar trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>), but this was attributed to the distortions created by the few cells exhibiting large bursts. Indeed, if the data were filtered by removing the contribution of large bursts, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> did not change much with the inducer concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>), leading the authors to conclude that the small burst frequency and size were independent of the inducer level.</p>

<p>(a) Derived from data for strain SX703, which exhibits only large transcriptional bursts, since it lacks both auxiliary operators. Choi et al. proposed that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the size and frequency of large transcriptional bursts. (b) Derived from raw data for strain SX701, which exhibits mostly small transcriptional bursts, since it has both auxiliary operators. Choi et al. did not consider this data on the grounds that the occurrence of large bursts in a few cells distorted the statistics of the small transcriptional bursts. (c) Derived from data for strain SX701 that was filtered by rejecting the data corresponding to the few cells exhibiting large bursts. Choi et al. proposed that this <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the size and frequency of small transcriptional bursts. (d) Mean size of large transcriptional bursts in strain SX701, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, (full red curve) and fraction of proteins derived from such bursts, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, (full blue curve) estimated from the data in (b). The ordinate of the dashed red line is one-third of the ordinate of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> vs. [TMG] line shown in (a), and therefore represents one-third of the (large) transcriptional burst size in strain SX703. The proximity of the full and dashed red lines implies that the mean size of large transcriptional bursts in strain SX701 is approximately one-third of the transcriptional burst size in strain SX703, which is consistent with our model predictions.</p>

<p>Choi et al. also explained these results by appealing to the known states of the <italic>lac</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). However, the mathematical model of Friedman et al., which forms the basis of their data analysis, does not account for these complexities — it only considers a constitutive (unregulated) promoter. Consequently, there is no strong support for the assumption that the proteins follow the Gamma distribution; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the size of small and large bursts; and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the frequency of small and large bursts. The goal of this study is to verify the validity of these assumptions by formulating a stochastic model accounting for the known states of the operon, and deriving analytical expressions for the steady state protein distribution, Fano factor, and noise.</p>
<p>There are stochastic models accounting for the details shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g001">Fig. 1</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Earnest1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Stamatakis1">[16]</xref>, but these studies do not give analytical expressions for the steady state protein distribution. The literature also contains several stochastic models of gene regulation for which analytical solutions were obtained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Friedman1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Berg1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Thattai1">[24]</xref>, but they do not account for the presence of multiple auxiliary operators and DNA looping. Our model fills this gap in the theoretical literature, and its analysis yields deeper insights into the experimental data. Specifically, we show that the size and frequency of small bursts cannot be extracted from the data for strain SX701 because they are averaged out. However, we can extract not only the size and frequency of the large bursts, but also their contribution to total protein synthesis, provided the data is not filtered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>). This result also yields tests for the consistency of the model by providing relationships between the size and frequency of large bursts in strains SX701 and SX703. Finally, we show that neither one of the two strains follow the negative binomial (or Gamma) distribution.</p>
<p>The paper is organized as follows. In the <bold>Analysis</bold> section, we describe the model, derive the master equation, and explain the key approximations used to obtain the steady state protein distribution. In the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><bold>Results</bold></xref> section, we perform simulations to check the validity of the analytical expression for the protein distribution, and we derive the expressions for mean and the variance of the distribution. We also show that the mean, variance, and hence, the Fano factor and the reciprocal of the noise, can be expressed in terms of the size and frequency of the transcriptional and translational bursts. In the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Discussion</bold></xref> section, the latter are compared with the assumptions of Choi et al. We also show that negative binomial distributions are obtained only if the size of the large transcriptional bursts is relatively small.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The model scheme, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g001">Figure 1</xref>, is based on the following facts enunciated by Oehler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Oehler1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Oehler2">[26]</xref>. The <italic>lac</italic> operon of <italic>E. coli</italic> contains three operators, namely the main operator <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the two auxiliary operators <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, lying downstream and upstream of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The <italic>lac</italic> operon rarely entertains more than one Lac repressor, and this single repressor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can bind to any one of the operators, thus forming the operon states, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since the tetrameric repressor is a "dimer of dimers,'' it has a free dimer even after it is bound to one of the operators. This free dimer can bind to one of the remaining two free operators, thus forming a DNA loop. In principle, three looped states are feasible, namely, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but the last one is very unlikely to form. We are therefore led to consider only six feasible states of the operon — the repressor-free state, and the five repressor-bound states, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Only three of these six states permit transcriptional activity, namely, the repressor-free state and the repressor-bound states, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The first two states permit full transcriptional activity. The last state can be neglected since it permits only 3–5% of the full transcriptional activity.</p>
<p>The model kinetics are based on the following assumptions. All cells have the same number of repressors, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is tantamount to neglecting extrinsic noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Elowitz1">[4]</xref>. Since association of a cytosolic repressor to an operator is diffusion-limited, we assume that a cytosolic repressor has the same propensity, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for association with each of the operators. In contrast, the propensity for dissociation of operator-bound repressor does depend on the identity of the operator, and we denote the propensity for dissociation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> -bound repressor by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Next, we consider the kinetics of looping. The looped state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be formed from either <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but both pathways have the same propensity because they are driven by the same local concentration effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Oehler2">[26]</xref>. Thus, we denote the propensity for formation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by the same symbol, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Similarly, we denote the propensity for formation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by the same symbol, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Finally, we let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote the propensities for mRNA synthesis and degradation, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote the propensities for protein synthesis and dilution.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102580-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the parameter values in the absence of the inducer. The parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reflect the experimental values measured by Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Yu1">[10]</xref>. The parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was chosen such that the the mean burst size, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, agreed with the measured value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, reported by Yu et al. The parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was estimated by assuming that the mean burst frequency of fully induced cells, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is 600. The rationale for this assumption is as follows. An uninduced cell contains, on average, 0.5 molecules of the tetrameric LacZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Cai1">[9]</xref>, and hence, is expected to contain 2 molecules of the monomeric LacY. Since the number of LacY and LacZ molecules increases <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>1200-fold in fully induced cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Oehler1">[25]</xref>, there are 2400 LacY molecules in such cells, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which implies that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. All other parameter values were estimated using the method of Vilar &amp; Leibler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Vilar1">[15]</xref>. They estimated all the equilibrium constants using the repression data of Oehler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Oehler2">[26]</xref>. Then, given an experimental estimate of any one parameter, they could find all other parameter values. They took that one parameter to be the dissociation rate constant, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and assigned to it the value obtained from <italic>in vitro</italic> data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Goeddel1">[27]</xref>. Based on this procedure, the association rate, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, was found to be 0.73 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, recent <italic>in vivo</italic> measurement show that the association rate for a dimeric repressor is 0.014 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Hammar1">[28]</xref>. If the dimeric and tetrameric repressor associate at the same rate, and each cell contains 10 repressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0102580-Gilbert1">[29]</xref>, the estimated value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from these measurements is 0.14 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>It is worth noting that due to rapid loop formation, small transcriptional bursts are very bursty (pulsatile). Moreover, under the weakly inducing conditions used in the experiments (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e241" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> 200<italic> µ</italic>M TMG), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e242" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is relatively large, and hence, the large transcriptional bursts are also quite bursty. It follows that under these conditions, (33)–(34) should be expressible in terms of the size and frequency of the small and large transcriptional bursts. We shall show below that this is indeed the case.</p>

<p>Evidently, there is a discrepancy between the assumptions of Choi et al. and the implications of our model. To understand its origin, observe that their assumptions are equivalent to the relations<disp-formula id="pone.0102580.e333"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e333" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(65)</label></disp-formula></p>

In contrast, (51)–(52) show that small bursts contribute to the mean, but not to the variance. This difference arises because we assumed that looping is so fast that the rapid fluctuations due to partial dissociations are averaged out on the slow time scale of the other processes. This averaging process preserves the contribution of small transcriptional bursts to the mean, but eliminates their contribution to the variance.</p>
<p>The assumption <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e335" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> appears to be implausible. Indeed, (53) implies that translational bursts contribute the term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e336" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the Fano factor. For the small bursts to make a significant, let alone dominant, contribution to the Fano factor, it is clear that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e337" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e., on average, approximately one mRNA must be synthesized per partial dissociation. However, looping is so fast compared to transcription that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e338" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the absence of the inducer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102580-t003">Table 3</xref>). Moreover, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e339" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is unlikely to change even in the presence of the inducer since <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e340" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e341" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are constant over the range of inducer concentrations used in the experiments. We conclude that the bursts due to partial dissociations are so small that they cannot be the dominant source of burstiness.</p>

<p>Choi et al. rejected the raw data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g002">Fig. 2b</xref> since the occurrence of large bursts in a few cells distorted the statistics of the small bursts. We show below that these data are a valuable source of information about the statistics of <italic>large</italic> bursts. Specifically, (53)–(54) predict the observed variation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e344" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e345" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> derived from the raw data, and thus provide a method for estimating not only the size and frequency of the large transcriptional bursts, but also the fraction of proteins derived from them. This method is particularly useful because, as we show below, there are simple relationships between the size and frequency of the large bursts in strains SX701 and SX703, but they are <italic>not</italic> identical.</p>
<p>The analysis of the raw data shows that the total burstiness, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e346" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, increases with inducer concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>). <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0102580.e287">Eq.

<title>Condition for the negative binomial distribution</title>
<p>Choi et al. assumed that the protein distributions of both strains follow the Gamma distribution, the continuous analog of the negative binomial distribution. We have shown above that neither one of the strains follows the negative binomial distribution. Here, we demonstrate that the distributions can reduce to the negative binomial distribution, but only only if the large burst size is negligibly small, i.e., the association rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e402" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is much larger than the transcription rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e403" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>We have shown above that the proteins follow the negative binomial distribution only if the large bursts are, in fact, rather small, and hence, do not contribute to the burstiness. But it follows from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g002">Figs. 2a,b</xref> that these bursts do contribute significantly to the burstiness of strains SX701 and SX703 — if this was not true, (77) and (80) imply that the burstiness would be independent of inducer concentration, which contradicts the data. The negative binomial distribution is therefore unlikely to provide good fits to the raw data for both strains, but will fit the filtered data well, since the contribution of large bursts has been eliminated from it. The fits in Choi et al. are consistent with this conclusion. The Gamma distribution fits the filtered data for strain SX701 rather well. However, this is less so for the protein distributions obtained with strain SX703, which exhibits only large bursts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102580-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows that better fits are obtained with the negative hypergeometric distribution (38).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We formulated and solved a stochastic model of <italic>lac</italic> expression accounting for auxiliary operators and DNA looping. Based on a comparison of our expressions for the Fano factor, noise, and protein distribution of strains SX701 (with auxiliary operators) and SX703 (without auxiliary operators) with those proposed by Choi et al., we arrive at the following conclusions:</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p>The physical interpretations of the Fano factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e429" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and reciprocal noise <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e430" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for strain SX703 are identical to those proposed by Choi et al., namely <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e431" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e432" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the size and frequency of (large) transcriptional bursts.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>The physical interpretations of the Fano factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e433" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and reciprocal noise <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e434" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> derived from the <italic>filtered</italic> data for SX701 differ from those given by Choi et al., namely <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e435" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e436" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the size and frequency of small transcriptional bursts. Instead, we find that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e437" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the size of translational bursts, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e438" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is proportional to the mean number of mRNAs derived from small transcriptional bursts. Our interpretation is different because we assume that looping is so fast that fluctuations due to small transcriptional bursts are averaged out — small bursts therefore contribute to the mean, but not the burstiness, of the protein distribution. This has two consequences:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item>
<p>The information lost due to the averaging implies that the small burst size and frequency cannot be separately extracted from the data. At best, we can only determine the product of the small burst size and frequency, which represents the mean number of mRNAs derived from small bursts.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>The burstiness is entirely due to translational and large transcriptional bursts. In particular, the burst size derived from the filtered data for strain SX701, from which the contribution of the large bursts has been deliberately eliminated, yields the size of translational, rather than small transcriptional, bursts.</p>
</list-item></list>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>Choi et al. did not consider the <italic>raw</italic> data for SX701 because large bursts, although rare, contributed significantly to protein synthesis. This is consistent with our model: Even in uninduced cells, 20% of the proteins are derived from large bursts. We find that the raw data contains valuable information about the statistics of large bursts. By analyzing this data with our model, we isolate not only the size and frequency of large bursts, but also the fraction of proteins derived from them. The large burst size obtained in this manner is consistent with another prediction of the model, namely, it is one-third of the (large) burst size in strain SX703. The model also predicts that the fraction of proteins derived from large bursts is completely determined by a measurable quantity, namely the dissociation constant for binding of the repressor to the auxiliary operator <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102580.e439" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>The protein distributions for both strains are not negative binomial: SX703 follows a negative hypergeometric distribution, and SX701 follows a mixture of the negative binomial and negative hypergeometric distributions that reflects the existence of two sub-populations of proteins, namely, those derived from small and large bursts. Negative binomial distributions are attained only if large bursts are insignificant, a condition that holds only if the data are filtered by eliminating the contribution of such bursts.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>These results imply that interpretation of the steady state protein distributions depends crucially on the details of the regulatory mechanisms.</p>
