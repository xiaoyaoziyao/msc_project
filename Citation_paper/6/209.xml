<abstract>
<p>WNT-5A, a key player in embryonic development and post-natal homeostasis, has been associated with a myriad of pathological conditions including malignant, fibroproliferative and inflammatory disorders. Previously, we have identified WNT-5A as a transcriptional target of TGF-β in airway smooth muscle cells and demonstrated its function as a mediator of airway remodeling. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression. We show that TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a critical mediator of WNT-5A expression as its pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated silencing reduced TGF-β induction of WNT-5A. Furthermore, we show that TAK1 engages p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling which redundantly participates in WNT-5A induction as only simultaneous, but not individual, inhibition of p38 and JNK suppressed TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression. Remarkably, we demonstrate a central role of β-catenin in TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression. Regulated by TAK1, β-catenin is required for WNT-5A induction as its silencing repressed WNT-5A expression whereas a constitutively active mutant augmented basal WNT-5A abundance. Furthermore, we identify Sp1 as the transcription factor for WNT-5A and demonstrate its interaction with β-catenin. We discover that Sp1 is recruited to the WNT-5A promoter in a TGF-β-induced and TAK1-regulated manner. Collectively, our findings describe a TAK1-dependent, β-catenin- and Sp1-mediated signaling cascade activated downstream of TGF-β which regulates WNT-5A induction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>WNT-5A is a member of the Wingless/integrase 1 (WNT) family of secreted glycoproteins. There are 19 WNT ligands known in humans that act through 10 Frizzled (FZD) receptors, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/6 co-receptors and many non-FZD receptors, including ROR1, ROR2, RYK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Baarsma1">[1]</xref>. WNT signaling is broadly subdivided into two main streams- canonical (β-catenin-dependent) and non-canonical (β-catenin-independent) WNT signaling. In the canonical signaling, binding of a WNT ligand to a FZD receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptors activates signaling mechanisms resulting in stabilization of the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin, leading to its accumulation in the cytosol. Stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it partners with the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors and activates target gene transcription. Non-canonical WNT signaling functions exclusive of β-catenin and LRP5/6 and involves a multitude of pathways regulating gene transcription, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell polarity and cell movements. WNT/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and WNT/planar cell polarity (PCP) are the best characterized non-canonical WNT signaling pathways among others. In the WNT/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, binding of WNT ligands to FZD or non-FZD receptors activates calcium-dependent signaling molecules, including protein kinase C (PKC), Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT), whereas the WNT/PCP pathway involves activation of the RhoA signaling or c-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs) via small Rho-GTPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Baarsma1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>WNT-5A is a crucial signaling molecule which primarily acts through non-canonical WNT signaling and plays key roles in embryonic development and post-natal homeostatic processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Nishita1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Yamaguchi1">[3]</xref>. It is involved in lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Li1">[4]</xref>, heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Cohen1">[5]</xref> and mammary gland morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Roarty1">[6]</xref> and regulates stem cell renewal and tissue regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Yeh1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Miyoshi1">[8]</xref>. In parallel, WNT-5A has been linked to inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Kikuchi1">[9]</xref> and various malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Iozzo1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, WNT-5A has been very closely associated with fibrosis. Increased amount of WNT-5A is reported in lung fibroblasts of pulmonary fibrosis patients where it regulates proliferation and promotes cell viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Vuga1">[11]</xref>. Similarly, studies have implicated WNT-5A expression and signaling in renal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Li2">[12]</xref> and hepatic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Xiong1">[13]</xref> fibrosis. WNT-5A signaling has also been implicated in ciliopathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Lee1">[14]</xref> and WNT-5A antagonism has been shown to counteract vascular calcification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Woldt1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have recently reported increased WNT-5A expression in asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Kumawat1">[16]</xref>. We have shown that TGF-β induces WNT-5A expression in airway smooth muscle cells where it mediates the expression of extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Kumawat1">[16]</xref>. TGF-β also induces WNT-5A expression in pancreatic cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Ripka1">[17]</xref>. Similarly, the pro-inflammatory cytokines-IL-1β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Ge1">[18]</xref>, TNF-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Rauner1">[19]</xref>, LPS/IFNγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Pereira1">[20]</xref>, IL-6 family members- leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CTF-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Fujio1">[21]</xref> and high extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-MacLeod1">[22]</xref> have also been shown to augment WNT-5A expression in various cell types.</p>
<p>While our knowledge about the involvement of WNT-5A in various physiological and pathological processes is evolving rapidly along with the identification of novel inducers, the understanding of mechanisms regulating WNT-5A expression and homeostasis remains poor. In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression using airway smooth muscle cells as model system.</p>
<p>TGF-β is a pleiotropic cytokine with functions as diverse as embryonic development and maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis to regulating stem cell renewal, cell fate determination and cellular proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Wu1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Massague1">[24]</xref>. Binding of TGF-β to its receptors leads to phosphorylation and dimerization of SMAD2/3 and generation of a heterotrimeric complex with SMAD4 which translocates to the nucleus and activates TGF-β-responsive genes. Besides, TGF-β can signal in a SMAD-independent manner through activation of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), JNK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, small Rho-GTPases and Nuclear Factor κB (NFκB) to name a few <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Zhang1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>TAK1, first identified as a mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) activated by TGF-β, is a critical regulator in inflammatory, immune and stress response signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Sakurai1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Dai1">[27]</xref>. TAK1 constitutes an integral part of pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, activating NFκB and MAPK pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Dai1">[27]</xref>. Besides, TAK1 also mediates the SMAD-independent arm of the TGF-β signaling pathway and regulates various TGF-β-induced cellular responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Dai1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Delaney1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression using airway smooth muscle cells as 1] airway smooth muscle cells are key structural and functional component of airways and major contributor of airway remodeling in asthma and 2] TGF-β upregulates WNT-5A expression in these cells. We examined the participation of various TGF-β-activated pathways and demonstrate that TAK1 via p38 and JNK mediates WNT-5A expression. Further, we determined an unanticipated role for β-catenin in WNT-5A expression and describe its regulation by TAK1. Finally, we identify Sp1 as the transcription factor for <italic>WNT-5A</italic> and demonstrate a link between TAK1, β-catenin and Sp1.</p>

<title>TAK1 mediates TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression</title>
<p>TGF-β activates multiple pathways, both SMAD-dependent and -independent, downstream of its receptor. We targeted key pathways to identify the signaling cascades involved in WNT-5A expression by TGF-β in airway smooth muscle cells. We observed that pharmacological inhibition of SMAD3 (SIS3; 3 µM), Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) (Y27632; 1 µM), PI3K (LY294002; 3 µM), glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) -3 (SB216763; 10 µM) and PKC (BIM; 3 µM), failed to reduce WNT-5A induction by TGF-β (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094801.s001">Figure S1A-E</xref>). Surprisingly, the SMAD3 inhibitor SIS3 significantly increased WNT-5A mRNA abundance by ∼2-fold in comparison to both the basal and TGF-β-stimulated conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094801.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) whereas GSK-3 inhibition by SB216763 also lead to a modest but significant increase in WNT-5A induction at the basal level (fold-induction 1.7±0.4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094801.s001">Figure S1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, inhibition of TAK1 by LL-Z1640-2 attenuated WNT-5A mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner with significant reduction at 0.5 µM and 1 µM by ∼75% and ∼91%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with the mRNA data, TAK1 inhibition also abrogated the TGF-β-induced increase in WNT-5A protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A, E) Airway smooth muscle cells were either left unstimulated (vehicle basal) or stimulated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of LL-Z1640-2 (0.1 µM, 0.5 µM, 1.0 µM) for 24 hours.

(C–D, F) Airway smooth muscle cells were transfected with TAK1-specific siRNA or a non-targeting siRNA as control.

<p>To further validate the role of TAK1 in WNT-5A induction, we employed TAK1-specific siRNA. Transfection of airway smooth muscle cells with TAK1 siRNA significantly repressed TAK1 transcripts to ∼30% of the baseline expression in both the unstimulated and TGF-β-stimulated airway smooth muscle cells in comparison to non-targeting siRNA transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In agreement with the findings above using LL-Z1640-2, TAK1-specific siRNA significantly attenuated TGF-β-induced increase in abundance of WNT-5A transcripts by ∼50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously reported a role for WNT-5A in TGF-β-induced ECM production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Kumawat1">[16]</xref>. In line with that, both the inhibition and knock-down of TAK1 reduced TGF-β-induced ECM production, further confirming an upstream role for TAK1 in WNT-5A expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g001">Figure 1E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, our data suggest that TAK1 specifically mediates TGF-β-induced WNT-5A production.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated the signaling mechanisms downstream of TAK1 activation which could be involved in WNT-5A induction by TGF-β in airway smooth muscle cells. TAK1 activates JNK and p38 pathways in multiple systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Dai1">[27]</xref> which we sought to confirm in airway smooth muscle cells.

Next, we directly targeted p38 and JNK kinases to assess their effect on WNT-5A induction. Surprisingly, individual targeting of p38 (SB203580; 10 µM) and JNK (SP600125; 10 µM) by specific pharmacological inhibitors failed to lower TGF-β-induced WNT-5A mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g002">Figure 2B, C</xref>), whereas targeting p38 and JNK signaling simultaneously lead to significant attenuation of TGF-β-induced WNT-5A mRNA expression by ∼60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>We have earlier shown that TGF-β stabilizes the canonical WNT signaling effector and transcriptional co-activator β-catenin in airway smooth muscle cells which is affected by inhibition of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Gosens2">[36]</xref>; therefore we investigated the involvement of β-catenin in WNT-5A induction. Transfection of airway smooth muscle cells with β-catenin-specific siRNA significantly decreased the abundance of β-catenin transcripts in both the unstimulated and TGF-β stimulated cells confirming an effective knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Accordingly, β-catenin siRNA attenuated TGF-β-induced WNT-5A mRNA expression by ∼62% in comparison to non-targeted siRNA-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In accordance with the mRNA data, β-catenin knock-down abrogated TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression at protein level as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>To further corroborate the role of β-catenin, we utilized degradation-resistant constitutively active β-catenin mutant (S33Y-β-catenin). This S33Y-β-catenin mutant has a serine to tyrosine substitution at amino acid position 33 rendering it unphosphorylatable by GSK-3 and therefore resistant to proteasomal degradation. Transfection of airway smooth muscle cells with S33Y-β-catenin lead to enhanced expression of total β-catenin in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, this was sufficient to increase WNT-5A protein in the absence of TGF-β, remarkably similar to the level of WNT-5A in control vector-transfected TGF-β-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>As β-catenin stabilization is a hallmark of canonical WNT signaling activation, we hypothesized that canonical WNT signaling can also increase WNT-5A expression. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated airway smooth muscle cells with WNT-3A conditioned medium. Remarkably, WNT-3A conditioned medium led to a 2-fold induction in WNT-5A transcript levels in airway smooth muscle cells when compared to control conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g003">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data therefore suggest a central role for β-catenin in WNT-5A induction.</p>

<title>TAK1 signaling regulates β-catenin</title>
<p>Having confirmed the role of β-catenin, we got interested in the link between TAK1 and β-catenin in WNT-5A expression.

<p>Next, we investigated whether p38 and JNK are involved in TAK1-mediated β-catenin regulation. Of note, while JNK inhibition had no effect, inhibition of p38 significantly attenuated TGF-β-induced total β-catenin protein abundance by ∼70% in comparison to TGF-β in airway smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Accordingly, simultaneous inhibition of both p38 and JNK completely attenuated TGF-β-induced increase in total β-catenin levels in airway smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>We were intrigued by the contrasting results that while β-catenin is required for TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression, the reduction in total β-catenin by p38 inhibition, though substantial, totally failed to affect WNT-5A transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g004">4B</xref>). To address this issue, we focused on the functional fraction of β-catenin - the non-phosphorylated or active β-catenin. We observed that TGF-β induced non-phosphorylated active β-catenin at 16 and 24 hours which were attenuated by the TAK1 inhibitor LL-Z1640-2 at both the 16 and 24 hours by ∼74% and ∼100%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g004">Figure 4D, E</xref>). Notably, inhibition of p38 by SB203580 failed to yield significant effect on the TGF-β-induced increase in levels of active β-catenin at both the time points studied (data not shown).</p>

<title>Sp1 is the transcription factor for WNT-5A</title>

In agreement with the observations above using Mithramycin A, Sp1-specific siRNA significantly attenuated TGF-β-induced increase in abundance of WNT-5A transcripts confirming the requirement for Sp1 in WNT-5A induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with the requirement of WNT-5A in TGF-β-induced ECM expression, we checked whether Sp1 inhibition shows similar effects. Interestingly, inhibition of Sp1 activity by Mithramycin A attenuated TGF-β-induced expression of collagen IαI and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), further underlining the role of Sp1 in WNT-5A induction.</p>
<p>We next performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and validated the direct binding of Sp1 to WNT-5A promoters. Consistent with the role of Sp1 in WNT-5A induction as deduced from Mithramycin A and Sp1 siRNA, we confirmed binding of Sp1 on <italic>WNT-5A</italic> promoter A in response to TGF-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Of note, while the recruitment of Sp1 on <italic>WNT-5A</italic> promoter A was induced by TGF-β, Sp1 occupancy of promoter B was TGF-β independent (data not shown). In line with the role of TAK1 in WNT-5A induction, the TGF-β-induced Sp1 recruitment to <italic>WNT-5A</italic> promoter A was abrogated in the presence of TAK1 inhibitor LL-Z1640-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g006">Figure 6G</xref>)</p>
<p>Our data, therefore, suggest that Sp1 is required for WNT-5A expression and is recruited to <italic>WNT-5A</italic> promoter via TAK1 in response to TGF-β in airway smooth muscle cells.</p>

<title>TGF-β promotes β-catenin/Sp1 interaction</title>
<p>As we observed that both Sp1 and β-catenin are required for WNT-5A induction via TAK1, we sought to investigate the functional link between these findings. β-Catenin can function as transcriptional co-activator and partner with various transcription factors to regulate gene expression. We therefore determined whether β-catenin physically interacts with Sp1. Indeed, a co-immunoprecipitation assay using whole cell extracts from airway smooth muscle cells demonstrated that Sp1 associates with β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, this Sp1/β-catenin interaction was further enhanced by TGF-β as indicated by increased amounts of β-catenin in Sp1 immunoprecipitates from TGF-β-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Of note, the increased interaction between Sp1 and β-catenin coincides with increased abundance of β-catenin by TGF-β as seen in whole cell extracts while Sp1 levels remain fairly equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094801-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we have delineated the signaling mechanisms driving TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression in airway smooth muscle cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing a signaling cascade consisting of TAK1, β-catenin and Sp1 that regulates WNT-5A expression. We demonstrate that TAK1 activity is required for WNT-5A expression in response to TGF-β stimulation and provide evidence for the involvement of β-catenin in this process which, in turn, is regulated by TAK1 signaling. We further identify Sp1 as transcription factor for WNT-5A and demonstrate its interaction with β-catenin in airway smooth muscle cells. We provide evidence that Sp1 is recruited to the WNT-5A promoter in response to TGF-β, a phenomenon regulated by TAK1 activity. Collectively, our study identifies a novel pathway involved in WNT-5A regulation, thus, providing an understanding of mechanisms governing WNT-5A homeostasis.</p>
<p>WNT-5A plays a key role in wide range of developmental and postnatal processes and derailed WNT-5A homeostasis has been widely implicated in myriad of pathological situations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Kikuchi1">[9]</xref>. WNT-5A expression is induced by a variety of growth factors and cytokines, however, little is known about the mechanisms regulating WNT-5A expression. Here, we demonstrate that TAK1 mediates WNT-5A expression in response to TGF-β as pharmacological inhibition or siRNA mediated silencing of TAK1 suppressed the TGF-β-induced augmentation in WNT-5A expression. Interestingly, out of many targeted TGF-β-activated pathways including the SMAD3-dependent cascade, only TAK1 inhibition was able to attenuate TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression. This suggests that TAK1-mediated induction of WNT-5A is a highly selective phenomenon. TAK1 inhibition or siRNA also attenuated TGF-β induced ECM gene expression, demonstrating the functional importance of TAK1 in this response.</p>
<p>MAPKs including p38 and JNK are downstream effectors of TAK1 in many cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Dai1">[27]</xref>. A study from our group has shown that TAK1 mediates PDGF-induced ERK1/2 activation in airway smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Pera1">[37]</xref>. Here, we show that TAK1 mediates TGF-β-induced activation of p38 and JNK MAPKs in airway smooth muscle cells as demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of LL-Z1640-2. We further provide evidence for direct involvement of p38 and JNK signaling in WNT-5A induction. Remarkably, only simultaneous but not separate inhibition of p38 and JNK could reduce TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression. This clearly suggests that p38 and JNK redundantly regulate TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression in airway smooth muscle cells.</p>
<p>TGF-β/SMAD constitutes the principle signaling axis in TGF-β responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Wu1">[23]</xref>. We observed that the inhibition of SMAD3 enhanced TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression, indicating a negative regulation by SMAD pathway. The contribution of TGF-β/SMAD signaling in WNT-5A induction, therefore, cannot be ruled out. Further investigation is required to decipher the regulatory role and underlying mechanisms of SMAD signaling in TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression.</p>
<p>β-Catenin, the canonical WNT signaling effector, constitutes an important component in TGF-β signaling in airway smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Yeganeh1">[38]</xref>. In canonical WNT signaling, cytosolic β-catenin is continuously phosphorylated by a multi-component destruction complex comprising of GSK-3 and marked for proteasomal degradation. Inactivation of destruction complex by canonical WNT ligands rescues β-catenin, leading to its accumulation in cytosol. Free cytosolic β-catenin then translocates to the nucleus and activates gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Baarsma1">[1]</xref>. Besides canonical WNT ligand, TGF-β also stabilizes β-catenin where it participates in TGF-β-specific cellular responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Yeganeh1">[38]</xref>. Our group has previously identified important physiological and functional roles for β-catenin in airway smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Gosens2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Baarsma2">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Jansen1">[41]</xref>. Here, we describe a novel role for β-catenin in WNT-5A induction. Silencing of β-catenin reduced TGF-β-induced WNT-5A induction. In addition to that, transient transfection of degradation resistant S33Y-β-catenin mutant in airway smooth muscle cells raised the basal WNT-5A protein abundance underlining the importance of β-catenin in WNT-5A induction. Remarkably, the presence of the canonical WNT ligand- WNT-3A also modestly augmented WNT-5A transcription, raising the possibility that β-catenin stabilization constitutes a primary phenomenon in WNT-5A expression in airway smooth muscle cells. However, WNT-3A-induced WNT-5A expression was much weaker in comparison to TGF-β-mediated induction suggesting that pathways other than stable β-catenin, define the magnitude of WNT-5A expression levels.</p>
<p>TGF-β engages a two pronged mechanism to increase the cytosolic abundance of β-catenin in airway smooth muscle cells- first, it inactivates GSK-3, the key upstream mediator of β-catenin degradation and second, it induces transcriptional upregulation of β-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Yeganeh1">[38]</xref>. Here, we demonstrate TAK1-mediated stabilization and subsequent increase in β-catenin abundance in response to TGF-β. Using LL-Z1640-2, we show that the TGF-β-induced increase in total cytosolic β-catenin levels is attenuated on TAK1 inhibition. This is in line with a recent report showing the positive effect of TAK1 on β-catenin stabilization and nuclear localization in KRAS-dependent colon cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Singh1">[42]</xref>. Furthermore, we extend our findings by demonstrating that TAK1 inhibition reduces transcriptionally active non-phosphorylated β-catenin, linking the TAK1-mediated regulation of β-catenin to functional level. The downstream mediators of TAK1 signaling- p38 and JNK- redundantly mediate β-catenin regulation in response to TGF-β. Interestingly, we also observed that TAK1 activity mediates TGF-β-induced GSK-3 inactivation by phosphorylation at Ser9-GSK-3α and Ser21-GSK-3β (data not shown). The observed GSK-3 phosphorylation sites are targeted by PI3K/AKT signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Cross1">[43]</xref> indicating the possible activation of PI3K/AKT by TAK1 in response to TGF-β. Indeed, TGF-β has been shown to activate AKT pathway via TAK1 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Gingery1">[44]</xref>. Multiple signaling pathways activated by TAK1 explain the redundancy we observe in TAK1 signaling with respect to WNT-5A induction. Altogether, our study identifies TAK1 as an upstream regulator of β-catenin, mediating its effects via a signaling cascade comprising of GSK-3, p38 and JNK. As PI3K inhibition failed to alter WNT-5A abundance, the relative contributions of GSK-3 and p38/JNK in β-catenin stabilization and WNT-5A expression warrant further investigation.</p>
<p>Altered expression patterns of WNT-5A and β-catenin have been implicated in various disorders, for instance, fibrosis. Enhanced expression and increased nuclear localization of β-catenin have been shown in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Chilosi1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Konigshoff1">[46]</xref>, systemic sclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Lam1">[47]</xref> and has also been linked to liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Cheng1">[48]</xref> and renal fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-He1">[49]</xref>. Similarly, increased WNT-5A expression levels have also been linked to lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Vuga1">[11]</xref>, hepatic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Xiong1">[13]</xref> and renal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Li2">[12]</xref> fibrosis. Recently, two separate studies from our lab have also shown that WNT-5A and β-catenin mediate common function in TGF-β signaling in the airway smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Kumawat1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Baarsma2">[39]</xref>. We have shown that TGF-β-induced WNT-5A mediates ECM production in airway smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Kumawat1">[16]</xref> whereas another report shows that β-catenin is required and sufficient to induce ECM production in airway smooth muscle cells, even in the absence of TGF-β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Baarsma2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Baarsma3">[50]</xref>. Paradoxically, WNT-5A has been shown to both activate and antagonize β-catenin signaling in a receptor-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Mikels1">[51]</xref>. We have previously demonstrated WNT-independent regulation of TGF-β-induced β-catenin, as neither silencing of WNT-5A nor inhibition of WNT ligand secretion by IWP2 could alter TGF-β-induced β-catenin abundance in airway smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Kumawat1">[16]</xref>. However, our current study provides the unanticipated but functional explanation connecting β-catenin as an upstream mediator of WNT-5A induction in airway smooth muscle cells. Together with the previous studies, our data suggest a complex cell-dependent relation between β-catenin and WNT-5A.</p>
<p>Transcriptional upregulation of WNT-5A has been reported in several studies. The <italic>WNT-5A</italic> gene generates two very identical transcripts by utilization of alternative transcription start sites of which the corresponding upstream sequences are termed as promoter A and B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Katoh1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Katula1">[33]</xref>. Both the promoters have comparable transcriptional potential; their activity, however, is highly context dependent. For instance, <italic>WNT-5A</italic> promoter A has been suggested to be more active in human and murine fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Katula1">[33]</xref>. CUTL1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Ripka1">[17]</xref>, STAT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Katoh2">[52]</xref>, TBX1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Chen1">[53]</xref>, NFκB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Ge1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Rauner1">[19]</xref> have all previously been reported as transcription factors for WNT-5A in various cell types. We performed <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of <italic>WNT-5A</italic> promoters which revealed multiple putative transcription factor binding sites on both the promoters. Our <italic>WNT-5A</italic> promoter screen predicted previously described transcription factor binding sites underlining its accuracy. Silencing of CUTL1 or ETS1 failed to affect WNT-5A induction in airway smooth muscle cells suggesting a cell-specific transcriptional program regulating WNT-5A expression. Our observations regarding involvement of β-catenin in WNT-5A induction lead us to target TCF4, the most common binding partner of β-catenin. However, TCF4 knock-down didn't effect WNT-5A induction in our system suggesting that β-catenin does not utilize TCF4 for mediating WNT-5A induction.</p>
<p>Sp1, a member of Specificity protein/Kruppel-like family of transcription factors, is ubiquitously expressed and involved in regulating expression of a wide array of genes starting from early embryonic phase and extending throughout the life span <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Black1">[54]</xref>. TGF-β utilizes Sp1 for mediating many of its transcriptional responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Black1">[54]</xref>. Multiple putative Sp1 transcription factor binding sites on <italic>WNT-5A</italic> promoter have been predicted earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Danielson1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Katula1">[33]</xref> and also appeared in our <italic>WNT-5A</italic> promoter screen. We used Mithramycin A and specific siRNA to deduce the role of Sp1 in WNT-5A induction. Mithramycin A is a highly selective inhibitor of Sp1 which competes for DNA binding with Sp1 and attenuates its recruitment on promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Blume1">[55]</xref>. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of Sp1 by Mithramycin A or Sp1 knock-down using specific-siRNA significantly attenuated TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression confirming a vital role for Sp1 in this process. Mithramycin A also attenuated ECM gene expression in response to TGF-β, demonstrating the functional relevance of Sp1 in WNT-5A mediated responses in airway smooth muscle cells. ChIP analysis further validated the crucial role for Sp1 in WNT-5A induction where we demonstrate direct binding of Sp1 on <italic>WNT-5A</italic> promoter in TGF-β-dependent manner. Furthermore, we identified TAK1 as upstream regulator of TGF-β-induced recruitment of Sp1 as LL-Z1640-2 treatment reduced Sp1 binding to <italic>WNT-5A</italic> promoter in airway smooth muscle cells. This is in contrast with earlier reports where TAK1 has been shown to negatively regulate Sp1 activity in keratinocytes and lung adenocarcinoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Fujiki1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Tan1">[57]</xref>. However, our data firmly supports positive interaction between Sp1 and TAK1 as inhibition of Sp1 completely abrogated WNT-5A expression, an effect which is strikingly similar to inhibition of TAK1. This ambiguity in observations underlines the context-dependent regulation of Sp1 by TAK1.</p>
<p>Sp1 activity is influenced by multiple post-translational modifications governing its DNA binding activity and protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Chang1">[58]</xref>. MAPKs including p38 and JNK can regulate Sp1 via phosphorylation. A study has reported association of Sp1 with p38 in fibroblasts leading to subsequent phosphorylation and increased recruitment of Sp1 to <italic>filamin A</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-DAddario1">[59]</xref>. Similarly, LPS-activated p38 regulates Sp1 binding to human <italic>il-10</italic> promoter in human monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Ma1">[60]</xref> whereas it regulates Sp1 transactivation, and not DNA binding, on <italic>platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase</italic> (<italic>PAF AH</italic>) promoter in murine and human immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Wu2">[61]</xref>. Likewise, JNK-mediated phosphorylation regulates Sp1 binding on human <italic>urokinase-type plasminogen activator</italic> (<italic>uPA)</italic> gene promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Benasciutti1">[62]</xref> and regulates Sp1 protein stability during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Chuang1">[63]</xref>. Sp1, hence, can be differentially regulated by MAPK signaling, not only in a cell- and stimulus-specific manner but also in a promoter-specific manner. Consistent with the positive regulation of Sp1 by both p38 and JNK signaling, activation of either p38 or JNK cascade is sufficient to sustain TGF-β-induced and TAK1-mediated transcriptional upregulation of WNT-5A. Our data, thus, suggest that TAK1 signaling recruits Sp1 to WNT-5A promoter via activation of p38 and JNK. Of note, this observation also provides an explanation to the stimulatory effect of TAK1 on Sp1 in our system as opposed to the inhibitory effect of TAK1 on Sp1 activity as reported by other groups.</p>
<p>Both β-catenin and Sp1 can associate with various transcription factors and co-activators in a cell- and stimulus-dependent manner to mediate their cellular responses. However, the interaction between β-catenin and Sp1 has been shown to be counteractive and indirect. For instance, constitutive activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling in mouse brain represses Sp1 target gene expression via upregulation of Sp5, a Sp1 repressor protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Fujimura1">[64]</xref>. On the other hand, Sp1 antagonizes β-catenin signaling by enhancing expression of E-cadherin which sequesters β-catenin to the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Hsu1">[65]</xref>. Here, we report a previously undetected interaction between Sp1 and β-catenin in airway smooth muscle cells which is further promoted by TGF-β suggesting a positive functional role in TGF-β cellular responses. Of note, the increased Sp1/β-catenin interaction as observed in the presence of TGF-β coincides with increased cellular abundance of β-catenin. Whether the Sp1/β-catenin interaction is spontaneous and determined by the amount of cytosolic β-catenin available in the cell or is influenced by external factors like TGF-β has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>In airway smooth muscle cells, TAK1 mediates cell phenotype and cigarette smoke-induced inflammation. A study from our group has shown that TAK1-mediates PDGF induced activation of ERK1/2, leading to airway smooth muscle cell proliferation and reduction in contractile proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Pera1">[37]</xref>. Pera et al also identified a pro-inflammatory role for TAK1 wherein it mediates cigarette smoke-induced release of IL-8 in airway smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Pera2">[66]</xref>. Interestingly, WNT-5A is a key player in pro-inflammatory responses in both the immune and non-immune cells. For instance, WNT-5A is induced by LPS/IFNγ in human macrophages where it mediates release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β and MIP-1β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Pereira1">[20]</xref>. Similarly, WNT-5A induces macrophage activation and release of IL-8 and CXC chemokines in human monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Kim1">[67]</xref>. Of note, WNT-5A also mediates pro-inflammatory responses in human aortic endothelial cells, a non-immune class of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Kim2">[68]</xref>. Our current findings correlating TAK1 activity and WNT-5A expression provide evidence for their close interaction to mediate pro-inflammatory reactions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our present study describes a novel signaling cascade comprising of TAK1, β-catenin and Sp1 in TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression in airway smooth muscle cells. We deduce the molecular pathway regulating WNT-5A expression which can have implications in various physiological and pathological situations involving WNT-5A. Moreover, our study also provides a mechanistic insight intertwining TAK1, β-catenin and Sp1 which, perhaps, has a much wider applicability extending to other cell- and tissue types and processes involving these factors. Our data suggest that TAK1 regulates TGF-β-induced WNT-5A expression by two simultaneous but linked mechanisms – 1] it augments expression of β-catenin which, in turn, partners with Sp1, perhaps, finalizing a transcriptional complex and 2] it promotes binding of Sp1 transcriptional complex to WNT-5A promoter thereby allowing WNT-5A transcription. Interestingly, therapeutic tools for targeting TAK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Sakurai1">[26]</xref> and Sp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Chang1">[58]</xref> are available whereas small molecule inhibitors for β-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Baarsma1">[1]</xref> and WNT-5A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094801-Jenei1">[69]</xref> with therapeutic potential are fast emerging. Our study, thus, not only sheds light on the regulatory mechanisms of WNT-5A expression but also provides multiple therapeutic targets which could be utilized to devise effective treatment strategies for wide array of diseases involving this pathway.</p>
