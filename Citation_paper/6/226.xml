        <p>Constitutive activation of the WNT signaling effector CTNNB1 (β-catenin) in the Sertoli cells of the <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> mouse model results in progressive germ cell loss and sterility. In this study, we sought to determine if this phenotype could be due to a loss of spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) activity. Reciprocal SSC transplants between <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> and wild-type mice showed that SSC activity is lost in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> testes over time, whereas the mutant testes could not support colonization by wild-type SSCs. Microarray analyses performed on cultured Sertoli cells showed that CTNNB1 induces the expression of genes associated with the female sex determination pathway, which was also found to occur in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> testes. One CTNNB1 target gene encoded the secreted signaling molecule WNT4. We therefore tested the effects of WNT4 on SSC-enriched germ cell cultures, and found that WNT4 induced cell death and reduced SSC activity without affecting cell cycle. Conversely, conditional inactivation of <italic>Wnt4</italic> in the <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> model rescued spermatogenesis and male fertility, indicating that WNT4 is the major effector downstream of CTNNB1 responsible for germ cell loss. Furthermore, WNT4 was found to signal via the CTNNB1 pathway in Sertoli cells, suggesting a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop. Collectively, these data indicate for the first time that ectopic activation of a signaling cascade in the stem cell niche depletes SSC activity through a paracrine factor. These findings may provide insight into the pathogenesis of male infertility, as well as embryonic gonadal development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are the progenitor population of male germ cells. Similar to other stem cell types, they can be directed to one of two cell fate decisions: either self-renewal to maintain the SSC pool, or differentiation into more specialized germ cells that will eventually become spermatozoa. SSCs reside in a specialized microenvironment, termed the SSC niche, that controls the activity of SSCs and is believed to be formed mainly by Sertoli cells and the basal membrane along the vascular network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Oatley1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Yoshida1">[2]</xref>. The Sertoli cells seem to be a particularly important component of the SSC niche, as numerous factors such as glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), kit ligand (KITL), activin A and bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) are all produced by Sertoli cells and affect self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation of SSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Meng1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-DeJong1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The wingless-related MMTV integration site (WNT) gene family encodes a large number of secreted signaling glycoproteins that are involved in many biological processes including embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Lustig1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Huelsken1">[9]</xref>, adult tissue homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Miller1">[10]</xref>, maintenance of progenitor cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Reya1">[11]</xref> and cell fate determination and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Lee1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Logan1">[15]</xref>. WNT signal transduction can occur via at least three distinct pathways, commonly referred to as the WNT/Ca<sup>2+</sup>, planar cell polarity and WNT/CTNNB1 or canonical pathway. In the latter, a pool of CTNNB1 (β-catenin) protein localizes to the cytoplasm, where it is resides in a large multiprotein complex that notably includes the scaffold proteins APC and AXIN. Bound to these proteins, CTNNB1 is rapidly phosphorylated by other components of the complex, but mainly by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. These phosphorylations result in the subsequent ubiquitination of the protein and its degradation by the cellular proteosomal machinery, and as a result there is little or no free CTNNB1 in the cytoplasmic pool in the resting state. The WNT/CTNNB1 pathway is activated by the binding of a WNT to a cognate receptor of the Frizzled (FZD) family, and ultimately results in CTNNB1 escaping the complex in a hypophosphorylated state, allowing it to accumulate within the cell and to translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus, CTNNB1 associates with different transcription factors to modulate the transcriptional activity of various target genes in a cell type- and developmental stage-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Lustig1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Logan1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Giles1">[16]</xref>. WNT signaling in the postnatal testis has not been well studied, but it has been suggested to affect normal spermatogenesis. Notably, mice bearing a null mutation of the WNT signaling antagonist <italic>Nkd1</italic> have lower numbers of haploid spermatids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Li1">[17]</xref>, and WNT5a has been shown to promote SSC self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Yeh1">[18]</xref>. Recently, ourselves and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Boyer1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Tanwar1">[20]</xref> generated transgenic mice (<italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup>) in which Cre-lox recombination leads to the expression of a dominant-stable mutant of CTNNB1 in Sertoli cells, thereby activating the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway constitutively in these cells. These mice were sterile due to testicular atrophy associated with degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium starting by 5 wks of age and resulting in complete loss of germ cells before 4 months. <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> Sertoli cells also exhibited morphological characteristics and gene expression patterns suggestive of incomplete differentiation that appeared in a manner coincident with germ cell loss. These data suggested that the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway disrupts Sertoli cell functions critical to their capacity to support spermatogenesis in the postnatal testis.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the loss of spermatogenesis in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> animals results from defective Sertoli cells that cannot support SSC activity. We discovered that <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> Sertoli cells lose their SSC niche capacity and that this is due to the ectopic expression of WNT4, which acts in a paracrine manner to downregulate SSC activity.</p>

        <p>To determine if germ cell loss in the <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> model could be associated with a loss of SSC activity, reciprocal SSC transplant studies were performed. In the first experiment, SSCs in mutant testes were transplanted into testes of germ cell-depleted wild-type recipient mice. To genetically label mutant donor cells with lacZ, <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> mice were crossed with <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic> mice. <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic> mice express the <italic>lacZ</italic> transgene in virtually all cell types, including male germ cells, allowing the discrimination of donor cells from recipient cells after transplantation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Donor SSCs from 5 and 17 week-old <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor;Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> and control <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor;Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup> mice were transplanted and the recipient testes analyzed two months later. A 56% reduction in the SSC frequency was observed in 5 week-old mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029764-g001">Fig. 1A–1D</xref>), corresponding to a 46% reduction in total functional SSC numbers per testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029764-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>). SSC frequency further declined to 8.6% of control in testes of 17 week-old mutant mice, with total SSC numbers per testis reduced to 1% of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029764-g001">Fig. 1D–1H</xref>). These results indicate that a loss of SSC activity occurs in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> mice in a manner temporally coincident with testicular atrophy and germ cell loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Boyer1">[19]</xref>.</p>

        <p>In the second experiment, the ability of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> testes to support wild-type SSCs was examined by using 6-week-old mutant mice as recipients. Any endogenous germ cells remaining in recipient testes at this age were depleted, and <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic> donor cells were transplanted into these testes. One week after transplantation, donor germ cells were present in both <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> and control <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup> testes but differed in appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029764-g002">Fig. 2A, 2B</xref>). In control testes, donor cells were found on the basal membrane of the tubules, indicating that the cells had migrated from the lumen and colonized the recipient testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029764-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, inset). In contrast, no migrating cells were observed in the testis of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> mice, and most donor cells remained in the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029764-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, inset). When analyzed two months after transplantation, a complete regeneration of spermatogenesis was observed in control animals (24.4±2.5 colonies/10<sup>6</sup> cells transplanted), whereas no donor-derived spermatogenesis was observed in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029764-g002">Fig. 2C, 2D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the activation of CTNNB1 in Sertoli cells altered their functional properties, resulting in a failure of the SSC niche and the loss of the ability to support SSC activity.</p>

An <italic>in vitro</italic> approach using short-term primary Sertoli cell cultures was used in order to preferentially identify immediate CTNNB1 transcriptional targets in an isolated cell population. Sertoli cells from 3 week-old <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/tm1Mmt</sup> mice were placed in culture and infected with adenoviruses to induce the expression of either Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre, to express dominant-stable CTNNB1) or eGFP (Ad-eGFP, control) for 24 h. Then, each cell population was subjected to microarray analyses, followed by <italic>in silico</italic> analyses to identify groups of genes associated with specific signaling pathways or biological processes. A first group of genes induced by Ad-Cre (i.e., dominant-stable CTNNB1) consisted of <italic>Ccnd1</italic> (cyclin D1) and a number of cell cycle-associated genes with known interaction with cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029764.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029764.s004">Table S1</xref>), suggesting that CTNNB1 could regulate Sertoli cell proliferation.

        <title>WNT4 downregulates spermatogonial stem cell activity <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
        <p>As Sertoli cells regulate SSC activity via the secretion of paracrine factors, the above-mentioned gene expression data was carefully screened for the differential expression of genes encoding secreted molecules that could contribute to the progressive loss of SSC activity observed in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> mice. Although no such factors were found to be down-regulated by CTNNB1, both <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Fst</italic> were up-regulated. We therefore sought to determine if either could affect SSC activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Testis cells from C57BL/6×<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic> F<sub>1</sub> hybrid mice were enriched for SSCs and cultured on feeder cells, resulting in the formation of undifferentiated spermatogonial aggregates (clusters). Clusters were then transferred onto Matrigel without feeder cells and treated with recombinant FST or WNT4 at different concentrations. After 4 days, the cluster-forming ability of the treated cells was assessed, as this is an in vitro indicator of SSC activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Yeh1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Yeh2">[23]</xref>.

        <p>To determine if the loss of SSC activity <italic>in vitro</italic> in response to WNT4 could be attributed to reduced proliferation, the cell cycle profile of the WNT4-treated cluster cells was examined by FACS analysis following propidium iodide incorporation. Results showed statistically indistinguishable proportions of cells in the proliferative phase (S/G<sub>2</sub>/M) of the cell cycle between WNT4-treated and control cells, indicating that WNT4 did not affect proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029764-g004">Fig. 4D, 4E</xref>).

Consistent with the results of the first experiment, WNT4 had no effect on active CTNNB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029764-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The SSCs are the adult stem cell population that sits atop the male germ cell developmental hierarchy. The proper regulation of SSC activity is therefore critical for the initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis. SSC survival and activity is dependent on a highly specialized microenvironment, the SSC niche, which provides the paracrine factors required to nurture SSCs and regulate their cell division patterns to maintain spermatogenesis. Various mutant mice have been reported in which spermatogenesis is disrupted and SSC activity declines. Phenotypes of some of these mutants are known to arise from defects in Sertoli cells, an important element of the SSC niche. Two examples of such mutants are Steel (Sl) and ETV5-knockout mice. In Sl mice, mutations occur in a Sertoli cell-derived growth factor, KITL, and affect the survival and function of differentiating spermatogonia, rather than SSCs, in postnatal mice and those of primordial germ cells in embryos, resulting in the loss of spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-deRooij1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Fleischman1">[26]</xref>. Although available data indicate that the SSC population size is diminished in Sl mouse testes, SSCs remaining are capable of accomplishing complete spermatogenesis when exposed to wild-type Sertoli cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Ogawa1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Shinohara1">[28]</xref>. In the case of ETV5-knockout mice, spermatogenesis takes place during the first cycle after birth but ceases with time due to gradual depletion of SSCs. ETV5-null mutation seems to affect both SSCs and Sertoli cells, and the mechanism of SSC depletion has not been identified definitively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Tyagi1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Simon1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we report that activation of CTNNB1 signaling specifically in Sertoli cells results in a defective testicular somatic environment that negatively regulates SSC activity. Our results indicate that <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> testes lose their endogenous SSC activity over time and are unable to support SSCs upon transplantation. These findings suggested an alteration of the paracrine signals emanating from Sertoli cells, leading to a functional breakdown of the SSC niche and resultant loss of SSC activity. Our subsequent investigations identified WNT4 as a key paracrine factor that acts downstream of CTNNB1 to downregulate SSC activity. Not only could WNT4 reduce SSC activity and increase germ cell apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic>, but conditional inactivation of <italic>Wnt4</italic> in the <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> model rescued spermatogenesis and restored fertility. We therefore conclude that, rather surprisingly, WNT4 appears to be the major factor downstream of CTNNB1 that is responsible for the loss of SSC activity, the inability to support donor SSCs, and the collapse of spermatogenesis that occurs in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> mice. It was previously suggested that GDNF might play a role in the induction of germ cell apoptosis in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> testes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Tanwar1">[20]</xref>. Contrary to Tanwar et al., we did not find increased expression of <italic>Gdnf</italic> in the <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029764.s002">Fig. S2</xref>), although we examined mRNA levels whereas Tanwar et al. studied protein expression, and therefore the stabilization of GDNF protein in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> testes could explain this discrepancy. Regardless, our results suggest that WNT4 is the primary factor involved in germ cells apoptosis, but do not exclude that GDNF might also play a minor role.</p>
      <p>The identification of WNT4 as a negative regulator of SSC activity may provide insight into the pathogenesis of male infertility. The <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>tm1Mmt/+</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> model closely mimics certain forms of Sertoli Cell Only Syndrome (SCOS), being characterized by germ cell loss, normal virilization, and a mosaic pattern of Sertoli cell differentiation in the adult testis with the expression of markers of immature Sertoli cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Boyer1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Boyer2">[22]</xref>. The pathogenesis of SCOS is poorly understood at the genetic level, although microdeletions of the Y chromosome are involved in some cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Shahid1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Krausz1">[32]</xref>. Our results suggest that any post-developmental event resulting in the inappropriate activation of the WNT4/CTNNB1 signaling loop in Sertoli cells could lead to SSC loss, with subsequent loss of all germ cells. As WNT4 is a secreted molecule that can act in a paracrine manner and can amplify its own signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029764-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), localized inappropriate activation of this pathway could conceivably spread to affect the entire organ. Whether or not such a mechanism is relevant to the etiology of SCOS in men has not been studied to our knowledge.</p>
      <p>Importantly, our findings that WNT4/CTNNB1 signaling in Sertoli cells results in the expression of granulosa cell genes and downregulates SSC activity may provide new insight into mechanisms of sex determination and gonadal development. WNT4/CTNNB1 signaling has well-established roles in female sex determination, as WNT4 insufficiency during embryogenesis results in partial female-to-male sex reversal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Liu1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Mandel1">[35]</xref>. Conversely, WNT4/CTNNB1 overexpression during embryonic development can cause male-to-female sex reversal, the extent of which apparently depending both on species and the amount of WNT4 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Jordan1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Chang2">[39]</xref>. In this study, we demonstrate that constitutive WNT4/CTNNB1 signaling in cells already committed to the Sertoli cell fate results in the expression of genes normally expressed during female sex differentiation and a loss of Sertoli cell differentiation and function (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Boyer1">[19]</xref>). These results are in agreement with the recent view that gonadal somatic cell commitment to either the granulosa cell or Sertoli cell fate is not “stable”, and can be partially or completely reversed by alterations in specific signaling processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Schlessinger1">[40]</xref>. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this concept is the recent report that postnatal deletion of <italic>Foxl2</italic> results in the reprogramming of granulosa cells into a Sertoli-like cell lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Uhlenhaut1">[41]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, WNT5a has recently been shown to promote SSC activity via non-canonical pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Yeh1">[18]</xref>. As WNT4 also appears to signal via non-canonical mechanisms in SSCs, it remains to be determined how each molecule acts to generate opposite biological effects via a similar mechanism in a single cell type. One possibility is that they have distinct receptor complexes, the activation of which triggers distinct (but partially overlapping) signaling cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Mikels1">[42]</xref>. This idea is supported by the observation that WNT5a appears to actively repress CTNNB1 signaling in SSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Yeh1">[18]</xref>, which we did not observe in the case of WNT4.</p>
      <p>We believe that it is unlikely that WNT4 plays a physiological role in the regulation of SSC activity in the adult testis. Indeed, we found <italic>Wnt4</italic> mRNA to be barely detectable or undetectable in normal testes using PCR-based methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029764-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029764.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), whereas the expression of most other <italic>Wnt</italic> genes (including <italic>Wnt5a</italic>) was readily detectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029764.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Wnt4</italic><sup>flox/−</sup>;<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>tm3(cre)Bhr/+</sup> mice are fertile and have qualitatively normal spermatogenesis (unpublished observations). Our data therefore seem to indicate that the WNT4/CTNNB1 pathway is not a physiological regulator of spermatogenesis. It should further be noted that Wnt1, a potent activator of the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway, is robustly produced by spermatids, which represent over 70% of cells in the seminiferous epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Shackleford1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Bellv1">[44]</xref>. This implies that Sertoli cells are constantly exposed to the activator of WNT/CTNNB1 signaling, yet the pathway is not normally active in these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Yeh1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029764-Boyer1">[19]</xref>. Collectively, these results therefore argue that the canonical WNT signaling pathway must be suppressed (presumably by repressors of WNT signaling such as SFRPs, DDKs or NKDs) in Sertoli cells to maintain the functional integrity of SSC niche, and thus the forced activation of this pathway has catastrophic consequences for SSCs, spermatogenesis, and male fertility.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have identified a WNT4/CTNNB1 signaling loop in Sertoli cells that acts in a paracrine manner to downregulate SSC activity. The results of this study may provide important insight into gonadal development and into the etiology of certain male germ cell loss pathologies.</p>
