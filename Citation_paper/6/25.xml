Consequently, deciphering the mechanism of fibronectin fibril formation is of immense interest. Fibronectin fibrillogenesis is driven by cell-traction forces that mechanically unfold particular modules within fibronectin. Previously, mechanical unfolding of fibronectin has been modeled by applying tensile forces at the N- and C-termini of fibronectin domains; however, physiological loading is likely focused on the solvent-exposed RGD loop in the 10<sup>th</sup> type-III repeat of fibronectin (10FNIII), which mediates binding to cell-surface integrin receptors. In this work we used steered molecular dynamics to study the mechanical unfolding of 10FNIII under tensile force applied at this RGD site. We demonstrate that mechanically unfolding 10FNIII by pulling at the RGD site requires less work than unfolding by pulling at the N- and C- termini. Moreover, pulling at the N- and C-termini leads to 10FNIII unfolding along several pathways while pulling on the RGD site leads to a single exclusive unfolding pathway that includes a partially unfolded intermediate with exposed hydrophobic N-terminal β-strands – residues that may facilitate fibronectin self-association. Additional mechanical unfolding triggers an essential arginine residue, which is required for high affinity binding to integrins, to move to a position far from the integrin binding site. This cell traction-induced conformational change may promote cell detachment after important partially unfolded kinetic intermediates are formed. These data suggest a novel mechanism that explains how cell-mediated forces promote fibronectin fibrillogenesis and how cell surface integrins detach from newly forming fibrils. This process enables cells to bind and unfold additional fibronectin modules – a method that propagates matrix assembly.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the NIH (NIH/NIGMS Molecular Biophysics Training Grant T32 GM008313 and NIH CA45548) as well as the Keck Foundation (NAKFI Nano 06).

The 10<sup>th</sup> type III repeat (10FNIII) contains the RGD site that is required for integrin recognition. Molecular force spectroscopy studies have revealed that this module is the most compliant, and thus it has been suggested that 10FNIII unfolds in response to cell-traction forces and that this unfolding facilitates FN fibrillogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Oberhauser1">[12]</xref>. While various aspects of this hypothesis have been debated in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Hocking1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Ingham1">[14]</xref>, there are data to suggest that 10FNIII unfolding plays a role in FN fibril formation. For example, recent studies suggest that the force generated during actin-myosin mediated cell traction is sufficient to unfold a FNIII module and that 10FNIII unfolding may facilitate the formation of FN fibrils <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Erickson1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Smith1">[16]</xref>. Consequently, characterization of specific regions of 10FNIII that become exposed when mechanically strained may offer insight into the earliest steps of FN fibrillogenesis.</p><p>Studying the effects of mechanical strain on the structure of 10FNIII is problematic because the direct observation of short-lived, partially unfolded states is difficult to achieve experimentally. Computer simulations provide a useful approach to address this problem. Molecular dynamics simulations, for example, have shed light on the physical basis of the mechanical stability of titin – a modular protein consisting of repeating FNIII-like domains – and of FN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Paci1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Craig2">[21]</xref>. But in all of these simulations the molecules were mechanically strained by applying tensile force to the N- and C-termini of the 10FNIII domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Paci1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Craig2">[21]</xref>. This loading pattern may not be helpful for understanding cell-traction induced fibrillogenesis as it is more relevant to understand how forces exerted through integrins bound to the RGD-loop of 10FNIII influence 10FNIII unfolding. Consequently, the goal of this study was to uncover molecular details of force-mediated unfolding of the 10FNIII domain under physiological loading conditions by applying tension along an axis that includes the integrin-binding RGD loop.</p><p>Our data suggest that pulling at the RGD motif leads to partial unfolding of 10FNIII along a unique and well-defined pathway. By contrast, pulling at the N- and C-termini leads to unfolding that can occur along many different pathways. Unfolding along a unique and robust pathway provides a mechanism to enable FN to reliably sample a limited number of intermediate structures that may preferentially promote FN fibril formation. These studies also reveal a novel uncoupling mechanism whereby traction-induced partial unfolding of the 10FNIII domain dislodges FN-integrin adhesions; this uncoupling permits new FN-integrin binding and propagation of fibrillogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Two Models of Force-induced 10FNIII Unfolding</title><p>To mechanically unfold 10FNIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), two points of contact are necessary – a fixed anchoring point and a pulling point where tensile forces are applied. As 10FNIII is covalently bonded to two other type-III domains at its N- and C- termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), the use of these termini as anchoring and pulling points (N-to-C pulling; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), as done in past molecular dynamics simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Paci1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Craig2">[21]</xref>, models structural changes in 10FNIII when external tension at distant sites is propagated to 10FNIII through neighboring modules. Because mechanical unfolding of 10FNIII likely occurs when cell-generated tensile force is applied through integrins at the RGD site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), we simplified the integrin-RGD interface such that the forces transferred to 10FNIII are modeled at a single pulling point - the Cα-carbon of the central glycine residue in the RGD triplet – with the fixed anchor point defined at the N-terminus (N-to-RGD pulling; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Alternatively, one could choose to anchor at the C-terminus, however this does not lead to module unfolding because the RGD site and the C-terminus are separated by thirteen residues that adopt a relatively extended conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) (data not shown). Moreover, the N-terminal region of full length fibronectin, which contains all FN repeats, contains binding sites for other ECM proteins such as collagen, fibrin, and other FN modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Mao1">[22]</xref>. Therefore anchoring at the N-terminus of 10FNIII (Val in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) models the scenario where the upstream FN modules are tightly bound to these components and therefore remains relatively stationary, while cellular forces are applied at the RGD loop.</p><fig id="pone-0002373-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002373.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Local Environment of 10FNIII.</title><p>(A) Crystal structure of 10FNIII.

Ten independent force-mediated unfolding simulations (30 ns each) were performed for each pulling axis. External force at the pulling point is provided by translating, at constant velocity, the free end of a spring (dummy atom in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g001">Figure 1C,D</xref>) that is attached to the pulling point. The rate at which 10FNIII unfolds is therefore a function of the velocity of the dummy atom. Fast unfolding simulations minimize the time required to unfold the protein but may introduce artifacts into the unfolding trajectories as the unfolding rate is much faster than the true unfolding rate <italic>in vivo</italic>; slower simulations are more realistic, but they require significant computational resources. Therefore, the optimal choice of spring extension represents a compromise between two competing considerations – computational efficiency and accuracy.

R1445 rapidly moves far from the RGD loop once the kinetic intermediate is formed (time point labeled with structure inset).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0002373.g006" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>We found that early in the unfolding trajectory, the distance between R1445 and G1494 (the central glycine in the RGD motif) remained relatively constant; however, after 15 ns, this distance increased dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). This time also corresponds to the end of the extension plateau when the kinetic intermediate forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). These observations suggest that once this intermediate is generated, the affinity of FN for cell-surface integrins significantly decreases. The mechanical coupling between FN fibril formation and disruption of cell-FN adhesions may permit cells to reiterate this process of binding, pulling, and detaching on additional neighboring FN molecules. This process promotes coordinated extension of FN fibril assembly and cell spreading over time and space.</p><p>Lastly, we note that these data suggest that 10FNIII, when subjected to mechanical unfolding at the RGD site, does not adopt structures that are more unfolded than the kinetic intermediate shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g006">Figure 6B</xref>. In the N-to-RGD unfolding simulations, this partially unfolded intermediate is reached around 15 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), which coincides with the mechanical decoupling of R1445 from the vicinity of the RGD loop. This structure exposes hydrophobic regions at the N-terminus that may facilitate FN fibril formation. Similarly, pulling along an N-to-C axis also results in partially unfolded kinetic intermediates that occur around 15 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), where some of these structures have solvent exposed, hydrophobic N-terminal β-strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In principle, these structures can promote FN fibrillogenesis through similar hydrophobic contacts. However, a comparison of the work as a function of time required to unfold 10FNIII along the two axes reveals that the cumulative work needed to reach these kinetic intermediates is significantly less for pulling along the N-to-RGD axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002373-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002373.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Calculation of the Work Needed to Partially Unfold 10FNIII Along Either Axis.</title><p>Data for each of the 10 simulations pulled along N-to-RGD (black) and N-to-C (red) are shown for the first 15 ns.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0002373.g007" xlink:type="simple"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>A number of studies suggest that FN fibrillogenesis requires cell-generated traction forces that lead to the formation of partially unfolded FN intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Baneyx1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Akiyama1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Baneyx2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Hocking1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Ohashi2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Pankov1">[28]</xref>. Since prior experiments have provided relatively limited information regarding the precise structural changes underlying the formation of FN fibrils, we used dynamical simulations to model the early steps in the fibrillogenesis process. Unlike previous experiments that applied mechanical forces at the N- and C-termini of FN modules, we studied the effect of applying forces at the physiological site of cell binding to 10FNIII through membrane integrin receptors, and we compared our data to unfolding trajectories that were generated by pulling at the N- and C-termini. Our results demonstrate that the response of 10FNIII to mechanical strain very much depends on the axis in which tensile forces are applied and that physiological loading conditions produce a more robust response.</p><p>Earlier studies have shown that 10FNIII can unfold via several different pathways when mechanical forces are applied at the N- and C-termini, and our results are consistent with these observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Paci1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Craig2">[21]</xref>. In our model, pulling along an N-to-C axis yielded two distinct unfolding pathways – in one the N-terminal strand <italic>A</italic> was exposed first, and in the other the C-terminal strand <italic>G</italic> was the initial strand to become exposed. Previous atomic force microscopy experiments have identified a partially unfolded intermediate adopted during force-induced unfolding of 10FNIII that may correspond to a structure that has an exposed β-strand; either at the N-terminus (strand <italic>A</italic>) or the C-terminus (strand <italic>G</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Li1">[29]</xref>. Past studies have suggested that only the pathway associated with early exposure of the <italic>G</italic> strand is relevant under physiological conditions based on an analysis of unfolding barrier heights <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Gao1">[19]</xref>. By contrast, we find similar force profiles and barrier heights for both N-to-C unfolding pathways, suggesting that both pathways are equally likely to occur in 10FNIII under these loading conditions.</p><p>To gain insight into how cell traction affects the structure of 10FNIII, we modeled the interactions between the integrin receptor and the RGD motif such that force is transmitted to FN through the center Gly residue of the RGD sequence. In actuality, it is likely that the integrin-10FNIII/RGD interface involves multiple inter-atomic interactions resulting in a pulling force that may be distributed over several atoms. However, in the absence of an integrin-10FNIII crystal structure, the precise manner in which these forces are distributed over atoms in this module is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-httpwww.pdb.org1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Takagi1">[31]</xref>. Nevertheless, since the RGD loop is likely the principle point of contact between FN and the integrin receptor, modeling FN unfolding by pulling at a distinct atom in the RGD loop therefore represents a convenient compromise that enables unfolding simulations to be performed in an efficient manner.</p><p>In both cases of pulling along either the N-to-C or N-to-RGD axis, the work put into the system is initially used to reorient the module until the end points of the axis (the anchor point and the pulling point) are aligned along the direction of pulling (along the long axis of 10FNIII). Overall, the choice of the pulling direction for N-to-RGD pulling only changes the amount of time initially spent to reorient the molecule such that the anchor point-to-pulling point axis is aligned with the pulling direction, but the resulting unfolding pathways are thereafter similar (data not shown). Given the relative positions of the N-terminus and the RGD loop with respect to the direction of pulling, less than 3 ns are spent realigning the N-to-RGD axis at the beginning of the trajectories (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002373.s004">Movies S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002373.s005">S2</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002373.s006">Movie S3</xref>). During this time, almost no unfolding occurs in either of the N-to-C unfolding pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, the difference in the work required to unfold 10FNIII by pulling along either axis cannot be explained by mere reorientation of 10FNIII.</p><p>Partial unfolding of 10FNIII by pulling along the N-to-RGD axis requires less work than partial unfolding by puling along the N-to-C axis, at least during the early stages of the unfolding trajectory (up to the point when the kinetic intermediate is reached prior to cell detachment, time∼15 ns). In addition, N-to-RGD pulling reliably leads to partial unfolding along one well-defined trajectory. A single pathway ensures that the same kinetic intermediates are sampled when cell-derived forces are applied at the RGD site. In addition, this intermediate contains solvent exposed hydrophobic residues within β-strands <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Additional pulling induces conformational changes in 10FNIII that promote integrin dislodgement and therefore cell detachment. Near the RGD loop is a residue, R1445, that is required for high affinity binding of FN to integrins, and its separation from the RGD loop increases following the exposure of the N-terminal strands in the kinetic intermediate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Redick1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Kauf1">[26]</xref>. This conformational transition likely decreases the affinity of 10FNIII for integrins once the N-terminal strands are exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). We also note that FN contains a synergy site, located in module 9FNIII, that also facilitates FN adhesion to cell surface receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Aota1">[32]</xref>. While we do not explicitly consider the role of the module that contains the synergy site, we note that a R1445A mutation reduces the affinity of FN fragments, which contain the synergy site (7–10FNIII), to cell-surface receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Redick1">[25]</xref>. This observation is consistent with the notion that unfolding near the R1445 site facilitates cell-detachment even when the synergy site is present.</p><p>Here we focused on conformational changes in 10FNIII and its relationship to FN fibrillogenesis. It is worthwhile to note that other FN modules are likely involved in fibril formation. There are data to suggest that cryptic FN binding sites exist in various FNIII modules: 1FNIII, 2FNII, 7FNIII, 9FNIII, 10FNIII, and 15FNIII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Hocking1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Ingham1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Hocking2">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Litvinovich1">[35]</xref>. Since our unfolding simulations model 10FNIII unfolding in a dilute solution, they do not explicitly account for other interactions that are likely important for fibrillogenesis. In particular, it may be possible for other FN molecules to become incorporated into FN fibrils through interactions that involve other partially unfolded domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Hocking1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Ingham1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Hocking2">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Litvinovich1">[35]</xref>. Nevertheless, our results do imply that cell traction-mediated unfolding of 10FNIII can lead to the formation of partially unfolded kinetic intermediates that can influence the rate of FN fibril formation through several different mechanisms. First, the exposure of hydrophobic residues in 10FNIII may facilitate the formation of hydrophobic contacts between distinct FN molecules, thereby promoting FN-FN association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002373-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Since exposure of these hydrophobic sites is quickly followed by cell-detachment, the formation of FN-FN contacts will occur only if FN refolding is slow relative to the time associated with the formation of FN-FN contacts. Secondly, our data suggest that formation of a relatively long lived kinetic intermediate may promote cell-detachment – a process which frees cell-surface integrins to bind other FN molecules. In this latter mechanism, formation of partially unfolded states that have decreased affinity for integrin receptors enables additional cycles of integrin binding to FN and subsequent incorporation of newly bound FN molecules into fibrils.</p><fig id="pone-0002373-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002373.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Cell-mediated Fibrillogenesis.</title><p>The proposed model involves the formation of a partially unfolded intermediate during cell-traction mediated unfolding.

This frees the cell and enables it to reattach to another FN molecule to propagate the process.

That is, force barriers in the unfolding profile arise mainly from short range interactions due to the internal rearrangements in the bond lengths, bond angles, and van der Waals energy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002373.s003">Figure S2</xref> in Supporting Information). These conclusions are supported by recent experimental evidence that suggest that electrostatic interactions are not critical to the mechanical stability of 10FNIII because 10FNIII unfolding is not dependent on the protonation state of residues participating in hydrogen bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Ng1">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Finally, it is interesting to note that our finding that the unfolding profile of 10FNIII depends on the axis in which tensile forces are applied is similar to behavior exhibited by ‘prestressed’ materials, including certain biopolymers (e.g., fibrin clots and stress fibers) and living cells under isometric tension at rest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Salganicoff1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002373-Ingber1">[40]</xref>.
