Ultimately, these cellular behaviors are synchronized to produce a tissue response, but how this is achieved remains enigmatic. Here, we investigated the genetic basis for mechanotransduction using the bone marrow as a model system. We found that physical stimuli produced a pattern of principal strain that precisely corresponded to the site-specific expression of <italic>sox9</italic> and <italic>runx2</italic>, two transcription factors required for the commitment of stem cells to a skeletogenic lineage, and the arrangement and orientation of newly deposited type I collagen fibrils. To gain insights into the genetic basis for skeletal mechanotransduction we conditionally inactivated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an intracellular component of the integrin signaling pathway. By doing so we abolished the mechanically induced osteogenic response and thus identified a critical genetic component of the molecular machinery required for mechanotransduction. Our data provide a new framework in which to consider how physical forces and molecular signals are synchronized during the program of skeletal regeneration.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Supported by NIH RO1-EB00504 (JBB), N.

An enormous investment has been made into the identification and characterization of molecular mediators of stem cell self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Willert1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Day1">[3]</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Moore1">[4]</xref>) but relatively little attention has been directed towards understanding how physical stimuli influence stem cell fate decisions. Changes in the stiffness of the extracellular matrix can have a profound influence on the fate decisions made by stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Deroanne1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Engler1">[6]</xref>. For example, stem cells grown on a soft substrate, which replicates the elasticity of brain tissue, adopt a neuronal phenotype whereas cells grown on a stiff substrate, which mimics bone tissue, assume an osteoblast phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Engler2">[7]</xref>. These data exemplify the intimate relationship that exists between the behavior of a cell and the extracellular matrix to which it is attached. But how does a cell perceive its extracellular milieu?</p><p>Integrin molecules are likely candidates for such mechanosensors because they span the cell membrane and connect at one end to the cytoskeleton and at the other end to the extracellular matrix. In doing so, they fulfill one of the fundamental properties of a mechanosensor, to link the transcriptional machinery of a cell to its outside environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Nelson1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Shemesh1">[13]</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Ingber1">[14]</xref>). In some biological systems, integrins are converted to a high affinity state in response to a mechanical force, but precisely how physical stimuli are transduced into biological responses via integrins remains poorly understood. Equally puzzling is how integrin-mediated responses are then integrated across multiple cell types and ultimately synchronized into a coordinated tissue-level response in a living organism.</p><p>One environment in which these types of questions can be addressed is the bone marrow cavity. Stem cells reside within the bone marrow in a quiescent state, until injury or disease affects the organism. Stem cells become mobilized in response, via an incompletely understood process that involves the activation of multiple signaling pathways (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Rabbany1">[15]</xref>). Some of these pathways are activated by physical stimuli, and it was this aspect of stem cell responsiveness that we exploited in our study into the genetic mechanisms underlying mechanotransduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Surgical procedure and implant design</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with Stanford University Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Animals were housed in a light- and temperature-controlled environment and given food and water ad libitum. Mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine (80 mg/kg) and Xylazine (16 mg/kg) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Clifford1">[16]</xref>. An incision was made over the right anterior-proximal tibia and the tibial surface was exposed while preserving the periosteal surface. Two screw holes were drilled through both cortices with a high-speed dental engine using a 0.5 mm drill bit. Next, the micromotion device was positioned and fixed with two 0.5 mm titanium Retopins (NTI Kahla GmbH, Germany). Using the center hole of the device as guidance, the mono-cortical implant hole was drilled using a 0.8 mm drill bit. The implant was composed of a surface-characterized polymer (i.e., Poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide; Midwest Plastics, MN) and had a main diameter of 0.8 mm and 0.5 mm-diameter tip that included two circumferential ridges (Medical Micro Machining, Inc., Simi Valley, CA).</p><p>A cap was threaded onto the device to assure that the implant was properly positioned and protected from displacement by mouse activity (i.e., chewing). Wounds were closed with size 7-0 Vicryl sutures. Following surgery, mice received subcutaneous injections of Buprenorphine (0.05–0.1 mg/kg) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Clifford1">[16]</xref> for analgesia and were allowed to ambulate freely.

One end connected to the load cell, and the other consisted of a 1 mm tip that passed through the cap of the bone plate to produce axial micromotion with a 1.0 Hz frequency, a 60 sec duration, and a 24 h interval, for a period of three, seven or fourteen days depending upon the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Tissue processing, histology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Following euthanasia, the treated limbs were dissected, removed of their epidermis and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight.

Specimens were dehydrated through an ascending ethanol series prior to paraffin embedding. Eight micron-thick longitudinal sections were cut of all samples and collected on Superfrost-plus slides for histology using a modification of Movat's Pentachrome staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Sheehan1">[17]</xref> and aniline blue staining. Immunohistochemistry for PCNA (Zymed) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Waseem1">[18]</xref> was performed on adjacent slides, using DAB (Zymed) as substrate.

After paraffin embedding and sectioning, tissues were stained with Aniline blue, and representative sections were analyzed as described below. The implant region in each condition (i.e., wild type stationary, stimulated; FAK mutant stationary, stimulated) was represented across approximately 40 tissue sections, each of which was 8 µm thick. Out of those 40 sections, 6–8 tissue sections were used for histomorphometric measurements. Each section was photographed using a Leica digital imaging system (5× objective). The digital images were imported into Adobe Photoshop CS2. The region of interest typically encompassed 10<sup>6</sup> pixels. The number of Aniline blue stained pixels was determined using the magic wand tool (tolerance setting; 60, histogram pixel setting; cache level 1) by a single blinded investigator, and confirmed by a second independent investigator.

When an implant is displaced within a pliable material such as the bone marrow cavity, then this displacement results in deformation of the extracellular matrix. A convenient measure of deformation is strain, and analogies have been made between strain fields and morphogen fields since both can act over considerable distances to influence cell fates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Gurdon1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Nelson2">[33]</xref>. We first carried out a finite element analysis to predict the strain pattern and found that the highest principal strains occurred around the circumferential ridges and at the base of the implant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>). Changing the material properties of the bone marrow cavity from a low to a high modulus of elasticity had little effect on the strain pattern (data not shown). Next, we created an <italic>in vitro</italic> model, in which we replicated the material properties of the rigid cortical bone and the pliable marrow cavity. We used µCT images to determine the position of fiduciary landmarks in the simulated peri-implant tissue before and after displacement of the implant, and then used these data points to calculate both the magnitude and the pattern of the strain fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g003">Fig. 3H,I</xref>). Once again, displacement generated a pattern where the highest strains were located around the circumferential ridges and the base of the implant and lower strains were found elsewhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g003">Fig. 3H,I</xref>).</p><p>Both the modeling results and <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation showed that strains were concentrated in discrete locations around the implant. Did this strain pattern have a biological correlate? One mechanism by which strain fields can influence cell behavior is by altering their extracellular matrix. We re-examined the bone marrow cavity using picrosirius red staining and polarized light and found that collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix were fully aligned and oriented parallel to the direction of displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g003">Fig. 3J,K</xref>). In the absence of displacement, collagen fibrils were randomly organized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g003">Fig. 3L</xref>). The strain pattern and the arrangement of the collagenous matrix showed a one-to-one correspondence, which was clearly evident in the area around the circumferential ridges (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g003">Fig. 3G,I</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g003">Fig. 3J,K</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, our data demonstrate that even a brief physical stimulus is sufficient to induce the rearrangement of the extracellular matrix of the bone marrow cavity. This pattern of collagen fibril organization mirrors the pattern of strain created by implant displacement. In response to implant displacement, bone marrow cells up-regulated an osteogenic gene, <italic>runx2</italic>. Within a few days the bone marrow cells have differentiated into osteoblasts. But how do bone marrow cells initially detect the deformation of the extracellular matrix, which triggers this mechanically-induced osteogenic response?</p><p>There are likely to be a variety of mechanisms by which a cell senses a change in its extracellular matrix and then transduces the physical stimulus into a biological signal. We devised a genetic approach to specifically test if integrin-mediated signaling was essential for mechanotransduction in the bone marrow cavity. Multiple integrins are implicated in mechanotransduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Ingber1">[14]</xref>; therefore rather than deleting the structural protein itself we inactivated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a tyrosine kinase that is involved in signal transduction from integrin-enriched focal adhesion sites.

In contrast, mechanical stimulation elicited no osteogenic response from FAK mutant bone marrow cells (n = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g004">Fig. 4F,G,M</xref>). FAK mutant mice showed 93% less bone matrix then their wild type counterparts. The only evident matrix deposition occurred on the periosteal surface in distance from the mechanical stimulus. In the bone marrow cavity, there was no evidence of a mineralized matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>), despite the normal vascularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g004">Fig. 4H</xref>) and expression of osteochondroprogenitor cell marker, such <italic>sox9</italic> and <italic>runx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g004">Fig. 4I,J</xref>). Even terminal osteoblast differentiation marker, like <italic>collagen type I</italic> and <italic>osteocalcin</italic>, were expressed in FAK mutants.

Rather, FAK inactivation specifically blocked the ability of bone marrow cells to sense a mechanical stimulus and reproducibly and rapidly repressed osteoblasts from depositing a mineralized matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>All non-circulating cells are equipped to detect and decipher physical stimuli, and then react to these stimuli in a cell type-specific manner. Ultimately, these cellular behaviors are synchronized to produce a tissue response, but how this is achieved remains enigmatic.</p><p>Here, we investigated the genetic basis for mechanotransduction using the bone marrow cavity with its high number of stem cells as a model system. We found that physical forces triggered the site-specific expression of <italic>sox9</italic> and <italic>runx2</italic>, two transcription factors required for the commitment of stem cells to a skeletogenic lineage. This physical force produced a pattern of effective strain that precisely corresponded to the arrangement and orientation of newly deposited type I collagen fibrils in the bone marrow cavity. To gain insights into the genetic basis for skeletal mechanotransduction, we conditionally inactivated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an intracellular component of the integrin signaling pathway. As a consequence of FAK deletion, the cellular response to physical stimuli was abolished: bone marrow cells no longer up-regulated skeletogenic genes, collagen fibrils remained disorganized, and the mechanically-induced osteogenic response was lost. Collectively, these data provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for the basis of mechanotransduction in the bone marrow cavity, and that skeletal progenitor cells detect physical stimuli.</p><p>The mechanical environment plays an equally critical role during skeletal tissue repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Carter1">[34]</xref>, where micromotion is sometimes viewed as an osteoinductive stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Claes1">[35]</xref> but excessive, uncontrolled motion leads to delayed fracture healing, skeletal non-unions, bone graft failures, and implant loosening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Claes1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Soballe1">[36]</xref>. This extraordinary mechanosensitivity of the skeleton may be attributable in part to the variety of skeletal cells whose behavior is influenced by physical stimuli. For example, osteoclastogenesis itself may be inhibited by physical stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Rubin1">[37]</xref> but matrix remodeling by mature osteoclasts is enhanced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Kurata1">[38]</xref>. Osteocytes are highly responsive to fluid flow changes within the canalicular network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-You1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Han1">[40]</xref> while osteoblasts react to deformations in their collagen-rich extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Ignatius1">[41]</xref>. Osteochondroprogenitor cells in the bone marrow stroma are mechanosensitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Thomas1">[42]</xref>. Therefore, understanding the skeleton as a mechanosensitive organ is predicated upon appreciating the heterogeneity of mechanosensitive cells mediating bone formation and remodeling, and being aware of the inherent variability in cellular response to the same physical stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Nelson2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Chen1">[43]</xref>. The physical stimulus itself is also a source of unpredictability since force transmission can be quantified to some degree, but determining how a cell experiences a mechanical stimulus depends upon variables such as substrate stiffness and the type (e.g., compressive, tensile) and magnitude of the resulting strain (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Discher1">[44]</xref>).</p><p>We developed a model system to explore the process of mechanotransduction, whereby a physical stimulus is converted into a biological response. We chose a model of skeletal tissue regeneration because of the well documented mechanosensitive properties of the skeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Rubin2">[45]</xref>, and in so doing, gained critical insights into how skeletal progenitor cells sense a mechanical force, interpret these forces, and then respond by altering their behavior. Our mathematical modeling predicts that implant displacement creates strain fields within the surrounding tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g003">Fig. 3G–I</xref>) and that cells migrating into this wound environment align themselves along the strained extracellular matrix and that the collagen fibrils secreted by these cells also become oriented parallel to the strain trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g003">Fig. 3J,K</xref>). A fraction of these cells are osteoprogenitors, based on their co-expression of <italic>sox9</italic> and <italic>runx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g003">Fig. 3C,E</xref>) and these cells appear to exploit the collagen rich matrix to sense their mechanical environment. Osteoprogenitors are able to do this by attaching to the extracellular matrix via their cell surface integrins, and then are dependent on the molecular machinery of the focal adhesion to transduce this mechanical stimulus into a biological signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000390-g004">Fig. 4F,G</xref>).</p><p>A number of questions remain. For example, finite element models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Claes1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Carter2">[46]</xref> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Angele1">[47]</xref> predict the existence of osteogenic and chondrogenic strain fields. These strain characteristics could be recapitulated <italic>in vivo</italic> using this device, which would then enable direct testing of the osteogenic and chondrogenic strain hypotheses. Another variable that remains to be explored is the extent to which a cell's response can be altered by changing the surface characteristics of an implant. Do modifications such as nano-texturing and growth factor coating stimulate osteogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>? By examining the spatiotemporal patterns of osteogenic gene expression one may be able to directly compare the osteoinductive or osteoconductive properties of such surface modifications (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000390-Hench1">[48]</xref>). In the broader context of skeletal regenerative medicine, a clear connection exists between the mechanical environment and the differentiation of skeletal progenitor cells into chondrocytes or osteoblasts. For example, the early, controlled loading of fractures accelerates bone healing but for unknown reasons. Are there specific physical stimuli that enhance skeletal progenitor cell proliferation, thereby creating a larger pool of cells that contribute to the regenerate? Or are these physical forces beneficial in the formation of a vascular network, which in turn supports osteoblast differentiation? Finally, there are subtleties to tissue mechanics that are difficult to capture using <italic>in vitro</italic> systems. For example, the length and time scales of physical stimuli that have greatest relevance to cell sensing and cell behavior are difficult to estimate, and while one can now measure forces exerted by individual cells, it is nearly impossible to extrapolate this to groups of cells, tissues, and organs. By determining how skeletal progenitor cells sense and respond to mechanical stimuli, we will undoubtedly find clues as to how to optimize physical stimuli to accelerate skeletal tissue regeneration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Antonio Nanci for helpful discussions and Daniel Nicolella for the technical evaluation of the strain
