<abstract>
<p>The poorly understood mechanisms of dry season persistence of <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp. mosquitoes through the dry season in Africa remain a critical gap in our knowledge of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> disease transmission. While it is thought that adult mosquitoes remain in a dormant state throughout this seven-month dry season, the nature of this state remains unknown and has largely not been recapitulated in laboratory settings. To elucidate possible connections of this state with microbial composition, the whole body microbiomes of adult mosquitoes in the dry and wet seasons in two locations of Mali with varying water availability were compared by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. These locations were a village near the Niger River with year-round water sources (N’Gabakoro, “riparian”), and a typical Sahelian area with highly seasonal breeding sites (Thierola Area, “Sahelian”). The 16S bacterial data consisted of 2057 sequence variants in 426 genera across 184 families. From these data, we found several compositional differences that were seasonally and spatially linked. Counter to our initial hypothesis, there were more pronounced seasonal differences in the bacterial microbiome of riparian, rather than Sahelian areas. These seasonal shifts were primarily in <italic>Ralstonia</italic>, <italic>Sphingorhabdus</italic>, and <italic>Duganella</italic> spp. bacteria that are usually soil and water-associated, indicating these changes may be from bacteria acquired in the larval environment, rather than adulthood. In Sahelian dry season mosquitoes, there was a unique intracellular bacteria, <italic>Anaplasma</italic>, which likely was acquired through non-human blood feeding. Cytochrome B analysis of blood meals showed greater heterogeneity in host choice of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> independent of season in the Thierola area compared to N’Gabakoro (77.5% vs. 94.6% human-origin blood meal, respectively), indicating a relaxation of anthropophily. Overall, this exploratory study provides valuable indications of spatial and seasonal differences in bacterial composition which help refine this difficult to study state.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While the overall numbers of <italic>Plasmodium-</italic>caused malarial disease have been decreasing since the early 2000s, the spatial extents of transmission have been mostly consistent, including in areas that have highly seasonal disease transmission such as Mali [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref001">1</xref>]. A major factor towards this is likely the resilience of the <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp. vectors, and their ability to recolonize an area after a 7–8 month dry season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref002">2</xref>]. Critical to this recolonization is a long-lived, reproductively depressed life stage of these mosquitoes called aestivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref003">3</xref>]. While this phenotype was described in <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp. over 60 years ago, much still remains poorly understood about this state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref004">4</xref>]. Previous entomological survey work has shown that the members of the <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> s.l. complex have differing strategies for dry season survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref005">5</xref>]. It is likely <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.s. (previously named <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> S-form) favors migration to areas of permanent water, while <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> (previously named <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> M-form) remains locally as an adult in a persistant state (aestivation) throughout the dry season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref006">6</xref>]. The adult dormancy phenotype of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic>, characterized by a ~7 fold life span extension has been difficult to induce in laboratory mosquito populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref008">8</xref>], and efforts in the field to find aestivating mosquitoes while in their refugia have been largely unsuccessful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref009">9</xref>]. These difficulties have prevented the study of the mechanistic, climatic, or behavioral underpinnings of aestivation in these mosquitoes. Thus, additional descriptive studies of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> while in this state, and how they differ from mosquitoes in other seasons or locations with year-round breeding potential (permanent water), but similar climactic conditions would be beneficial to understanding the behaviors of these vectors.</p>
<p>Work on the microbiome of insects has shown that a variety of life history traits are reflected within this complex bacterial ecosystem. Specifically, the microbiome contains signatures which may link mosquito populations geographically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref011">11</xref>]; it changes in response to bloodfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref012">12</xref>], infection with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref013">13</xref>], and habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref014">14</xref>]; and shifts inbacterial community compositions have been shown to increase host mortality in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref015">15</xref>]. Recent work has shown there is minor seasonal variation in <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.s. mosquito microbiota from the forest-savannah regions with perennial larval sites during the dry season in Ghana, but that limited differences were found within <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> between seasons and locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref016">16</xref>]. However, there has been no work to date that has characterized the variability present in the whole-body mosquito microbiome in areas with more distinct seasonality such as the Sahel where no larval habitat could be found during the dry season.</p>
<p>To investigate seasonal compositional differences in the microbiome that may link to aestivation, this exploratory study utilizes quantitative and qualitative measures to evaluate how the microbiome differs in an area in West Africa with highly seasonal water availability and mosquito abundance. We compare seasonal changes within and between locations, initially hypothesizing that we would find the greatest difference in mosquito microbiota found in Sahelian dry season due to this location having the clearest demarcation between physiological states of reproductive vs. aestivating mosquitoes in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Additionally, we compared how laboratory mosquitoes compare to these field-caught specimens in their microbial composition.</p>

<p><italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> mosquitoes were collected via indoor aspiration in three locations, Zanga (Latitude 13.688050°, Longitude -7.221029°), M’Piabougou (13.599830°, -7.192859°), and N’Gabakoro (12.683870°, -7.840419°) in the Koulikoro region of western Mali from September 2009 to August 2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194899.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Due to the close proximity (~10 km) and similar climates between locations, mosquitoes from Zanga and M’Piabougou were treated as being both in the Sahelian class for analysis. Mosquitoes from each location were noted for blood fed status, had their thoraces punctured to allow for permeation of preservative into the sample, and were added to 50 μl RNA<italic>later</italic> stabilization solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Fourteen additional laboratory reared <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> were also preserved in groups of young (3 days old, Samples 55–57) and old (14 days old, Samples 58–60) post emergence to compare microbiome development over time.</p>

<title>Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) analysis</title>
<p>To further quantify the differences in seasonality between our Sahelian and riparian areas, we calculated the NDVI around the center point of each of the 3 field sampling locations with a ~5 km square on the NDVI output from the 1 km resolution Metop-AVHRR S10 global satellite database (Accessed 5/1/2017, from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vito-eodata.be/PDF/portal/Application.html#Home" xlink:type="simple">http://www.vito-eodata.be/PDF/portal/Application.html#Home</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref018">18</xref>]. NDVI contrasts the absorption and reflectance of light to quantify the greenness of plants (live plants reflect near-infrared radiation to prevent overheating).

<title>Presence/absence analysis for seasonally indicative genera</title>
<p>In addition to analysis of the variance in bacterial abundance described above, we performed two analyses based on the presence/absence of bacterial taxa in mosquitoes, regardless of the abundance. In the first, we performed random forest supervised classification analysis on genus-level data using the ‘caret’ package in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref042">42</xref>]. The proximity metric calculated during the random forest model generation was utilized to generate a multi-dimensional scaling plot (MDS) to evaluate the degree of difference and clustering between and within sample groups. Group centroids were compared by pairwise permutation multivariate analysis of variance test (PERMANOVA) with 9999 permutations with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction using the ‘RVAideMemoire’ package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref043">43</xref>]. Prevalence for each of the sample groups for the top 10 most important genera in the random forest classification model are presented.</p>
<p>Additionally, for field samples we enumerated taxa unique to the Sahelian dry season sample, found their relative frequency (in terms of mosquito hosts), and evaluated how unique taxa are to that sample group (“private”—i.e. found only in that sample group) in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Using “informative” taxa (excluding rare and ubiquitous taxa), we sequentially tested if the frequency (prevalence) of any informative taxa differed between the dry and wet seasons in the Sahel, followed by testing that the Sahelian dry season differs from riparian dry season, and that it also differed from the riparian wet season in a consistent direction. These tests employed the sequential Fisher’s exact tests (with the last two being one-way tests), only passing genera significant at <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.1 forwards to the next test (Summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194899.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<p>Unlike the Sahelian villages, the proximity of N’Gabakoro to the Niger River allows mosquito breeding year-round. To further assess the seasonal differential in aridity between the Sahelian and riparian villages, we analyzed the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194899.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Due to its proximity to the Niger River, we found that there is a desiccation lag-period in which the vegetation index does not drop at the same rate in N’Gabakoro as it does in the two villages that have only rainfall as a water source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194899.g001">Fig 1A</xref> top right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194899.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Additionally, while the vegetation minima are reached roughly at the same time in the dry season between sites (late March to early April), the overall NDVI remains higher in N’Gabakoro during the transition periods to and from this dry season low point.</p>

<title>Sequencing</title>
<p>Of the 58 samples sent for sequencing, 53 returned sequence for 16S and 26 returned sequence for ITS. For 16S sequencing 2643 sequence variants (SVs) were found, though some of these variants aligned to eukaryotic reads in the SILVA database and were filtered, leaving 2057 SVs with 426 genera across 184 families. Many of these 16S reads when searched against the ‘nr’ database using BLAST had hits to <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> strain PEST sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref045">45</xref>]. This could indicate some cross-reactivity of the primers with other ribosomal sequence, or mis-annotated reference sequence. The fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing had limited success in amplification in terms of both average read counts per successful sample (755 vs. 4554 for ITS and 16S, respectively), and in the amount of coverage across locations/seasons. Fungal ITS failed to amplify from any samples in N’Gabakoro or the laboratory samples. Due to this, no comparisons were made between season and location of the fungal microbiome. All ITS reads that were not assigned to genus level (63332/79195 total) were filtered. Of the successful samples, the most abundant fungal genera were <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (20.7% of total reads without <italic>Anopheles</italic>) with presence in 12/21 samples with fungal ITS reads followed by <italic>Malassezia</italic>, <italic>Cladosporium</italic>, and <italic>Phoma</italic> (15/21, 13/21, 9/21 of samples, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194899.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Characteristics of bacterial communities between sampling locations and time points</title>
<p>The most abundant genera across field-caught mosquitoes was <italic>Ralstonia</italic> (25.1% of all field reads, in 42/47 samples), and the most prevalent genera was <italic>Propionibacterium</italic> (46/47 samples) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194899.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Laboratory samples were largely dominated by <italic>Asaia</italic> (62.9% of all laboratory reads), with this genus being the most prevalent taxa in 5/6 samples. There was no significant difference in the Shannon diversity between groups of field samples via Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, though the mean diversity of the laboratory samples was significantly lower than all field groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194899.s003">S3A–S3C Fig</xref>). While overall the dry season had the highest diversity, this difference was not significantly higher than the wet season overall (dry: 2.54, wet: 2.03, <italic>p =</italic> 0.087, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194899.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). The mean number of SVs per sample varied from 42.5–65.13 in the field to 20 in the laboratory, with dry season samples from both field locations being significantly different than laboratory samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194899.s004">S4A Fig</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0117 for Thierola Area and <italic>p =</italic> 0.0066 for N’Gabakoro).

The Pearson correlation between the overall genus abundance and frequency (across mosquitoes) was moderate (r = 0.30 and r = 0.70, P&lt;0.001, n = 424 for native and log-transformed values), indicating that the genera more frequent across mosquitoes were more abundant (sequence reads). However, the majority of SVs and genera were sample singletons (i.e. that sequence variant or genus was present in only one sample for 91.9% of SVs and 43.7% of genera), though the majority of reads were found in non-singletons (68.0% of sequence variant reads, 98.8% of genera-level reads) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194899.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). This indicates there remains a high degree of heterogeneity between samples, though dominant species have some conservation between groups. Finally, there were higher mean amounts of group specific (private) SVs within the Sahel dry season (53.6 compared to 35.1, 47.5, 31.2, and 12.7 for Sahel dry, Sahel wet, riparian dry, riparian wet, and laboratory samples, respectively), however this difference was only significantly different between the laboratory samples and the two dry seasons (<italic>p =</italic> 0.0173 and 0.0048 for riparian dry and Sahel dry via Dunn’s test, respectively).</p>

<p>The mosquito microbiome varies over developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref047">47</xref>], and has been previously shown to have distinct bacterial composition based on location and season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref016">16</xref>]. In this study, we analyzed how the microbiome changes in <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> from a Sahelian area where aestivation is probable in comparison to a riparian area where aestivation is unlikely. This variation in seasonality in our sampling areas is due to a difference in latitude, causing the N’Gabakoro area to not dry out as rapidly as the more northerly areas in the Sahel, and the presence of the Niger River providing year round larval sites. Our main hypotheses were that due to the unique physiological state of Sahelian <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> mosquitoes during aestivation, the largest seasonal differences in microbial composition would be between the Sahelian dry and wet seasons, and that these characteristics would also distinguish the Sahelian dry season from either season in the riparian area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref048">48</xref>]. If confirmed, aestivation-specific microbiome taxa might be used as a predictor of this state in populations where both aestivators and reproductive adults coexist.</p>
<p>Counter to our initial hypothesis that dry season Sahelian mosquitoes would have the most distinct microbiome composition, we found that dry season mosquitoes from the riparian area (N’Gabakoro) were, overall, the most different among our mosquito groups (described in detail below). The Sahelian dry season did exhibit some unique characteristics including high microbial diversity with highest number of private SVs, and had slight differences in overall microbial composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194899.g004">Fig 4</xref>), though these differences were not as pronounced as those between seasons in permanent water locations. Additionally, several bacterial genera were significantly elevated in the Sahelian dry season including <italic>Anaplasma</italic> (exclusively present in the Sahelian dry season), <italic>Bacillus</italic> (in 90.9% of Sahelian dry samples vs. 7–37.5% in others), <italic>Microvirga</italic> (63.6% vs. 7–14%), and <italic>Intestinibacter</italic> (45.4% vs. 0–7%). We also note that three of these genera (<italic>Anaplasma</italic>, <italic>Bacillus</italic>, and <italic>Microvirga</italic>) were also found to be important to the random forest classification model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194899.g004">Fig 4B and 4D</xref>). Only <italic>Anaplasma</italic> was found to be significantly different based on read count abundance (log<sub>2</sub> fold-change: 3.50, <italic>p-</italic>adj: 0.027, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194899.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The most likely route of acquisition of <italic>Bacillus</italic>, <italic>Microvirga</italic>, and <italic>Intestinibacter</italic> would be through the larval environment or possibly plant feeding due to their soil/water association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194899.s006">S1 Table</xref>). As no private genera were present in all Sahelian dry season mosquitoes, if bacterial biomarkers of aestivation exist, it may indicate not all mosquitoes in this period are in this state or that alternative but rare species can play the same role. Further studies are necessary to test whether these putative differences are indeed “characteristic” of the Sahelian dry season and has relevance to aestivation. Ideally, these studies will characterize the reproducibility of the interactions between years.</p>
<p>The riparian dry season sample set was the most unique of the field samples and was characterized by a reduction of <italic>Ralstonia</italic> reads, and an increase in <italic>Duganella</italic>, <italic>Janthinobacterium</italic>, and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> reads as determined by hierarchical multiple testing and ordination (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194899.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194899.g004">4B</xref>). The most abundant genera in wild-caught samples was <italic>Ralstonia</italic> (present in 40/47, most abundant taxa in 24/47), and had little representation in laboratory mosquitoes (1/6 samples with 10 reads). This genus has been seen previously in wild-caught <italic>Anopheles</italic> from Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref013">13</xref>] and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref049">49</xref>], and is believed to be largely soil and water associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref051">51</xref>]. Additionally, we found that the majority of 16S SVs were unique to an individual sample (91.9%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194899.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), indicating that there is a high degree of heterogeneity between mosquitoes. However these SVs were relatively low in abundance, only accounting for 32.0% of reads. These SVs also demonstrate the additional sub-species level heterogeneity that the more commonly used operational taxonomic units (OTUs) may miss. A caveat to this finding is that due to the low read counts of the sequencing technology used, the high percentage of uniqueness of SVs may be linked more to this limited coverage rather than biology.</p>
<p>As it has been previously reported in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> that most of the adult gut flora is acquired transstadially from larval stages to adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref047">47</xref>], and the “core microbiome” does not change significantly in laboratory adults released into the wild and recaptured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref052">52</xref>]. This may help explain why there were limited seasonal differences in mosquitoes in the northern Sahel. Due to the prolonged dry season, there are no known larval sites available during this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref005">5</xref>]. Thus, the mosquitoes present would have been larvae in the same rainfall-linked transient water sources that the wet season mosquitoes developed in, and any changes present in the microbiome would be due to incorporation of new flora from adult environmental conditions, or blood/sugar sources. This homogeneity in larval environments is contrasted in the available larval habitat near N’Gabakoro that changes broadly throughout the year, from fresh rain puddles to ground and river water in rock and other pools near the Niger River that develop as flooded areas recede [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref054">54</xref>], or from standing water present in the more urban area of Bamako nearby (though these pools are likely unsuitable for <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp. growth). This explanation needs to be tested beyond this work, however it could explain why the dry season Sahelian samples had the most pronounced difference in genera likely acquired through blood feeding, and the riparian areas had the largest differences in bacteria that are predominantly soil and water associated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194899.s006">S1 Table</xref>). This may also explain why the previous analysis of seasonality in a wetter climate of Ghana showed limited seasonal differences in <italic>Anopheles coluzzii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref016">16</xref>]. Another difference between the studies is related to the Ghanaian study use of day 1 post emergence mosquitoes that were collected as larvae in differing seasonal water sources and were non-bloodfed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref016">16</xref>]. This may then limit effects of the adult environment upon the microbiome. Finally, an additional possibility is that mosquitoes collected during the dry season peak in April are failed aestivators who are exiting from this state prior to the wet season or migrants from distant larval habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref007">7</xref>]. Due to the high, synchronous density and aggregation of emergence however, these are unlikely to be the main source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref055">55</xref>]. Future studies should compare water and larval samples from collection locations to further refine what is the main route of acquisition of these genera, and whether distinct seasonal patterns are consistent between years.</p>
<p>Towards determining the possible route of acquisition of the only Sahelian dry season specific bacteria found, we looked further into the nature of <italic>Anaplasma ovis</italic> and its known hosts. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>ovis</italic> 16S sequence has been found previously in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> and <italic>An</italic>. <italic>funestus</italic> collected in western Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref056">56</xref>], though it remains unknown if this finding has any relevance to the disease’s transmission or is simply related to it being an intracellular pathogen of the blood that could be inadvertently picked up during feeding. Towards this, the analysis of host-choice PCR with cytochrome B allowed us to refine the biting characteristics of each population across seasons. We found that the relaxation of strict anthropophily in the seasonal areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194899.g005">Fig 5</xref>) which may follow what has been reported previously in areas of low host-availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref057">57</xref>]. Due to the climactic severity during the dry season in the Sahel, the acquisition of blood from the nearest source is likely less taxing than feeding on the preferred host. Though as there is not an increase in zoophily in the N’Gabakoro samples in March-April in the dry season (when conditions are similar between locations) and there is some zoophily in the wet season, there may be an innate degree of zoophily in all <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> even in favorable conditions. This could also better explain the presence of <italic>Anaplasma ovis</italic> in these samples as being incidentally acquired from a more catholic feeding behavior in mosquitoes thought to be primarily anthropophilic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref058">58</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> has been shown to modulate <italic>Ixodes</italic> tick microbiota, though the effects of <italic>Anaplasma</italic> on mosquito microbiota has not been studied to our knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref059">59</xref>]. This pathogen is also in the same order as the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genus bacteria that have achieved considerable attention as an <italic>Aedine</italic> symbiont and possible vectorial-competence modifying species, but again its effects upon the mosquito vector are currently unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref062">62</xref>].</p>
<p>A caveat to our microbiome composition data is that the sampling and next-generation sequencing in this study was performed prior to the widespread description of “kitome” DNA present from DNA extraction kits, molecular water, and cross-over contamination on microbiome analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref063">63</xref>]. Due to this, we do not have control samples from each of these items, and due to the time since processing, these kits are no longer available to be sequenced. The issues of contamination have been reported to be more severe with samples of low-bacterial abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref063">63</xref>]. Following this association, we found that there were no significant negative correlations between read count and presence of known kitome genera as would be expected from this sort of contamination (two-tailed Pearson’s r, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194899.s007">S2 Table</xref>). This lack of correlation should not imply there is no contamination possibility in our samples, but is the best assessment we can provide retrospectively that presence of these genera is not linked to low-biomass in our samples. Additionally, no reads were broadly found in all samples, and all samples were extracted and PCR amplified at the same time using the same kits. Future studies should include these negative controls, and assessment of aquatic bacterial species from the larval sites to limit these possible confounders. Additionally, use of newer versions of next-generation sequencing approaches could also help to improve sequencing coverage, allowing for more efficient filtering of these low prevalence reads.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study of the seasonal variation in the microbiome of <italic>An</italic>. <italic>coluzzii</italic> from Sahelian and riparian habitats was designed to explore if there are major differences that could link the state of aestivation to a particular composition of the microbiome. While notably, the diversity of the microbiome of individual mosquitoes is very large with &gt;90% sequence variant singletons and this diversity increases in the dry season, when considering the main differences in microbiome composition we do not find the Sahelian samples to follow our hypothesis and instead suggests that the riparian dry season sample is the most distinct. We interpret these results to suggest that the most abundant and frequent members of the microbiome are not well linked to aestivation or that the specimens used here do not represent the microbiome of the aestivating mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194899.ref048">48</xref>]. Finally, it is also possible that the main changes in the mosquito microbiome depend on its larval environment and not on this physiological state. Accordingly, the greater seasonal difference in the microbiome of the riparian habitat reflects the change from typical–“ephemeral puddles” prevalent in the wet season (in both Sahelian and riparian habitats) to the more permanent larval sites that form in the bank of the river as it recedes in the riparian area. This inversion of our original hypothesis with respect to the magnitude of the seasonal difference between habitats, requires additional studies to discern between these new explanations.</p>
