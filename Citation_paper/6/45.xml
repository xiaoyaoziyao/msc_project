<abstract>
<p>The radionuclides released from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011 pose a health risk. In this study, we estimated the 1st-year average doses resulting from the intake of iodine 131 (<sup>131</sup>I) and cesium 134 and 137 (<sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs) in drinking water and food ingested by citizens of Fukushima City (∼50 km from the nuclear power plant; outside the evacuation zone), Tokyo (∼230 km), and Osaka (∼580 km) after the accident. For citizens in Fukushima City, we considered two scenarios: Case 1, citizens consumed vegetables bought from markets; Case 2, citizens consumed vegetables grown locally (conservative scenario). The estimated effective doses of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs agreed well with those estimated through market basket and food-duplicate surveys. The average thyroid equivalent doses due to ingestion of <sup>131</sup>I for adults were 840 µSv (Case 1) and 2700 µSv (Case 2) in Fukushima City, 370 µSv in Tokyo, and 16 µSv in Osaka. The average effective doses due to <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs were 19, 120, 6.1, and 1.9 µSv, respectively. The doses estimated in this study were much lower than values reported by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, whose assessments lacked validation and full consideration of regional trade in foods, highlighting the importance of including regional trade. The 95th percentile effective doses were 2–3 times the average values. Lifetime attributable risks (LARs) of thyroid cancers due to ingestion were 2.3–39×10<sup>−6</sup> (Case 1) and 10–98×10<sup>−6</sup> (Case 2) in Fukushima City, 0.95–14×10<sup>−6</sup> in Tokyo, and 0.11–1.3×10<sup>−6</sup> in Osaka. The contributions of LARs of thyroid cancers due to ingestion were 7.5%–12% of all exposure (Case 1) and 12%–30% (Case 2) in Fukushima City.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Radionuclides were released from the Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, mainly on 15 March 2011, after the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami on 11 March. They were diffused into the atmosphere, deposited mainly through precipitation, and incorporated into surface waters, drinking waters, agricultural crops, and aquatic organisms. Radionuclides have been detected in drinking water and foods in Fukushima and other prefectures in Japan, including Tokyo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Tokyo1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Fukushima1">[3]</xref>. Radioactive iodine 131 (<sup>131</sup>I), which has a short half-life (8.04 d <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-ICRP1">[4]</xref>), can contaminate drinking water and foods immediately after its release, whereas radioactive cesium 134 and 137 (<sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs), which have longer half-lives (2.06 and 30 y, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-ICRP1">[4]</xref>), cause contamination over longer periods of time. Although other radionuclides such as strontium 90 (<sup>90</sup>Sr), ruthenium 106 (<sup>106</sup>Ru), and plutonium have half-lives of &gt;1 y, in the year after the accident <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs contributed an estimated 84% to 88% of the total radiation dose from radionuclides with half-lives of &gt;1 y in the diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Working1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>In response to the accident, the Japanese government announced provisional “indices relating to limits on food and drink ingestion” on 17 March 2011 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry1">[1]</xref>. The government began releasing monitoring data on radionuclide concentrations in foods on 19 March and restricted the distribution of foods collected in some municipalities from 21 March, as the foods exceeded the limits. Some municipalities in Fukushima prefecture voluntarily imposed more stringent limits. In addition, some local governments, including the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, distributed bottled water to protect the health of citizens, particularly infants, against the high concentrations of <sup>131</sup>I detected in drinking water.</p>
<p>Among the exposure pathways, internal exposure from dietary intake has not been fully elucidated. External exposure can be determined from personal dosimeters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-YoshidaOhuchi1">[6]</xref>, calculated from ambient dose monitoring and shielding factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Yasutaka1">[7]</xref>, or estimated by using numerical dispersion models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Evangeliou1">[8]</xref>. Internal exposure from inhalation can be estimated by air monitoring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Amano1">[9]</xref> or by numerical dispersion models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Evangeliou1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Christoudias1">[10]</xref>. Internal exposure to Cs can be measured by whole-body-counter surveys; however, the Cs burdens in most inhabitants of Fukushima have been below the detection limit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Hayano1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Tsubokura1">[12]</xref>. Internal exposure from the intake of water and food can be determined from market basket surveys (i.e., foods are purchased from the market according to consumption patterns) or food-duplicate surveys (i.e., cooked foods are collected from home) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Harada1">[13]</xref>, but exposure immediately after the accident could not be evaluated by these methods because of the lack of samples. On the other hand, individual foods were monitored just after the accident for restriction of the distribution of foods, as described above. On the basis of the monitoring data, working groups of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry2">[14]</xref> and the World Health Organization (WHO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-World1">[15]</xref> approximated the nationwide average internal exposure to radionuclides from foods. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) also recently reported that an increased risk of thyroid cancer for infants and children in particular is of concern, that most of the absorbed dose to the thyroid was received during the first year after the accident, and that the major route of exposure was ingestion; e.g., absorbed dose to thyroid in the first year for 1-year-olds in Fukushima Prefecture (districts not evacuated): external + inhalation, 0.2–19 mGy; ingestion, 33 mGy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-United1">[16]</xref>. However, the regional trade in foods was not fully considered in these assessments despite the low food self-sufficiency rates in Japan (54% for major grains, 39% on basis of total energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-MinistryofAgriculture1">[17]</xref>), and no validations based on the results of market basket, food-duplicate, or whole-body-counter surveys were done. More detailed estimates and validation are required on account of regional variations in concentrations in drinking water and foods, the regional trade in foods, and variations in individual exposure. Furthermore, recent screening of all children in Fukushima Prefecture identified thyroid cancer in 90 of more than 280 000 children (an incidence of 313 per 1 million) by March 2014 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Nagataki1">[18]</xref>. Although this incidence might be attributable to increased screening by advanced ultrasound techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Nagataki1">[18]</xref>, an increase incidence of cancer in future, especially thyroid cancer in children, is a matter of concern. The the contribution of cancer risk from ingestion needs to be understood.</p>
<p>To provide more detail, we estimated the 1st-year average doses due to intake of drinking water and foods after the accident from radionuclide concentrations measured in water and foods and the effects of countermeasures (i.e., restriction of food distribution, voluntary withholding of rice, and distribution of bottled water for infants). We previously reported the average thyroid doses resulting from the intake of <sup>131</sup>I by citizens of Tokyo and the effects of countermeasures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Murakami1">[19]</xref>. Here, we estimated the intake of <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>134</sup>Cs, and <sup>137</sup>Cs by the citizens of Fukushima City, Tokyo, and Osaka, which differ in the regional trade in foods. The results were validated against observations in market basket, food-duplicate, and whole-body-counter surveys. By comparing the results with reports by WHO and UNSCEAR, whose assessments lacked validation and full consideration of regional trade in foods, we evaluated the role of regional trade in foods. We also estimated variations in intakes by using a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we assessed the cancer risks due to intake. We considered all sources of exposure for citizens in Fukushima City, and evaluated the contributions of cancer risks due to ingestion to the overall risk.This information will help to address current concerns of citizens and be useful for establishing the regulation of foods and drinking water.</p>

<title>Intake pathway</title>
<p>To assess intake via the ingestion of drinking water and foods, we estimated the thyroid equivalent dose and effective dose of <sup>131</sup>I and the effective dose of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs among citizens of Fukushima City (∼50 km from the nuclear power plant; capital of prefecture), Tokyo (∼230 km), and Osaka (∼580 km). All three cities, including Fukushima City, were outside the evacuation zone. Citizens were classified into ten groups based on age, sex, and pregnancy: &lt;1-y-old infants, males and females aged 1–6, 7–12, 13–18, and ≥19 y old, and pregnant females.</p>
<p>Monitoring data on drinking water and foods were obtained from ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Tokyo1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Fukushima1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Osaka1">[20]</xref>. Drinking water and foods were classified into 18 categories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Working2">[21]</xref>: drinking water, rice, other grains, potato, leafy vegetables, root crops, beans, fruit vegetables, milk, dairy products, formula milk, beef, pork, chicken, chicken eggs, fresh fisheries products, marine products, and others. “Fruit vegetables” included vegetable-like fruits such as tomatoes and fruits such as persimmons and apples. They were then further classified into sub-categories based on governmental restrictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry1">[1]</xref>: leafy vegetables were divided into “spinach”, “garland chrysanthemum and ging-geng-cai”, “mustard spinach and non-heading lettuce”, “heading leafy vegetables”, “broccoli and cauliflower”, and “naganegi onion, chive, and asparagus”; root crops into “turnip”, “bamboo shoots”, and “other root crops”; fruit vegetables into “kiwifruit”, “chestnut”, and “other fruit vegetables”; fresh fisheries products into “wild <italic>ayu</italic>, wild Japanese dace, and wild landlocked <italic>masu</italic> salmon” and “other fresh fisheries products”; and other into “tea”, “shiitake mushroom (virgin wood)”, and “other mushrooms”.</p>

<p>The average doses (thyroid equivalent dose of <sup>131</sup>I and the effective dose of <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>134</sup>Cs, and <sup>137</sup>Cs) from drinking water were estimated as: <disp-formula id="pone.0112791.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0112791.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>k</italic> is the radionuclide, <italic>A<sub>k</sub></italic> is the dose coefficient for radionuclide <italic>k</italic> (µSv/Bq) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s012">Table S1</xref>), <italic>B</italic> is the daily consumption of drinking water per person (g/d) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s013">Table S2</xref>), <italic>t</italic> is the number of days after the accident (consumption date), and <italic>C<sub>kt</sub></italic> is the concentration of radionuclide <italic>k</italic> in drinking water at <italic>t</italic> days after the accident (Bq/g).</p>
<p>So as not to underestimate the dose, we set <italic>A<sub>k</sub></italic> for <sup>131</sup>I on the assumption that the fractional thyroid uptake from blood is 0.3, as used in the determination of control index levels by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Nuclear1">[22]</xref>.

<p>For the daily consumption of each food recently reported detailed values were adopted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Working2">[21]</xref>.

<title>Radionuclide concentrations</title>
<p>The radionuclide concentrations in food were drawn from  &gt;130 000 food monitoring data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry1">[1]</xref> and rice monitoring data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Fukushima1">[3]</xref>.

Foods were washed with water and the edible parts were then analyzed for radionuclides by Ge, NaI or CsI detectors. We considered the intake of radionuclides via the consumption of foods collected in 16 prefectures: Hokkaido, Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Akita, Yamagata, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Tokyo (Metropolis), Yamanashi, and Shizuoka (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Analysis of the variations in radionuclide concentrations among foods in Fukushima Prefecture showed that spinach, broccoli and cauliflower, and marine products were heavily contaminated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s003">S3</xref>). Analysis of the regional differences in radionuclide concentrations in spinach showed that foods collected in Fukushima Prefecture and in prefectures in the Kanto region (Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, and Tokyo) had much higher levels than those in the other 8 prefectures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The amounts of radionuclides originating from other prefectures or from overseas were regarded as negligible. When radionuclides were not detected in a food, the contribution of radionuclides from that food to the dose was considered to be negligible. The concentrations in each food were classified by source prefecture and date. The prefectures where the distribution of the food was restricted (for example, rice in Fukushima Prefecture) were further classified into prefectural sub-groups. The arithmetic mean concentration in each area on each day was calculated. When only the sum of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs concentrations was available, individual concentrations were estimated from the average ratio of <sup>134</sup>Cs to the sum of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs, namely 0.49 (March–June 2011), 0.46 (July–September 2011), 0.45 (October–December 2011), or 0.42 (January–March 2012), as calculated from foods in which both the <sup>134</sup>Cs and the <sup>137</sup>Cs concentration exceeded 25 Bq/kg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry1">[1]</xref>. The radionuclide concentrations in crude tea and manufactured tea were converted to those in tea leaf by multiplying by the weight ratio of crude tea to tea leaf (0.22) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry5">[30]</xref>.

<title>Arrival shares</title>
<p>Since citizens generally purchase food from markets, which are supplied from the whole country, the arrival share is an important parameter for estimating the doses due to ingestion. A few citizens in Fukushima City consumed vegetables produced in local fields or home gardens (4.5% of workers in Fukushima City were agricultural workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Statistics1">[31]</xref>). We therefore considered two scenarios: Case 1, citizens consumed foods from markets; Case 2, citizens consumed vegetables produced in Fukushima Prefecture and other foods from markets. Case 2 means the arrival shares of vegetables from Fukushima Prefecture are 100%, so this scenario can be regarded as conservative. For citizens in Tokyo and Osaka, only Case 1 was considered. The proportions of targeted foods produced in each area for the markets in each city were calculated as follows. The arrival shares of vegetables and fisheries products were based on the amounts arriving from each prefecture at each central wholesale market in 2010 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Tokyo2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Fukushima2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Osaka2">[33]</xref>. We used the 2010 data so as to evaluate the effects of countermeasures. Since data on the importation of fisheries products from overseas were not available, we used the Japanese food self-sufficiency rates based on quantities of production, imports, and exports  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-MinistryofAgriculture1">[17]</xref>. The production of marine products in Fukushima Prefecture was regarded to be nil owing to the tsunami damage and the suspension of fishing. The arrival shares of beef, pork, and chicken eggs were based on the quantities transported from each prefecture to Fukushima, Tokyo, and Osaka prefectures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry6">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry7">[35]</xref>. The arrival shares of beef and pork were corrected to the food self-sufficiency rates of Japan. The arrival shares of milk and dairy products were based on the production and transport of raw milk in each prefecture, the amount of milk transported from each prefecture to Fukushima, Tokyo, and Osaka prefectures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry8">[36]</xref>, and the food self-sufficiency rates. For rice, other grains, tea, soybeans, and chicken, we used the nationwide production rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry5">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry7">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry9">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry10">[38]</xref> and the food self-sufficiency rates of Japan. The use of these sources is reasonable, especially for dried foods. To estimate the ratios of restricted food production among the prefectural sub-groups, we used the number of cows in each municipality for milk and dairy products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry11">[39]</xref>, the cultivated areas of vegetables and tea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry12">[40]</xref>, the areas of rice paddies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry12">[40]</xref> and the number of rice farm households <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Fukushima1">[3]</xref>, and the production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Fukushima3">[41]</xref> or the number of management bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry13">[42]</xref> for shiitake mushrooms.</p>

<title>Calculation periods</title>
<p>It is likely that rainfall on the night of 15–16 March 2011 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Japan1">[43]</xref> caused heavy contamination of leafy vegetables and of milk and dairy products by radionuclides, so we estimated intake via these products before the first release of data (19 March 2011): from 17 March 2011 in Fukushima City, on the assumption that delivery to citizens takes 1 day; and from 18 March 2011 in Tokyo and Osaka, on the assumption that it takes 2 days. The intake of other foods was estimated from 21 March 2011, when the Japanese government restricted the distribution of foods. Since radionuclide contamination in other foods was not attributable to direct deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Nuclear1">[22]</xref>, the intake before 21 March was not included. This was supported by the lower contamination of other foods by <sup>131</sup>I and <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs than of leafy vegetables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s002">Figures S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s003">S3</xref>). The intake was estimated from these days to 20 March 2012.</p>

<title>Effects of countermeasures</title>
<p>We evaluated the effects of countermeasures (restrictions on the distribution of foods, voluntary withholding of rice, and distribution of bottled water for infants) on reducing intake. We assumed the consumption of foods harvested in the areas where distribution was restricted or rice was withheld to be nil: citizens ate alternative foods containing negligible radionuclides. In this regard, however, for Case 2, the conservative scenario, we considered the effects of restrictions on the distribution of other foods except vegetables, because we assumed that some citizens consumed vegetables grown locally. Since the Tokyo Metropolitan Government distributed bottled water for infants on the morning of 24 March, we evaluated the effect of this countermeasure on 24 and 25 March. (Fukushima City distributed bottled water on the night of 11 March following the earthquake, but this was too early to consider).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Variations in individual doses</title>
<p>The variations in ingestion doses for ≥19-y-old males (with countermeasures in place) were estimated by Monte Carlo simulation using the commercially available software Crystal Ball (Oracle, California, USA). The drinking water and food variation data input into the Monte Carlo simulation were obtained as below.</p>
<p>We took into account variations in daily consumption of drinking water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Murakami2">[44]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s013">Table S2</xref>). The drinking water in Tokyo is derived from several sources: 38.0% of tap water comes from the Edogawa River, 41.3% from the Arakawa River, 14.4% from the Tamagawa River, and 6.3% from other sources such as ground water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Japan2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Bureau1">[46]</xref>. Therefore, we also took into account the radionuclide concentrations in each source. We assumed that citizens drank water from a single source. The radionuclide concentration factors were estimated from the ratios of <sup>131</sup>I concentrations in representative purification plants (Kanamachi purification plant for the Edogawa River, Asaka purification plant for the Arakawa River, Ozaku purification plant for the Tamagawa River) to those in tap water in Shinjuku <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Tokyo1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Bureau1">[46]</xref>. We used the arithmetic mean concentrations on 22–28 March in the purification plants and on 23–29 March in Shinjuku, on the assumption that delivery to the tap takes 1 day. Concentrations were corrected for half-life. Concentration factors were 3.51 for the Edogawa River, 1.31 for the Arakawa River, and 0.46 for the Tamagawa River (i.e., the <sup>131</sup>I concentration in the Ozaku purification plant on the Tamagawa River was lower than that in tap water in Shinjuku). The <sup>131</sup>I concentration in other water systems was regarded as negligible. Fukushima City has only one drinking water treatment plant, and radionuclides were not detected in the drinking water in Osaka. We therefore did not need to take into account variations in the water resources in these two cities.</p>
<p>For input into the Monte Carlo simulation, variations in the dose from drinking water in Fukushima City were estimated from the variation in daily consumption under the assumption of a log-normal distribution. Variations in Tokyo were estimated from variations in daily consumption, the dependence on water source, and the concentration factor.</p>
<p>Variations in the dose from foods for input into the model were estimated under the assumption that citizens bought each food once a week, and the production area was randomly selected according to the distribution of the arrival shares. The weekly average concentrations of radionuclides in each food were calculated. The variations in the daily consumption of each food were as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Suzuki1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry14">[47]</xref>. Since these values are based on 1-day surveys, not long-term surveys, their use could have caused us to overestimate the results. The variations in doses obtained by ingesting each food from the same area in the same week at the same daily rate of consumption were considered to indicate variations in the radionuclide concentrations. The relative standard deviations of the variations were estimated from the effective doses calculated from data measured on the same day in Tochigi Prefecture for “ging-geng-cai,” in Ibaraki Prefecture for “marine products,” in Shizuoka Prefecture for “tea,” and in Fukushima Prefecture for other foods (<italic>n</italic>≥4 for each food; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s013">Table S2</xref>). Daily consumption of foods and the radionuclide concentrations in foods were assumed to follow a log-normal distribution. The variations in the dose from each food were estimated from the input data for the Monte Carlo simulation, namely, the variation in daily consumption, the distribution of arrival shares, and the variation in doses received by ingesting the foods in the same areas. The simulation was performed 10 000 times for drinking water and for each food.</p>

<title>Estimation of cancer risk</title>

<title>Sources of uncertainty</title>
<p>This study included sources of uncertainty: <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs concentrations in tap water in Fukushima City, limited data on foods in the early stages, data that were less than detection limits, individual behaviors (such as purchasing of bottled water or not purchasing products from Fukushima Prefecture), and assessment of doses in the second and subsequent years for cancer estimation.</p>
<p><sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs concentrations in tap water in Fukushima City were estimated from the <sup>131</sup>I concentrations and the ratios of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs to <sup>131</sup>I in tap water in Tokyo by assuming that the ratios of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs deposition to <sup>131</sup>I deposition and the removal efficiencies in drinking water treatment plants were similar between Fukushima City and Tokyo. The deposition ratios are known to be similar in the two cities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Kinoshita1">[62]</xref>, and drinking water treatment plants in both cities use sedimentation and rapid sand filtration, which are effective for removing <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Kosaka1">[63]</xref>. This uncertainty did not have a large effect, because the contributions of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs from drinking water were minor (see “Comparison of doses among ages, effects of countermeasures, and change of intake over time).</p>
<p>In the early stages of monitoring, data were not available for some foods in some prefectures in the Kanto region, but these contributions were judged to be small (see Supporting Information). The number of samples was limited for some foods in the early stages even in Fukushima Prefecture. We therefore used a Monte Carlo simulation and show the variations in dose (e.g., 95th percentile value), including those resulting from radionuclide concentrations, in foods in the early stages.</p>
<p>We regarded radionuclide concentrations that were less than detection limits as nil. There were differences in detection limits among periods and institutions surveyed. We therefore confirmed the results through validation against observations in market basket, food-duplicate, and whole-body-counter surveys.</p>
<p>Differences in individual behaviors, such as not purchasing products from Fukushima Prefecture, could have influenced the variation in estimates. However, as the volume of major crops shipped from Fukushima Prefecture did not decrease after the accident <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Diamond1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Hangui1">[65]</xref>, we ignored differences in behaviors. The nationwide average of bottled soft drink consumption was 410 g/d in 2011 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Japan3">[66]</xref>, and some citizens also purchased bottled water so as to avoid tap water. We ignored the consumption of bottled water and soft drinks: the assumption that people drank only tap water would conservatively overestimate the dose from drinking water.</p>
<p>The doses due to ingestion in the second and subsequent years for cancer estimation were calculated from the physical decay, although the actual doses might be lower because of tighter regulations. The doses due to external exposure from September 2014 were also calculated from the physical decay. These assumptions can be regarded as conservative.</p>

<p>The effective doses due to ingestion of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs in the diet in Fukushima City (Case 1), Tokyo, and Osaka agreed within a factor of 2, in general, with those calculated in the market basket <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry1">[1]</xref> and food-duplicate surveys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ministry1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Harada1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Koizumi1">[67]</xref> in five periods from July 2011 to March 2012 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112791-t001">Table 1</xref>). The market basket survey includes drinking water as well as foods. This good agreement supports the accuracy and reliability of our results. The doses in the diet in Fukushima City (Case 2) were higher than those in the market basket and food-duplicate surveys. This result is reasonable because Case 2 is conservative. Validation for the period from March to June, including for the thyroid equivalent doses due to <sup>131</sup>I, was not done, because no data from market basket and food-duplicate surveys were available.</p>

<p>The dose due to ingestion of <sup>131</sup>I in Case 2 was 3 times that in Case 1 and the dose due to <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs was 6 times that in Case 1. The doses in Fukushima City (Case 1) were lower than the values reported in the WHO preliminary assessment (adults in Fukushima City, thyroid equivalent dose, 800–8000 µSv; effective dose due to total radionuclides, 500–5000 µSv) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-World1">[15]</xref> and the UNSCEAR report (absorbed dose to thyroid, 7800 µGy; effective dose due to total radionuclides, 900 µSv) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-United1">[16]</xref>. Regional trade in foods was considered in this study, whereas the WHO preliminary assessment and UNSCEAR report assumed that consumers consumed mainly food produced in Fukushima and neighboring prefectures. Inclusion of regional trade in foods is a key to accurate dose assessment.</p>
<p>In both doses, Fukushima City had the highest values and Osaka the lowest. This was consistent with the distances from the nuclear power plant (i.e. Fukushima City, ∼50 km; Tokyo, ∼230 km; Osaka, ∼580 km). The contribution of effective dose from <sup>131</sup>I to total radionuclides was higher than that from <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs in Fukushima City and Tokyo, and lower in Osaka. Except in Case 2, drinking water contributed the highest thyroid equivalent dose due to ingestion of <sup>131</sup>I in Fukushima City and Tokyo, followed by vegetables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112791-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s005">S5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s006">S6</xref>). <sup>131</sup>I was not detected in drinking water in Osaka, and vegetables contributed the highest effective dose due to <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s007">Figure S7</xref>). These results indicate that local contamination of drinking water caused higher intake of <sup>131</sup>I by citizens in Fukushima City and Tokyo than in Osaka, and that regional trade in foods played an important role in the intake of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs by citizens in Osaka.</p>

<p>The 95th percentile effective dose due to ingestion of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs in Fukushima City (Case 1) was 43 µSv; this was 4 times the 97th percentile internal exposure to <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs (i.e., 10 µSv, the value below which the exposures of 328 out of 337 individuals fell) in inhabitants of the village of Kawauchi in Fukushima Prefecture, as monitored by whole-body-counter surveys in November 2011 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Tsubokura1">[12]</xref>. The effects of differences in monitoring time were small, because our average effective dose due to <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs in November 2011 (1.3 µSv/month) was similar to the annual average (19 µSv/y = 1.6 µSv/month). Note that the whole-body-counter surveys had sampling bias and may have underestimated the doses received by the general population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Hayano1">[11]</xref>. The 95th percentile effective doses due to total radionuclides were 110 µSv in Fukushima City (Case 1), 530 µSv in Fukushima City (Case 2), 80 µSv in Tokyo, and 7.1 µSv in Osaka, 2 to 3 times the average values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112791-t002">Table 2</xref>). These values were much lower than the annual effective dose due to other natural radionuclides in the diet; e.g., potassium 40 (<sup>40</sup>K), 130–217 µSv <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Sugiyama1">[68]</xref>; polonium 210 (<sup>210</sup>Po), 730 µSv <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Ota1">[69]</xref>. The provisional limits of radionuclides in drinking water and foods, which were announced by the Japanese government just after the accident, were determined from the intervention levels of 50 000 µSv of an annual thyroid equivalent dose due to <sup>131</sup>I and 5000 µSv of an annual effective dose due to <sup>134</sup>Cs, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>89</sup>Sr, and <sup>90</sup>Sr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Nuclear1">[22]</xref>. Standards released in April 2012 were determined from the intervention level of 1000 µSv of annual effective dose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Working2">[21]</xref>. The 95th percentile doses due to ingestion of individual and total radionuclides in Fukushima City (Cases 1 and 2) and Tokyo were greater than or equal to 1 order of magnitude lower than the provisional limits and also lower than the new limits.

<title>Comparison of doses among ages, effects of countermeasures, and change of intake over time</title>
<p>The thyroid equivalent dose due to ingestion of <sup>131</sup>I in Fukushima City (Case 1) decreased with increasing age from 1 y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112791-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s016">Tables S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s018">S7</xref>), although the daily consumption of drinking water and most foods increases with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s013">Table S2</xref>). This discrepancy between dose and daily consumption is attributable to the thyroid ingestion dose coefficient, which depends largely on age. In contrast, the effective doses due to <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs increased with age. Overall, the effective doses due to total radionuclides were higher for younger people except for &lt;1-y-old infants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s017">Table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s019">S8</xref>). The difference in dose between sexes was small. Because the dose coefficients are the same for males and females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s012">Table S1</xref>), the differences in doses can be attributed to differences in consumption patterns. Similar results were found in Case 2, Tokyo and Osaka, with the exception that there were no large differences in effective dose due to total radionuclides among ages in Osaka (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s005">Figures S5</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s007">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s020">Tables S9</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s031">S20</xref>).</p>
<p>The countermeasures reduced the intake of <sup>131</sup>I by &gt;1-y-olds by 27%–32% in Fukushima City (Case 1), by 11%–15% in Tokyo, and by 33%–37% in Osaka, and reduced the intake of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs by 49%–57% in Fukushima City (Case 1), by 18%–25% in Tokyo, and by 16%–24% in Osaka (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s032">Table S21</xref>). The reductions of intake were generally lower for &lt;1-y-old infants because the contributions of drinking water were higher for them.</p>
<p>The cumulative intakes of <sup>131</sup>I for ≥19-y-old males in Fukushima City (Case 1) in the presence of countermeasures were 72% of the total in week 1 and 87% in week 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112791-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and stopped increasing within 1 month. This was consistent with our previous result <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Murakami1">[19]</xref> and is attributable to the short half-life of <sup>131</sup>I and the absence of new serious releases from the nuclear power plant to the atmosphere. The intake of <sup>131</sup>I was dominant within the first 2 weeks: rapid countermeasures are therefore important in reducing intake. On the other hand, the cumulative intakes of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs were 25% of the total in week 1 and 27% in week 2. The longer-term intake of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs is due to the longer half-lives. In particular, the intake via consumption of vegetables and fisheries products was continuous. Similar results were found in Case 2, Tokyo and Osaka (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s008">Figures S8</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s010">S10</xref>).</p>

<title>LARs of cancer incidence</title>
<p>The LARs of cancer from ingestion are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112791-t003">Table 3</xref>. These values do not include risks from external exposure and inhalation. The LARs of all the solid cancer risks were 8.4–12×10<sup>−6</sup> in Fukushima City (Case 1), 45–71×10<sup>−6</sup> in Fukushima City (Case 2), 3.0–5.0×10<sup>−6</sup> in Tokyo, and 1.1–2.0×10<sup>−6</sup> in Osaka, whereas the LARs of leukemia were  &gt;1 order of magnitude lower than those for all the solid cancers (i.e., 0.34–0.59×10<sup>−6</sup> in Fukushima City (Case 1), 2.0–3.5×10<sup>−6</sup> in Fukushima City (Case 2), 0.14–0.25×10<sup>−6</sup> in Tokyo, and 0.05–0.09×10<sup>−6</sup> in Osaka). The risk of all solid cancers combined together with leukemia is intended to provide an overall indication of the lifetime risk of cancer; however, in circumstances where the tissue doses are highly heterogeneous, such as with doses of <sup>131</sup>I to the thyroid, the risk of all solid cancers underestimates the cancer risk in specific tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-World2">[48]</xref>. This is because the LARs of thyroid cancer in some young groups (&lt;1 y and 10 y in the first year) in Fukushima City and Tokyo exceeded those of all solid cancers. The LARs of all solid cancers estimated from the colon dose are not suitable in the case of ingestion, although they may be still useful as indicators of the risk of deadly cancers. The LARs of thyroid cancers were 2.3–39×10<sup>−6</sup> in Fukushima City (Case 1), 10–98×10<sup>−6</sup> in Fukushima City (Case 2), 0.95–14×10<sup>−6</sup> in Tokyo, and 0.11–1.3×10<sup>−6</sup> in Osaka, and the maximum LAR in Fukushima City (Case 1) was found in females &lt;1 y old. These values were calculated from the average doses. The 95th percentile doses were 2× the average values for Fukushima City (Cases 1 and 2) and 3× those for Tokyo and Osaka. Because of the variation of doses, a factor of at least 2–3 could be applied to the 95th percentiles of LARs. In addition, these values cannot be directly compared with the ongoing results of diagnosis of thyroid cancers in Fukushima Prefecture because of the screening effects of diagnosis and the use of advanced ultrasound techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Nagataki1">[18]</xref>. The contributions of <sup>131</sup>I to the lifetime-exposure thyroid doses were 92%–96% in Fukushima City (Case 1), 84%–92% in Fukushima City (Case 2), 91%–96% in Tokyo, and 62%–78% in Osaka. As described above, most of the <sup>131</sup>I was taken up within the first 2 weeks. The LARs of thyroid cancers were attributed mainly to <sup>131</sup>I in the first 2 weeks, highlighting again the fact that rapid implementation of countermeasures after a nuclear accident is important. On the other hand, Japanese dietary exposure gives lifetime cancer risks of 310×10<sup>−6</sup> from inorganic arsenic (for the sum of skin, liver, and lung cancers) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Oguri1">[70]</xref> and 1400×10<sup>−6</sup> from acrylamide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112791-Murakami3">[71]</xref>. Cancer risks from ingestion–especially in the case of the thyroid cancer risk in young females in Fukushima City–might not be negligible, but they are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than the cancer risks from ubiquitous carcinogens in the daily diet.</p>

<p>The total effective doses due to ingestion, inhalation, and external exposure in the first year and over a lifetime (up to 89 y) for Fukushima City are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112791.s033">Table S22</xref>. The LARs of all solid cancers due to the three pathways were 1400–4100×10<sup>−6</sup> in Fukushima City (Case 1) and 1400–4200×10<sup>−6</sup> in Fukushima City (Case 2); those of thyroid cancer were 29–490×10<sup>−6</sup> in Fukushima City (Case 1) and 37–520×10<sup>−6</sup> in Fukushima City (Case 2) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112791-t004">Table 4</xref>). The contributions of LARs of all solid cancer due to ingestion were 0.3%–0.5% (Case 1) and 1.6%–3.1% (Case 2); those of thyroid cancer were 7.5%–12% (Case 1) and 12%–30% (Case 2). Even when the 95th percentile values were 2× the average, the contributions of LARs of all solid cancers due to ingestion were minor. However, for the 95th percentile values in Case 2, the contribution of LARs of thyroid cancer due to ingestion was approximately half of the total. Except in such extreme situations, the contributions of LARs of thyroid cancer due to ingestion cannot be regarded as either negligible or predominant but as minor.</p>

<p>As described above, the contributions of <sup>131</sup>I to the lifetime-exposure thyroid doses were  &gt;84% for Fukushima City, and the contributions of LARs from foods in the second and subsequent years were negligible. However, in Japan and other countries, some people are still concerned about artificial radionuclides in the diet. Although a greater understanding of risks alone may not lead to reasonable countermeasures, the doses and cancer risks calculated in this study are essential information.</p>
