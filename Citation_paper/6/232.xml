        <p>During development, precise temporal and spatial gradients are responsible for
                    guiding axons to their appropriate targets. Within the developing ventral
                    midbrain (VM) the cues that guide dopaminergic (DA) axons to their forebrain
                    targets remain to be fully elucidated. Wnts are morphogens that have been
                    identified as axon guidance molecules. Several Wnts are expressed in the VM
                    where they regulate the birth of DA neurons. Here, we describe that a precise
                    temporo-spatial expression of Wnt5a accompanies the development of nigrostriatal
                    projections by VM DA neurons. In mice at E11.5, <italic>Wnt5a</italic> is
                    expressed in the VM where it was found to promote DA neurite and axonal growth
                    in VM primary cultures. By E14.5, when DA axons are approaching their striatal
                    target, Wnt5a causes DA neurite retraction in primary cultures. Co-culture of VM
                    explants with Wnt5a-overexpressing cell aggregates revealed that Wnt5a is
                    capable of repelling DA neurites. Antagonism experiments revealed that the
                    effects of Wnt5a are mediated by the Frizzled receptors and by the small GTPase,
                    Rac1 (a component of the non-canonical Wnt planar cell polarity pathway).
                    Moreover, the effects were specific as they could be blocked by Wnt5a antibody,
                    sFRPs and RYK-Fc. The importance of Wnt5a in DA axon morphogenesis was further
                    verified in <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, where
                    fasciculation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) as well as the density of DA
                    neurites in the MFB and striatal terminals were disrupted. Thus, our results
                    identify a novel role of Wnt5a in DA axon growth and guidance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dopamine (DA) neurons within the ventral midbrain (VM) project to the striatum and
                prefrontal cortex forming the nigrostriatal, mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways,
                which are important for motor and cognitive functions. DA neuron dysfunction is
                associated with a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Abnormal
                development of the nervous system may contribute to these disorders; hence, the
                importance of understanding the processes involved in DA neuron maturation and
                connectivity. Whilst the cues that orchestrate the birth of midbrain DA neurons are
                well established, the signals regulating DA neurite morphogenesis (including neurite
                growth, axon guidance and synaptogenesis) are less well defined.</p>
      <p>Several studies have identified cellular and molecular signals that participate in
                establishing these pathways (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-VandenHeuvel1">[1]</xref>), including Ephrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Sieber1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Richards1">[4]</xref>, Semaphorins

In this study
                we asked whether Wnts also regulate DA axon morphogenesis.</p>
      <p>Wnt1 and Wnt5a are important morphogens for VM development, regulating proliferation,
                differentiation and survival of DA neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-McMahon1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Prakash1">[24]</xref>. Wnts also participate in axon

      <p>Wnt5a is a highly conserved diffusible protein whose signal is transduced by Frizzled
                (Fz) receptors and/or co-receptors including the atypical tyrosine kinases Ryk and
                Ror2. Dependent on the receptor and cell type, Wnt5a has been shown to activate
                three signaling pathways: the Wnt/β-catenin/canonical pathway, the
                Wnt/calcium/non-canonical pathway, and the Wnt/planar cell polarity
                (PCP)/non-canonical pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Mikels1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Witze1">[39]</xref>. However, little is known about which of these pathways
                and downstream signaling components mediate Wnt5a's influence on axon growth
                and guidance. Moreover, it is not known whether Wnt5a promotes neuritogenesis and
                axonal growth of DA axons in the nigrostriatal system. We therefore set out to
                determine whether Wnt5a plays a role in DA axon growth and guidance and examined the
                involvement of some of the candidate Wnt5a receptors and Wnt signaling
                components.</p>

                    microdissected in chilled L15 media (Invitrogen). Note, stages in development of
                    the dopamine systems occur approximately 2 days later in rats than mice, hence
                    E13.5 rat is considered equivalent to E11.5 mouse. Whilst initial studies were
                    performed in mice, they were verified later in rats. Rat embryos were used in
                    all antagonism studies as greater volumes of VM primary neurons can be obtained,
                    necessary for the outlined antagonism studies that required multiple conditions.
                    The isolated ventral midbrains were enzymatically dissociated in HBSS containing
                    0.05% trypsin and 0.1% DNase for 12 minutes at 37°C. Cells

                    supplement (all purchased from Invitrogen). Cells were seeded at a density of
                    125,000 cells per well in a 48-well plate at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>

        <p>To generate the RYK-Fc, the human RYK WIF domain (residues 60–195 of
                    Genbank accession number NP_002949.2) was subcloned by PCR into pApex-3.Fc.FLAG,
                    between an IL-3 signal peptide and the human IgG<sub>1</sub> Fc domain, to
                    create a fusion protein with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope tag. CHO-K1 cells
                    were transfected with pApex-3.hRYKWD.Fc.FLAG using FuGENE 6 (Invitrogen) and
                    selection applied after 24 h (200 µg/ml hygromycin B; Invitrogen). Stable

        <p>TH-immunoreactive (TH<sup>+</sup>) neurons from each primary VM culture were

                    avoid any potential sampling bias. In each experiment, data was compared to the
                    mean normalized control value (set at 100%) to account for
                    inter-experimental variation. Photomicrographs of each DA neuron (identified by

                    TH+ neuron and quantified using Stereoinvestigator software
                    (MicrobrightField, USA) on a Leica DML microscope. In adjacent series, z-stack
                    images of TH+ immunofluorescence were taken on a confocal microscope (Zeiss
                    Pascal) to represent the quantified changes.</p>
        <p>At E18, the volume of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) was estimated by
                    delineating the area of the TH<sup>+</sup> fiber bundle in the first
                    section rostral to the midbrain TH<sup>+</sup> neurons until the final
                    section prior to the arrival of TH<sup>+</sup> fibers in the striatum. The
                    MFB was delineated in approximately 7 sections (16 µm thickness,
                    1∶10 series, i.e. approximately 1120 µm in length) from each brain,
                    with the area and total volume estimated using StereoInvestigator software.</p>
        <p>The number of dopaminergic fibers (TH<sup>+</sup>) in the MFB and the
                    density of TH<sup>+</sup> varicosities in the lateral striatum were
                    estimated using previously described fractionator methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Gundersen1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Parish2">[51]</xref>. The
                    density of TH<sup>+</sup> fibers was assessed at two independent levels
                    along the MFB, (i) 320 µm and (ii) 800 µm rostral to the midbrain DA
                    neurons. TH<sup>+</sup> fiber counts were made at regular pre-determined
                    intervals (x = 50 µm, y = 50
                    µm). These counts were derived by means of a grid program, through which a
                    systematic sample of the area occupied by the fibers was made from a random
                    starting point. An unbiased counting frame of known area (7 µm×7
                    µm = 49 µm<sup>2</sup>) was superimposed on the
                    image of the tissue sections viewed under a 100×, N.A. 1.30 oil immersion
                    objective. The number of TH<sup>+</sup> fibers at each level was counted in
                    16 µm thick, 1∶10 serial sections.</p>
        <p>TH<sup>+</sup> varicosities in the lateral 400 µm of the striatum were
                    counted from 16 µm serial sections, 1∶10 series, with four sections
                    sampled from each striatum. Counts of TH<sup>+</sup> varicosities were made
                    at regular predetermined intervals (x = 150 µm,
                    y = 150 µm) using an unbiased counting frame of known
                    area (6 µm×6 µm = 36
                    µm<sup>2</sup>). TH<sup>+</sup> varicosities were identified as
                    predominantly round swellings in association with axonal processes.
                        TH<sup>+</sup> varicosity counts were expressed as terminal density,
                    with comparisons made between <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>+/+</sup>,

        <p>In order to assess the possible role of Wnt5a in DA neuritogenesis and axon
                    formation, we first examined the temporal and spatial expression of Wnt5a
                    relative to the developing DA pathway in the MFB; expanding on previous studies
                    by Andersson et al., 2008 who examined Wnt5a expression in relation to the birth
                    of DA neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Andersson1">[23]</xref>. Using in situ hybridization to detect Wnt5a
                    expression and immunohistochemistry against TH (to identify DA neurons), strong
                    Wnt5a expression was apparent within the VM where DA neurons reside at both
                    E11.5 and E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g001">Fig.
                        1A–C,E–G,H–J,L–N</xref>). At E11.5, Wnt5a expression
                    was greater in the ventricular zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), whilst at E14.5 expression was
                    greater in the mantle zone of the VM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g001">Fig. 1L</xref>). Closer examination of the E11.5 VM
                    revealed a rostro-caudal gradient of Wnt5a, with levels higher in the rostral VM
                    than caudal VM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). By
                    E14.5 this gradient was reversed, with rostral VM expression decreased and Wnt5a
                    expression higher in the caudal midbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g001">Fig. 1L</xref> compared to 1E). At this stage,
                    neurites maintained their initial dorsal projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g001">Fig. 1M, M</xref>'), but subsequently projected
                    rostrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g001">Fig. 1K</xref>), away
                    from the strong ventral source of Wnt5a in the VM.</p>
        <p>Wnt5a mRNA expression was more closely examined in VM cells isolated by FACS from
                    the TH-GFP reporter mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Sawamoto1">[42]</xref>. Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) performed on the
                        GFP<sup>+</sup> fraction (DA neurons) and GFP<sup>−</sup>
                    fraction (other VM cells) revealed that Wnt5a mRNA expression was significantly
                    higher in the GFP<sup>−</sup> fraction (four-fold increase,
                    p = 0.042) compared to the GFP<sup>+</sup> fraction
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g001">Fig. 1O</xref>). These
                    findings were in accordance with Wnt5a in situ hybridization, with expression

                    results are also in agreement with previous studies showing greater expression
                    of Wnt5a in glial cells (radial glia first and later astrocytes) compared to

        <title>Wnt5a increases dominant DA neurite length and reduces DA neurite branching
                    in VM cultures at E11.5, but not at E14.5</title>
        <p>As the temporal-spatial pattern of expression of Wnt5a was appropriate for a role
                    in DA neurite development, we tested the effect of Wnt5a on DA neurite growth by
                    applying recombinant Wnt5a protein to VM primary neuron cultures isolated from
                    E11.5 and E14.5 mouse embryos and examining the neurites of tyrosine hydroxylase

                    immunoreactive neurons.</p>
        <p>A dose-response curve revealed that Wnt5a promotes DA neurite elongation in a
                    dose-dependent manner in E11.5 VM cultures. Maximal elongation, as measured by
                    total neurite length, was achieved with a dose of 300 ng/ml of Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Immunoblots were
                    performed in a dopaminergic cell line (SN4741) in order to confirm that Wnt5a
                    induced intracellular activation of Wnt signaling. We found that 100, 300 and
                    1000 ng/ml of Wnt5a induced dishevelled-2 (Dvl2) phosphorylation (visible by
                    Western blot as a mobility shift of the protein) in a dose-dependent manner
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>'). The
                    effects were optimal at 300 ng/ml and this dose was used for further assessment
                    of the neurite arbors of TH<sup>+</sup> cells. Wnt5a treatment of E11.5 VM
                    cultures increased total neurite length compared to control treated cultures
                    (295%±12%, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g002">Fig. 2B–D</xref>). Other morphological changes
                    were also observed in Wnt5a treated cultures. The dominant neurite was

                    Furthermore, Wnt5a treatment resulted in fewer neurites

                    neurites in cultures treated with Wnt5a were not significantly longer than
                    neurites in control cultures (117%±14%, and

        <p>To confirm the specificity of the effects of Wnt5a on DA neurite development, we
                    treated primary VM cultures with different Wnt blocking tools and subsequently
                    evaluated TH<sup>+</sup> neurites. Given the maintained effect of Wnt5a on
                    DA neurites in both mice and rats, we performed these antagonism experiments in
                    rats due to the increased yield of VM tissue, and the numerous antagonists to be

                    signaling by preventing Wnt from interacting with membrane-bound receptors. In
                    the absence of exogenous Wnt5a, sFRP-1 reduced neurite length to

                    antagonism of endogenous Wnt signaling within the VM. This was confirmed by
                    using a Wnt5a blocking antibody (αWnt5a), which also reduced neurite length

                    first examined the expression of Fz3 and Ryk in the VM by Q-PCR and found
                    elevated expression of both receptors in the VM compared to the dorsal midbrain
                    (DM) and the rest of the embryo (E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g004">Fig. 4H</xref>',I'). Further, Q-PCR
                    performed on the GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>−</sup> fraction of VM
                    tissue isolated from TH-GFP mice, revealed that these receptors were expressed
                    on the DA neurons (GFP<sup>+</sup>) and not surrounding cells
                        (GFP<sup>−</sup>) within the VM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g004">Fig. 4H” and 4I”</xref>).</p>
        <p>Subsequently, we examined whether E13.5 rat VM cultures treated with antibodies
                    against Fz3 (αFz3-CRD) or in the presence of a Ryk construct containing the
                    human RYK WIF domain (RYK-Fc), blocked the effects of Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g004">Fig. 4K–Q</xref>).
                    Interestingly, the increase in neurite length produced by the addition of Wnt5a
                    (166%±10%) was significantly attenuated in the presence of
                    a RYK-Fc, to levels not significantly different to control
                    (97%±4%), yet they had no effect on neurite number (data
                    not shown). Similarly, but more modestly, αFz3-CRD also reduced the effect
                    of Wnt5a on total neurite length (from 166%±10% to
                    129%±6%), but not neurite number (data not shown). Since
                    RYK-Fc can bind Wnt, we interpret that the blocking by RYK-Fc likely mediated by
                    Wnt5a binding. However, as the RYK-Fc construct is not capable of interacting
                    directly at the receptor membrane level, this data should be interpreted with
                    caution. In fact, a recent study has shown no changes in the morphology or
                    trajectory of DA axons in Ryk(−/−) embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Fenstermaker1">[55]</xref>. We believe that
                    additional experiments, employing selective functional blocking antibodies
                    against the Ryk receptor, as well as Ryk-Wnt5a double knock out mice will be
                    required to ascertain whether Ryk plays a role in Wnt5a mediated DA axon growth
                    and guidance.</p>
        <p>In contrast, since the αFz3-CRD binds directly to the receptor (with its
                    specificity and function verified by the manufacturer and others Endo 2008), our
                    results indicate that the action of Wnt5a on DA neurite morphology is mediated,
                    at least in part, by the Frizzled-3 receptor. Interestingly, we also found that
                    these proteins antagonized the Wnt5a-mediated Dvl-2 phosphorylation in a
                    dopaminergic cell line (SN4741 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g004">Fig. 4J</xref>), reinforcing the idea that the
                    effects of Wnt5a require Wnt5a binding and are mediated by Frizzled. It is also
                    important to note that RYK-Fc and αFz3-CRD had no effect on non-DA neurites
                    within the culture, illustrating the specificity of the effects of Wnt5a for DA
                    neurites and the lack of toxicity of the proteins used here (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018373.s002">Figure

        <p>We next examined whether blocking of the small GTPase, Rac1, a downstream
                    component of the Wnt/PCP pathway in DA neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Andersson1">[23]</xref> affected the total
                    length of DA neurites in primary VM cultures. Treatment of control cultures with
                    the Rac1 inhibitor, NSC23376 reduced TH+ neurite length
                    (39%+4% reduction), presumably due to antagonism of
                    endogenous Wnt signaling as well as other potential axon guidance pathways for
                    which Rac1 is a downstream component. However, co-treatment with Wnt5a and
                    NSC23766, significantly reduced total TH<sup>+</sup> neurite length even
                    further (60%±4%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g005">Fig. 5A,C,F</xref>) compared to Wnt5a treatment
                    alone. These findings suggest that at least in part Rac1, downstream of Wnt5a
                    and thereby the PCP pathway, regulates DA neurite length. Finally, treatment
                    with Wnt5a + D4476, but not Wnt5a + NSC23766, increased the number of
                        TH<sup>+</sup> neurites per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>), suggesting that while PCP signaling
                    increases neurite length, other non-canonical Wnt signaling such as the
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway may cooperate to reduce the number of
                    neurites.</p>

                    effect on DA neurons has not yet been examined. Mouse VM explants (E11.5) were
                    co-cultured with either mock-transfected or Wnt5a over-expressing cell
                    aggregates for 72 hours and the number of TH<sup>+</sup> fibers in the
                    distal (D) and proximal (P) quadrants of the explant, with respect to the cell
                    aggregate, were counted, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>. TH<sup>+</sup> neurites from
                    explants co-cultured with mock-transfected cell aggregates radiated out in all
                    directions from the explant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g006">Fig.

                    neurites in VM explants cultured with Wnt5a-overexpressing cell aggregates
                    emanated from the distal aspect of the explant, with a proximal to distal ratio
                    of 0.70±0.09 (n = 29, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g006">Fig. 6B,E</xref>), indicating a
                    repulsive effect. We confirmed that the effects of Wnt5a were specific to
                        TH<sup>+</sup> neurites by staining all neurites in culture
                        (TUJ1<sup>+</sup>). Whilst TH<sup>+</sup> fibers were repelled by
                    Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>),
                        TUJ1<sup>+</sup> neurites were observed emanating from all aspects of

                    application of the casein kinase 1 inhibitor D4476, the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766,
                    and anti-Fz3-CRD, indicating that the repulsive effects of Wnt5a on
                        TH<sup>+</sup> neurites are mediated by PCP/Wnt signaling via the Fz3
                    receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g006">Fig.

                    Fenstermaker et al (2010), who illustrated that DA neurons in

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Understanding the intricate and precise pattern of connectivity achieved during brain
                development has been, and remains, an outstanding challenge. This is particularly
                true for the dopaminergic pathways that arise from the ventral midbrain and
                innervate distant targets such as the striatum and cortex. Changes in the
                connectivity of these pathways and in the availability of their neurotransmitter,
                dopamine, underpin a number of neurological disorders including Parkinson's
                disease, schizophrenia and addiction. In this context, our study demonstrates a
                novel function for Wnt5a in the establishment of the dopaminergic pathways
                originating in the VM. First, we found that the temporal and spatial expression
                pattern of Wnt5a correlates with the development of the nigrostriatal/mesolimbic DA
                pathways. Second, we report that Wnt5a selectively regulates the axon length of
                    TH<sup>+</sup> cells in primary VM cultures in a time-dependent manner,
                promoting axon extension at E11.5 (and rat E13.5) and axon retraction at E14.5.
                Third, we identify Wnt5a as a chemorepellant of DA neurites in mouse E11.5 and E14.5
                explant cultures. We confirm that these growth and chemotaxic effects of Wnt5a are
                mediated by Frizzled and involve the activation of Rac1, a component of the Wnt/PCP
                pathway. Fourth, analysis of the <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup>
                mice revealed that Wnt5a is required for fasciculation of DA axons in the MFB, and
                for the innervation of the dorsolateral striatum, the target area of substantia
                nigra DA neurons.</p>
      <p>Wnt5a expression within the VM and caudal region of the MFB was maintained during
                development of the DA pathways. More precise temporal and spatial gradients reflect
                the functions of this protein in DA axon morphogenesis. We speculate that at E11.5,
                the high expression of Wnt5a within the ventricular zone and in the rostral part of
                the ventral midbrain, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g001">Fig.
                1A,E</xref>) may prevent axons from entering the ventricular zone and from taking a
                premature anterior direction. In support, our in vitro results at E11.5 indicate
                that Wnt5a increases neurite length during initial DA axon development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g002">Fig. 2D,E</xref>), and repels them away
                from the source of Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g006">Fig.
                    6B,D,E</xref>). Additionally, E12 Wnt5a<sup>−/−</sup>embryos show
                reduced neurite length and disorganization of DA neurites, with fibers seen within
                intermediate layers of the VM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018373.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We therefore suggest that the initial
                effect of Wnt5a is to contribute to DA axonal elongation and to maintain axons
                within the VM, but out of the ventricular zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g008">Fig. 8A, D</xref>). Later in development, by E14.5, the
                high rostral expression of Wnt5a is down-regulated and expression is higher in the
                caudal VM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g001">Fig. 1L</xref>). This
                gradient shift may facilitate DA axons taking a forebrain trajectory by being
                repelled away from the caudal VM, and preventing their entry into the hindbrain
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). Interestingly,
                whilst not observed by us, Fenstermaker et al (2010) reported the appearance of DA
                axons in the hindbrain of Wnt5a<sup>−/−</sup>mice at E12.5, a phenotype
                that was lost later in development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Fenstermaker1">[55]</xref>, yet supports our theory
                of Wnt5a ensuring DA axons maintain their rostral trajectory.</p>

                        mesostriatal/mesolimbic pathways in mice.</title>
          <p>(<bold>A</bold>) In wildtype mice, at E11.5-12, a high ventricular to low
                        mantle zone expression of Wnt5a (red shading) in the ventral midbrain,
                        combined with our in vitro findings of Wnt5a's ability to elongate and
                        repel DA axons (green), suggests that Wnt5a may be capable of polarizing and
                        driving DA axons out of the VM. Higher Wnt5a levels in the rostral VM (red),
                        in combination with its chemorepulsive function, further suggests that Wnt5a
                        may prevent premature rostral trajectory of these DA axons. (<bold>B</bold>)
                        At E14.5, a higher caudal to lower rostral Wnt5a gradient (red), combined
                        with the maintained repulsive action of Wnt5a at this age, may ensure
                            TH<sup>+</sup> axons maintain their forebrain trajectory. The
                        ability of Wnt5a to induce axon retraction in vitro (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) suggests a
                        plausible role in axon stalling, a key developmental event that prevents
                        axons prematurely entering their forebrain striatal targets. The dotted red
                        line indicates the border of the ganglionic eminence where axon stalling
                        occurs. (<bold>C</bold>) At E18, low expression of Wnt5a is maintained
                        within the VM. At this stage in development TH<sup>+</sup> axons are
                        present within the GE and are making increasing synaptic contacts.
                            (<bold>D</bold>) In the absence of Wnt5a, at E11.5-12,
                            TH<sup>+</sup> axons maintain a rostral projection but are shorter
                        and show a lack of organization. (<bold>E</bold>) By E18, the
                        disorganization of TH<sup>+</sup> fibers is evident by the
                        defasiculation of the MFB in Wnt5a<sup>−/−</sup> mice.
                        Additionally, axons prematurely enter the target, presumably due to loss of
                        axonal stalling, resulting in increased striatal innervation in
                            Wnt5a<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Lv, lateral ventricle; Aq,

      <p>Previous studies have shown that Fz3 is involved in PCP signaling in the context of
                axon guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Wang3">[64]</xref>
                and that Fz3-deficient mice, whilst possessing normal numbers of DA neurons, have no
                nigrostriatal pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Wang1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Wang2">[58]</xref>. Moreover, Stuebner et al. has recently reported that Fz3
                and Fz6 cooperate to regulate midbrain morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Stuebner1">[65]</xref>. Similarly, we have
                previously reported that Wnt5a mutant mice have a near normal number of DA neurons,
                but show a clear defect in midbrain morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Andersson1">[23]</xref>. We hereby report that,
                similar to Fz3, Wnt5a promotes DA neuritogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and that
                    <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibit defects in DA
                axonogenesis. Moreover, we found that αFz3-CRD blocked the neuritogenic and
                repulsive effects of Wnt5a, suggesting that these Wnt5a effects are mediated by Fz3
                or Fz3-like receptors. Fenstermaker et al., (2010) has since illustrated notable
                defects within the trajectory of DA fibers in Fz3<sup>−/−</sup>mice,
                observing several fibers projecting caudally and failing to make striatal contacts
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Fenstermaker1">[55]</xref>.
                Surprisingly, we observed increased fiber innervation in
                    Wnt5a<sup>−/−</sup> mice suggesting that Fz3 is only partially
                responsible for our observations. In the future, analysis of double mutant mice for
                Fz3 and Wnt5a may more clearly identify these roles and highlight the need to
                investigate other Wnt related receptors.</p>
      <p>Signaling mediated through Frizzled receptors is commonly associated with axon
                elongation and attraction while, in contrast, signaling through Ryk induces axon
                repulsion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Zou1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Speese1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-SanchezCamacho1">[66]</xref>. However, Ryk receptors activated by Wnt5a gradients
                promoted elongation of cortical axons in the callosal and corticospinal tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Liu1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Li1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Keeble1">[35]</xref>, and
                chemorepelled these same axons via Wnt5a signaling through both Ryk and Frizzled
                receptors. These differing actions were mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes
                involving IP3 receptors and/or TRP channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Li1">[33]</xref>. Whilst we can not directly
                attribute the effects of Wnt5a to Ryk binding, the high expression of Ryk within DA
                neurons of the VM, combined with RYK-Fc antagonism in a DA cell line and existing
                literature in other pathways, suggests that Ryk may also play a role in regulating
                DA morphogenesis. Analysis of Ryk-deficient mice as well as double mutants (Wnt5a
                and Ryk) or siRNA experiments may shed more light on this receptor's
                involvement in these processes.</p>
      <p>Whilst a number of guidance molecules have been recognized for their role in DA
                neurite development, few studies have verified these functions in vivo. In our
                study, we examined the nigrostriatal DA pathway in
                    <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, validating a number of
                our in vitro findings and the importance of Wnt5a in DA connectivity. In wildtype
                mice, TH<sup>+</sup> axons remain tightly fasciculated within the MFB as they
                project towards their forebrain targets. In contrast, DA axons in the
                    <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were clearly
                defasciculated throughout the MFB, with broadening of the bundle observed from
                caudal to rostral levels of the pathway. Interestingly, defasciculation and
                broadening of the MFB has also been observed in
                    <italic>Sema3F</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Kolk1">[9]</xref> and
                    <italic>Ryk</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed defasciculation of
                the callosal axon bundle crossing the midline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Keeble1">[35]</xref>. These findings indicate that
                Wnt5a is required to fasciculate DA axons in vivo.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, despite the role of Wnt5a in promoting axonal growth, repelling DA
                axons and regulating fasciculation of the DA fiber bundle, DA axons in
                    <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice maintained their
                appropriate caudo-rostral trajectory, indicating that Wnt5a alone is not necessary
                to initiate neurite growth or provide directionality in vivo. Collectively these
                findings suggest that other guidance molecules or Wnts might be capable of
                compensating for the lack of Wnt5a during the establishment of this pathway.
                However, more axons were detected within the MFB of
                    <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Since we previously
                reported that the number of neurons in
                    <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and
                    <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice is not different <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-Andersson1">[23]</xref>, the
                increased fiber density in the MFB of
                    <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice suggests a possible
                increase in DA neurites per DA neuron, or alternatively, increased branching of the
                DA axons. Interestingly, our in vitro data supports both possibilities, but the
                greater effect on branching suggests a predominant role of Wnt5a on DA neurite
                branching, rather than on the number of neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g002">Fig. 2F,G</xref>).</p>
      <p>Finally, it is important to note that despite DA axons arriving at the border of the
                ganglionic eminence at approximately E15 in rats, they do not enter the striatum,
                but rather increase in numbers until approximately E17 (comparable to mouse E15)
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018373-VandenHeuvel1">[1]</xref>. In
                support of a possible role for Wnt5a in axon stalling, we found that Wnt5a had a
                negative effect on DA neurite length in vitro, at E14.5 (approximately equivalent to
                rat E16.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018373-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), and that
                axonal innervation of the dorsolateral striatum was accelerated in the
                    <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. These results indicate
                that Wnt5a may be the repulsive signal that prevents premature entry of DA axons
                into the striatum. Indeed, both the increased fiber number in the MFB and the dense
                striatal innervation of the <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice
                may reflect a premature maturation of the pathway (i.e. loss of axonal stalling).
                Thus our results suggest that one of the functions of Wnt5a in the nigrostriatal
                system would be to prevent the premature maturation of this pathway.</p>
      <p>In summary, our findings identify a number of key roles for Wnt5a in the development
                of DA axons in vitro and in the maturation of the MFB in vivo. Wnt5a promotes DA
                axon elongation, retraction and repulsion in a time-dependent manner, as well as
                maturation and fasciculation of the MFB. These effects, at least in part, are
                mediated through the Frizzled receptors and downstream activation of the Wnt/PCP
                pathway. Whilst broadening our knowledge of dopamine development, an understanding
                of the regulation and promotion of DA axonal growth and guidance may have
                significant implications for a number of neurological disorders in which the
                development of nigrostriatal DA axons are affected, as well as enhancing integration
                of grafted dopamine neurons into the Parkinsonian brain.</p>

                        were specific to DA neurites. Furthermore, the absence of an effect of
                        αFz3-CRD and RYK-Fc on the general neuronal population verifies the lack
                        of toxicity of these proteins at the doses selected.</p>
