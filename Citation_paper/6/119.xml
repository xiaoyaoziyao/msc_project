These fluctuations can interfere with optimal function or can be exploited to generate beneficial diversity between cells; gene expression noise is therefore expected to be subject to evolutionary pressure. Shifts between modes of high and low rates of transcription initiation at a promoter appear to contribute to this noise both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, models invoked for eukaryotic promoter noise such as stable activation scaffolds or persistent nucleosome alterations seem unlikely to apply to prokaryotic promoters. We consider the relative importance of the steps required for transcription initiation. The 3-step transcription initiation model of McClure is extended into a mathematical model that can be used to predict consequences of additional promoter properties. We show in principle that the transcriptional bursting observed at an <italic>E. coli</italic> promoter by Golding et al. (2005) can be explained by stimulation of initiation by the negative supercoiling behind a transcribing RNA polymerase (RNAP) or by the formation of moribund or dead-end RNAP-promoter complexes. Both mechanisms are tunable by the alteration of promoter kinetics and therefore allow the optimization of promoter mediated noise.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Noise in gene expression is important for phenotypic variation among genetically identical cells. The gene expression will be particularly sensitive to noise in transcription initiation. Transcription initiation from a given promoter involves multiple steps, each of which could be rate limiting. In this paper we discuss how transcription initiation could come in bursts, separated by long periods where the promoter is inactive. Our results are compared to recent data of Golding et al. (2005), which suggest that transcriptions from some prokaryotic promoters occur in a highly irregular burst-like fashion. We show that the observed bursting could be caused by one of two alternate mechanisms. One possibility is that changes in supercoiling induced by previous RNA polymerase can help a subsequent RNAP to enter directly into open complex. Another possibility is that an RNAP at the promoter sometimes forms a dead-end complex, and thereby occludes the promoter for a sizeable amount of time.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Danish National Research Foundation.

Transcription involves the production of small numbers of mRNAs, which are then translated multiple times, creating and amplifying noise in protein concentrations. Therefore, the probability distribution underlying the timing of transcription initiation is important for understanding cellular dynamics. A distribution where initiations are evenly spaced will result in less noise and a more uniform cell population. In contrast, a highly variable rate of initiation will produce large fluctuations that can lead to heterogeneous behavior across populations of genetically identical cells. This variability is important to allow populations of unicellular organisms to cope with variable environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Suel1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Blake1">[5]</xref>.

When the promoter was induced, transcription was observed to occur in an unexpectedly irregular fashion, with bursts of transcription separated by long periods of inactivity. This phenomenon was called transcriptional bursting. The bursts of activity (on-periods) lasted an exponentially distributed amount of time, with a mean of 6 minutes at 22°C. During an on period a geometrically distributed number of transcripts are produced in rapid succession, with a mean of 2.2 transcripts per on-period.

Here we consider the McClure model of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Hawley1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-McClure1">[13]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000109-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), where transcription initiation requires three steps: RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding to the promoter to form a closed complex, followed by isomerisation of the closed complex to an open complex in which the DNA at the promoter is melted, and the escape of the open complex to form an RNAP complex engaged in elongation of the transcript. The closed complex is assumed to be in rapid equilibrium with free RNAP, while isomerisation and escape are treated as being slower and irreversible. This model is a simplified but useful version of the full kinetics of initiation.</p><p>The kinetics of each elementary reaction in initiation determines the final distribution of transcription initiation. Transcription is often treated as a Poisson process, i.e. the probability of initiation at a given moment is a constant, which results in an exponential distribution of times between transcripts. Golding <italic>et al.</italic> were able to show through several methods that the distribution of transcription initiation was non-Poisson. However, the exponential distribution is a special case where there is only one rate limiting step in the initiation of transcription.</p><p>For the analytical analysis of the McClure model, we make the assumption that the rates of binding <italic>k<sub>b</sub></italic> and unbinding <italic>k<sub>u</sub></italic> of the closed complex are relatively fast, and therefore that there are only two kinetically significant steps, isomerisation of the closed complex to an open complex, and promoter escape by the open complex. We assume that each step is elementary, i.e. that it can be approximated as a single chemical reaction. We also ignore the effect of self-occlusion, where an RNAP prevents further initiation at the promoter until it has transcribed far enough to no longer occlude the promoter (50 bp), as the time needed to transcribe this distance (1–4 seconds) is negligible compared to the time between initiations in the Golding <italic>et al.</italic> experiments. The average time needed to complete the first step, <italic>t<sub>o</sub></italic>, is therefore <italic>t<sub>o</sub></italic> = (1+<italic>K</italic>)/<italic>O</italic>, where <italic>K</italic> = <italic>k<sub>u</sub></italic>/<italic>k<sub>b</sub></italic> is the equilibrium constant of dissociation for the closed complex and <italic>O</italic> is the rate of transition from closed to open complex. The inverse of the rate of the open to elongating transition (<italic>E</italic>) gives the average time needed for the second kinetically important step, <italic>t<sub>E</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000109-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The average time taken for initiation (and therefore the time gap between initiations, 〈Δ<italic>t</italic>〉, with 〈…〉 indicating the average) is the sum of two exponentially distributed random variables, 〈Δ<italic>t</italic>〉 = 〈<italic>τ<sub>O</sub></italic>+<italic>τ<sub>E</sub></italic>〉.

Here, the data points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000109-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) have been obtained by simulating the model of the promoter in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000109-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) using the Gillespie algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Gillespie1">[14]</xref>, which stochastically determines the next reaction to occur and the time interval between reactions based on the given rates. The other extreme, where <italic>t<sub>O</sub></italic> = <italic>t<sub>E</sub></italic> (Class II), is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000109-g001">Figure 1C</xref>. In Class II, the chance of rapid successive firings faster than the average (<italic>Dt</italic>&lt;&lt;<italic>t<sub>O</sub></italic>+<italic>t<sub>E</sub></italic>) is smaller than for a Class I promoter, as for a Class II promoter a low <italic>Dt</italic> requires both the isomerisation and the escape to productive transcription to occur in rapid succession, whereas for a Class I promoter a low <italic>Dt</italic> requires the rapid occurrence of the rate limiting step only. As a consequence the distribution in Class II shows a peak at non-zero <italic>Dt</italic>. Promoter models that specify more kinetically significant reaction intermediates produce more extreme versions of the Class II distribution, with a larger peak centered around 〈Δ<italic>t</italic>〉, resulting in more regular firing intervals.</p><p>The Class I type promoter shows the most fluctuation in <italic>Dt</italic>, and the effect of adding more kinetically significant intermediate steps is to reduce the amount of variability in <italic>Dt</italic>. Therefore neither the standard model nor models that take into account more intermediates can reproduce the bunched activity observed by Golding <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Golding1">[10]</xref>, which show greater fluctuations in <italic>Dt</italic> than a Poisson process. In order to reproduce the bunched activity, it is necessary to consider a model with a branched pathway, where the system can go into either an active state or an inactive state with a switching mechanism between them.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Previously Proposed Mechanisms for Bunched Activity</title><p>Here we consider several hypotheses for the mechanism of transcriptional bursting and argue that they are unlikely to be correct. The promoter used by Golding <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Golding1">[10]</xref>, P<sub>lac/ara</sub>, can be repressed about 70-fold by the lac repressor and activated about 30 fold by AraC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Lutz1">[15]</xref>. Therefore, a simple hypothesis put forward by Golding <italic>et al.</italic> is that the silent periods are periods where the lac repressor is bound to the promoter, and the bursts are periods of activity when the promoter is free. However, the mean duration of off-periods is 37 min while on periods are only 6 min in duration, despite the fact that the promoter has been fully induced by 1 mM IPTG. It seems impossible for the lac repressor to remain bound to the DNA for 37 minutes under these conditions; especially considering that 1 mM IPTG derepresses the lac promoter in less than 5 sec <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Elf1">[16]</xref>.</p><p>A similar idea is that the off-periods represent periods where AraC is not bound to the promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Golding1">[10]</xref>. To make this feasible the on rate for AraC in an <italic>E.coli</italic> cell would have to be exceedingly small given the large off periods. This is unreasonable in view of the high association rate for AraC to other operators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Timmes1">[17]</xref>. Presumably association rate is diffusion limited, meaning that it would take one AraC molecule less than a minute to bind to the operator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Sneppen2">[18]</xref>. In conclusion we find it unlikely that binding AraC is sufficient to produce bunched activity.</p><p>Another hypothesis put forward by Golding <italic>et al.</italic> is that RNAP might be able to re-initiate after termination, aided by the retention of sigma factor during transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-BarNahum1">[19]</xref>. Presumably the RNAP would have to be positioned to rebind to the same promoter after termination for re-initiation to occur with any reliability, and it is not clear how this would be caused. One possibility is that a transcription factor might remain in contact with both the RNAP and the promoter via a DNA loop. This would render the promoter unavailable during transcription, which has some support from the data in that the lengths of the observed on-periods were approximately equal to the number of initiations multiplied by the time taken to transcribe the reporter mRNA for both P<sub>lac/ara</sub> and P<sub>RM</sub> (Golding, private communication), which would be expected if transcription does not occur simultaneously. However, this data is somewhat anecdotal, and stands in contradiction to the simultaneous transcription observed with electron microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-French1">[20]</xref>. Also, this mechanism requires binding of a closed complex to the DNA to be the rate limiting step that causes the 37 minute long off-period, and we consider it unlikely that simple recognition of the promoter by RNAP would take this long, especially given that closed complex formation is often thought to be a rapid equilibrium process.</p><p>Multiple RNAP can cooperate to overcome pause sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Epshtein1">[21]</xref>. It might therefore be possible that the burst is due to multiple RNAP building up at a pause site and overcoming it together. However, this would require the RNAP to pause for a length of time on the same scale as the off-period; such an extreme pause is unlikely given that even the strongest pauses measured <italic>in vitro</italic> only last for around one minute.</p><p>Bursting could also result if there were distinct regions of high and low transcriptional activity within bacteria, akin to the idea of transcription factories in eukaryotes, and the promoter moved in and out of these regions on a slow time scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Cook1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Cabrera1">[23]</xref>. Although this is an interesting possibility, not enough is known to evaluate such a mechanism in bacteria in much detail.</p><p>Fluctuations in the availability of free RNAP within the cell could contribute to variable initiation rates but it is difficult to see how such severe and long-lasting fluctuations capable of producing extended periods of complete inactivity could occur in cells where ∼3000 RNAPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Pedersen1">[24]</xref> produce &gt;10<sup>5</sup> RNAs per generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Supercoiling-Mediated Recruitment</title><p>There is both theoretical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Liu1">[25]</xref> and experimental evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Lim1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Opel1">[27]</xref> that an elongating RNAP can increase the negative supercoiling of the DNA behind it.</p><p>Promoters can be very sensitive to supercoiling; for example, <italic>in vitro</italic> the activity of the LacP promoter increases by more than a factor of 10 when the super-coilings is changed from zero to −0.065 (which is the average supercoiling of DNA in E. coli) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Lim1">[26]</xref>. We therefore consider it a possibility that the bursts of transcription might be caused by a transcribing RNAP assisting the recruitment of further RNAP via the wake of supercoiling left behind it. In principle one could argue that perturbed supercoil states could relax quickly in a plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Liu1">[25]</xref> like the one used by Golding <italic>et al.</italic>, but it has been demonstrated that a promoter can induce huge changes in supercoiling of a plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Samul1">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Consider a promoter where open complex formation is a rate limiting step that is assisted by negative supercoiling. To model this, we assume that the negative supercoiling assists this step to the extent that it is no longer rate limiting. We parameterize this effect of supercoiling into a single number <italic>q</italic>, the probability that supercoiling left in the wake of a prior RNAP allows a subsequent RNAP to rapidly form an open complex before the supercoiling is relaxed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000109-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This then creates two possible behaviors at the promoter.

If the promoter is not in the supercoiled state, then open complex formation is very much slower and now rate limiting; transcriptional events are still exponentially distributed but now with the much lower rate <italic>O</italic>.

In particular, promoters with bunched transcription initiation will be highly sensitive to negative supercoiling of the DNA. And conversely, promoters that are insensitive to supercoiling will have transcription events which are separated by more regular time intervals.</p><p>For promoters that are sensitive to supercoiling, one could selectively shorten the long off periods by introducing a second nearby promoter. One option is to add a divergent promoter that might be able to donate its negative supercoil wake. Such a construct was investigated by Opel <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Opel1">[27]</xref>, who reported that a second promoter could indeed increase the activity of a supercoiling sensitive promoter in the <italic>ilvYC</italic> operon. This predicts that if a similar experiment was done with the P<sub>lac/ara</sub> promoter, then reduced off periods would be observed.</p><p>Another prediction is that for promoters with bunched activity the isomerisation step is rate limiting. Thus the fraction of time spent in open complex is small compared to the time between transcription initiations. One might be able to show an inverse correlation between the noisiness of a promoter and the occupancy of the promoter by open complexes using potassium permanganate DNA footprinting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-SasseDwight1">[35]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Testing the Dead-End Model</title><p>The dead-end mechanism implies that the promoter is mostly occluded by an RNAP with an open transcription bubble.

The off-times of a promoter could therefore in principle be shortened by using other RNAP's initiated from another promoter that transcribes across the promoter in question. If a promoter spent a substantial fraction of the time occupied by a dead-end complex, it could be strongly activated by tandem or even convergent promoters, which would be a novel twist on the usually repressive effect of transcriptional interference. If <italic>d</italic> is reduced in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000109-t001">Table 1</xref>, the “off-times” could be reduced by a factor set by the ratio of the strength of the two promoters, and the promoter activity could increase. Thus, if P<sub>lac/ara</sub> activity is affected by dead-end complex formation, then placing a weak divergent promoter upstream should not increase P<sub>lac/ara</sub> activity but placing this promoter in a convergent orientation may activate P<sub>lac/ara</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Perspectives for the Regulation of Transcriptional Noise</title><p>The sensitivity of a promoter to supercoiling mediated recruitment or dead-end complex formation provides additional avenues for control of overall promoter strength, either by evolution or by regulatory factors.</p><p>DNA supercoiling can increase or decrease promoter activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Lim1">[26]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Peter1">[37]</xref> in a promoter specific manner. Supercoiling can affect RNAP binding to the promoter and open complex formation <italic>in vitro</italic> and presumably can affect other steps as well. RNAP recruitment induced by the supercoiling created by an elongating transcription complex may contribute significantly to the activity of certain promoters. We expect that, except for very active promoters, rapid dissipation of the supercoil wake would make inhibition of a supercoiling-repressed promoter by this mechanism unlikely. Stimulation by the departing elongating complex should similarly only apply to the early steps in initiation. Thus only promoters whose early steps are rate-limiting and can be enhanced by supercoiling should be stimulated by this mechanism.</p><p>The reduction of promoter activity by the formation of dead-end complexes is potentially very strong. The effect increases with the probability of forming such a complex (1-<italic>Q</italic>) and with the lifetime of the complex (1/<italic>d</italic>), parameters which could be determined both by the promoter sequence and by the availability of factors such as GreA/B that may remove the complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Stepanova1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Susa1">[30]</xref>. This mechanism would seem to be an inefficient way to set the strength of a promoter, as it would sequester an RNAP. However, it would allow regulation by transcription factors that change the fraction of RNAPs that enter into dead-end complexes or that stabilized the dead-end complex. As a consequence, genes which are silenced through this mechanism will have relatively high fluctuations in expression level, and thereby some cells can explore advantages afforded by relatively high expressions, even when most cells are kept at near zero expression. Bunched activity for a near silenced promoter could, for example, be important in the pathway for the spontaneous induction of lysogeny for some temperate phages, like P2.</p><p>High noise in protein levels can also be obtained at the translation level. If a single mRNA molecule is rapidly translated many times the result is a burst of protein production. Therefore transcriptional bursting is not strictly required for protein production to occur in bursts. However, transcriptional bursting might allow for additional modes of regulation by transcription factors or other proteins that influence the state of the DNA around the promoter site. It may also complement bursts of protein production produced by rapid translation by removing constraints placed on burst size by the upper limits of mRNA translation rate.</p><p>Dynamics and the interplay between timescales presents an open, and until recently, quite unexplored part of molecular biology. The present analysis suggests a new mechanism for <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation, where long silent timescales emerge as the result of some particularly large rate limiting step in the promoter.

They analyzed the experimentally obtained time series of fluorescent signal manually. The system is considered to be in “off-period” when the signal does not change for a while, and otherwise it is in “on-period”. The specific time resolution to detect an “off-period” was not given, but the shortest off-time measured was around 6 [min] (Golding, private communication); in other words, transcription events separated by less than 6 [min] were considered to be in the same “on-period”.</p><p>During an on-period, the number of messages transcribed, D<italic>n</italic>≥1, and the duration <italic>t<sub>on</sub></italic> were recorded; the time to transcribe one message D was 2.5 [min] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Golding1">[10]</xref>, which corresponds to the on-time for D<italic>n</italic> = 1 case.</p><p>Considering this protocol used by Golding <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000109-Golding1">[10]</xref>, we defined Δ<italic>n</italic>, <italic>t<sub>on</sub></italic>, and the duration of the off-time <italic>t<sub>off</sub></italic> out of the time series of firings from our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000109-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) as follows: (i) When firings are separated by more than <italic>τ<sub>c</sub></italic> = 6 [min]+Δ = 8.5[min], the promoter is in an off period. (iii) Otherwise, if successive firings are separated by an interval less than <italic>τ<sub>c</sub></italic>, the gene is considered to be on until we observe an interval greater than <italic>τ<sub>c</sub></italic>.
