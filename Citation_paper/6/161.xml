<abstract>
<p>Containing about 22 nucleotides, a micro RNA (abbreviated miRNA) is a small non-coding RNA molecule, functioning in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The human genome may encode over 1000 miRNAs. Albeit poorly characterized, miRNAs are widely deemed as important regulators of biological processes. Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been observed in many cancers and other disease states, indicating they are deeply implicated with these diseases, particularly in carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is important for both basic research and miRNA-based therapy to discriminate the real pre-miRNAs from the false ones (such as hairpin sequences with similar stem-loops). Particularly, with the avalanche of RNA sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired to develop computational sequence-based methods in this regard. Here two new predictors, called “iMcRNA-PseSSC” and “iMcRNA-ExPseSSC”, were proposed for identifying the human pre-microRNAs by incorporating the global or long-range structure-order information using a way quite similar to the pseudo amino acid composition approach. Rigorous cross-validations on a much larger and more stringent newly constructed benchmark dataset showed that the two new predictors (accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iMcRNA/" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iMcRNA/</ext-link>) outperformed or were highly comparable with the best existing predictors in this area.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small single-strand, non-coding RNAs about 22 nucleotides (nt) in length, which play important roles in gene regulation by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for cleavage or translational repression. The miRNAs are also involved in many important biological processes, such as affecting stability, translation of mRNAs and negatively regulating gene expression in post-transcriptional processes. In animals, the biogenesis of miRNA is shown in <xref rid="pone.0121501.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, and can be divided into the following steps: (i) The genes of miRNA are transcribed by RNA polymerase II [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], resulting in the primary transcripts termed as pri-miRNAs, which are typically 60–70 nt. (ii) The pre-miRNAs are processed by the enzyme Drosha to release the hairpin-shaped intermediates (pre-miRNAs) [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. (iii) The pre-miRNAs are then exported into the cytoplasm by Exportin V and Ran-GTP cofactor [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and cleaved by the enzyme Dicer to yield miRNA/miRNA* duplexes [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>

<p>Owing to the difficulty of systematically detecting miRNAs from a genome by existing experiment techniques, computational methods have been indispensable tools in miRNA studies [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Various computational methods have been proposed to predict pre-miRNAs. Most of these methods employed the machine learning techniques to build their prediction models, which treated this problem as a binary classification task to discriminate the real pre-miRNAs from false pre-miRNAs. These methods are different in the feature selections and machine learning algorithms or operation engines. The machine learning algorithms usually used in this field include Support Vector Machine (SVM) [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Random Forest (RF) [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Covariant Discrimination (CD) [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or Naive Bayes (NB) [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
<p>The secondary structure is an important feature used in the computational methods, because most of the pre-miRNAs have the characteristic of stem-loop hairpin structures [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mir-abela [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] is an SVM-based method trained with 16 statistic features computed from the entire hairpin structure. Triplet-SVM [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] employed a SVM classifier to train 32 local triplet sequence-structure features. Later, MiPred [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] improved Triplet-SVM [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] by employing the Random Forest classifier trained with the local triplet sequence-structure features, minimum of free energy (MFE), and <italic>P</italic>-values. MiRFinder [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] is a high-throughput pre-miRNA prediction method, which consists of two steps: a search for hairpin candidates and exclusion of the non-robust structures based on the analysis of 18 parameters by the SVM.</p>
<p>All these computational methods could yield quite encouraging results, and each of them did play a role in simulating the development of pre-miRNA identification. However, further work is needed due to the following reasons: (i) The datasets constructed in those methods were too small to reflect the statistical profile of human pre-miRNAs. Most of these methods were trained and tested with a dataset containing only several hundreds of human pre-miRNA samples or pseudo pre-miRNA samples. (ii) No cutoff threshold was imposed to rigorously exclude the redundant samples or those with high sequence similarity with others in a same benchmark dataset. (iii) Most of these methods only consider the local structure or sequence order information of RNA sequences, and all the global or long range structure or sequence order effects were ignored.</p>
<p>In this study, we attempted to improve the accuracy for human pre-miRNA identification from the above three aspects; especially, we focused on how to incorporate the global structure-order effects into the predictor. However, it is difficult to incorporate this kind of information into a statistical predictor because the RNA sequences have different lengths with extremely large number of possible structure patterns. To overcome this difficulty, is it possible to find an approximate way to take the structure-order effects into account?</p>
<p>Actually, similar problems were also encountered in computational proteomics and genomics. To incorporate the long-range or global sequence order information for protein/peptide sequences, the pseudo amino acid composition [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or Chou’s PseAAC [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was proposed. Ever since the concept of PseAAC was proposed in 2001[<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], it has been penetrating into almost all the fields of protein attribute predictions (see, e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], as well as a Wikipedia article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_amino_acid_composition" xlink:type="simple">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_amino_acid_composition</ext-link> and a long list of papers cited in [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) and some fields of drug development and biomedicine [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Recently, the concept of PseAAC has also been further extended to the field of genomics by using different modes of pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition or PseKNC [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] to predict the recombination spots of DNA [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], the nucleosome positions [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], sigma-54 promoters [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and DNA methylation sites [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. For more information about this, see a recent review [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>
<p>Encouraged by the successes of PseAAC and PseKNC approaches in the fields of proteomics and genomics, we proposed a feature vector called “pseudo structure status composition (PseSSC)” to represent RNA sequences by incorporating the structure-order effects so as to improve the prediction quality in identifying human pre-miRNA. The detailed approach is elaborated as follows.</p>
<p>As pointed out in a comprehensive review [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and carried out in a series of recent publications (see, e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]), to develop a really useful statistical predictor or model for a biological system, one needs to engage the following procedures: (i) construct or select a valid benchmark dataset to train and test the predictor; (ii) formulate the statistical samples with an effective mathematical expression that can truly reflect their intrinsic correlation with the target to be predicted; (iii) introduce or develop a powerful algorithm (or engine) to operate the prediction; (iv) properly perform cross-validation tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated accuracy of the model; (v) establish a user-friendly web-server for the predictor that is accessible to the public. Below, let us describe how to deal with these procedures one-by-one.</p>

<title>Materials and Method</title>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>1. Benchmark Dataset</title>
<p>The pre-miRNAs or positive samples were downloaded from the latest version (release 20: June 2013) of miRNABase [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], which contained 1,872 experiment-confirmed sapiens pre-miRNA entries. The false pre-miRNAs or negative samples were taken from the data constructed by Xue et al. [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which contained 8,489 false pre-miRNA samples. These false pre-miRNAs are similar to the real pre-miRNAs according to the following widely accepted characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]: (i) the RNA length ranges from 51 nt to 137 nt; (ii) a minimum of 18 base pairings on the stem of the hairpin structure; (iii) a maximum of-15 kal/mol free energy of the secondary structure.</p>
<p>To get rid of the redundancy and avoid homology bias, the CD-HIT software [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] with the cutoff threshold set at 80% (note that the most stringent cutoff threshold for DNA sequences by CD-HIT is 75%) was used to winnow those samples which had ≥80% sequence identity to any other in a same subset. After such a screening procedure, we obtained 1,612 human pre-miRNAs, which formed the positive dataset in the current study.</p>
<p>To avoid imbalance problem caused by different number of positive and negative samples, we randomly picked 1,612 samples from the 8,489 false pre-miRNAs to form the negative dataset. Again, none of the samples included had ≥80% sequence identity to any other in a same subset.</p>
<p>As pointed out by a review [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], there is no need to separate a benchmark dataset into a training dataset and a testing dataset for validating a prediction method if it is tested by the jackknife or subsampling (K-fold) cross-validation because the outcome thus obtained is actually from a combination of many different independent dataset tests. Therefore, the benchmark dataset 𝕊 can be formulated as

<p>Given a RNA sequence R (cf. <xref rid="pone.0121501.e002" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 2</xref>), its secondary structure sequence was derived from Vienna RNA software package, as formulated in <xref rid="pone.0121501.e004" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 4</xref>. According to the definition in that package, there are two types of status for each of the nucleotides: unpaired or paired. The former is denoted by a dot “.” and the latter by the symbol “(“or “)”. The left bracket “(“stands for a nucleotide near the 5'-end while the right bracket for the one near the 3'-end. Since the number of different structure elements in the RNA sequence thus obtained is 10 (cf. <xref rid="pone.0121501.e005" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 5</xref>), its <italic>n</italic>-tuple element composition will contain 10<sup><italic>n</italic></sup>components (cf. <xref rid="pone.0121501.e006" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 6</xref>).

<title>3. Support Vector Machine</title>
<p>Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a class of supervised learning algorithms first introduced by Vapnik [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Given a set of labelled training vectors (positive and negative input samples), SVM learns a linear decision boundary from both positive and negative training samples to discriminate between the unseen protein sequences. A key feature of SVM is that it needs fixed length of the input vector. The proteins in the training set and test set were transformed into fixed-dimension feature vectors following the process introduced above, and then the training vectors were input into SVM to construct the classifier. The SVM gives a predicted class for each sample in the test set.</p>
<p>In the current study, the LIBSVM algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] was employed, which is a type of software for SVM classification and regression. The kernel function was set as Radial Basis Function (RBF), which is defined as

<title>4. Cross Validation</title>
<p>In examining the accuracy of a statistical predictor, it is very important to choose an objective method to perform the test. In literature, the following three cross-validation methods are often used to examine the quality of a predictor and its effectiveness in practical application: independent dataset test, subsampling or K-fold (such as 5-fold, 7-fold, or 10-fold) crossover test, and jackknife test. However, as elucidated by a penetrating analysis in [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], considerable arbitrariness exists in the independent dataset test. Also, as demonstrated by Eqs.28–32 of [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the subsampling (or K-fold crossover validation) test cannot avoid arbitrariness either. Only the jackknife test is the least arbitrary that can always yield a unique result for a given benchmark dataset. Therefore, the jackknife test has been widely recognized and increasingly utilized by investigators to examine the quality of various predictors (see, e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]). Accordingly, in this study we also use the jackknife test to evaluate the accuracy of the current predictor. During the jackknife test, each of the samples in the benchmark dataset is in turn singled out as an independent test sample and all the rule-parameters are calculated without including the sample being identified. Although the jackknife test may take more computational time, it is worthwhile because it will yield a unique outcome for a given benchmark dataset.</p>

<title>1. Performance of iMcRNA-PseSSC and iMcRNA-ExPseSSC</title>
<p>As we can see from <xref rid="pone.0121501.e009" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0121501.e011" ref-type="disp-formula">11</xref>, both the iMcRNA-PseSSC and iMcRNA-ExPseSSC predictors contain three uncertain parameters, namely <italic>n</italic>,λ, and <italic>w</italic>, where <italic>n</italic> reflects the local or short-range structure-order effect, λ reflects the global or long-range structure-order effect, and 0077 is the factor to adjust the weight between the local and global effects. Generally speaking, the greater the <italic>n</italic> is, the more local structure-order information is incorporated. And the greater the λ is, the more global structure-order information is taken into account. However, if <italic>n</italic> or λ is too large, it would reduce the cluster-tolerant capacity [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and cause the “overfitting” or “high dimension disaster” [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] problem, so as to reduce the prediction accuracy.

Thus, the parameters in <xref rid="pone.0121501.e031" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 16</xref> were used to perform the rigorous jackknife test on the benchmark dataset to calculate the metrics defined in <xref rid="pone.0121501.e015" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 14</xref>.</p>
<p>The results thus obtained by the two new predictors are given in <xref rid="pone.0121501.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, from which we can see that the overall accuracy (Acc) achieved by iMcRNA-PseSSC was 85.76% with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) equal to 0.72. The corresponding rates achieved by iMcRNA-ExPseSSC were even better; i.e., 89.86% and 0.80 for Acc and MCC, respectively. It is not surprising because the additional features counted in <xref rid="pone.0121501.e011" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 11</xref> play a complementary role to the feature in <xref rid="pone.0121501.e009" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 9</xref>. In other words, all these features are complementary with each other: PseSSC is a structure-based feature reflecting the global or long-range structure-order effects; MFE and <italic>P</italic>-value are for the secondary structure state of minimum free energy; and tri-nucleobase composition is for the local or short-range sequence order information [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>

<title>2. Comparison with Other Methods</title>
<p>We have also made a comparison of the current iMcRNA-PseSSC and iMcRNA-ExPseSSC (<xref rid="pone.0121501.e014" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 13</xref>) with Triplet-SVM [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and MiPred [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], two of the best existing predictors in this area. As mentioned in the Introduction section, the accuracy rates by the two predictors as originally reported [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] were based on small benchmark datasets without removing high similarity or redundant RNA sequences, and hence the rates thus obtained might be over-estimated.</p>
<p>For instance, Triplet-SVM [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was trained with 163 human pre-miRNAs and 168 false pre-miRNAs, and tested with only 30 human pre-miRNAs and 1,000 false pre-miRNAs. Also, MiPred [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was trained using the same dataset as used by Triplet-SVM [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and tested with 263 human pre-miRNAs and 265 false pre-miRNAs. In contrast, the current predictors iMcRNA-PseSSC and iMcRNA-ExPseSSC were trained and tested on a much larger and more stringent benchmark dataset that contained 1,612 human pre-miRNAs and 1,612 false pre-miRNAs in which none had more than 80% pairwise sequence identity to any other.</p>
<p>If using the larger and more stringent benchmark dataset (<xref rid="pone.0121501.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>) to examine the two predictors via the rigorous jackknife tests, we obtained the corresponding results as given in <xref rid="pone.0121501.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></p>
<p>Furthermore, to provide a graphic illustration to show the performances of the four predictors, the corresponding ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves were drawn in <xref rid="pone.0121501.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, where the horizontal coordinate X is for the false positive rate or 1-Sp, and the vertical coordinate Y is for the true positive rate or Sn. The best possible predictor should yield a point with the coordinate (0, 1) meaning 0 false positive rate (or 100% specificity), and 100% true positive rate or sensitivity Sn. Therefore, the (0,1) point is also called a perfect classification. A completely random guess would give a point along a diagonal from the point (0,0) to (1,1). The area under the ROC curve is called AUC, which is often used to indicate the performance quality of a binary classification predictor: the larger the area, the better the prediction quality is.</p>

(i) The predictor iMcRNA-PseSSC outperformed Triplet-SVM [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and was highly comparable with MiPred [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], meaning that the prediction quality can be enhanced to the level of the existing best predictor by only taking into account the long-range or global secondary structure sequence order information. (ii) The predictor iMcRNA-ExPseSSC outperformed all its counterparts, meaning that the prediction quality can be further enhanced by combing the aforementioned long-range information with the local features as used in the existing predictors [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

<title>3. Discriminant Visualization and Interpretation</title>
<p>Why was the current approach able to enhance the success rates so remarkably? To address this problem, we are to carry out a graphical analysis. It can provide an intuitive picture or useful insights for helping understand varieties of complicated relations, as demonstrated by many previous studies on a series of important biological topics, such as using graphical rules to study enzyme-catalyzed reactions [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], and drug metabolism systems [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]; using the “cellular automaton image” [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] to study hepatitis B viral infections [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and HBV virus gene missense mutation [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]; and using wenxiang diagram or graph [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] to study protein-protein interactions [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Here, we used the heat map [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] to present an intuitive analysis. Similar to the approach in [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], we calculated the discriminant weight vector in the feature space of iMcRNA-PseSSC. The results thus obtained are illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0121501.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, where the darker the spot is, the more discriminative power the corresponding structure status has. Thus, according to the degree of dark colour in the subfigure, we can see that the statuses of the four structures (A-U, U-A, C-G, G-C) are more important than the others in identifying human microRNA precursors because they have stronger discriminative power. Moreover, the discriminative powers of the 13 features incorporating the structure-order effects are shown in <xref rid="pone.0121501.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>, from which we can see that the discriminative power for miRNAs tends to be stronger with the increasing λ in value, indicating that the long-range or global structure-order effect do have considerable impacts upon the discrimination. That is the main reason why iMcRNA-PseSSC can remarkably outperform its counterparts.</p>

<p>We have also established a web-server for the two predictors as formulated in <xref rid="pone.0121501.e014" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 13</xref>. Furthermore, for the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, below let us give a step-by-step guide on how to use the web-server to get their desired results without the need to follow the complicated mathematic equations.</p>
<p><bold>Step 1</bold>. Open the web-server by clicking the link at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iMcRNA/" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iMcRNA/</ext-link> and you will see its top page as shown in <xref rid="pone.0121501.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. Click on the <underline>Read Me</underline> button to see a brief introduction about the server that contains two predictors: iMcRNA-PseSSC and iMcRNA-ExPseSSC.</p>

</fig>
<p><bold>Step 2</bold>. Check the open circle right in front of iMcRNA-PseSSC or iMcRNA-ExPseSSC to choose which of the two predictors you are to use for prediction.</p>
<p><bold>Step 3</bold>. You can directly enter the query RNA sequences into the input box at the center of <xref rid="pone.0121501.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, or use the <underline>Browse</underline> button to upload them via a file. All the input sequences should be in the FASTA format. A sequence in FASTA format consists of a single initial line beginning with the symbol “&gt;” in the first column, followed by lines of sequence data in which nucleotides are represented using single-letter codes. Except for the mandatory symbol “&gt;”, all the other characters in the single initial line are optional and only used for the purpose of identification and description. The sequence ends if another line starting with the symbol “&gt;” appears; this indicates the start of another sequence. Example sequences in FASTA format can be seen by clicking on the <underline>Example</underline> button.</p>
<p><bold>Step 4</bold>. Click on the <underline>Submit</underline> button to see the predicted result. For example, if you use the four query RNA sequences in the <underline>Example</underline> window as the input and select iMcRNA-PseSSC for prediction, after clicking the <underline>Submit</underline> button, you will see on your screen (<xref rid="pone.0121501.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) that the predicted results for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> query RNA sequences are “<bold>Real Pre-miRNA</bold>”, and that for the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4th ones are “<bold>False Pre-miRNA</bold>”. <bold>All these predicted results are fully consistent with the experimental observations</bold>. It takes about 2 seconds for the above computation before the predicted result appears on your computer screen. If you select iMcRNA-ExPseSSC, however, for the same prediction, it may take about 20 seconds because more calculations are needed although the overall success rates thus obtained are generally higher than those by the iMcRNA-PseSSC predictor.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Based on the concept of pseudo amino acid composition [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or Chou’s PseAAC [<xref rid="pone.0121501.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], two new predictors named iMcRNA-PseSSC and iMcRNA-ExPseSSC were proposed for identifying the human pre-micrRNAs by incorporating the global or long-range structure-order information. It was observed via the rigorous cross-validation on a larger and more stringent newly constructed benchmark dataset that the two new predictors outperformed or were highly comparable with the best existing predictor in this area. The two predictors are publically accessible via a web-server at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iMcRNA/" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iMcRNA/</ext-link>, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to follow the complicated mathematical equations, which were presented in this paper just for the integrity of their development process.</p>
<p>It is instructive to point out that although the current two predictors were established for identifying the human pre-micrRNAs, they can be easily used to identify the pre-micrRNAs in any other organism as well if a corresponding benchmark dataset is available.</p>
