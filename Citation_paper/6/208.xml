<abstract>
<p>The characterization of mammary stem cells, and signals that regulate their behavior, is of central importance in understanding developmental changes in the mammary gland and possibly for targeting stem-like cells in breast cancer. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a signaling mechanism associated with maintenance of self-renewing stem cells in many tissues, including mammary epithelium, and can be oncogenic when deregulated. Wnt1 and Wnt3a are examples of ligands that activate the canonical pathway. Other Wnt ligands, such as Wnt5a, typically signal via non-canonical, β-catenin-independent, pathways that in some cases can antagonize canonical signaling. Since the role of non-canonical Wnt signaling in stem cell regulation is not well characterized, we set out to investigate this using mammosphere formation assays that reflect and quantify stem cell properties. Ex vivo mammosphere cultures were established from both wild-type and <italic>Wnt1</italic> transgenic mice and were analyzed in response to manipulation of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling. An increased level of mammosphere formation was observed in cultures derived from MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> versus wild-type animals, and this was blocked by treatment with Dkk1, a selective inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling. Consistent with this, we found that a single dose of recombinant Wnt3a was sufficient to increase mammosphere formation in wild-type cultures. Surprisingly, we found that Wnt5a also increased mammosphere formation in these assays. We confirmed that this was not caused by an increase in canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling but was instead mediated by non-canonical Wnt signals requiring the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 and activity of the Jun N-terminal kinase, JNK. We conclude that both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signals have positive effects promoting stem cell activity in mammosphere assays and that they do so via independent signaling mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stem cells of the adult mammary gland are predicted to have a capacity for self-renewal and to give rise to the two major epithelial cell lineages of mammary ducts: luminal and basal. Substantial progress has been made towards characterizing mouse mammary stem cell populations, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, but much remains to be determined about the signaling pathways that regulate their behavior. Elucidating the relevant mechanisms is important for understanding normal stem cell and tissue biology, and also because of the potential for developing therapies that can target stem-like cells in cancer.</p>
<p>Evidence that adult mammary tissue contains multipotent self-renewing stem cells was first provided by classical transplantation studies in which a normal epithelial ductal tree, comprising both basal and luminal cell lineages, could be regenerated from small tissue fragments or individual cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Daniel1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Kordon1">[2]</xref>. Such assays were subsequently used prospectively to identify several combinations of surface markers that enrich for cells with mammary repopulating activity, and indicated that stem cells were distributed within the basal epithelial layer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Shackleton1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Stingl1">[4]</xref>. More recently, however, <italic>in vivo</italic> lineage tracing experiments have challenged some of these conclusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-DeVisser1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-VanKeymeulen1">[6]</xref>, suggesting that much of the post-natal development of mammary epithelium is dependent on separate luminal and basal progenitors acting in combination with a smaller population of bipotent stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-DeVisser1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Rios1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Ex vivo</italic> assays of mammary epithelial cell sphere formation in suspension culture, mammospheres, offer a complementary approach to stem cell studies that is amenable to signaling pathway analysis. Originally developed for analysis of neuronal precursors, the ability of cells to form spheroids has been used as a stem cell assay for several other tissue types, including prostate and mesenchymal stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-MndezFerrer1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Ahmed1">[11]</xref>. Mammosphere-forming cell cultures exhibit stem cell properties in their capacity to self-renew and ability to differentiate into committed luminal and basal lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Dontu1">[12]</xref>. In addition, the ability to form mammospheres correlates with the potential to generate epithelial ductal trees in mammary reconstitution assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Liao1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Liu1">[14]</xref>. Thus, mammosphere formation has been used as an indicator of cells with stem cell properties in mouse and human mammary cell lines as well as in primary tissue culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Liao1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Lamb1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is one of the principal signaling mechanisms associated with regulation of stem cell behavior in numerous tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Brennan1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Howe1">[23]</xref>. Canonical Wnt signaling also has well established roles in regulating embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, where many of its functions may result from effects on stem or progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Brennan1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Clevers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Nusse1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-VanCamp1">[25]</xref>. Similarly, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is frequently activated in a wide range of human cancers and may regulate neoplasia in part via modulation of cancer cells with stem-like cell properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Clevers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Howe1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Polakis1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>The MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> mouse strain is a well characterized model for the studying the consequences of Wnt signaling in the mammary gland and its effects on stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Li1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Incassati1">[30]</xref>. The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter drives expression of the <italic>Wnt1</italic> transgene predominantly in luminal epithelium, and results in activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the basal layer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Baker1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Badders1">[33]</xref>. MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> mice display widespread mammary epithelial hyperplasia and are predisposed to carcinomas with nearly 100% penetrance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Tsukamoto1">[34]</xref>. Notably, the pre-cancerous hyperplastic tissue of MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> was reported to contain larger numbers of CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>HI</sup> cells, which are enriched for stem cell activity, in comparison to wild-type glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Shackleton1">[3]</xref>. In a matrigel-based colony assay, wild-type mouse mammary cells selected for the CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>HI</sup> immunophenotype showed increased colony formation in response to purified Wnt3a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Zeng1">[35]</xref>. Moreover, lineage tracing experiments using Cre-mediated recombination to mark the descendants of Wnt/β-catenin responsive cells expressing Axin2 suggest that such cells contribute to a stem cell population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-VanAmerongen1">[36]</xref>. Collectively these data support a role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the growth and/or maintenance of mammary stem cells.</p>
<p>Intracellular signaling elicited by members of the Wnt family of secreted ligands can be broadly classified into two modes: canonical and non-canonical. In the canonical pathway, Wnt ligand binding to receptor complexes containing Frizzled and Lrp5/6 proteins results in stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin and transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin/TCF complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Clevers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Macdonald1">[37]</xref>. Wnt1 and Wnt3a are prototypical examples of ligands that consistently activate this pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Shimizu1">[38]</xref>. In contrast, non-canonical Wnt signaling is defined as a signaling response to Wnt ligands that is independent of β-catenin stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Semenov1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-VanAmerongen2">[40]</xref>. Wnt5a exemplifies a Wnt protein that typically signals in a non-canonical manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Shimizu1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Liu3">[41]</xref>. Several non-canonical signaling pathways have been proposed and the cognate receptors include Frizzled proteins, and receptor tyrosine kinases such as Ror2, while Lrp5/6 are not required for non-canonical signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Liu3">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-GonzalezSancho1">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>While there is strong support for Wnt/β-catenin signaling promoting mammary stem cell properties, as described above, the roles of non-canonical signaling in the mammary gland are much less clear. Moreover, apparently conflicting data exists concerning functional interactions between canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling in other experimental systems. Thus Wnt5a has been reported to act either act in opposition to, in concert with, or independently of Wnt/β-catenin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-McDonald1">[45]</xref>. In the mouse mammary gland, Wnt5a overexpression has been shown to inhibit ductal extension during development, and to reduce the growth rate of certain tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Roarty1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Roarty2">[47]</xref>. However, due to the multiplicity of non-canonical signaling pathways that Wnt5a may activate depending on the context, it is essential to test its functional consequences empirically in individual assays.</p>
<p>To elucidate the effects of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling on stem cell properties of mouse mammary epithelium, here we test the consequence of altered Wnt signaling activity on mammosphere cultures, specifically quantifying the number of secondary mammosphere-forming units (MFUs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Dontu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Liao1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Dontu2">[48]</xref>. To include all potential stem cells, including those that may not express the cell surface markers previously used for enrichment, we used unsorted populations of mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Shackleton1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Stingl1">[4]</xref>. Contrasting the ability of Wnt5a to antagonize canonical Wnt signaling in other systems, we observed that both Wnt3a and Wnt5a promoted mammosphere formation through distinct signaling pathways. Thus both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling have independent abilities to promote stem cell capacity.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Mammospheres culture methods were adapted from Dontu <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Dontu1">[12]</xref>. Number 3, 4, 8, and 9 mammary glands were resected from adult mice between 3 and 9 months of age, from a FVB/NJ background. Glands were mechanically minced with a razor blade and digested at 37°C with collagenase (≥250 units/ml) in DMEM/F12 medium for 3 hours with vortexing and pipetting every 30 minutes. The digested tissue was centrifuged at 650×g for 5 minutes. The floating fat layer was removed by aspiration, and the tissue homogenate was digested in 1 mg/ml dispase in DMEM/F12 media with constant pipetting for 3 minutes to generate a single cell suspension. This was washed twice in “mammosphere medium” (DMEM/F12, 20 ng/ml bFGF, 20 ng/ml EGF, 4 µg/ml Heparin, B-27 Supplement, and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin antibiotic solution) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Dontu1">[12]</xref> and resuspended in that medium. Remaining clumps of cells were removed by filtration through a 40 µM cell strainer. The cell suspension was enriched for epithelial cells using an Easy-Sep mouse mammary epithelial cell enrichment kit (Stem Cell Technologies) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were resuspended in mammosphere medium and plated into 96 well low adherence plates (Corning Costar). Primary mammosphere cultures were fed once by addition of fresh mammosphere medium and the pooled cultures harvested by mild centrifugation and resuspension for assays of secondary sphere formation as described below.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Secondary mammosphere assay</title>
<p>Primary mammosphere cultures were disassociated with trypsin for 30 minutes in the presence of a vital cell labeling dye, (Di-I, or Cell Tracker Red, Invitrogen). Cell suspensions were filtered through a 40 µM cell strainer and then diluted in mammosphere medium with 1% methylcellulose to limit cell aggregation, and 10 nM dexamethasone to maintain transcription from the MMTV promoter. Cells were plated in 96-well low adherence plates using 24 wells per treatment, and were scored for mammosphere formation after one week of growth. In all secondary mammosphere assays, cells were plated at 1000 cells per well except in lentiviral shRNA knockdown experiments, in which they were plated at 2000 cells per well. All exogenous treatments were given as a single dose to the dissociated cells at the time of secondary assay plating. Mammospheres were defined as colonies in methylcellulose suspension culture that contained 10 or more cells visible under phase contrast, of which fewer than 50% still retained the cell tracking dye, consistent with the dye being diluted out upon successive cell divisions.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>Secondary mammosphere cultures were harvested and washed with PBS. Mammospheres were fixed and permeabilized with a 1∶1 acetone:methanol fixation solution for 30 minutes at −20°C, and PBS was used to rehydrate the mammospheres for 10 minutes at room temperature. Non-specific antibody binding was blocked with a 3% BSA/PBS solution for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies to cytokeratin 8 (K8; Troma I antibody, developmental studies hybridoma bank, University of Iowa), and cytokeratin 14 (K14; Abcam, catalog #7800), both at a 1∶200 dilution in 3% BSA/PBS, were applied overnight at 4°C. Mammospheres were then washed twice in PBS. Cells were incubated in a 1∶1000 dilution of Alexafluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life technologies) in 3% BSA/PBS for 4 hours. Cells were washed twice with PBS and mounted in Vectashield mounting media (Vector laboratories) including 0.1 µg/ml DAPI.</p>

<title>Mammosphere assay statistical analysis</title>
<p>Numbers of mammospheres reported are the mean of 24 wells per treatment from representative experiments.

<title>Mammosphere samples for qRT-PCR</title>
<p>Mammospheres were prepared as for secondary mammosphere assays, except cells were plated in 6-well low adherence plates.

Quantitech primers (Qiagen) were used with SYBR-Green mastermix (Quanta) for quantitative PCR using an MJ Opticon2 system (BioRad) according to manufacturer's instructions.</p>

<title>Viral infection</title>
<p>To infect mammosphere cultures with lentivirus, primary mammospheres were disassociated as for secondary mammosphere assays. Before plating, single cell suspensions in DMEM/F12 media were mixed with lentiviral particles in PBS at a multiplicity of infection of greater than 5∶1, plus a 1∶200 dilution of Transdux reagent (System Biosciences) for 30 minutes at 37°C. After infection, the cell suspension was plated as for secondary sphere assays. The 7TGC lentiviral reporter vector was obtained from Addgene (Plasmid#24304) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Fuerer1">[49]</xref>. Lentiviral vectors for knockdown of <italic>Ror2</italic> mRNA were obtained from Dr. T. Stappenbeck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Miyoshi1">[50]</xref>.

<title>MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> transgenic mammospheres exhibit similar properties to those from wild-type mice</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of Wnt-induced signaling in mouse mammary stem cells, we employed <italic>ex vivo</italic> mammosphere cultures derived from primary mouse mammary epithelium. Dissociated epithelial cells were obtained from wild-type mice and from MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> transgenic animals. Such mammosphere cultures provide an assay system for stem cell-initiated sphere growth, independent of previously identified stem cell enrichment markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Dontu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Liao1">[13]</xref>. Single cell suspensions being assayed for mammosphere formation were labeled with the lipid-soluble vital dye Di-I in order to track cell division. The majority of cells in all resultant secondary mammospheres exhibited low, or undetectable, fluorescence, the tracking dye having been diluted through multiple cell divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101800-g001">Figure 1A–D</xref>). In contrast, we observed bright fluorescence in one to two cells per mammosphere, suggesting that individual mammosphere forming cells can divide asymmetrically so as to retain the cell tracking dye in one daughter cell, while the majority of cells within each sphere are derived by serial proliferation. The lineage-specific markers Cytokeratin 8 (K8) and Cytokeratin 14 (K14) were used to identify luminal and basal mammary cells, respectively, in wild-type and MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> derived mammospheres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Dontu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Mani1">[52]</xref>. For both genotypes, all mammospheres contained a mixture of cells expressing both K8 and K14, cells expressing K14 alone, and marker-negative cells. Most mammospheres also contained cells that expressed K8 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101800-g001">Figure 1E–N</xref>). This indicates that MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> and wild-type mammospheres have similar capacity to produce progeny cells expressing differentiation markers during mammosphere growth <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, wild-type and MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> mammospheres exhibited similar morphology in both shape and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101800-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To confirm the expected self-renewal capacity of cells with mammosphere forming ability in these cultures, the number of mammosphere-forming units (MFUs) was measured at sequential passages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101800.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

To examine the consequences of canonical Wnt signaling in mammosphere assays, we measured the numbers of secondary MFUs in wild-type and MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> cultures and observed a significantly larger number of MFUs per 1000 cells in MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> cultures compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101800-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

<p>The elevated number of MFUs in MMTV-<italic>Wnt1 ex vivo</italic> cultures might depend on a continuous Wnt1 signal, or Wnt1 signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> at an earlier stage might induce a change in cell fate such that mammosphere-forming capacity is permanently altered, irrespective of continued Wnt signaling. To distinguish between these possibilities, we treated dissociated primary mammosphere cells with Dkk1, a specific antagonist of Wnt binding to Lrp5/6, in order to block Wnt1 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Semnov1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Mao1">[60]</xref>. The addition of Dkk1 to MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> cultures reduced their sphere forming capacity to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101800-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The effect of Wnt1 expression was thus reversible upon blockade of receptors for the canonical Wnt pathway, implying that a continued elevated level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for the increase in MFU numbers observed in MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> cultures.</p>
<p>We next tested whether acute stimulation of canonical Wnt signaling could substitute for the long term elevated canonical Wnt signaling resulting from the MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> transgene. Disassociated mammospheres were therefore treated with a single dose of recombinant Wnt3a, a Wnt protein that is functionally interchangeable with Wnt1 in canonical signaling assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Zeng1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Baljinnyam1">[61]</xref>. A single application of Wnt protein was sufficient to induce a two-fold increase in MFUs in wild-type cultures, as assayed by secondary sphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101800-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We also found that addition of Wnt3a to MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> cultures further increased the MFU numbers above the levels observed in MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> cultures or wild-type cultures treated with Wnt3a. As expected, the elevation of MFU numbers induced by Wnt3a was impaired by pre-treatment of cells with Dkk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101800-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, short term stimulation with Wnt3a phenocopies the effects of an MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> transgene in mammosphere cultures.</p>

To ensure that Wnt5a did not stimulate β-catenin/TCF activity independently of Lrp5/6, we infected secondary mammosphere cultures with a lentivirus (7TGC) that constitutively expresses mCherry, and expresses Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) only in response to β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Fuerer1">[49]</xref>.

In a complementary experiment we used iCRT3, a small molecule inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling which specifically blocks the interaction between β-catenin and TCF/LEF proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Gonsalves1">[51]</xref>.

Both iCRT3 and JNK inhibitor treatment inhibited mammosphere formation irrespective of exogenous ligands. These results demonstrate a requirement for JNK activity in mediating the effects of Wnt5a, but not Wnt3a, on mammosphere formation. Conversely, they suggest that the increase in MFU numbers mediated by Wnt3a requires the interaction of β-catenin and TCF/LEF, while Wnt5a acts independently of β-catenin-mediated transcription. Additionally mammosphere formation may be dependent upon a basal level of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have examined the effects of Wnt signals on secondary mammosphere formation, an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay that reflects mammary stem cell activity. Using <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultures from both wild-type and MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> transgenic mice, we observed that canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling stimulates mammosphere formation by primary mouse mammary epithelial cells. This is evident from comparing mammosphere formation by MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> and wild-type <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultures, and from the effect of recombinant Wnt3a on wild-type cells. We also observed that treatment with Wnt5a caused a similar increase in mammosphere formation, although it did not stimulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Instead, the effects of Wnt5a were mediated via a non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway acting via the receptor Ror2 and dependent on activity of the kinase JNK. Our results indicate that both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signals act independently to promote the stem cell properties required for mammosphere formation.</p>
<p>Previous studies of the effects of canonical Wnt signaling on mouse mammary epithelial stem cells, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, have focused on the sub-population of cells with the immunophenotype CD24<sup>+</sup> CD29<sup>hi</sup>, which are enriched for cells capable of mammary gland repopulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Shackleton1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Zeng1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Cho1">[75]</xref>. Wnt3a promotes the self-renewal of such cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and their abundance <italic>in vivo</italic> is elevated in MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Shackleton1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Zeng1">[35]</xref>. The present studies constitute a complementary approach in focusing on the mammosphere-forming capacity of mammary stem cells independently of specific cell surface markers. We found that a single dose of Wnt3a protein applied to dissociated cells was sufficient to increase secondary mammosphere formation. Consistent with this, and with the results of Shackleton <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Shackleton1">[3]</xref>, mammary epithelium from MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> mice displayed a greater number of MFUs <italic>in vitro</italic> than equivalent cultures from wild-type mice. This effect was blocked by addition of Dkk1 to the <italic>Wnt1</italic> transgenic cultures. This indicates that elevated canonical Wnt signaling is actively required during <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture in order to produce increased numbers of MFUs, rather than it arising from a permanent change in cell fate mediated by the <italic>Wnt1</italic> transgene during early mammary development. The immediate mammary phenotype of MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> mice is precocious and permanent lobuloalveolar hyperplasia, which imparts significant risk of progression to carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Tsukamoto1">[34]</xref>. If the hyperplasia is a consequence of increased numbers of stem-like cells, our data suggest that this would be reversible upon blockade of canonical Wnt signaling. Moreover a continuing effect of canonical Wnt signaling acting on tumor stem cells might account for the suppression of tumor growth in MMTV-<italic>Wnt1</italic> transgenic mice when the Wnt1 signal is antagonized after progression to carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Ettenberg1">[76]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Gunther1">[78]</xref>.</p>
<p>While elevated levels of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling are clearly associated with promoting hyperplasia and tumorigenesis in the mammary gland, both in mice and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Brennan1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Howe1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-VanCamp1">[25]</xref>, the effects of non-canonical Wnt signaling, e.g. as elicited by Wnt5a, have generally been linked to inhibitory effects. In human breast cancer, for example, loss of Wnt5a expression correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting that the gene acts as a tumor suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Jonsson1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Dejmek1">[80]</xref>. Moreover, Wnt5a protein can inhibit ductal proliferation in the mouse mammary gland, loss of <italic>Wnt5a</italic> confers a more aggressive mammary tumor phenotype, and there is evidence that Wnt5a can antagonize the intracellular pathway of canonical Wnt signaling in several settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-VanCamp1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Roarty1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Roarty2">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Mikels1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Topol1">[65]</xref>. Given this background, we were surprised to observe a significant increase in MFU numbers upon treatment with Wnt5a in mammosphere assays, an effect comparable to that of Wnt1 or Wnt3a which each stimulate the canonical Wnt pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Shimizu1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Mikels1">[62]</xref>. Nevertheless our results are consistent with those of Scheel <italic>et al</italic>. (2011), who observed that treatment of human breast epithelial cells with Wnt5a, in conjunction with activation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ pathways, enhanced the efficiency of mammosphere formation as well inducing the expression of EMT markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Scheel1">[81]</xref>. In addition, it has been shown that Wnt5a promotes the self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that its positive effect on mammospheres is not unique to breast tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Yeh1">[82]</xref>. Given the numerous distinct signaling pathways and receptors through which Wnt5a may act <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Semenov1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-VanAmerongen2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Niehrs1">[83]</xref>, the positive effects on mammosphere formation observed in our study can perhaps be reconciled with the growth suppressive effects of Wnt5a signaling in mammary tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Roarty1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Roarty2">[47]</xref> by invoking distinct signaling responses to Wnt5a in stem cells versus committed progenitors.</p>
<p>Although Wnt5a typically signals via β-catenin-independent mechanisms, there are special circumstances in which it has been found to activate the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Mikels1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-He1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-VanAmerongen4">[84]</xref>. This was not the case in our experiments, however, since Wnt5a treatment of mammospheres failed to activate a transcriptional reporter of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and the positive effect of Wnt5a was not blocked by either the Lrp5/6 antagonist Dkk1 or the β-Catenin/TCF inhibitor iCRT3. Instead, we provide evidence that stimulation of mammosphere formation by Wnt5a depends on <italic>Ror2</italic>, a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds Wnt5a and transduces a non-canonical Wnt signal that includes activation of JNK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Oishi1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Mikels1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Nomachi1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Niehrs1">[83]</xref>. Consistent with <italic>Ror2</italic> involvement, we found that Wnt5a-induced mammosphere formation was abolished by inhibition of JNK. We conclude that while Wnt3a promotes mammosphere formation via canonical Wnt signaling, Wnt5a does so by a non-canonical mechanism. Moreover, our data particularly implicate a <italic>Ror2</italic>-JNK pathway among the numerous other pathways that have been ascribed to non-canonical Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Semenov1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Niehrs1">[83]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-VanAmerongen4">[84]</xref>.</p>
<p>It remains to be determined whether the independent and additive effects of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling on mammosphere formation are caused by both signals operating on the same population of mammosphere-forming cells, or whether they act on distinct target populations. Recent studies aimed at identifying mouse mammary stem cells by lineage tracing <italic>in vivo</italic> have yielded data that may be inconsistent with those from classical mammary reconstitution assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-DeVisser1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Rios1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Plaks1">[85]</xref>. Collectively these reports suggest that the capacity to act as multipotent stem cells may reside in several distinct cell types in the developing mammary gland and that they may be activated under different circumstances in response to hormonal signals, pregnancy, tissue damage, or other forms of stress. Thus, the stem cell phenotype may be subject to considerable plasticity in response to extrinsic factors such as Wnts and other putative stem cell niche components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Alexander1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101800-Marjanovic1">[87]</xref>. Against the growing complexity of mammary stem cell analysis <italic>in vivo</italic>, mammosphere assays provide a promising system for dissecting the responses of individual self-renewing cells to defined factors <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
