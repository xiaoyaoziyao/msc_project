<p>Mammalian gene expression patterns, and their variability across populations of cells, are regulated by factors specific to each gene in concert with its surrounding cellular and genomic environment. Lentiviruses such as HIV integrate their genomes into semi-random genomic locations in the cells they infect, and the resulting viral gene expression provides a natural system to dissect the contributions of genomic environment to transcriptional regulation. Previously, we showed that expression heterogeneity and its modulation by specific host factors at HIV integration sites are key determinants of infected-cell fate and a possible source of latent infections. Here, we assess the integration context dependence of expression heterogeneity from diverse single integrations of a HIV-promoter/GFP-reporter cassette in Jurkat T-cells. Systematically fitting a stochastic model of gene expression to our data reveals an underlying transcriptional dynamic, by which multiple transcripts are produced during short, infrequent bursts, that quantitatively accounts for the wide, highly skewed protein expression distributions observed in each of our clonal cell populations. Interestingly, we find that the size of transcriptional bursts is the primary systematic covariate over integration sites, varying from a few to tens of transcripts across integration sites, and correlating well with mean expression. In contrast, burst frequencies are scattered about a typical value of several per cell-division time and demonstrate little correlation with the clonal means. This pattern of modulation generates consistently noisy distributions over the sampled integration positions, with large expression variability relative to the mean maintained even for the most productive integrations, and could contribute to specifying heterogeneous, integration-site-dependent viral production patterns in HIV-infected cells. Genomic environment thus emerges as a significant control parameter for gene expression variation that may contribute to structuring mammalian genomes, as well as be exploited for survival by integrating viruses.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cellular gene expression is a fundamentally stochastic process due to the intrinsic randomness of the underlying biochemical reactions involved. The resulting stochastically generated expression heterogeneities have important biological consequences and also encode information about the underlying dynamics that generate them. A fundamental goal of transcriptional biology is to understand the quantitative regulation of gene-expression dynamics, which in eukaryotes depends on factors specific to each gene in concert with its surrounding cellular and genomic environment. We investigated the regulatory effects of variable genomic environments by quantitatively measuring expression heterogeneity from diverse single genomic integrations of the HIV promoter in cultured cells. Systematically fitting a model of stochastic gene expression to our measurements reveals transcript production in bursts as the underlying dynamic that accounts for the large heterogeneities observed within single-integration clonal cell populations, with the size of transcriptional bursts as the primary feature that varies over genomic integrations. Our findings implicate genomic environment as an important quantitative control parameter that eukaryotic cells might use to shape gene-expression patterns, and that lentviruses such as HIV, whose genomes are semi-randomly integrated into the genomes of the host cells they infect, may exploit to sample diverse and heterogeneous expression patterns that evade treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The life cycle dynamics of HIV-1 within a host are shaped by numerous apparently stochastic processes, from the statistics of immune cell infection in humans, to mutation during reverse transcription, semi-random integration of the proviral DNA into the host-cell chromosome, and stochastic viral gene expression thereafter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Tuckwell1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Williams1">[7]</xref>. We and others have experimentally shown that expression from the HIV-1 promoter is indeed stochastic and shaped by host factors at the viral integration site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Weinberger1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Weinberger2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Jordan1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Burnett1">[10]</xref>, and we have argued as well that the resultant expression heterogeneities are important in the genesis of viral latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Weinberger1">[4]</xref>, a ubiquitous feature of infection that currently confounds our ability to cure HIV in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Williams1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Strain1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Lassen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Chun1">[13]</xref>. Gaining a deeper understanding of the factors that influence cell-cell variability in viral gene expression may thus shed light on how to ameliorate the effects of latency, and more generally on the processes that affect the expression of any gene.</p>
<p>The semi-random integration of HIV-1 into the host genome provides a particularly ideal opportunity to dissect the relative contribution of genomic environment as a fundamental element of expression regulation that may contribute importantly to expression dynamics and heterogeneities in eukaryotes. It is now well established that HIV-1 integration is biased towards actively transcribed chromosomal locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Wang1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Lewinski1">[14]</xref>, and it has been demonstrated that mean expression levels from model HIV-1 viruses correlate with specific epigenetic features at their integrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Jordan1">[9]</xref> and of their surrounding genomic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Wang1">[3]</xref>. Prior studies in other systems focused on how the population average expression of genetic constructs depends on integration context, and have found correlations with the expression levels of surrounding genes and with the local 3-D chromatin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Gierman1">[15]</xref>, as well as with DNA methylation, nucleolar association, and DNA diffusional mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Rosin1">[16]</xref>. Importantly, these studies inform us about the features of genomic environment that might affect mean expression levels. However, the effects of genomic environment, or integration site, on stochastic expression and heterogeneity have not yet been explored.</p>
<p>The discrete and stochastic nature of gene expression has been appreciated for some time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Delbruck1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Spudich1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Ko1">[19]</xref>, and it has become increasingly recognized that the resulting expression variability may significantly impact diverse biological functions, shaping the outcomes of cellular decisions, being exploited as a tool for survival in changing environments, and often inducing qualitatively different behaviors than would be predicted from a deterministic understanding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Samoilov1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Longo1">[26]</xref>. Theoretical and computational analyses have explored the relative contributions of key processes to heterogeneity in gene expression, including open-complex formation, transcriptional elongation, translation, post-transcriptional and translational processing/modification, as well as chromatin regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-McAdams1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Ozbudak1">[32]</xref>. Importantly for this study, the latter, an integral element of epigenetic control over gene expression, yields potentially slow and probabilistic dynamics that have been postulated as a significant source of expression heterogeneity in eukaryotes. In parallel with these theoretical studies, experimental approaches have been developed to characterize expression noise arising both ‘intrinsically’ from the biochemical processes directly involved in the expression of any individual gene, as well as ‘extrinsically’ from variability in other cellular processes that more homogeneously affect the expression dynamics of groups of genes simultaneously, such as cell cycle or concentration fluctuations of upstream transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Volfson1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Tsimring1">[37]</xref>. Interestingly, genome-scale measurements of expression heterogeneity demonstrate correlations with gene functional class, implying that perhaps noise is a “selected” feature of a gene's expression pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Newman1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Jothi1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent complexity of cellular transcriptional regulation, for many genes across a broad range of cell types, the patterns of cell-to-cell expression variability within isogenic populations are remarkably well described by simple stochastic models that represent the gene – including the associated genomic environment, chromatin structure, transcriptional regulators, and transcriptional machinery – as existing in a small number of discrete configurations, or states, with expression heterogeneities depending on probabilistic transitions between states and on probabilistic transcript and protein production and degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-McAdams1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Kaern1">[44]</xref>. These models are often necessarily abstract, yet they parsimoniously capture many essential features of transcriptional biology. Model fits to clonal single-cell experimental data, primarily in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> for eukaryotic studies, has allowed the inference of underlying gene-state and transcriptional dynamics that largely account for observed expression heterogeneities in a number of instances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-BarEven1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Blake1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Cohen1">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>A wide range of transcriptional dynamics have been revealed by such analyses, from continuous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Newman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Zenklusen1">[48]</xref>, to ‘pulsatile’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Blake1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raser1">[47]</xref>, to ‘bursty’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raj1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Zenklusen1">[48]</xref>. These diverse dynamics are effectively characterized by the frequency of gene-activation events, their duration, and the number of transcripts produced during each event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Pedraza1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Dobrzynski1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Zenklusen1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raj2">[50]</xref>, and contrasting results have emerged concerning the relative contributions of cellular regulation of each of these quantities to specifying the expression pattern of any given gene. For example, several pioneering studies, of single, targeted integrations of inducible, synthetic constructs, in yeast have suggested that the concentration of inducer largely controls the frequency of gene-activation events rather than the number of transcripts produced by each event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Blake1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raser1">[47]</xref>. A subsequent study in yeast – which considered three targeted integrations of similar constructs into 1) adjacent locations on a single chromosome, 2) homologous locations on sister chromosomes, or 3) non-homologous chromosomal locations – similarly found that transcriptional activation frequency varied between locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Becskei1">[36]</xref>. Genome-scale studies of stochastic gene expression in yeast suggest as well that the primary feature of transcriptional dynamics that varies between genes, over a wide range of genes, is the frequency of transcriptional activation events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Newman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-BarEven1">[39]</xref>. In contrast, an elegant study in mammalian cells quantified expression heterogeneities – from a single, random integration of a Tet-inducible construct into one locus in the genome – by using fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) to directly visualize single transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raj1">[46]</xref>. The authors concluded that transcripts are produced in bursts, and that the typical number of transcripts produced during a burst (referred to as the ‘transcriptional burst size’), rather than the frequency of bursting, was the primary measure that varied with tetracycline induction level.</p>
<p>While the above studies have begun to characterize the dependence of gene-expression dynamics on a number of cellular inputs, a systematic, quantitative investigation of the contribution of genomic environment over a broad range of genomic integration positions remains to be conducted. Furthermore, the contrasting observations as to whether transcriptional activation frequency, transcriptional burst size, or some other feature of transcriptional dynamics represents the primary variable that cells modulate to control expression patterns in these diverse systems raise key questions of how important features of genetic, epigenetic, and regulatory architecture may differ in yeast and mammalian cells.</p>
<p>Here we explore the fundamental relationship between genomic environment and expression heterogeneity from a diverse set of semi-random single integrations of a model HIV-1-promoter/GFP-reporter construct in cultured Jurkat T-cells. Systematically and rigorously fitting a model of stochastic gene expression allows us to infer the underlying expression dynamics that account for the single-gene expression distributions that we measure from single-integration clonal populations. Our analysis reveals that transcript production in bursts accounts for the wide, highly skewed, expression profiles that we observe, and importantly that transcriptional burst size is the primary feature that varies across viral integrations. These results interestingly suggest that the virus samples a particularly ‘noisy’ range of possible expression profiles across cellular integrations, and open a number of important questions for further study. We propose several qualitative models that may explain this inferred variation of transcriptional dynamics with genomic environment and discuss the implications of our findings for HIV dynamics, and for cellular gene expression in general.</p>

<title>HIV-1 LTR distributions are wide and highly skewed</title>
<p>Although HIV-1 requires transactivation by the virally-encoded protein Tat to amplify its expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Brady1">[51]</xref>, the HIV-1 promoter still supports basal transcription in the absence of Tat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Jordan1">[9]</xref>, which occurs initially after viral infection but before significant viral protein is produced. The dynamics of this basal expression, and the associated expression heterogeneities that result, may play an important role in affecting the cellular ‘decision’ between lytic viral production and latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Weinberger1">[4]</xref>. To study heterogeneities in basal expression from the HIV promoter, we infected Jurkat T-cells, at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), with a model HIV-1 virus that contains the full-length LTR driving expression of a GFP reporter but no viral genes. Cells with single integrations were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and expanded into clonal populations. The resulting clonal GFP expression profiles were quantified by flow cytometry and smoothed for comparison to model distributions in the analysis that follows. Thirty-one such clones, with average florescence levels ranging over an order of magnitude, and expression profiles clearly distinguishable from a measured autofluorescence profile, were selected for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Integrations whose mean fluorescence was less than twice the autofluorescence mean were not included in our analysis.</p>

<p>The shape features of our experimental distributions (such as mean, variance, skewness, etc.) are diagnostic of the underlying expression dynamics that generate them – and of the regulatory role of various molecular ‘inputs’ such as integration position (as well as promoter structure and concentrations of transcription factors, which were the ‘inputs’ considered in several other elegant studies: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Newman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Blake1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raj1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raser1">[47]</xref>). For example, a simple model assuming transcript number fluctuations as the primary source of expression heterogeneity, with only the rate of constant transcript production varying with a given ‘input’, predicts a Poisson-like distribution shape variation whereby distribution variances (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> considered as a measure of distribution width and expression heterogeneity) vary proportionately to the mean (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Such a variation, illustrated by the lower dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> (‘Poisson’), has been observed over a large set of yeast promoters under multiple experimental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Newman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-BarEven1">[39]</xref>. Alternatively, a model in which distribution shape variations are effectively described by a simple scaling of single-cell fluorescent values by an ‘input-controlled’ constant value (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the probability of observing fluorescence <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for a normalized value of the ‘input-controlled’ parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) would predict distribution variances to vary in proportion to the mean <italic>squared</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> upper dashed line, ‘Scaling’). Such a shape variation might arise if heterogeneities are instead due primarily to probabilistic transitions between promoter configurations that specify different transcription rates, with only these transcription rates varying (proportionately) with the ‘input’ from one clonal distribution to the next. In contrast to these possibilities, we find that the trend in distribution-shape variation over our set of clonal populations is best described by a relationship where the distribution variance changes proportionately to the mean raised to the 1.7±0.2 power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, solid regression). This characteristic trend differs significantly from either of the above simple models (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.025), suggesting that neither is sufficient, and that integration-site variation may specify a more complex modulation of promoter and transcriptional dynamics in our system.</p>
<p>To visualize additional features of the expression distributions over the set of clones, we translated each to a common mean fluorescence, and correspondingly scaled its fluorescence values about that mean based on the variance regression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, revealing a ‘typical’ distribution shape that is wide and highly skewed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

<title>A two-state gene model of transcriptional bursting <italic>qualitatively</italic> captures characteristic HIV-LTR distribution shapes and variation over viral integrations</title>
<p>A simple stochastic model that captures a number of essential features of transcriptional biology, and that can reproduce a range of single-gene expression profiles, assumes that the promoter may exist in either an activated state (<italic>φ<sub>a</sub></italic>) that produces mRNA probabilistically at a fixed rate (<italic>κ<sub>t</sub><sup>+</sup></italic>), or repressed state (<italic>φ<sub>r</sub></italic>) that is unproductive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

<p>In the analysis that follows, we always consider steady-state model distributions, since longitudinal measurements over the course of a week on several clones indicate that distribution shapes are relatively stable over our time scale of interest (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s003">Fig. S3</xref> and  Sec.

Furthermore, we determine all rate constants relative to the transcript degradation rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, estimated to be approximately 0.2 h<sup>−1</sup>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s007">Text S1</xref> Sec.

<p>The qualitative expression regimes of the two-state gene model fundamentally depend on the relative values of the gene-state transition rate constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), with different dynamics corresponding to different potential underlying transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. ‘Fast’ gene-state dynamics (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, perhaps specified by fast binding and unbinding of transcription factors) approximate continuous transcription from a single fixed gene state and can generate relatively narrow Poisson-like expression profiles, which widen for ‘Intermediate’ dynamics (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). ‘Slow’ gene-state dynamics (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, due perhaps to slower changes in chromatin configuration) may generate multiple transcripts after each transition to a relatively stable active state, and the dynamics can be described as ‘pulsatile’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Blake1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raser1">[47]</xref>. Distributions become bimodal in the extreme case.</p>
<p>Another dynamic regime that has received considerable attention can be termed the transcriptional ‘bursting’ regime, in which the gene inactivation rate is fast (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and the transcription rate is sufficiently large (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> not small) that transcriptional bursts of average size <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are produced during short excursions of frequency <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to a relatively unstable active gene-state (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s007">Text S1</xref>, Sec.

Distributions in the ‘bursting’ regime are wide and highly skewed, in qualitative agreement with the ‘typical’ HIV-LTR distributions from our measurements (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">2B</xref>, solid curves), with both the protein and transcript distribution means and variances approximately demonstrating a relatively simple dependence on transcriptional burst size and frequency: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s007">Text S1</xref>, Secs. S.III – S.V). Indeed, by assuming a model solution in the ‘bursting’ regime, one can analytically calculate a unique transcriptional burst size and burst frequency that reproduce the mean and variance of each of our experimental distributions, with good <italic>qualitative</italic> agreement in distribution shape (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s007">Text S1</xref>, Secs. S.III and S.VI for further discussion). Furthermore, variation in transcriptional burst size and frequency, individually or in combination, can account for the range of distribution-shape variation discussed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, with the best agreement to our experimental observations occurring if burst size and burst frequency typically vary simultaneously, but with the dominant effect coming from burst-size variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Though the relatively slow time scale of protein degradation in our system (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) effectively ‘filters’ some of the dynamic information propagated from model transcript to protein distributions, we emphasize that the calculated protein distribution shapes still reflect the underlying transcript distribution shapes and demonstrate distinctive features in each expression regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Below, through careful analysis, we will make use of this observation, building on the qualitative analysis developed here, to quantitatively infer the underlying heterogeneity-generating gene-state and transcriptional dynamics within our system from measured protein expression distributions, and to determine quantitative bounds on our ability to distinguish between different dynamic regimes. Of considerable benefit for this analysis, cytometry-based protein measurements can be acquired rapidly (e.g. compared to microscopy-based transcript-counting measurements), allowing good resolution of the probability distributions that underlie the expression histograms collected over populations of cells, and enabling measurements on sufficient numbers of clones to identify trends in the variation of single-gene expression distributions over integration sites.</p>

<title>Bursting gene expression <italic>quantitatively</italic> accounts for HIV-1 LTR integration-clonal distributions</title>
<p>While the analysis above provides intuition as to the dynamics and regulation that may underlie our experimental observations of the HIV LTR, it is solely a qualitative assessment based on the assumption of ‘burstiness’ and comparisons to ‘stereotypical’ model distributions. In reality, model distributions vary continuously between regimes, and means and variances provide an incomplete characterization of the actual distribution shapes. Therefore, to better determine the degree to which transcriptional ‘bursting’ best accounts for our experimental distributions, and the degree to which it can be distinguished from other possible dynamic regimes, we used a systematic fitting routine to identify the best-fit combination of transcription rate and gene-state transition rates for each distribution. Transcript degradation, protein production, and protein degradation rates (<italic>κ<sub>t</sub></italic><sup>−</sup>, <italic>κ<sub>p</sub></italic><sup>+</sup>, and <italic>κ<sub>p</sub></italic><sup>−</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) were fixed at values that were separately measured.</p>
<p>An important indicator of the dynamic regime of our system is the average time that the promoter remains in the active configuration following a gene activation event, relative to the average life time of a transcript (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), specified by τ = <italic>κ<sub>t</sub><sup>−</sup></italic>/<italic>κ<sub>r</sub></italic>, which we refer to as the ‘active duration’ (τ). We therefore began by identifying best-fit sets of model parameters for each clone over a range of fixed values for τ. We arrived at a robust estimate of the range of parameters for which the model quantitatively accounts for our measured distributions by considering the ratio, <italic>Dev<sub>r</sub></italic>, of each best-fit deviation at a given τ, to a bootstrap-estimated 95% upper bound on the deviation expected due to uncertainty in our measurements, which served as a metric for identifying model fits whose quality was statistically comparable. Fits for which the values of <italic>Dev<sub>r</sub></italic> differ by less than 1 for a given clone were considered to be effectively indistinguishable, since their differences may be accounted for by uncertainty in our experimental data, and these fits were thus considered to identify a range of parameters for which the model gives a statistically comparable account. The work-flow for our analysis is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s006">Table S1</xref>; the definitions that we used to quantify fit deviations, as well as the error model used for our bootstrap error calculation, are discussed briefly in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, and in more depth, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s007">Text S1</xref>, Secs. S.I and S.VII, together with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s001">Fig. S1</xref>.</p>
<p>We find that the optimal agreement between model and experiment always occurs at short active-state durations (sample fits given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), with deviations increasing for larger values of τ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), past a distinguishability cut-off (where <italic>Dev<sub>r</sub></italic> has increased by 1) that effectively marks the resolution limit of our analysis, which we call <italic>τ<sub>Max</sub></italic> for each clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The value of <italic>τ<sub>Max</sub></italic> defines a range of active durations (bounded below by <italic>τ</italic> = 0), for which the quality of model fits for a given clone is comparable, and acts as a measure of how well our analysis can distinguish a ‘bursty’ underlying dynamic from other regime possibilities. Small values of <italic>τ<sub>Max</sub></italic> indicate model fits where short-lived gene activation events, which are a hallmark of transcript production in bursts, provide a significantly better account of our experimentally measured distributions than a less noisy dynamic (i.e. one specified by longer active durations). Because we do find that the best model fits always occur at the shortest active durations (where the relative deviation <italic>Dev<sub>r</sub></italic> = <italic>Dev<sub>r</sub><sup>Opt</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), we conclude that a transcriptional dynamic in the ‘bursting’ regime does indeed always give the best <italic>quantitative</italic> account of our data, and we further note that larger predicted transcriptional bursts (generally associated with brighter clones) are correlated with better regime resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Finally, we note that our systematic distribution fitting procedure always resulted in improved fits over those obtained by only considering the first two distribution moments, with the improvement often statistically significant. Nevertheless, small systematic deviations remained, which are discussed further in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s002">Fig. S2</xref>.</p>

<title>Transcriptional burst size is the primary feature that varies across viral integrations</title>
<p>From the optimal fits above we identified best-fit transcriptional burst sizes and frequencies that specify the predicted transcriptional dynamics for each integration clone. Importantly, we find that the transcriptional burst size is the primary feature that varies over the set of genomic environments sampled by our 31 viral integrations, increasing from a few transcripts in very dim clones to tens of transcripts in very bright clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, with σ/μ = 3.5 for the distribution of log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>b</italic>)). Consistent with the qualitative analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, we find that transcriptional burst size varies approximately sub-linearly with expression-distribution mean (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.66). In contrast, the transcriptional burst frequencies inferred through our analysis are scattered about a characteristic value of one burst per several transcript degradation times, corresponding to several transcriptional bursts per cell-division time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In addition, these frequency values vary no more than several-fold (σ/μ = 2.2 for log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>κ<sub>a</sub></italic>)), and they demonstrate little correlation with distribution mean (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.2). These results were maintained, to within the accuracy of our analysis, when the scattering gate used to control for cell-size variability in our experimental distributions was decreased by a factor of 6 from the value that was found to be optimal for our analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s007">Text S1</xref>, Sec.

<p>Our findings thus indicate that burst-size variation makes the dominant contribution in controlling single-gene expression profiles and represents the primary feature of transcriptional dynamics whose modulation distinguishes typical bright from dim clones. Importantly, the trends noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g004">Fig. 4</xref> characterize the modulation of a ‘typical’ LTR integration by the sampled genomic environments. However, we must emphasize that the significant scatter of both the burst sizes and burst frequencies inferred for each individual clone about these ‘typical’ variations, as well as the possibility that a different trend may exist for very dim integrations (which were not considered in this study), suggest a potentially richer behavior that may still be uncovered through further study.</p>
<p>Another recent study has also considered a two state model to analyze expression variability from the HIV LTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Singh1">[56]</xref>. This study similarly suggests that transcript production occurs in bursts and that both burst size and frequency vary with LTR integration position, though the analysis is qualitative, based only on consideration of distribution moments. In contrast to our findings, they emphasize burst frequency modulation as structuring distribution-shape variation over integration positions, as well as in response to pharmacological perturbation, though the later finding is difficult to interpret, as a steady-state model is considered to analyze data that are clearly varying in time. Additional quantitative analysis, including systematic model fitting, would be necessary to characterize the relative contributions of burst-size and burst-frequency modulation in this study, and to determine whether its findings are consistent with our own.</p>

<title>Distinguishing modes of integration-site regulation of transcriptional dynamics</title>
<p>A correlate of our findings – that transcription in short bursts underlies basal expression heterogeneities from the HIV LTR in the absence of Tat – is that the active promoter configuration is short-lived. This implies that the promoter would be observed in the active configuration for only a small fraction of cells in a clonal population at any given time at steady state.

<p>Transcriptional burst size – defined by the ratio of the transcription rate to promoter-inactivation rate (or the product of transcription rate and the active duration <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) – can be modulated by two qualitatively difference ‘Modes’ of regulation. First, integration position could affect the dynamics of promoter inactivation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), reflecting integration-position effects on the stability of the active configuration, possibly due to direct effects of the surrounding chromatin configurations on the energetics of the active configuration and/or the stabilizing effects of regulatory factor recruitment by surrounding regions (Mode 1). Alternately, integration position could affect transcriptional productivity in the active state (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), which may also be affected by modulation of chromatin configuration and/or recruitment of regulatory factors by surrounding genomic regions (Mode 2). We have seen in our analysis to this point, that model fits of our cytometry data cannot separate the two constituent parameters that define transcriptional burst size, and therefore they cannot resolve these two possible ‘Modes’ of its regulation (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g003">Fig. 3</xref>; a similar parametric indeterminacy has been noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raj1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Zenklusen1">[48]</xref>). Furthermore, the potentially overlapping effects of many molecular regulatory mechanisms on transcriptional dynamics may make it difficult to define experiments that directly distinguish these ‘Modes’, and to decouple their regulatory contributions.</p>
<p>However, our analysis predicts that each ‘Mode’ of control leads to a distinct pattern of active-fraction variation over the set of integration clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, symbols): for Mode 1 the active-fraction varies proportionately to the clonal expression mean, whereas for Mode 2 the scatter in active fraction predicted over our set of integration clones reflects scatter in the predicted burst frequencies. We thus suggest that future experimental analysis of the active fraction may provide a means of distinguishing between these two key ‘Modes’ of integration-site modulation of gene expression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings, that expression from the HIV promoter is characterized by transcript production in bursts and that the site of viral integration primarily modulates transcriptional burst size, contribute to an emerging paradigm for transcriptional regulation that emphasizes the importance of stochastic/probabilistic dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Samoilov1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-McAdams1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raj2">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Ko2">[57]</xref>. In particular, the expression patterns that we observe from single integrations of the HIV promoter cannot be accounted for by transcription from a single, fixed state of promoter activation, which would involve a single transcription rate that specifies a comparatively narrow single-gene expression profile with little variation over a population of cells. Rather, our analysis predicts that the large expression heterogeneities observed in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) are shaped by probabilistic transitions between (at least) two distinct configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), with the promoter spending only the minority of time in the transcriptionally active configuration even for the most productive integrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g003">Figs. 3B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Furthermore, our analysis suggests that an essential component of the regulatory effect of genomic environment at the viral integration site is to modulate the <italic>dynamics</italic> of transitions between states of differing transcriptional activity, in addition to possible effects on the transcriptional activity of each state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g005">5</xref>). Of note, it is only by systematically fitting a quantitative model to our measurements that these underlying dynamics were revealed, as quantitative single-cell measurements of protein expression only provide an indirect measure, and it is only by applying our systematic analysis to observations across a diverse sampling of integration-modulated expression patterns that we succeeded in extracting a characteristic effect of integration position on transcriptional dynamics.</p>

<title>What features of the HIV-LTR determine ‘bursty’ transcription?</title>
<p>Transcript production in bursts is a particularly ‘noisy’ transcriptional dynamic that can generate significant cell-to-cell expression variability, which is reflected in wide and highly skewed single-gene expression distributions across clonal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">2B</xref>). In particular, the ‘typical’ distribution identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> demonstrates a coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean, or relative width), corresponding to 60% variability. This value is significantly larger than the values observed for most eukaryotic promoters in several large-scale studies (compare to data in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Newman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-BarEven1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Sigal1">[58]</xref>), and we anticipate that a number of features of the HIV promoter, some of which are common in mammalian promoters, may conspire to account for this ‘noisy’ expression pattern.</p>
<p>Similar to HIV expression shortly after infection, our system lacks the viral transcriptional activator Tat. In the absence of Tat the LTR has been observed to bind repressive factors that maintain a non-conducive chromatin configuration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Lewinski1">[14]</xref>, , and the likely greater stability of this ‘inactive’ configuration may limit the fraction of time that a transcriptionally ‘active’ configuration can be maintained. On the other hand, like many mammalian promoters, the HIV LTR contains multiple binding sites for repressing and activating elements (which still bind in the absence of Tat), several of which affect chromatin state and bind competitively and/or cooperatively. For example, the histone-acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 and the activating NF-κB component RelA are thought to bind their respective HIV-1 Sp1 and NF-κB sites cooperatively to activate transcription, and in competition with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) recruiting activity of SP1 and the p50/p50 homo-dimer that bind the same sites respectively to inhibit transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Burnett1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Jiang1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Perkins2">[66]</xref>. One may hypothesize that this competition could thus lead to an infrequent all-or-none binding of activating factors that directly remodel promoter-bound nucleosomes to establish a transcriptionally conducive chromatin configuration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Burnett1">[10]</xref>. In addition, the LTR includes a number of other cis-regulatory elements that bind transcriptional activators such as NFAT and AP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-ElKharroubi1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Giffin1">[68]</xref>, as well a TATA motif that contributes core transcriptional complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Garcia1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Berkhout1">[70]</xref>. These elements may enable more efficient recruitment, assembly, and stabilization of a productive transcription complex, with transcriptional reinitiation potentially yielding multiple transcripts from each gene-activation event (the presence of a TATA box has been linked to increased expression noise in other studies as well, see for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Choi1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raser1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Tirosh1">[71]</xref>). In combination, the above features may specify transcript production during short, infrequent bursts, consistent with the results of our analysis.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, a recent mammalian genome-wide mapping of HAT and HDAC association found them simultaneously bound to a large number of active promoters, suggesting that simultaneous regulation by competitive epigenetic regulators may be more common than previously thought <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Wang2">[72]</xref>. It is therefore possible that transcript production in bursts represents a more general feature of mammalian expression regulation, and it will be interesting to discover how properties of the HIV promoter shape its transcriptional dynamics, and whether similar promoter architectures specify ‘bursty’ dynamics for other genes.</p>

<title>Significance of burst-size variation over LTR genomic integrations</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that transcriptional burst size is a more ‘locally’ determined property, more sensitive to those features of genomic environment that vary significantly between integration sites, whereas transcriptional burst frequency is, by comparison, a more ‘globally’ determined feature, specified by interactions with the cellular environment that may be more promoter-specific but less significantly integration-site dependent. Burst frequency reflects the statistics of assembling the more active promoter configuration from an inactive one, and we might speculate that this transition depends in part on large-scale chromatin reorganization and dynamics that are coordinated globally across the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Cook1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Misteli1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Schneider1">[75]</xref>. Burst size, on the other hand, is a property of the transcriptionally ‘active’ configuration, and we may conjecture that some of the reorganization that accompanies its establishment also may provide opportunities for important ‘local’ features to exert their regulatory influences. For example, chromatin remodeling may expose new binding sites for transcriptional regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Kim1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Lam1">[76]</xref>, and the initiation of transcriptional activity could contribute to association with ‘nearby’ transcription factories where additional transcriptional regulators are localized, and where interactions with surrounding (and possibly distant) genomic regions may be enhanced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Cook1">[73]</xref>.</p>
<p>At a more basic level, a feature of transcriptional burst size that could more generally account for a greater sensitivity to genomic environment is its complimentary dependence on transcriptional productivity and the stability of the active promoter configuration. We had noted earlier that this complimentary dependence specifies two distinct ‘Modes’ by which surrounding genomic regions may differentially affect the resulting transcriptional dynamics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), both of which might be effected by recruitment of transcriptional regulators by surrounding genomic regions, epigenetic features of the surrounding regions, and the transcriptional activity of neighboring genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Gierman1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Schneider1">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Lenasi1">[77]</xref>. If we assume that a ‘typical’ more productive integration increases <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, τ, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> all proportionately (i.e. without assuming a weaker dependence for burst frequency), then the dual dependence of burst size would dictate that it vary as burst frequency squared (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and the scalings <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would result, which fall within the 95% confidence interval of our regression analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g004">Fig. 4</xref>. This possibility is consistent with our suggestion in the previous subsection that the architecture of the HIV LTR may effectively couple the control of gene activation and inactivation, and with the hypothesis that the chromatin regulators that may control these dynamics could also modulate the active-state transcription rate either directly or indirectly. Such a combined ‘Mode’ of modulation would specify an active-fraction variation intermediate between that predicted for the two pure ‘Modes’ of modulation considered in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, and might be used to distinguish it experimentally.</p>
<p>Burst-size variation with promoter induction level from a tetracycline-inducible construct at a single genomic position has been noted in another study using mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raj1">[46]</xref>, though this result contrasts with a number of yeast studies that have identified the frequency of gene-activation events as the primary feature that varies with genetic-construct induction level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Blake1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Raser1">[47]</xref>, over a single set of three targeted genomic loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Becskei1">[36]</xref>, and over a large set of endogenous promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Newman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-BarEven1">[39]</xref>. It thus remains to be determined whether our observation of burst-size variation represents a mode of transcriptional regulation particular to mammalian cells or to transcriptional control by genomic environment, or whether it is determined by any specific features of the HIV promoter that dictate a unique coupling to mammalian genomic environments that might be shared by other ‘bursty’ promoters and cell types. Future studies investigating greater numbers of genomic integrations, in our and other systems, that correlate expression variability with promoter and surrounding genomic sequences, may provide important answers to such questions.</p>

<title>Basal transcription as a determinant of HIV-infected cell fate</title>
<p>The observation that integration site primarily modulates transcriptional burst size from the HIV promoter implies that viral integrants sample a ‘noisy’ set of basal expression distributions by semi-randomly integrating in the genome. Specifically, relative distribution widths (i.e. the coefficient of variation) are approximately maintained and comparable between ‘dim’ and ‘bright’ integrations. This contrasts with the naive expectation that dimmer integrations should demonstrate greater relative expression heterogeneity due to larger relative fluctuations typically generated by smaller numbers of molecules, as would be the case if burst frequency were the primary covariate over viral integrations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), and as was found to be the case over a large sampling of yeast promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Newman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-BarEven1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>The basal expression patterns, and their associated expression noise, that were measured here reflect the range of expression dynamics that may be generated initially from an HIV infection after its semi-random integration into the host genome but prior to significant production of viral proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Weinberger1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Jordan1">[9]</xref>. Productive viral replication depends on subsequent production of the HIV protein Tat, which mediates expression transactivation by enhancing both transcript elongation from the LTR as well as the binding of other transcriptional activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Brady1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Brigati1">[78]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Dorr1">[81]</xref>. In an intact virus, this positive feedback would act to amplify the basal expression fluctuations observed here.</p>
<p>We anticipate that certain ranges of parameters representing integration-site dependent basal fluctuations in promoter activity may act to specify distinct infected-cell fates, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g006">Figure 6</xref> where the drawn region boundaries are hypothetical and the insets depict representative expression phenotypes that result when Tat is expressed from the HIV LTR in a minimal viral system that we had studied in earlier work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Weinberger1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Burnett1">[10]</xref>. Promoter integrations with smaller basal transcriptional burst sizes, and with frequencies that do not effectively couple one burst to the next, will never produce sufficient Tat for transactivation and may represent unproductive infections (<bold>Region I</bold>). On the other hand, promoter integrations specifying larger basal burst sizes and sufficient frequencies will quickly and stably transactivate after a small number of initial transcriptional bursts and may represent a productive infection (<bold>Region II</bold>). In contrast, those integrations with small to intermediate basal burst sizes and frequencies will only infrequently (stochastically) generate sufficient Tat for positive feedback activation. Moreover, the transactivated state may be subsequently destabilized by the infrequent occurrence of consecutive smaller and more widely spaced bursts, to generate a bimodal expression pattern (<bold>Region III</bold>). We have hypothesized that the dynamics of this phenotype, which include significant delays in switching between non-productive and productive expression phenotypes, may create a sufficient time window for the establishment of latent infections in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Weinberger1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Burnett1">[10]</xref>.

<title>Implications for investigations of genomic architectures in health and disease</title>
<p>While other studies have considered the effects of genomic environment on mean expression, we have analyzed its effects on expression heterogeneities. By applying an integrated computational and experimental approach, we have characterized the modulation of underlying transcriptional dynamics by genomic environment in human cells. Since classes of human promoters often share common enhancer and repressor motifs, it is possible that two such promoters at different genomic loci would demonstrate significantly different transcriptional dynamics, as we have observed from different integrations of a single promoter in our system. In this way, genomic architecture would provide an additional axis of expression regulation complementary to that specified by individual promoter sequence architectures, and promoter and genomic architectures might evolve in parallel to optimize their coupled contributions to transcriptional control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Wang2">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Janga1">[82]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Babu1">[85]</xref>.

<p>The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> represents a continuous-time discrete-state Markov process described by a chemical master equation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Gardiner1">[87]</xref>, which was solved using an in-house Matlab routine (The MathWorks, Inc.; code available upon request) for steady-state protein distributions, which were then convolved with a separately measured autoflorescence profile and converted to cytometer-based RFU (Relative Fluorescence Units) values for comparison with smoothed experimental distributions. Briefly, the master equation was truncated at large protein and transcript numbers to specify a finite system. A graded coarse-graining approach was applied, whereby neighboring states at higher transcript and/or protein number, where distributions admit a continuum approximation, were binned together (probabilities summed), and transition rates between binned states were approximated by interpolation to estimate probability fluxes at the boundaries. The coarse graining scheme reproduces the master equation at small transcript and protein numbers (where no coarse-graining is applied), and specifies a second-order approximation to the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation at large protein and transcript numbers. The resulting linear system was then integrated in time until an effectively stationary distribution was achieved by using a forward/backwards Euler method that alternates treating transcript and protein transitions implicitly or explicitly; this represents a fast and stable method, appropriate to stiff systems and multi-dimensional PDEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-PressWHT1">[88]</xref>. Marginal coarse-grained protein distributions were then calculated by summing calculated probabilities over transcript numbers and gene states, and the resulting distributions were interpolated. Solution accuracy was established by comparing the first three moments of the calculated distributions to their theoretical values (calculated analytically, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s007">Text S1</xref>, Sec. S.III), by varying the coarse graining and the time step for the integrator, and by comparing our solutions to those calculated using the Finite State Projection algorithm developed by Munsky and Khummash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000952-Munsky1">[89]</xref>, which allows a rigorous calculation of numerical error for finite times, for several test cases.

<title>Specifying non-fit model parameters</title>
<p>A number of model parameters quantify processes occurring at spatially separate locations from the integrated LTR. These were assumed to be the same for all integrations, and were specified separately. Methods developed independently from this study allowed us to calibrate relevant non-fit model parameters via comparison between the measured transcript distribution for a single clone, and the corresponding cytometry-based GFP distributions (Foley, et al. manuscript in preparation). A conversion factor between transcript number and RFU could be estimated from the measured ratio of means, as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 2.5 (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = measured cytometry-based RFU/transcript mean). By assuming transcriptional bursting, the ratio of transcript to protein degradation rates could be calculated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, yielding a value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for our measurement. These constitute the remaining quantities necessary to specify our model. While uncertainties in these quantities would affect the values inferred for model fit parameters, they would approximately affect the inferred fit parameters for each clone by the same scale factor, preserving inferred trends in parameter variation over the set of integration clones. These uncertainties were therefore not explicitly considered in our analysis (see Text S.1, Sec. S.VII for further discussion). Quantifying the dilution of a synthetic non-degraded fluorescence marker allowed us to estimate a cell-division rate of 0.05 h<sup>−1</sup>, which served as an effective protein degradation rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in our model, and thus specified <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; the absolute values of these degradation rates were not essential to specifying our model because steady-state distributions only depend on ratios of rate constants, and all rates were therefore scaled relative to the transcript degradation rate in our analysis. The relatively large protein numbers in our system dictate that fluctuations in protein production and degradation do not significantly influence distribution shapes, and as long as the ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was chosen to be a sufficiently large value, its specific value did not affect our analysis; we chose <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<title>Quantifying experimental uncertainties and model-fit discrimination</title>
<p>A bootstrap procedure was used to estimate a 95% upper-bound on the value of <italic>Dev</italic> for our processed experimental distributions (<italic>Dev<sub>data</sub></italic>) that included uncertainties due to the finite number of cells sampled and to specifying distributions at a single scattering measure. Other sources of uncertainty, such as cytometer PSF and distribution variability over time, were found not to significantly affect our determination of trends in model-parameter variations over the set of integration clones and were not included (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000952.s007">Text S1</xref>, Sec.

<p>Distribution processing. A) 2-d histogram of fluorescence and forward scatter (FSC) values, as measured by cytometry from 10<sup>4</sup> cells, for a sample clone. FSC is binned on a linear axis covering values between 1 and 1024 (10 bits) in arbitrary units (AU), and fluorescence values were log-binned over 4 orders of magnitude in relative florescence units (RFU). B) Smooth 2-d histograms were generated using a low-pass Fourier filter. The dashed line highlights correlation between fluorescence and FSC measures (we aim to account for this correlation in a distribution-processing procedure), and the green line is drawn at the mean FSC value, which specifies C) the ‘target’ GFP distribution at fixed FSC that we aim to extract by our processing procedure. D) Optimized gating. For each clone, a bootstrap approach was used to determine the optimal fraction of the FSC range to gate the data by (% Gate), which for each clone, minimizes the average over the set of re-sampled (synthetic) data of the deviation between each processed ‘synthetic’ data set and the ‘target’ distribution. The distribution deviation is defined as in the main text, as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the target distribution, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a processed synthetic distribution, both have been normalized as probabilities, and the sum is taken over cytometry bins. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> marks the calculated value of <italic>Dev</italic> for each clone, averaged over the set of synthetic data, and normalized by the optimal value. The box plot shows the dependence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the % Gate over the full set of clones that were fit, with box edges marking the inter-quartile range (iqr), whiskers marking 1.5*iqr ( = 2σ for a normal distribution), and ‘+’ marking outlier clones. Though the minimal (optimal) value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> often occurs for a gate slightly narrower than 60%, 60% is nearly optimal for all clones and was used to process our data for analysis and fitting. E) Alternate corrections. The average value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> over the set of clones (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), for each gate size, is calculated for the different corrections mentioned in the text. Subtracting linear correlation (‘<italic>lin</italic>’), or dividing the GFP by FSC values (‘<italic>Div</italic>’), makes little difference compared to making no further correction (‘<italic>Cor</italic>’) in reproducing the ‘target’ distribution. F) Fractional contribution of cell-size variability to expression heterogeneity. For each clone, after applying a 60% gate to select cells in the middle of the FSC range, the fraction of the variance of the GFP histogram that can be attributed to FSC variation (i.e. cell size variability), is calculated as the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value for a linear regression between FSC and GFP, equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000952.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where the brackets denote the population average. G, H) Gating for cell size has little effect on distribution noise and skew. Square gates in the FSC/SSC plane were defined by taking varying percentages of the total cells for each clonal population about the mean FSC and SSC values (Gate %). For each Gate %, the distribution coefficient of variation (CV = σ/μ, G), or skewness (‘skew’ = <italic>m<sub>3</sub></italic>/σ<sup>3</sup>, <italic>m<sub>3</sub></italic> = 3<sup>rd</sup> distribution central moment, H), was calculated for each clone, relative to the value measured at the 60% gate used in the main text. The mean value of this ratio over the set of integration clones is given by the red line at each Gate %, with the box marking the inter-quartile range (iqr) and the bar marking 1.5*iqr.</p>

The decrease in <italic>Dev<sub>r</sub></italic>, in going from the initial moment-based fits to systematic fits (δ<italic>Dev<sub>r</sub></italic>), is given, with values greater than 1 (marked by the dashed line) indicating clones whose fits were significantly improved by the systematic fitting procedure. C) Shape of the fit deviation. For each of our 31 distribution fits, the deviation between the model prediction and the smooth experimental data is plotted on the log-binned fluorescence axis on which our cytometry data was ginned. Each fit deviation is scaled so that its peak absolute value is equal to 1, and each was translated to a mean of 100 RFU to superimpose them. Deviations were only calculated for bins whose probability was greater than 2% of the distribution maximum. D) Fit-deviation significance. The data in C is re-plotted with the deviation at each bin normalized by the bootstrap estimated 95% upper bound on its expected value due to uncertainty in our data, as calculated in Sec. S.I. Absolute values greater than 1 (marked by the dashed lines) indicate bins for which the fit deviation is significant.</p>

<p>Distribution stability over time. A) Distribution variation over time is not correlated among clones. Six clones and a control with no plasmid that quantifies cellular autofluorescence (‘Aut’) were followed over 6 consecutive days by cytometry. Daily fluctuations in fluorescence mean (μ<sub>t</sub>, normalized by the value on the first day μ<sub>0</sub>, for each clone) are uncorrelated over the sampled populations for any pair of time points (P&gt;0.5). B) Distribution shape variations over time for any clone are approximated by a distribution scaling of all fluorescence by a constant value, such that the variance (σ<sup>2</sup>) changes approximately as the mean squared (μ<sup>2</sup>). For small deviations, this translates as the relative variance (σ<sub>t</sub><sup>2</sup> at each time, normalized by its value on the first day, σ<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> for each clone) changing in proportion to twice the change in mean, which is plotted as a reference line (‘Scaling’). C) Distribution variability over time for a sample clone approximately demonstrates a ‘scaling’ variation, as noted in B, which is equivalent to translating the distribution on the log-binned fluorescence axis on which the histogram is plotted. D) Distribution rescaling. For the sample clone in C, the fluorescence values each day are scaled by the ratio of the mean on the first day to the mean on that day. This rescaling leads to improved distribution stability over time. In particular, the distribution variability is now approximately within the experimental uncertainty due to our distribution-processing procedure. This suggests that distribution drift over time can be treated as a simple scaling of fluorescence values, perhaps due to metabolic drift, as discussed in the text. E, F) Best-fit model parameter variability over time is comparable to 95% confidence intervals calculated for sources of uncertainty considered in the main text. For each clone, the fitting procedure of the main text was applied to each processed experimental distribution, for each of the six days. Best-fit transcriptional burst frequencies (E) and burst sizes (F) for each clone, relative the value obtained for fitting the average of its distribution over time, is plotted against the log expression mean (averaged over the six days). Bars about the value of 1 represent 95% confidence intervals, as calculated in the main text, which do not include uncertainty due to distribution variability over time.</p>

<p>Gating for cell size does not significantly affect inferred trends in burst-parameter variation with integration position. A, B) The experimental distributions obtained by applying a 10% square gate in the FSC/SSC plane (as discussed in Sec. S.I.7) were fit following the procedure in the main text (‘narrow gate’), and the resulting best-fit model parameters compared to those obtained for each clone based on our optimized distribution processing procedure (‘optimal gate’,  = 60%), that were given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g004">Fig. 4</xref>. Bars represent 95% confidence intervals, as obtained in the main text.

<p>No significant correlation between transcriptional burst size and frequency for the HIV LTR. The best-fit transcriptional burst frequencies (<italic>κ<sub>a</sub></italic>), which were inferred for our system in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g004">Fig. 4</xref> of the main text, are plotted against the corresponding inferred transcriptional burst size (<italic>b</italic>) for each clone (*) in a log-log plot to investigate possible correlations. Diagonal lines (green) represent combinations of burst size and frequency that specify constant mean expression (μ ∝ <italic>κ<sub>a</sub> b</italic> in the bursting regime). The 95% confidence region calculated in the main text are ovals in the <italic>b</italic>×<italic>κ<sub>a</sub></italic> plane, and become deformed to rounded crescents in the log-log plot, represented by the closed curves about each combination of best-fit parameters (blue). Notice that in the region closest to the each best-fit parameter combination, the corresponding confidence boundary generally depicts less constrained variation in the direction that preserves expression mean (i.e. parallel to the drawn lines of constant mean). Linear regression reveals a slope of 0.17±0.3 (95% confidence), with an <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> value of 0.05, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.2. We thus conclude that significant correlations between burst size and frequency, that might affect the trends in these parameters with distribution mean that were analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000952-g004">Fig. 4</xref> of the main text, are not present in our system.</p>
