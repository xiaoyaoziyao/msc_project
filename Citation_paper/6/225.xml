        <p>The Wnt/β-catenin pathway controls cell proliferation, death and differentiation. Several families of extracellular proteins can antagonize Wnt/β-catenin signaling, including the decoy receptors known as secreted frizzled related proteins (SFRPs), which have a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) structurally similar to the extracellular Wnt-binding domain of the frizzled receptors. SFRPs inhibit Wnt signaling by sequestering Wnts through the CRD or by forming inactive complexes with the frizzled receptors. Other endogenous molecules carrying frizzled CRDs inhibit Wnt signaling, such as V3Nter, which is proteolytically derived from the cell surface component collagen XVIII and contains a biologically active frizzled domain (FZC18) inhibiting <italic>in vivo</italic> cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice. We recently showed that FZC18 expressing cells deliver short-range signals to neighboring cells, decreasing their proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Here, using low concentrations of soluble FZC18 and Wnt3a, we show that they physically interact in a cell-free system. In addition, soluble FZC18 binds the frizzled 1 and 8 receptors' CRDs, reducing cell sensitivity to Wnt3a. Conversely, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was partially rescued by the expression of full-length frizzled 1 and 8 receptors, but enhanced by the expression of a chimeric cell-membrane-tethered frizzled 8 CRD. Moreover, soluble, partially purified recombinant FZC18_CRD inhibited Wnt3a-induced β-catenin activation. Taken together, the data indicate that collagen XVIII-derived frizzled CRD shifts Wnt sensitivity of normal cells to a lower pitch and controls their growth.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Wnt/β-catenin pathway controls cell fate through regulation of cell proliferation and death, migration, differentiation and metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Cadigan1">[1]</xref>. Pathway activation involves interaction of Wnt ligands with cell surface Frizzled receptors and LRP5/6 co-receptors. This disrupts the <italic>Adenomatous polyposis coli</italic> (APC)-axin complex, thus halting proteasomal degradation of β-catenin, which is stabilized and interacts with T-cell factor (TCF) transcription factors, displacing repressors and recruiting activators of target gene expression.</p>
      <p>The bioavailability of Wnts at the cell surface is regulated by several families of extracellular proteins. Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans control Wnt diffusion, thus enhancing interaction of Wnt ligands with Frizzled receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Mikels1">[2]</xref>. Antagonists include members of the <italic>Dickkopf</italic> (DKK) family that block canonical signaling by binding to LRP5/6, thereby disrupting the Wnt-induced Frizzled-LRP5/6 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-MacDonald1">[3]</xref>. Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1) binds directly to Wnts, altering their ability to interact with the receptors. The extracellular decoy receptors known as <italic>secreted frizzled-related proteins</italic> (SFRPs) have a frizzled <italic>cysteine-rich domain</italic> (CRD) structurally similar to the extracellular Wnt-binding domain of the frizzled receptors. Frizzled CRDs contain 10 cysteines at conserved positions, which form a highly conserved 3D structure, bind Wnts and form homodimers or heterodimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Dann1">[4]</xref>. Thus, SFRPs can modulate Wnt signaling by sequestering Wnts through the CRD or by acting as dominant-negative inhibitors, forming inactive complexes with the frizzled receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Bovolenta1">[5]</xref>. In addition, engineered SFRP-like proteins such as the soluble CRD of the receptor Frizzled 8 bind Wnt3a and inhibit autocrine Wnt signaling and tumor growth in mice carrying teratomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-DeAlmeida1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to SFRPs, other endogenous molecules carrying frizzled CRDs inhibit Wnt signaling. Among them, V3Nter is a cell surface polypeptide that inhibits tumor growth and switches off the β-catenin target gene expression signature <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Quelard1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Lavergne1">[8]</xref>. V3Nter is proteolytically derived from the cell surface extracellular matrix component collagen XVIII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Quelard1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Elamaa1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Musso1">[10]</xref> and contains a biologically active frizzled domain (FZC18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Quelard1">[7]</xref>. The CRD in the FZC18 domain is highly conserved in frog, mouse and man, all 10 cysteines and the number and type of intervening amino-acids being fully conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Elamaa1">[9]</xref>. Indeed, we previously showed a 100% probability that the predicted 3D model of FZC18_CRD matches the 3D structure of mouse SFRP3 and FZD8 CRDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Quelard1">[7]</xref>. In human liver cancer, endogenous collagen XVIII is proteolyzed, releasing the FZC18 precursor V3Nter. We have shown that low FZC18 protein expression in liver cancer correlated with markers of high Wnt/β-catenin activity and <italic>vice versa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Quelard1">[7]</xref>.</p>

      <p>In this work, we show that low concentration soluble FZC18 interacts with Wnt3a and with the receptors FZD1 and FZD8 in a cell-free system. Consequently, FZC18 reduces cell sensitivity to Wnt3a and inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In line with these findings, FZC18 inhibitory effects were partially rescued by the expression of FZD1 and FZD8 receptors, but enhanced by expression of FZD8_CRD-GPI, a cell-membrane-tethered chimeric FZD8_CRD. Finally, we produced high-yield soluble recombinant human FZC18_CRD-Fc fusion protein, which inhibited Wnt3a-induced β-catenin activation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

        <p>Collection of conditioned media (CM) from parental L cells (control CM) and Wnt3a CM was performed as recommended by ATCC and by R. Nusse lab website. For other CM, HEK293 EBNA cells were seeded at 2.2×10<sup>6</sup> cells/10 mm dishes and transfected with either FZC18-myc/pCEP-PU, mFZD8_CRD-myc/pcDNA3, mFZD8_CRD-Fc/pRK5 or with the respective empty vectors and, 24 hr later, fresh media were replaced by DMEM (4.5 g/l glucose) without phenol red or FCS (Invitrogen). Conditioned media were collected 48 hr later, centrifuged at 450 <italic>g</italic> and filtered (0.2 µm). To obtain recombinant FZC18_CRD, conditioned media from hFZC18_CRD-Fc clones were screened for protein expression by ELISA and positive clones were confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-human IgG-Fc antibody. The positive clones were further adapted to CD OptiCHO medium supplemented with 8 mM L-Glutamine. hFZC18_CRD-Fc producing cells were seeded into spinner flasks at 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> with agitation at 80 rpm in humidified air for 10 days. The medium was collected, cleared by centrifugation, filtered (0.45 µm) and stored at 4°C until purification. The samples were loaded on a protein A column following equilibration with 20 mM sodium phosphate, 20 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.5. The column was washed with the same buffer until effluent absorbance returned to baseline. The bound proteins were eluted with 20 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 2.5 followed by rapid neutralization by adding 0.1 volume of 1 M Tris-hydrochloride, pH 9.0. The yield of the purified proteins was approximately 1∼5 mg/l and purity was over 40%, as estimated by sandwich ELISA using anti-Fc antibody (Abcam AB1927) for capture and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma A0170) for detection.

        <p>We produced zeocin-resistant mass cultures of 293T cells stably expressing FZC18 or empty vector. To avoid clonal variability, we expanded colonies showing different densities of FZC18 (+) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As FZC18 locates preferentially at the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Quelard1">[7]</xref>, cell permeabilization followed by immunocytochemistry allowed identification of all cells expressing the protein of interest, regardless of protein maturation. Thus, batch #1 showed a lower density of FZC18 (+) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and lower FZC18 expression by immunoblot than batch #4 and #5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

Simultaneous detection of N- and C-terminal epitopes in this fusion protein indicated preservation of FZC18 integrity in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and in the medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030601.s001">Figure S1C</xref>).

        <p>Incubation of vector and FZC18-expressing 293T cells with conditioned medium (CM) from L cells secreting soluble Wnt3a (Wnt3a CM) confirmed that FZC18 reduces Wnt3a-induced Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g003">Figure 3</xref>), β-catenin stabilization, cyclin D1 promoter activity and protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030601.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

To this end, FZC18-expressing and vector cells were transfected with increasing amounts of full-length FZD1 or FZD8 receptor cDNAs and incubated in the presence of Wnt3a CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g006">Figure 6, A and B</xref>). FZD1 and FZD8 receptor expression led to up-regulation of CRT in both vector and FZC18-expressing cells. Vector and FZC18 cells expressing FZD1 exhibited similar CRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, 100 ng of FZD8 cDNA was required to reach 50% of vector cells' maximal CRT in FZC18-expressing cells, whereas vector cells' maximal activity was obtained with 5 ng of FZD8 cDNA. Interestingly, although lower amounts of FZD1 (0.5 and 0.75 ng) or FZD8 (0.5 to 10 ng) cDNAs activated CRT in a dose-dependent manner, higher amounts of FZD1 (1 to 250 ng) or FZD8 (50 to 250 ng) cDNAs gradually reduced CRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g006">Figure 6, A and B</xref>). Although high doses of FZ receptor cDNA appeared non-specifically inhibitory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030601.s008">S8</xref>), mouse FZD1 and Drosophila FZ3 may behave as antagonists of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-RomanRoman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Sato1">[22]</xref>.

Within the 10 pg-100 ng range of transfected cDNA, FZD8_CRD-GPI and FZD8_CRD further reduced Wnt signaling in FZC18-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Under the same conditions, full-length FZD8 antagonized the effects of FZC18, increasing CRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), supporting the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g006">Figure 6B</xref>.

        <p>These results show an additive effect of FZC18 and either FZD8_CRD or FZD8_CRD-GPI, the dose-response curve outlining a higher efficacy of FZD8_CRD-GPI. Thus, Wnt/β-catenin signaling can be concomitantly downregulated by different Wnt-binding proteins. As FZD8_CRD is soluble, its cell surface bioavailability may thus be lower than that of FZD8_CRD-GPI, probably resulting in lower Wnt inhibitory activity.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these data underline the specificity of the Wnt inhibitory activity of FZC18. As FZD receptors rescued Wnt/β-catenin signaling, but FZD CRDs further enhanced the inhibitory effects of FZC18, these findings indicate that the effects of FZC18 may not result from endoplasmic reticulum toxicity through clogging of the secretion pathway with cysteine-rich proteins.</p>

            <p>(A) Schematic structure of V3Nter, V2Nter and FZC18 cDNAs. V3Nter and V2Nter correspond to the N-terminal noncollagenous domains of variants 3 and 2 of collagen XVIII, respectively. They share the <italic>DUF-959</italic> domain, a portion of the <italic>tsp-1</italic> (thrombospondin-1) domain and the <italic>V5</italic> tag. Only V3Nter contains the FZC18 domain. The FZC18 vector has a <italic>myc</italic> tag. Thick horizontal lines indicate the antibodies used. (B) FZC18 can homodimerize. FZC18-myc was cotransfected with V3Nter-V5 or V2Nter-V5 in HEK293-EBNA cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc and immunoblotted with anti-DUF-959 <italic>(top)</italic>.

CM from HEK293-EBNA cells secreting FZC18-myc was incubated with recombinant 100 ng/ml FZD1_CRD-Fc <italic>(upper panel)</italic> or with CM from HEK293-EBNA cells secreting FZD8_CRD-Fc <italic>(lower panel)</italic>. FZD1_CRD-Fc and FZD8_CRD-Fc were immunoprecipitated with protein G magnetic beads, electrophoresed and immunoblotted with anti-myc, anti-FZD1_CRD or anti-FZD8_CRD, as shown. <italic>Asterisks</italic> denote inputs or FZC18 cell lysate, as indicated.</p>

        <p>Next, we tested whether FZC18 could bind the CRDs of FZ receptors. To this end, we used soluble FZD1 or FZD8 CRDs fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Adding recombinant FZD1_CRD-Fc or FZD8_CRD-Fc CM to non-concentrated FZC18 CM and immunoprecipitating with protein G coated beads, followed by immunobloting with anti-myc antibody showed that FZC18 could bind FZD1 and FZD8 CRDs. Taken together, the results suggest a model whereby FZC18 could bind both Wnts and FZD CRDs, hampering access of Wnts to the FZD receptors, thus blocking Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in an SFRP-like mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030601-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The microenvironment impacts Wnt activity and regulates cell behavior through extracellular molecules that fine tune the response to Wnt stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Bovolenta1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Vermeulen1">[23]</xref>. Proteolysis in human tissues releases active FZC18 and tumors containing high levels of FZC18 show low β-catenin activation levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Quelard1">[7]</xref>. FZC18 behaves as an SFRP-like molecule inhibiting in vivo cell proliferation and tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Lavergne1">[8]</xref>. Although Wnt3a and FZC18 were shown to interact in a cell overexpression system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Quelard1">[7]</xref>, whether the interaction was still active in a cell-free system at physiological concentrations remained unknown. Here, we show that soluble FZC18 binds Wnt3a and the receptors FZD1 and FZD8, and reduces cell sensitivity to Wnt3a. FZC18 inhibitory effects are partially rescued by FZD1 and FZD8 receptors, but enhanced by FZD8_CRD-GPI, a cell-surface-tethered FZD8_CRD chimera. Altogether, the results suggest that FZC18 shifts the sensitivity of cells to Wnt stimuli to a lower pitch, slowing their growth rate.</p>
      <p>Although the concentration of soluble FZC18 in the conditioned medium was several fold lower than that of FZD8_CRD, a well-known partner of Wnt3a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-DeAlmeida1">[6]</xref>, Wnt3a was efficiently pulled down by FZC18. Accordingly, Wnts bind to FZD CRDs with affinities lower than 90 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Hsieh1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Wu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Wawrzak1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Carmon1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Carmon2">[20]</xref>. In the present report, the use of soluble FZC18 at very low concentrations and a Wnt3a concentration within the physiological range (2.7 nM) indicates that spurious interactions of highly concentrated cysteine-rich proteins are unlikely. In addition, we show that FZC18 binds FZD1 and FZD8 CRDs, implying that FZC18 could form nonfunctional complexes with the frizzled receptors, thus acting as a dominant negative inhibitor of Wnt signaling.</p>
      <p>The major technical hardship of this work was the low yield of soluble FZC18. Expression of FZC18 using different vectors and mammalian host cell systems, allowing either genomic DNA integration or high copy number episomal replication of target sequences yielded low amounts of soluble FZC18 (not shown). Similarly, generation of isogenic stable mammalian cell lines using Flp recombinase and optimal site-specific genomic recombination failed to increase the yield of soluble FZC18 (not shown). Since we demonstrated that the CRD of FZC18 can form homodimers, we hypothesized that homodimerization could increase yield of soluble protein and expressed human FZC18_CRD sequences in frame with the Fc fragment of IgG in CHO cells. This vector/host combination dramatically increased yield of soluble FZC18_CRD in the medium. Furthermore, partially purified recombinant hFZC18_CRD-Fc inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling induced by soluble Wnt3a, confirming that the Wnt inhibitory activity resides within the frizzled CRD of FZC18.</p>
      <p>Overexpression of either FZD1 or FZD8 receptors partially rescued Wnt signaling in FZC18-expressing cells. On the other hand, FZD8_CRD-GPI, which remains tethered to the cell surface, enhanced the inhibitory effect of FZC18 more efficiently than FZD8_CRD did, which freely diffuses into the medium. Therefore, competing CRDs may diminish sensitivity to Wnt ligands at the cell surface. Accordingly, recent evidence indicates that FZD receptors may be limiting partners in Wnt signal reception because decreased Wnt/Wg signaling resulting from ubiquitylation of FZD receptors can be rescued by FZD receptor overexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Mukai1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally, Wnt signaling outputs rely not only on ligand and receptor availability at the cell surface, but also on the microenvironment that can either enhance (such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Mikels1">[2]</xref> or blur (such as SFRPs, DKKs or FZC18) ligand/receptor interactions. In normal adult human tissues, FZC18 is released by stepwise proteolytic cleavage from a cell surface variant of collagen XVIII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Elamaa1">[9]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Quelard1">[7]</xref> which is expressed at low levels. Its expression is up-regulated in liver fibrosis and in small, well-differentiated tumors, but decreases in advanced human liver cancers. Indeed, low FZC18 immunostaining in liver cancers correlates with markers of high Wnt/β-catenin activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Quelard1">[7]</xref>. Since the release of biologically active FZC18 is controlled by so far unidentified proteases, it is possible that cell growth or tumor invasion facilitate the local release of FZC18, conveying negative feedback cues to control cell fate. Therefore, further work is necessary to determine if FZC18 works as a cell surface sensor of proteolysis.</p>
      <p>Ectopically expressed FZC18 blocks Wnt signaling in an SFRP-like fashion, inhibiting <italic>in vivo</italic> cell proliferation and tumor growth through paracrine signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030601-Lavergne1">[8]</xref>. However, further work will be necessary to know whether soluble FZC18 inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. The present work suggests that soluble FZC18 decreases cell sensitivity to Wnt signals by binding Wnt3a and the receptors Frizzled 1 and 8. Thus, the full repertoire of Wnt ligands and frizzled receptors that interact with FZC18 should be defined, as well as its possible interaction with other molecules of the extracellular matrix. In particular, FZC18 could signal through the non-canonical Wnt pathway to decrease cell proliferation. Comparison of binding affinities of FZC18 with soluble and, as yet unknown, extracellular-matrix-tethered ligands will help better understand the physiological role of this collagen-embedded frizzled CRD.</p>
