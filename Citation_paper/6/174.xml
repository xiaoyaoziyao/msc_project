<abstract>
<p>Expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) analysis is a powerful tool to study the biological mechanisms linking the genotype with gene expression. Such analyses can identify genomic locations where genotypic variants influence the expression of genes, both in close proximity to the variant (cis-eQTL), and on other chromosomes (trans-eQTL). Many traditional eQTL methods are based on a linear regression model. In this study, we propose a novel method by which to identify eQTL associations with information theory and machine learning approaches. Mutual Information (MI) is used to describe the association between genetic marker and gene expression. MI can detect both linear and non-linear associations. What’s more, it can capture the heterogeneity of the population. Advanced feature selection methods, Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) and Incremental Feature Selection (IFS), were applied to optimize the selection of the affected genes by the genetic marker. When we applied our method to a study of apoE-deficient mice, it was found that the cis-acting eQTLs are stronger than trans-acting eQTLs but there are more trans-acting eQTLs than cis-acting eQTLs. We compared our results (mRMR.eQTL) with R/qtl, and MatrixEQTL (modelLINEAR and modelANOVA). In female mice, 67.9% of mRMR.eQTL results can be confirmed by at least two other methods while only 14.4% of R/qtl result can be confirmed by at least two other methods. In male mice, 74.1% of mRMR.eQTL results can be confirmed by at least two other methods while only 18.2% of R/qtl result can be confirmed by at least two other methods. Our methods provide a new way to identify the association between genetic markers and gene expression. Our software is available from supporting information.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As a powerful tool to increase understanding of the biological mechanisms by integrating genetic marker data with gene expression data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Gilad1">[1]</xref>, the goal of expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) analysis is to identify genomic locations where genotype significantly affects gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Cookson1">[2]</xref>. This analysis was first applied to yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Brem1">[3]</xref> and then to mouse and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Schadt1">[4]</xref>. Many cis/trans loci associated with the expression level of hundreds of transcripts were identified. In cis-acting eQTLs, the SNPs are close to the affected gene; while in trans-acting eQTLs, the SNPs are far away from the affected gene. Usually, the trans-effects are weaker than the cis-effects, but the number of trans-effects is larger than the cis-effects in mouse and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Cookson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Schadt1">[4]</xref>. How close the SNP and the affected gene should be in cis-acting eQTLs is debatable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Cookson1">[2]</xref>. In this study, the SNPs that were within 5 Mb of the affected genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Smirnov1">[5]</xref> were termed cis-acting eQTLs.</p>
<p>Since eQTL is intended to assist in discovery of whether the genetic marker at a certain locus is correlated with the gene expression of a certain gene, the traditional eQTL methods are based on the linear regression of the gene expression with the genetic marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Michaelson1">[6]</xref>. The expression level of one gene is assumed to be the result of one or multiple genetic markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Zhang1">[7]</xref>. But on the other hand, we can also say that one genetic marker can affect one or multiple genes. The relationship between genetic marker and gene expression is mutual.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional statistical eQTL methods, here we propose an information theory based machine learning method to accomplish eQTL analysis. It is different from traditional statistical eQTL methods in the following ways:</p>
<p>First, the association between genetic marker and gene expression is measured with Mutual Information (MI), which can not only be used for both linear and non-linear dependencies, but can also capture the potential heterogeneity of the study population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Li1">[8]</xref>. As an ideal stochastic dependence measurement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Cover1">[9]</xref>, MI considers all types of dependencies, including linear relationships and monotonic dependencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Kojadinovic1">[10]</xref>. MI measures the mutual dependence between two variables <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Sun1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Shannon1">[13]</xref>. The MI between X and Y is defined as the marginal entropies of X minus the conditional entropies of X|Y. The marginal entropies of X measure the uncertainty of variable X. The conditional entropies of X|Y measure the uncertainty remaining about X after Y is given. Since MI is symmetric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Batina1">[14]</xref>, i.e., the MI of X and Y is the same as the MI of Y and X, the MI between X and Y equals the marginal entropies of Y minus the conditional entropies of Y|X as well.</p>
<p>Second, in this method, the status of the genetic marker is considered the class label and the expression levels of genes are considered features. The expression levels of genes are then used to predict the status of the genetic marker. The idea of predicting genotype from gene expression is originated from a series of reverse engineering works from gene expression to its genetic basis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Hertzberg1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Schadt2">[17]</xref>. The genes that one genetic marker can affect are determined by both the MI between the gene and the genetic marker, and the MI among genes. In other words, not only the relevance between the gene and the genetic marker, but also the redundancy among genes was considered. The relevance guarantees detection of the strong associations and the redundancy can filter the indirect associations. The affected genes are optimized with feature selection techniques: Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) and Incremental Feature Selection (IFS). The biological rationale of applying these feature selection method to eQTL study is that if a set of genes are highly co-expressed, they are very likely involved in the same biological process and have similar biological functions. The feature selection procedure will reduce the number of regulated genes but the representative ones will be selected. The biological functions of regulated genes by the SNP will be clearer.</p>
<p>Our methods provide a new way to identify the associated genetic marker - gene expression eQTL pairs with advanced information theory and optimize the detection of affected genes corresponding to genetic markers with feature selection and machine learning. We applied the method on a published eQTL mouse data set <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Bhasin1">[18]</xref> and simulated data set. On the published data set, our method identified more consensus eQTLs than traditional methods. On the simulated data set, the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) of our method is greater than traditional methods, such as R/qtl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Broman1">[19]</xref>, and MatrixEQTL (modelLINEAR and modelANOVA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Shabalin1">[20]</xref>.</p>

<p>The eQTL dataset we used were obtained from a published study by Jonathan David Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Bhasin1">[18]</xref>. The gene expression data was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number of GSE8512. The SNP data was provided by Jonathan David Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Bhasin1">[18]</xref>. There were 207 apoE-deficient F2 mice utilized from an AKRxDBA/2 intercross. The numbers of male and female mice were 114 and 93, respectively. The gene expression was measured with Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. There were 45,101 probes in this platform. Meanwhile, the genotypes of 1,967 informative SNP markers: 1 = homozygous AKR allele, 2 = heterozygous, 3 = homozygous DBA/2 allele, were measured.</p>

The genes with top ranks should have maximum relevance to the genotype class and also be minimally redundant, i.e., maximally dissimilar to one another. The maximum relevance makes sure that the genes are associated with the genotype and the minimum redundancy reduces the indirect associations. Both relevance and redundancy are defined by mutual information (MI), which measures how much one vector is related to another. MI is defined as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0067899.e009"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0067899.e009" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0067899.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0067899.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are two vectors, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0067899.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the joint probabilistic density, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0067899.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0067899.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the marginal probabilistic densities.</p>

<title>mRMR Results</title>
<p>Since the mice we studied were apoE-deficient F2 mice from an AKRxDBA/2 intercross, for each genetic marker, i.e. SNP, there were three statuses: homozygous AKR allele, heterozygous allele and homozygous DBA/2 allele. The genotype is the category variable which is usually the target class label in machine learning studies. The gene expression level is the numeric variables which contains data that can be used as features to represent the target class label. Therefore, unlike traditional eQTL methods which use the genotype data to represent the expression data, we used the expression data as features to represent the genotype data which were target class labels. After transforming the eQTL problems, i.e. discovering correlations between genotype data and expression data and placing these into machine learning questions, we applied the advanced mRMR methods to extract informative genes that have maximal relevance to the genotype and at the same time have minimal redundancy among genes. The maximal relevance ensures that the selected genes were strongly correlated with the genotype. The minimal redundancy reduces the number of selected genes; such a compact gene set will have fewer false positive correlations.</p>
<p>The genotype of each genetic marker was considered a machine learning problem. The genes were ranked by relevancy with the corresponding genetic marker. After the mRMR analysis, we obtained the mRMR score and mRMR order of all genes for each genetic marker. The mRMR score can be used a measurement of association between gene expression and genetic marker.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>IFS Results</title>
<p>With mRMR analysis, we can obtain the rank of association between gene expression and genetic marker, but it is still not clear how many genes are affected by the SNP. The number of affected genes can be optimized with IFS methods. In this method, the genes were progressively tested and the gene set that achieves the best prediction performance is considered the optimal gene set. Unlike the traditional eQTL methods which usually require an arbitrary cutoff, the IFS method is parameter free. It utilizes the IFS curve which characterizes the distribution of prediction performances, to optimize the affected gene selection.</p>

<title>eQTL Results</title>
<p>After the feature selection with mRMR and IFS, we obtained 6489 and 9401 eQTLs in female and male mice, respectively.</p>
<p>If the distance between SNP and the affected genes was smaller than 5 Mb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Smirnov1">[5]</xref>, this eQTL association was termed a cis-acting eQTL. Since the sequences of some probes in the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array did not achieve a perfect match with the mouse genome, they did not have exact genome locations. If an eQTL pair includes such probes, it was then termed ambiguous eQTL. Based on the above criteria, there were 1298 cis-acting eQTLs, 3392 trans-acting eQTLs, 1799 ambiguous eQTLs in female mice and 1698 cis-acting eQTLs, 5324 trans-acting eQTLs, 2379 ambiguous eQTLs in male mice.</p>
<p>To investigate the differences between cis-acting eQTLs and trans-acting eQTLs, we compared the mRMR scores of cis-acting eQTLs and trans-acting eQTLs and found that the mRMR scores of cis-acting eQTLs were significantly greater than the mRMR scores of trans-acting eQTLs. The one sided t test p values of this comparison in female and male mice were 7.13e-47 and 1.43e-66, respectively. Although the trans-acting eQTLs were weaker than cis-acting eQTLs, the number of trans-acting eQTLs was larger than the number of cis-acting eQTLs. Both the comparisons of associations and numbers of cis-acting eQTLs and trans-acting eQTLs in our results agreed with the prior reports that in mouse, the cis-acting eQTLs are stronger than trans-acting eQTLs but that there are more trans-acting eQTLs than cis-acting eQTLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Cookson1">[2]</xref>.</p>

<title>Comparison with the Original eQTL Results</title>
<p>We compared our eQTL results with Jonathan David Smith’s results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Bhasin1">[18]</xref>. They used R/qtl to calculate the eQTLs in female and male mice. Recently, a new method of eQTL, MatrixEQTL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Shabalin1">[20]</xref>, was developed. MatrixEQTL includes two models: modelLINEAR and modelANOVA. In modelLINEAR, the effect of genotype is considered as additive linear and the significance is tested using t-statistic. In modelANOVA, the genotype is treated as categorical variable and ANOVA model is applied to test the significance. We calculated the eQTLs in female and male mice using MatrixEQTL.modelLINEAR and MatrixEQTL.modelANOVA as well. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067899-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref> shows the venn diagram of these four methods. The cutoff of R/qtl was log-odds (LOD) &gt; = 3. The cutoff of MatrixEQTL.modelLINEAR and MatrixEQTL.modelANOVA was False Discovery Rate (FDR) &lt; = 0.05. The cutoff of mRMR is LOOCV Accuracy&gt; = 0.90. The outputs of these four methods were given in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067899.s001">Dataset S1</xref></bold>. In female mice, 67.9% of mRMR.eQTL results can be confirmed by at least two other methods while only 14.4% of R/qtl result can be confirmed by at least two other methods. In male mice, 74.1% of mRMR.eQTL results can be confirmed by at least two other methods while only 18.2% of R/qtl result can be confirmed by at least two other methods. Our method, mRMR.eQTL was better than R/qtl, which was used in the original study by Jonathan David Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Bhasin1">[18]</xref>.</p>

<p>To view the manner in which the SNPs affect their downstream genes and in which these genes interact with Apoe, we plotted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067899-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> which shows the eQTL associations between the enriched SNPs and their downstream genes in female and male mice and the protein interactions between Apoe and its partners. In female mice, two SNPs of Gm13803, rs13476656 and rs3689502, regulates three Apoe’s interaction partners, Cat, Cd44 and Rbm45. In male mice, two SNPs of Gm19516, rs13481820 and rs3698807, regulates three Apoe’s interaction partners, Stab2, 2010111I01Rik and Sptlc1. The eQTL results provided useful clues about the functions of predicted genes, Gm13803 and Gm19516.</p>

<title>Comparison with other Methods on Simulated Dataset</title>
<p>We generated simulated genotype and gene expression data using SysGenSIM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Pinna1">[45]</xref>.

To evaluate the eQTL identification performance of our method, R/qtl, and MatrixEQTL (modelLINEAR and modelANOVA), we plotted the precision-recall curve and calculate the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) which was widely used in evaluating eQTL and network construction methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Marbach1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Stolovitzky1">[48]</xref>.

<title>The Advantages and Disadvantages of our Method</title>
<p>Compared with the traditional linear regression based eQTL methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Kendziorski1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Kendziorski2">[52]</xref>, our information-theoretic machine learning method has several advantages: firstly, we use MI to measure the association between genetic marker and gene expression. MI can detect both linear and non-linear dependencies and deal with the heterogeneity of the study population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Li1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Kumar1">[53]</xref>. Thus, our method can identify more eQTLs than can the linear regression models. Secondly, since our method is based machine learning, we use advanced features selection methods - mRMR and IFS, to optimize the affected gene selection. Both mRMR and IFS have been widely used in machine learning areas and many difficult problems have been solved with these feature selection methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Cai1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Huang2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Huang4">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Huang10">[38]</xref>. In mRMR, the maximal relevance guarantees that the selected genes are associated with the genotype of the genetic marker and the minimal redundancy reduces the false positive associations. The IFS method borrows the IFS curve to analyse the performance distribution of a possible affected gene set and determine the optimal affected genes that have the best performance. Both mRMR and IFS methods are easy to understand and practice.</p>
<p>There are still some disadvantages to our method: firstly, since our methods originated from information theory and machine learning, it might be difficult for the traditional statistical geneticist to understand. Some equivalent terms we used may be strange to them, such as the MI we used to measure the association and the IFS curve we used to optimize the affected genes. Secondly, we used the gene expression data to represent the genotype. It is a concept different from the traditional method which is the contrary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067899-Zhang1">[7]</xref>. Some people may find it difficult to understand. We are of the opinion, however, that the aim of eQTL analysis is to identify the association between genetic marker and gene expression regardless of the representation form taken.</p>
