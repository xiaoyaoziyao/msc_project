<abstract>
<p>Worldwide tree mortality as induced by climate change presents a challenge to forest managers. To successfully manage vulnerable forests requires the capacity of regeneration to compensate for losses from tree mortality. We observed rapid regeneration and the growth release of young trees after warming-induced mortality in a David aspen-dominated (<italic>Populus davidiana</italic>) broad-leaved forest in Inner Mongolia, China, as based on individual tree measurements taken in 2012 and 2015 from a 6-ha permanent plot. Warming and drought stress killed large trees 10–15 m tall with a total number of 2881 trees during 2011–2012, and also thinned the upper crowns. David aspen recruitment increased 2 times during 2012–2015 and resulted in a high transition probability of David aspen replacing the same or other species, whereas the recruitment of Mongolian oak (<italic>Quercus mongolica</italic>) was much lower: it decreased from 2012 to 2015, indicating that rapid regeneration represented a regrowth phase for David aspen, and not succession to Mongolian oak. Further, we found that the recruitment density increased with canopy openness, thus implying that warming-induced mortality enhanced regeneration. Our results suggest that David aspen has a high regrowth ability to offset individual losses from warming-induced mortality. This important insight has implications for managing this vulnerable forest in the semi-arid region of northern China.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tree mortality has been reported in semi-arid regions worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref001">1</xref>]. Previous studies have primarily concentrated on the drivers of tree mortality and have linked it to climate change, pest outbreaks, and fire regimes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref004">4</xref>]. Recently, however, tree regeneration following episodes of mortality—knowledge that is necessary for predicting forest dynamics under future climate change—has become a topic of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Among the forest types suffering dieback, trembling aspen (<italic>Populus tremuloides</italic>) ranks among the most biologically diverse vegetation communities across the Intermountain Region of western North America, and this type has been well-studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref009">9</xref>]. Trembling aspen mortality and overstory dieback have occurred at unusually high levels throughout Colorado and western North America over the past 15 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref007">7</xref>]. Findings from southwestern Colorado indicated that dieback and mortality were clearly related to climate stress, coupled to disease and insect attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref010">10</xref>]. It was also found that trembling aspen stands continue to deteriorate after drought-incited sudden aspen decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Although aspen mortality has been widely documented in North America and Inner Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref011">11</xref>], studies about aspen regeneration after warming-induced mortality were few. Forest regeneration is commonly associated with various biotic features of tree species, such as the vegetative sprouting of aspen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref013">13</xref>]. Interspecific competition usually controls aspen regeneration during the process of secondary succession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref008">8</xref>]. Disturbance such as fire is known to have positive effect on aspen regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref016">16</xref>]. Similarly, heavy partial or even clear-cutting have been suggested in forest management to promote aspen recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref018">18</xref>]. In these prior studies, however, tree mortality and regeneration were often studied separately. Recent research indicates that the density of tree seedlings increases in healthy plots but decreases in drought-stricken plots, implying a possible negative relationship between warming-induced mortality and regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>In North America, the poor regeneration potential of trembling aspen has been observed in stands affected by severe drought, which might lead to conifer succession or conversion to shrub or grass vegetation, raising concerns that increasing aridity could ultimately lead to the widespread loss of aspen forest cover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref023">23</xref>]. Although warming-induced mortality of David aspen has been <bold>r</bold>eported in the temperate forest-steppe ecotone of northern China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref024">24</xref>], little is known about David aspen regeneration or the succession of mortality in this region. Hence, how to manage those stands that are susceptible to David aspen mortality remains a challenge. Since the regeneration ability of aspen may determine the process and direction of succession, we hypothesized that the ineffective regeneration of David aspen should lead to an alternative successional pathway or forest decline after forest dieback in this region.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we selected a David aspen-dominated forest containing Mongolian oak, white birch (<italic>Betula platyphylla</italic>), and black birch (<italic>Betula dahurica</italic>), in a mountainous region of the forest-steppe ecotone in Inner Mongolia, China. The objectives of this study were to: (1) characterize the regeneration status of David aspen after warming-induced mortality, (2) analyze the changes of the dominant species after tree mortality, and (3) evaluate the relationship between tree mortality and regeneration. Through these, we sought a scientific basis for managing this vulnerable forest, as well as those facing similar threats in other parts of the world.</p>

<title>Site and field monitoring</title>
<p>Our study site was in a mountainous region of the forest-steppe ecotone in northern China. In this region, we chose a broad-leaved forest dominated by David aspen and accompanied by Mongolian oak, white birch, and black birch for our investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195630.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This site is at an elevation of 1175–1355 m a.s.l.; it has annual temperature of c. 2°C and the mean annual precipitation is c. 360 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref024">24</xref>]. Warming-induced mortality in this region was reported for 2011–2012, with the highest mortality occurring in both aspen and Mongolian oak (mortality ratio &gt; 60%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref024">24</xref>].</p>

<p>In 2012, a permanent plot (6 ha) was established in broad-leaved forest that consisted of 600 subplots, each 10 m × 10 m (100 m<sup>2</sup>), at Saihan Wula National Nature Reserve by Inner Mongolia Agricultural University. Data collection was permitted by the Saihan Wula National Nature Reserve. All individuals with a stem diameter at the base (about 5 cm from ground) &gt; 1 cm in the permanent plot were labeled in 2012. Each individual was assigned a unique number. We identified the species and status (dead or living) of each labeled individual. We also measured the diameter of breast height (DBH) and height of all labeled individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref025">25</xref>]. The crown of every labeled individual was considered as an ellipse projected onto the ground, and both the lengths of long and short axes were measured to estimate tree crown size (m<sup>2</sup>). All of this 2012 fieldwork was likewise repeated in 2015. Any newly-recruited individuals generated after 2012 were labeled and their DBH and height were measured in 2015.</p>

<title>Assessment of tree mortality, growth, and regeneration</title>
<p>This study used 600 subplots in 2012 and in 2015 to evaluate the dead tree density, recruitment density, and canopy openness. For each subplot, we calculated the dead tree densities of four species (David aspen, Mongolian oak, white birch, black birch), expressed as the number of dead trees per 100 m<sup>2</sup>. The growth increment of each tree was evaluated by the changes in both DBH and height during the 2012–2015 period; the growth of each of the four species was averaged from co-occurring trees in each subplot. Recruitment in 2015 was defined as the number of new trees per 100 m<sup>2</sup> that were initiated previously during 2012–2015. These new recruits had ranges in DBH and height of &lt;7 cm and &lt;8 m, respectively. To evaluate the regeneration status before mortality occurred, recruits in 2012 were considered as those young trees with DBH &lt;7 cm and height &lt;8 m. Recruitment densities of the four tree species in each subplot were also assessed as counts of recruitments per 100 m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The diameter distribution of living trees in 2012 and 2015 were compared to assess changes in the dominant species in the mixed broad-leaved forest after severe mortality. For each of the dominant species, a diameter distribution was constructed by summing the number of living trees in 5-cm DBH intervals, and then dividing by the total number of living trees to yield a relative frequency (%). We further build up a transition probability matrix over the period of 2012 to 2015 to illustrate transition dynamics between the four tree species after tree mortalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref027">27</xref>]. The subplots with mortality &gt; 0 were considered as gaps which were released by tree death and available for capture. The transition probabilities of four tree species replaced by another of the same or a different species were estimated by counting the dominant tree species in 2012 and the percentage of seedlings and saplings of the various species.</p>
<p>We used the density of the surviving trees and canopy openness to estimate within-community competition after tree mortality, since competition among living trees predominates in the forest communities of this study region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref030">30</xref>]. The number of surviving trees was counted within each subplot. The canopy openness in each subplot was considered as ratio of gap areas accounting for the total area of each subplot. In previous studies, canopy openness was usually measured with hemispherical photographs or with equipment measuring photosynthetic active radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref031">31</xref>]. However, both methods cannot reflect the openness changes caused by tree mortality and recruitment. In our study, crown of each tree was considered as an ellipse, and the location of each tree was considered as the ellipse’s center. Ellipse of every tree in each subplot was projected on the same horizontal plane to roughly reconstruct the horizontal structure of canopy. Canopy openness was estimated by the total area without tree’s crown divided by the area of each subplot. As coordinates of each tree in each subplot were recorded in the field, the overlapped area can be excluded in calculation. As we have recorded coordinates of each tree and lengths of long and short axes of each tree crown, it is quite practical to use our method to estimate the openness of each subplot for a 6-ha permanent plot to study the relationship between openness changes and tree mortality/recruitment.</p>
<p>Canopy openness was estimated by the total area without tree’s crown divided by the area of each subplot. Linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between recruitment density and (1) canopy openness and (2) surviving tree density.</p>

<title>Increased tree growth and regeneration during 2012–2015</title>
<p>The tree stem DBH and the height of the four dominant species increased during 2012–2015, but especially for David aspen, for which DBH increased by 34.9% and height increased by 18.0%. The DBH increment of Mongolian oak was 18.9%, and its height increment was 12.2%. For both white birch and black birch, their DBH increased by 11%, and their height increased by 8%. Increments of DBH and height for David aspen and Mongolian oak mainly occured in relatively young trees in the 0–10 cm diameter class, which had 1.5–2.5 cm increments for DBH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195630.s001">S1A Fig</xref>, see Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195630.s003">S1 Table</xref>) and 0.5–1.5 m increments for height (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195630.s001">S1B Fig</xref>, see Table B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195630.s003">S1 Table</xref>). By contrast, for white birch and black birch, their increments of DBH occurred in trees over a relatively wide range (0–20 cm) of diameter classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195630.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2012, the density of dead David aspen was 4.0 trees 100 m<sup>−2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195630.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), followed by the density of dead white birch (0.8 trees 100 m<sup>−2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195630.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, see Table C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195630.s003">S1 Table</xref>). Comparatively few trees died during 2012–2015. The recruitment density of David aspen in 2015 doubled that in 2012 (18.1 trees 100 m<sup>−2</sup> vs. 8.5 trees 100 m<sup>−2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195630.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, see Table D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195630.s003">S1 Table</xref>). The recruitment densities of the other three species were clearly lower than that of David aspen, and the recruitment densities of Mongolian oak, white birch, and black birch in 2015 were relatively lower than the corresponding values in 2012 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195630.g002">Fig 2B–2D</xref>).

<title>Rapid regeneration of aspen after severe forest mortality</title>
<p>Our results rejected the hypothesis that the aspen-dominated community will succeed to a Mongolian oak-dominated community or convert to shrub and grass vegetation because of ineffective regeneration. Instead, we found abundant regeneration of David aspen following the mortality event—lacking any clear time lag. Additionally, the results revealed a growth release that was allocated towards the radial growth of young trees, which indicates a recruitment pathway for advance regeneration that existed prior to the mortality event.</p>
<p>The recruitment density of David aspen in this mixed forest doubled in 2015 as compared with the pre-mortality level, possibly due to the fast and effective regeneration strategy via suckering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref032">32</xref>]. Nonetheless, we observed higher growth releases of surviving younger trees than of older ones, also indicating that David aspen regeneration was promoted. The rapid regeneration recruited the forest community and confirmed a high regrowth ability for David aspen, which is generally observed following stand-replacing disturbances, such as fire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref033">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, in this study the rapid regeneration of David aspen was associated with a different disturbance: warming-induced mortality.</p>
<p>The unchanged diameter distributions show that the dominant species in this forest did not shift in rank after mortality. Before tree mortality occurred in 2011–2012, both young David aspen and young Mongolian oak in the 5–10 cm diameter class were at similar proportions in the community, implying a possible invasion process of Mongolian oak; yet in 2015, the percentage of young David aspen in the 0–10 cm diameter class increased sharply and dominated the regeneration class. Meanwhile, the high probabilities of both self-replacement and replacements to other species of David aspen indicated that aspen regeneration during 2012–2015 captured most of gaps no matter what dominant species was in 2012. In contrast, the transition probabilities from David aspen to other species were relatively low. As a pioneer species in the mixed aspen-conifer forests, trembling aspen is typically replaced by shade-tolerant conifers after a canopy gap forms or partial-cutting occurs, and this conifer invasion usually prevents the recruitment of aspen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref015">15</xref>]. David aspen usually occupies a similar habitat as oak and was an interim before the community developed towards oak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref036">36</xref>]. However, in this study, Mongolian oak had a much lower recruitment density which even appeared to decrease after the warming-induced mortality. In addition, the transition probability from David aspen to Mongolian oak was only 4%. These results suggest that the regeneration of Mongolian oak was possibly reduced by competition with the abundant David aspen recruits for water, light, and nutrients.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Positive relationship between mortality and regeneration</title>
<p>Our results suggest that warming-induced mortality might enhance regeneration. Drought stress killed the large trees (i.e., those of 10–15 m height) and it thinned the forest canopy in our study region. Recruitment density increased with canopy openness, suggesting that the asymmetric competition from crowns of surviving trees restricted forest regeneration. Warming-induced mortality possibly reduced the competition from crowns of surviving trees and thus enhanced the light availability in the forest interior and understory, which further favors the tree regeneration process. Similar effects were also observed for trembling aspen in North America for disturbances that affect the forest canopy, such as fires and heavy partial- or clear-cutting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>The enhanced forest regeneration after mortality at our site is different from that of trembling aspen in North America. Trembling aspen were recently documented to experience warming-induced mortality with damaged roots in the soil, which reduced the amounts of suckers and led to poor regeneration after mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref042">42</xref>]. In addition, herbivore damage were documented to threaten aspen regeneration process in North America, by browsing new recruits after overstory mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref043">43</xref>]. In the present study, however, we observed rapid regeneration after warming-induced mortality, which suggests a higher regrowth ability of David aspen in our study region than for trembling aspen in North America. This might be caused by undamaged roots. Since the study site located in a national nature reserve where grazing was forbidden, we speculated that herbivore absence was likely to prompting successful regeneration of David aspen in our study region. Although it is difficult to accurately compare the damage degrees of drought on roots between in our study region and North America, the positive effect from grazing prohibition suggested that forest managements played an important role on forest regeneration after warming-induced mortality.</p>

<title>Implication for forest management in the forest-steppe ecotone</title>
<p>How to manage the vulnerable forest in the forest-steppe ecotone remains a major challenge, while the conservation of natural forest is a national policy in China. Our results suggested a conceptual model for the recovery progress of aspen forests after mortality in this forest-steppe ecotone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195630.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Specifically, David aspen in semi-arid northern China has a high regrowth ability response to warming-induced mortality, as indicated by its rapid and abundant regeneration without a time lag. Tree mortality promotes aspen regeneration and increased the total number of living trees, suggesting a tendency towards compensating for losses from mortality, which was quite different from the prediction of forest decline in previous studies about forest dynamics under climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref044">44</xref>]. Meanwhile, tree mortality also restrains Mongolian oak regeneration, indicating a regrowth process that favors aspen dominance rather than a succession to Mongolian oak dominance. Distribution of tree height indicated that dead trees were mainly saplings with height 5 m and large trees of 10–15 m height. If warming and drought continues in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref046">46</xref>], a high percentage of the new recruitments we observed might be killed after growing up, which may further accelerate old-aged tree replacement and rejuvenate the overall age of the forest. Meanwhile, enhanced competition from aspen saplings is likely to keep restraining regeneration of Mongolian oak, which could lengthen the succession process towards climax community. However, we only observed a relative short-term window of forest dynamics and regeneration in this study; multiple factors (e.g., drought stress and the risk of shallow rooting) may contribute to the growth of seedlings and saplings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref049">49</xref>]. Whether the aspen forest recovers to its initial state requires additional work, especially over the long-term. Nevertheless, the abundant regeneration of aspen without a time lag suggests a bright future for aspen regrowth in spite of suffering severe mortality as induced by drought stress.</p>

<p>Our study site has a large area and covers most of the major tree species in the semi-arid region, which is rare and valuable for observing the succession process in the semiarid region of northern China. Although only containing results in a single locality, our findings provide important insights into the persistence of this vulnerable forest type in China, and possibly those facing similar threats in other parts of the world. The positive effect of mortality on regeneration was not only found in aspen, but also observed in a larch-dominated forest (<italic>Larix sibirica</italic>) and a birch-dominated forest (<italic>Betula platyphylla</italic>) in the neighboring region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref051">51</xref>]. Reduced canopy cover caused by mortality stimulated both vegetative sprouting by broadleaved trees and seed production by conifers. Although climate warming and drought threatens semi-arid forests with high rates of tree growth decline and increased tree mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref054">54</xref>], semi-arid forests may be capable of a greater recruitment rate to compensate for population and community losses from mortality. Under the predicted high risk of forest loss in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0195630.ref044">44</xref>], we suggest that the management of forests in semi-arid regions should consider integrating the forest dynamics associated with the warming-induced mortality’s positive influence on forest regeneration.</p>
