          <title>Rationale</title>
          <p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare progressive pulmonary vascular disorder associated with vascular remodeling and right heart failure. Vascular remodeling involves numerous signaling cascades governing pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation, migration and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3ß) is a serine/threonine kinase and can act as a downstream regulatory switch for numerous signaling pathways. Hence, we hypothesized that GSK3ß plays a crucial role in pulmonary vascular remodeling.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>All experiments were done with lung tissue or isolated PASMCs in a well-established monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rat model. The mRNA expression of Wnt ligands (Wnt1, Wnt3a, Wnt5a), upstream Wnt signaling regulator genes (Frizzled Receptors 1, 2 and secreted Frizzled related protein sFRP-1) and canonical Wnt intracellular effectors (GSK3ß, Axin1) were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and protein levels of GSK3ß, phospho-GSK3ß (ser 9) by western blotting and localization by immunohistochemistry. The role of GSK3ß in PASMCs proliferation was assessed by overexpression of wild-type GSK3ß (WT) and constitutively active GSK3ß S9A by [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation assay.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Increased levels of total and phosphorylated GSK3ß (inhibitory phosphorylation) were observed in lungs and PASMCs isolated from MCT-induced PAH rats compared to controls. Further, stimulation of MCT-PASMCs with growth factors induced GSK3ß inactivation. Most importantly, treatment with the PDGFR inhibitor, Imatinib, attenuated PDGF-BB and FCS induced GSK3ß phosphorylation. Increased expression of GSK3ß observed in lungs and PASMC isolated from MCT-induced PAH rats was confirmed to be clinically relevant as the same observation was identified in human iPAH lung explants. Overexpression of GSK3ß significantly increased MCT-PASMCs proliferation by regulating ERK phosphorylation. Constitutive activation of GSK3ß (GSK3ß S9A, 9th serine replaced to alanine) inhibited MCT-PASMCs proliferation by decreasing ERK phosphorylation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>This study supports a central role for GSK3ß in vascular remodeling processes and suggests a novel therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of PAH.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive pulmonary vascular disorder with high morbidity and mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Rubin1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-DAlonzo1">[2]</xref>. The pulmonary vascular remodeling may typically involve numerous molecular signaling cascades governing endothelial dysfunction, neovascularization of small pulmonary arteries, pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) and adventitial fibroblast (PAAF) migration and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Humbert1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Rabinovitch1">[4]</xref>. However, 3 of the currently approved therapies targeting vasoconstrictive/vasodilatory abnormalities in PAH, like endothelin, nitric oxide or prostacyclin, show beneficial effects and improved quality of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Rubin2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Barst1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Galie1">[7]</xref>, but do not appear to reverse or modify disease progression.</p>
      <p>To this end, in the last 5 years, enormous progress has been made by our group and authors in developing new anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic therapeutic strategies to reverse the disease progression. The role of growth factors, tyrosine/serine-threonine kinase receptors in PAH has been extensively studied at the cellular, preclinical and clinical levels. Accumulation of growth factors such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pro-survival factors like survivin in the pulmonary vasculature suggest categorizing this disease as a pseudo-malignant proliferative disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Schermuly1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Perros1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Merklinger1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Wedgwood1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-McMurtry1">[12]</xref>. In accordance, inhibition of anti-cancer compounds, Imatinib/STI571 (PDGFRß, C-kit, SDF-1), PKI166 (EGFR) and Sorafenib (multikinase inhibitor), prove effective in reversing vascular remodeling and improved survival in various experimental models of PAH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Schermuly1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Merklinger1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Klein1">[13]</xref>. These studies not only highlighted the importance of anti-cancer therapeutics in PAH but also open avenues to explore new intracellular signaling pathways in the PAH disease pathogenesis.</p>
      <p>GSK3ß (Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 beta) is a ubiquitously expressed, highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase found in all eukaryotes. Although initially identified as a regulator of glycogen metabolism, GSK3ß can act as a downstream regulatory switch for numerous signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Grimes1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Doble1">[15]</xref>. GSK3ß is constitutively active in unstimulated, resting cells, and is inactivated during cellular responses. Treatment of cells with a growth factors such as insulin, is shown to cause GSK3ß inactivation through a PI 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism. PI3K-induced activation of PKB/Akt results in phosphorylation of ser 9 on GSK3ß, that inhibits GSK3ß activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-vanWeeren1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Pap1">[17]</xref>. Similarly, GSK3ß was shown to play a key inhibitory role in the Wnt signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Sakanaka1">[18]</xref>. This inactivation causes reduced phosphorylation of its substrates, such as ß-Catenin, c-Myc, endothelin, VEGF, survivin etc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Fiol1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Welsh1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Morisco1">[21]</xref>. Thus, GSK3 by regulating several of its substrates participates in a wide spectrum of cellular processes, including glycogen metabolism, transcription, translation, cytoskeleton regulation, intracellular vesicular transport, cell cycle progression and apoptosis.</p>
      <p>Recent evidences suggest that inactivation of GSK3ß can positively regulate proliferation and cell survival in many types of cancer and in vascular remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Shakoori1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Wang1">[23]</xref>. Hence we hypothesized that GSK3ß plays a crucial role in remodeling of vascular components during PAH. Our aims were at first to determinate expression profile of GSK3ß and its regulatory genes (Wnt ligands 1, 3a, 5a, Frizzled Receptor 1 and 2, sFRP-1 and Axin1) and quantify protein level changes and phosphorylation status in MCT-induced PAH rat lungs and in isolated PASMCs. Further, to assess the functional role of GSK3ß in PASMCs proliferation and down stream molecular mechanisms by overexpression of wild type and constitutively active mutant of GSK3ß.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, in all cases PDGF-BB and 10% FCS stimulation caused a significant increase in phospho-AKT and phospho-GSK3ß (Ser 9) in combination with significant activation of ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018883-g004">Figure 4A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018883-g005">5A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018883.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The increased phosphorylation of AKT, GSK3ß at ser 9 site and ERK observed after stimulation with growth factors were significantly abrogated by Imatinib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018883-g004">Figure 4A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018883-g005">5A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018883.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

This suggest that GSK3β is a possible crucial player in growth factors signaling and abnormal proliferation of PASMCs in experimental PAH.</p>

        <p>To further evaluate the contribution of GSK3ß to vascular remodeling processes, we generated pcDNA 3.1 TOPO-cloning constructs carrying GSK3ß wild type (WT) cDNA and GSK3ß S9A (where serine at residue 9 is replaced to alanine) mutant.

        <p>Transient overexpression of GSK3ß WT and GSK3ß S9A mutant in PASMCs resulted in a significantly enhancement of GSK3ß expression 24 hrs post transfection. Empty vector (EV) transfection caused no change in GSK3ß protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018883-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Importantly, serum stimulation did not cause GSK3ß phosphorylation in GSK3ß S9A mutant overexpressing cells while another tyrosine 216 residue was phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018883-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The gain of GSK3ß WT expression was coupled to a significantly increase of [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine uptake as compared to cells transfected with either empty pcDNA3.1 vector or Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (LF2000) only, 24 hrs post serum stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018883-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). On the other hand, GSK3ß S9A mutant expression decreased [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine uptake, suggested that GSK3ß inactivation is involved in PASMCs proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018883-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study has 4 salient features. First, GSK3ß and the phosphorylated form of GSK3ß (inactivation) are increased in MCT lungs and PASMCs isolated from monocrotaline induced pulmonary arterial hypertensive rats compared to control rats. Second, both PDGF and FCS stimulation induced GSK3ß phosphorylation (inactivation) in PASMCs. Third, treatment with the PDGFR inhibitor, Imatinib, attenuated growth factors-induced GSK3ß and ERK phosphorylation. Fourth, overexpression of wild type and constitutively activate form of GSK3ß (GSK3ß S9A; 9th serine replaced to alanine) influenced serum induced MCT-PASMCs proliferation by regulating ERK phosphorylation. This study supports a central role for GSK3ß in vascular remodeling processes and suggests a novel therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.</p>
      <p>The dynamic process of pulmonary vascular remodeling involves numerous molecular signaling cascades governing PASMCs proliferation, differentiation and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Rabinovitch1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Arciniegas1">[29]</xref>. We hypothesized that GSK3ß signaling plays a critical regulatory role in pulmonary vascular remodeling. In accord with our hypothesis, we demonstrated significant increase in total GSK3ß expression levels as well as its phosphorylation status in lungs and PASMCs in response to MCT injury and total GSK3ß in human iPAH lung explants. Interestingly, the increase in GSK3ß and its phosphorylated form, observed in primary PASMCs isolated from MCT-PAH rats as well as in rat and human lungs, suggest that aberrant GSK3ß signaling may trigger the proliferative phenotype of PASMCs. In line with this notion, aberrant GSK3ß signaling was recently implicated in various vascular- and fibro-proliferative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Wang1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Bentley1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Chilosi1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>GSK3ß remains increased and inactivated 5 weeks after MCT injury, which is accompanied by decreases in mRNA expression of canonical Wnt ligands (Wnt1 and Wnt3a) and an increase in non-canonical Wnt5a ligand, 3 and 5 weeks after MCT injury. However, GSK3ß was downregulated at the mRNA level in MCT-PASMCs compared to control-PASMCs. We assume that downregulation of GSK3ß mRNA levels concurrent with upregulation of protein expression may occur when a protein's half-life is increased due to stabilization-components involved with the protein's normal turnover may be disrupted. It is also possible that the protein may become stabilized through protein-protein interactions. Additionally, this can be explained by transcriptional repression when high levels of proteins accumulate. Furthermore as delineated in our study, GSK3ß phosphorylation is regulated by growth factors, i.e. PDGF-BB that were highly upregulated in PAH. Hence we believe that GSK3ß is clearly dependent on multiple lines of regulation in addition to the phosphorylation state of GSK3ß <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Goode1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Ali1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-George1">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our study, upregulation of non-canonical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Mikels1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Miller1">[36]</xref> Wnt5a mRNA in MCT-lungs is in line with previously published data, showing involvement of non-canonical Wnt signaling in human IPAH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Laumanns1">[37]</xref>. Moreover, downstream targets of the non-canonical Wnt pathway, like Rho-kinases or calcium signaling, were shown to significantly contribute to PASMCs proliferation and vasocontriction and demonstrated therapeutic potential in pulmonary hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Chen1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Li1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Zhang1">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our data indicate that MCT-PASMCs are hyper-proliferative in the presence of FCS and PDGF compared to control-PASMCs. Interestingly, our results showed that PDGF and FCS stimulation on MCT-PASMCs, acting via PI3-kinase-dependent activation of AKT, causes GSK3ß (Ser 9) phosphorylation and GSK3ß inactivation followed by ERK activation, which is potentially suppressed by Imatinib. A similar role of growth factors, such as PDGF, IGF and EGF, mediated GSK3ß inactivation was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Tsakiridis1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Shin1">[42]</xref>. Furthermore, several kinases were also shown to be capable of mediating ser 9 phosphorylation, including AKT, PKA, PKC and Wnts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-vanWeeren1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Goode1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Fang1">[43]</xref>. Considering the crucial role of PDGF signaling in pulmonary vascular remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Schermuly1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Perros1">[9]</xref>, the increased presence of growth factors signaling in human and experimental PAH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Schermuly1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Merklinger1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Klein1">[13]</xref> and PDGF and FCS mediated alteration of GSK3ß activity, collectively suggests GSK3ß plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PAH.</p>
      <p>The effects of GSK3ß are also regulated by Wnt signaling pathway protein complex formation, a process involved in modulating ß-Catenin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Sakanaka1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Rubinfeld1">[44]</xref>. Future studies are needed to study the regulation of canonical Wnt signaling and the multitude of factors regulating ß-Catenin expression in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. Albeit recent studies suggest that recruitment of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways promote pulmonary arterial endothelial cell proliferation, survival, and migration. In addition, it was demonstrated that both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways are required for BMP-2-mediated angiogenesis in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-deJesusPerez1">[45]</xref>. These findings may help better understand the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension, a disease that featured with the loss of small precapillary arteries.</p>
      <p>In the present study, overexpression of GSK3ß significantly increased expression of GSK3ß that was accompanied by increased proliferation capacity of MCT-PASMCs proliferation after FCS stimulation. Constitutive activation of GSK3ß significantly reduced expression of phospho-GSK3ß and PASMCs proliferation. This effect can be due to GSK3ß phosphorylation of a diverse group of substrates or by inhibition of transcription factor activation such as p53, CREB and ß-Catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Pap1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Sakanaka1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Fiol1">[19]</xref>. In addition, GSK3ß constitutively activation (S9A) has also been shown to directly effects cyclin D1 expression, independent of ß-Catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Diehl1">[46]</xref>. Here, we show that overexpression of wild-type GSK3ß significantly influenced the proliferation capacity of MCT-PASMCs via regulating phosphorylation of ERK. In a recent study by Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, it was shown that GSK3ß acts as a negative regulator of ERK in human colon cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Wang2">[47]</xref>. Our study shows that constitutive activation of GSK3ß significantly reduced phospho-GSK3ß levels and PASMCs proliferation that was accompanied by a significant decrease in ERK phosphorylation. These results collectively suggest that modification of GSK3ß can significantly influence highly dysregulated growth factors signaling associated with abnormal proliferation of PASMCs in PAH.</p>
      <p>Although mRNA levels of GSK3ß is downregulated in MCT-PASMCs and in human iPAH patient lungs, along with other canonical Wnt signaling dependent genes we found that protein levels of GSK3ß increased in a time dependent fashion with disease progression in the MCT-induced PAH model (lungs and MCT-PASMCs) and also in explanted iPAH patient lungs, suggesting a role for GSK3ß in disease progression, potentially independent of canonical Wnt signaling. Recently a crucial role for GSK3ß in systemic vascular remodeling was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Bonnet1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Park1">[49]</xref>. Authors demonstrated for the first time <italic>in vivo</italic> that active GSK3ß gene transfer results in a significant reduction in neointima formation in the restenosis model of balloon injury in rat carotid arteries. These effects were attributable, at least in part to the ability of GSK3ß to inhibit smooth muscle proliferation and to promote sustained apoptosis. This concept was extended to demonstrate that GSK3ß plays a significant role in VSMCs proliferation and apoptosis in vascular remodeling after balloon injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018883-Park1">[49]</xref>. Similarly, in our study the inactivation of GSK3β by serine 9 phosphorylation was observed 5 weeks after MCT injury in rats, both in PASMCs and lung homogenates. This suggest that the introduction of active GSK3β (S9A) may also prove beneficial for regression of vascular remodeling in experimental PAH.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate that GSK3ß is significantly altered in the pathogenesis of experimental as well as human PAH and the regulatory role for GSK3ß in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. This study supports a central role for GSK3ß in vascular remodeling processes and suggests a novel therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p>
