<title>Background</title>
<p>Adiponectin-transgenic mice had many small adipocytes in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues, and showed higher sensitivity to insulin, longer life span, and reduced chronic inflammation. We hypothesized that adiponectin regulates Wnt signaling in adipocytes and thereby modulates adipocyte proliferation and chronic inflammation in adipose tissue.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We examined the expression of all Wnt ligands and their receptors and the activity of Wnt signaling pathways in visceral adipose tissue from wild-type mice and two lines of adiponectin-transgenic mice. The effects of adiponectin were also investigated in cultured 3T3-L1 cells.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The <italic>Wnt5b</italic>, <italic>Wnt6</italic>, Frizzled 6 (<italic>Fzd6</italic>), and <italic>Fzd9</italic> genes were up-regulated in both lines of transgenic mice, whereas <italic>Wnt1</italic>, <italic>Wnt2</italic>, <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Wnt9b</italic>, <italic>Wnt10b</italic>, <italic>Wnt11</italic>, <italic>Fzd1</italic>, <italic>Fzd2</italic>, <italic>Fzd4</italic>, <italic>Fzd7</italic>, and the Fzd coreceptor low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (<italic>Lrp6</italic>) were reduced. There was no difference in total β-catenin levels in whole-cell extracts, non-phospho-β-catenin levels in nuclear extracts, or mRNA levels of β-catenin target genes, indicating that hyperadiponectinemia did not affect canonical Wnt signaling. In contrast, phosphorylated calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (p-CaMKII) and phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) were markedly reduced in adipose tissue from the transgenic mice. The adipose tissue of the transgenic mice consisted of many small cells and had increased expression of adiponectin, whereas cyclooxygenase-2 expression was reduced. <italic>Wnt5b</italic> expression was elevated in preadipocytes of the transgenic mice and decreased in diet-induced obese mice, suggesting a role in adipocyte differentiation. Some Wnt genes, Fzd genes, and p-CaMKII protein were down-regulated in 3T3-L1 cells cultured with a high concentration of adiponectin.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Chronic hyperadiponectinemia selectively modulated the expression of Wnt ligands, Fzd receptors and LRP coreceptors accompanied by the inhibition of the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and JNK signaling pathways, which may be involved in the altered adipocyte cellularity, endogenous adiponectin production, and anti-inflammatory action induced by hyperadiponectinemia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Visceral adipose tissue in metabolic syndrome is histologically characterized by enlargement of adipocytes due to impaired adipocyte differentiation, accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation. The enlarged adipocytes release more free fatty acids, glycerol, and proinflammatory cytokines and less adiponectin. Hypoadiponectinemia and chronic inflammation in adipose tissue are closely associated with obesity-linked complications, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p>
<p>Previously, we established transgenic mouse lines that express full-length human adiponectin in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Otabe1">[1]</xref>. The hyperadiponectinemic mice show higher sensitivity to insulin, longer life span and resistance to the deleterious effects of a high-fat/high-sugar diet. The high-calorie diet-induced increase in urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, is markedly suppressed in the transgenic mice. Interestingly, adipocytes of the transgenic mice are reduced in size and increased in number compared with those of wild-type mice in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues, suggesting that adiponectin may play a role in the regulation of adipogenesis. However, the mechanism of adiponectin action in adipose tissue has not been elucidated.</p>
<p>The Wnt signaling pathway is a highly conserved signal transduction cascade that has a critical role in embryonic development, differentiation and cellular homeostasis. Constitutive endogenous Wnt signaling keeps preadipocytes in an undifferentiated state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Longo1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Isakson1">[4]</xref>. However, Wnt signaling is involved in the activation of proinflammatory mediators in inflammatory disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Sen1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Kim1">[7]</xref>. Wnt family members are involved in the regulation of many biological processes, including embryonic development, cell fate, cell proliferation, cell migration, stem cell maintenance, tumor suppression, and oncogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Gordon1">[8]</xref>. Binding of Wnt to the Frizzled (Fzd) family of receptors can activate at least two distinct signaling pathways. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is characterized by cytosolic and nuclear β-catenin accumulation and the activation of certain β-catenin-responsive target genes such as c-Myc (<italic>Myc</italic>) and cyclin D1 (<italic>Ccnd1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Hinck1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Papkoff1">[10]</xref>. The non-canonical β-catenin-independent pathways include the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII)-mediated Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway and the small GTPase RhoA- and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Khl1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-WnnenbergStapleton1">[12]</xref>. In addition to Fzd receptors, the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway requires low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (Lrp5) and Lrp6 coreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Gong1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-He1">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, receptor tyrosine kinases-like orphan receptor 1 (Ror1), Ror2 and receptor-like tyrosine kinase (Ryk) transduce non-canonical Wnt signals and modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Oishi1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Lu1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis that adiponectin regulates Wnt signaling in adipocytes and thereby modulates adipocyte proliferation and chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, we examined the expression of all Wnt ligands and their receptors and the activities of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling in visceral adipose tissue from wild-type mice and adiponectin-transgenic mice.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>We have established three lines of transgenic mice expressing human full-length adiponectin under the control of the serum amyloid P component promoter on the C57BL/6 background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Otabe1">[1]</xref>. In this study, we used male transgenic mice of line 11 and line 13, which exhibited a high plasma concentration of human adiponectin (284.1±44.4 and 183.0±32.0 µg/ml, respectively, including the high-molecular-weight isoform) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Otabe1">[1]</xref>. The high plasma adiponectin enabled us to analyze adiponectin actions in adipose tissue, where adiponectin concentration is assumed to be higher than in peripheral blood. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice originally purchased from Nippon CLEA (Shizuoka, Japan) and maintained in our laboratory served as controls. Plasma adiponectin was 41.9±5.4 µg/ml in wild-type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Otabe1">[1]</xref>. Mice were fed standard mouse chow (347 kcal/100 g, protein 24.9 g/100 g, fat 4.6 g/100 g; Nippon CLEA) and water ad libitum and sacrificed at the age of 20 weeks. To study diet-induced obesity, wild-type mice were maintained on a high-fat/high-sucrose food (592 kcal/100 g, 70% fat, 14% sucrose, 3% other carbohydrates, and 13% protein, Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) from the age of 8 weeks. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All procedures were approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of Kurume University School of Medicine (Permit Number: 2262). Mice were sacrificed under ether anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.</p>

<title>Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR</title>
<p>The mRNA expression of Wnt ligands, Wnt receptors, coreceptors, and components of Wnt signaling pathways was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Visceral adipose tissue and quadriceps femoris muscle were obtained from 20-week-old male mice. Preadipocytes and mature adipocytes were isolated by the collagenase digestion method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Ouchi1">[20]</xref>. RNA was isolated using RNA-Bee (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan), and 5 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). SYBR green-based real-time quantitative PCR of cDNA templates was performed using StepOnePlus (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The PCR cycling conditions were 10 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 53–64°C, and 30 sec at 72°C. The results were calculated as the expression of the target gene relative to the expression of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>Gapdh</italic>) gene. Forward and reverse primers are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067712-t001">Table 1</xref>. The expression of <italic>Fabp4</italic> and <italic>Pparg</italic> was measured by quantitative RT-PCR as markers of mature adipocytes.</p>

<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Adipose tissue and 3T3-L1 cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol DTT, 0.0025% NP40 and a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors. The lysate was centrifuged at 19,000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected as whole-cell extract. To obtain nuclear extract, adipose tissue lysate was centrifuged at 600 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C, and the pellet was solubilized in nuclear lysis buffer containing 0.5 mmol/l DTT, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mmol/l EDTA and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 12,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, the supernatant was collected. The total protein concentrations of the whole-cell and nuclear extracts were measured using the Bradford reagent (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After being heated at 100°C for 5 min, 20 µg total protein was loaded into each well, separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against β-catenin and non-phospho β-catenin, rabbit polyclonal antibody against CaMKII, rabbit polyclonal antibody against phospho-CaMKII Thr286 (p-CaMKII), rabbit monoclonal antibody against JNK, or rabbit monoclonal antibody against phospho-JNK Thr183/Thr185 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) at 4°C overnight. After being washed, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Wako) and then visualized using an ECL system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this comprehensive analysis of Wnt ligands and their receptors in adipose tissue, we demonstrated that hyperadiponectinemia elicited profound effects on Wnt pathway components. Of 13 detectable Wnt ligand families, both lines of adiponectin-transgenic mice showed increased expression of <italic>Wnt5b</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> and reduced expression of <italic>Wnt1</italic>, <italic>Wnt2</italic>, <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Wnt9b</italic>, <italic>Wnt10b</italic>, and <italic>Wnt11</italic>. Several Wnt ligands, including Wnt1, predominantly use the canonical pathway for intracellular signaling, while some other Wnt ligands, including Wnt5a, mainly activate non-canonical signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Flahertya1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Katoh1">[24]</xref>. However, a growing body of evidence suggests substantial overlap between these pathways in cell- and context-dependent manners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Mikels1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Swain1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Wnt ligands can signal through different receptors, including Fzd, Ror1, Ror2 and Ryk. Fzd receptors are seven-pass transmembrane proteins requisite for canonical Wnt signaling. Two members of the Fzd family were up-regulated and four were down-regulated in adipose tissue from the transgenic mice. However, no significant difference was observed in the expression of the non-Fzd Wnt receptors <italic>Ror1</italic>, <italic>Ror2</italic> and <italic>Ryk</italic> between wild-type mice and the transgenic mice. On the other hand, the hyperadiponectinemic mice showed lower expression of coreceptor <italic>Lrp6</italic>, whereas <italic>Lrp5</italic> expression was not significantly altered.</p>
<p>These observations prompted us to analyze the effects of hyperadiponectinemia on Wnt signaling pathways in adipose tissue. To assess the activity of the canonical signaling pathway, we examined β-catenin. Western blot analysis showed neither total β-catenin in whole-cell extracts nor non-phospho-β-catenin in nuclear extracts was altered in the transgenic mice compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in the expression of <italic>Myc</italic> or <italic>Ccnd1</italic>, classical target genes of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Morin1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Behrens1">[29]</xref>, between wild-type mice and adiponectin-transgenic mice. Hence, chronic hyperadiponectinemia in the transgenic mice did not alter the downstream signals of the canonical Wnt pathway in adipose tissue. <italic>Lrp5</italic> expression might be sufficient to transduce canonical signals in spite of the reduction of <italic>Lrp6</italic> expression.</p>
<p>The two non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways are the Wnt/PCP pathway, involving RhoA GTPase and JNK, and the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway, involving CaMKII and protein kinase C. In this study the expression of <italic>RhoA</italic> was not altered in adipose tissue from the transgenic mice, although RhoA activity was not measured. However, the protein levels of p-JNK and p-CaMKII, but not total JNK and total CaMKII, were markedly reduced in the transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. Although the physiological roles of individual Fzd members remain to be characterized, Wnt5a binds to Fzd2 and Fzd4 and transduces the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. The attenuated Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway in the transgenic mice could be attributable to the reduced expression of <italic>Wnt5a</italic> and its putative receptors <italic>Fzd2</italic> and <italic>Fzd4</italic>.</p>
<p>Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are associated with impaired adipogenesis, characterized by increased fat cell size. Previously, we reported that adipocytes are small in size but increase in number in adiponectin-transgenic mice fed a high-fat/high-sugar diet compared with wild-type mice fed the same diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Otabe1">[1]</xref>. The elevated expression of endogenous adiponectin shown in this study may have resulted from the increase of small adipocytes in the transgenic mice. Wnt signaling may play a role in the altered cellularity of hyperadiponectinemic mice because non-canonical Wnt signaling is one of the regulatory mechanisms of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation from common mesenchymal stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Bilkovski1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Bilkovski2">[31]</xref>. Wnt5a can shift the balance towards osteoblastogenesis through the activation of CaMKII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Bilkovski1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Takada1">[32]</xref>. Thus, the reduced expression of Wnt5a and lower level of p-CaMKII in the transgenic mice may have enhanced adipogenesis.</p>
<p>Unlike <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, adipose expression of <italic>Wnt5b</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> was elevated in the transgenic mice. Overexpression of <italic>Wnt5b</italic> in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes results in the augmentation of adipocyte differentiation, suggesting that Wnt5b is a positive regulator of adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-vanTienen1">[33]</xref>. Wnt6 may also be involved in the regulation of adipogenesis because <italic>Wnt6</italic> mRNA shows biphasic expression during the differentiation period of 3T3-L1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Nishizuka1">[34]</xref>. Taken together, our data suggest that the altered expression of Wnt ligands in adipose tissue from the transgenic mice may be involved in the enhanced adipogenesis and thereby the up-regulated production of endogenous adiponectin.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the expression of putative regulators of adipocyte differentiation, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, and Wnt6, in preadipocytes and mature adipocytes. The expression of <italic>Wnt5b</italic> was elevated in both preadipocytes and mature adipocytes from adiponectin-transgenic mice, while the reduction of <italic>Wnt5a</italic> mRNA and the increase of <italic>Wnt6</italic> mRNA were detected only in mature adipocytes. These observations suggest that Wnt5b may play a major role in the adipocyte differentiation induced by hyperadiponectinemia. This suggestion is supported by the fact that diet-induced obesity resulted in the reduction of <italic>Wnt5b</italic> expression in adipose tissue. However, it should be noted that the preadipocyte fraction may also contain immune cells and endothelial cells.</p>
<p>Activated Wnt5a signaling has been implicated in the up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines in autoimmune and infectious diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Sen2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Blumenthal1">[36]</xref>. Serum levels of Wnt5a were increased in patients with severe obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Schulte1">[37]</xref>. Wnt5a induces cyclooxygenase-2 expression by endothelial cells through the non-canonical Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway, leading to the enhancement of inflammatory cytokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Kim1">[7]</xref>. As expected, cyclooxygenase-2 expression was significantly reduced in adipose tissue from adiponectin-transgenic mice. Hence, the inhibition of Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling may be a mechanism by which adiponectin attenuates the chronic inflammation associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The promoter region of the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> gene contains a binding element of NF-κB, a transcription factor activated by TNF-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Katoh2">[38]</xref>. Down-regulation of NF-κB may mediate the suppressive effect of adiponectin on <italic>Wnt5a</italic> expression because adiponectin inhibits TNF-α-induced IκB-α phosphorylation and subsequent NF-κB activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Ouchi2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Ajuwon1">[40]</xref>. Further studies are needed to define the mechanism of the selective modulation of Wnt ligands and their receptors by adiponectin.</p>
<p>It was of interest that p-JNK was markedly reduced in adipose tissue from the transgenic mice because JNK has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. In obesity, JNK activity is increased in the liver, muscle, and adipose tissues, and an absence of JNK1 results in decreased adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity in obese models of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Hirosumi1">[41]</xref>. Furthermore, JNK is a crucial regulator of apoptosis and cell proliferation. Activation of JNK might be associated with increased carcinogenesis in obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Endo1">[42]</xref>, and it was hypothesized that decreased adiponectin levels, as observed in obesity, fail to control JNK expression. Although various inflammatory and metabolic pathways may be involved in the activation of JNK, the observations in this study suggest that the attenuation of non-canonical Wnt signaling is a mechanism by which hyperadiponectinemia suppresses JNK activity in adipose tissue.</p>
<p>Next, we assessed the <italic>ex vivo</italic> effects of adiponectin on the mRNA levels of Wnt ligands and their receptors using cultured 3T3-L1 cells. The cells were exposed to a high concentration of recombinant adiponectin (300 µg/ml) because adiponectin concentration is likely to be elevated in the micro-environment of adipocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>. As in adipose tissue from the transgenic mice, down-regulation of <italic>Wnt1</italic>, <italic>Wnt2</italic>, <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Wnt9b</italic>, <italic>Wnt10b</italic>, <italic>Fzd2</italic>, <italic>Fzd4</italic>, <italic>Fzd7</italic>, and <italic>Lrp6</italic> was also detected in 3T3-L1 cells exposed to adiponectin for 24 h. Thus, adiponectin may directly attenuate the expression of these Wnt-related genes in adipose tissue. In contrast, the reduction of <italic>Wnt11</italic> expression in adipose tissue may be an indirect effect of hyperadiponectinemia because <italic>Wnt11</italic> mRNA was not decreased in 3T3-L1 cells cultured with adiponectin. The expression of some Wnt-related genes was reduced by adiponectin <italic>in vitro</italic>, but not in adipose tissue from the transgenic mice. Furthermore, up-regulation of <italic>Wnt5b</italic>, <italic>Wnt6</italic>, <italic>Fzd6</italic> and <italic>Fzd9</italic>, observed in the adipose tissue from the transgenic mice, was not observed in 3T3-L1 cells exposed to adiponectin. Although these discrepancies might be explained by the distinct responsiveness of 3T3-L1 cells or the relatively short-term of exposure to adiponectin in the culture experiment, the expression of some Wnt-related genes in adipose tissue of the transgenic mice might be modified by endocrinologic and metabolic alterations resulting from hyperadiponectinemia.</p>
<p>In accordance with the <italic>in vivo</italic> observations of adiponectin-transgenic mice, p-CaMKII was decreased in 3T3-L1 cells after 24-h culture with adiponectin. By contrast, p-CaMKII was elevated after exposure to Wnt5a. The supplementation with adiponectin failed to inhibit the activation of CaMKII induced by Wnt5a, suggesting that the suppressive effect of adiponectin on the non-canonical signaling pathway is mainly due to the modulation of Wnt ligand expression rather than alterations in their receptors. As expected, phosphorylation of JNK, another non-canonical signaling molecule, was augmented in cells incubated with Wnt5a. However, exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to adiponectin also resulted in activation of JNK. This finding is not surprising because it was reported that adiponectin stimulates JNK <italic>ex vivo</italic> through the activation of phospholipase C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Miyazaki1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067712-Jung1">[44]</xref>. The suppression of JNK activity observed in adiponectin-transgenic mice may have been a more chronic effect of adiponectin.</p>
<p>Finally, we analyzed the alterations of Wnt-related gene expression in skeletal muscle from the transgenic mice and found that the expression of <italic>Wnt1</italic>, <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Wnt10b</italic>, <italic>Fzd7</italic>, <italic>Fzd10</italic>, and <italic>Lrp6</italic>, as well as the cyclooxygenase-2 gene, was reduced. All of the genes except <italic>Fzd10</italic> were also down-regulated in adipose tissue from the transgenic mice, although there was considerable organ-specificity in the response of the Wnt system to hyperadiponectinemia. The physiological relevance of the changes in Wnt-related gene expression in skeletal muscle found in this study requires further investigation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, using adiponectin-transgenic mice, we showed that chronic hyperadiponectinemia altered the expression pattern of Wnt ligands, Fzd receptors and the Lrp6 coreceptor in adipose tissue, suggesting that the inhibition of the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and JNK signaling pathways may be involved in the enhanced adipocyte differentiation and attenuated inflammation in adipose tissue induced by hyperadiponectinemia. Thus, adiponectin might exert these effects when adiponectin production is augmented by body weight loss or the administration of thiazolidine derivatives. However, further studies are required to elucidate the dose-response relationship and to determine whether adiponectin exhibits similar action in other tissues.</p>
