          <p>We showed here that Wnt5a activated Dvl2, Daam1 and RhoA, and promoted migration of breast cancer cells, which was, however, abolished by Secreted Frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP2) pretreatment. Dominant negative Dvl2 mutants or Dvl2 siRNA significantly decreased Wnt5a-induced Daam1/RhoA activation and cell migration. Ectopic expression of <italic>N</italic>-Daam1, a dominant negative mutant, or Daam1 siRNA remarkably inhibited Wnt5a-induced RhoA activation, stress fiber formation and cell migration. Ectopic expression of dominant negative RhoA (N19) or C3 exoenzyme transferase, a Rho inhibitor, decreased Wnt5a-induced stress fiber formation and cell migration.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Despite advances in the early diagnosis and adjuvant treatment of breast carcinoma, this disease still remains the most common malignancy of women worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Weigelt1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-MorenoAspitia1">[2]</xref>. Several improvements in understanding the molecular pathology of metastatic breast cancer have been achieved over the past decade. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this malignancy are still largely unknown. For this reason, elucidating the signaling pathways involved in the metastatic cascade is a key goal for developing novel effective therapeutics aimed at reducing cancer mortality rates.</p>
      <p>The Wnt signaling has historically been divided into two classes: the canonical (β-catenin dependent) and non-canonical (β-catenin independent) signaling pathway. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway has been implicated in promoting malignant transformation and tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Nusse1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Klaus1">[4]</xref>. Wnt/TCF signaling program, for example, has been reported to be capable of enhancing the competence of lung adenocarcinoma cells to colonize the bones and the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>, while very limited studies have been done on the role and mechanisms of non-canonical Wnt signaling in tumor progression. Wnt5a is a representative of Wnt proteins that activates non-canonical Wnt signaling. The Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway triggered by Wnt5a activates small Rho-GTPases and regulates the cytoskeletal architecture and cellular polarity during development and tissue homoeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Capelluto1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Habas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Yamanaka1">[8]</xref>. Wnt5a is classified as a non-transforming Wnt family member that plays complicated roles in oncogenesis and cancer metastasis. In malignant melanoma and gastric cancer, Wnt5a actually promotes cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Bittner1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Weeraratna1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Kurayoshi1">[11]</xref>. Conversely, Wnt5a functions as a tumor suppressor in colon, thyroid, and hepatocellular cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Kremenevskaja1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Dejmek1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Liu1">[14]</xref>. In the breast, dysregulated Wnt signaling appears to occur by autocrine mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Huguet1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Bafico1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Schlange1">[17]</xref>. Interference with autocrine Wnt signaling can block <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation of many human breast cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Bafico1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Schlange1">[17]</xref>. The non-transforming Wnt5a can inhibit breast epithelial cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Sfholm1">[18]</xref> and predicts longer disease-free survival for patients with breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Jnsson1">[19]</xref>. In contrast to the hypothesis that Wnt5a functions as a tumor suppressor, Wnt5a secreted by macrophages is proved to be essential for macrophage-induced invasiveness of breast cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Pukrop1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>These promiscuous viewpoints of Wnt5a in breast cancer progression led us to further elucidate the function of Wnt5a, and investigate the underlying mechanisms whereby cell migration is regulated. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that Wnt5a promotes the migration of breast cancer cells, and we report on the mechanisms whereby Wnt5a/PCP signaling regulates cell migration. Wnt5a signaling directly activates RhoA, which requires Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2) and Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (Daam1).</p>

        <p>The plasmids pCB6-GFP-RhoA-WT, V14 and N19 were kindly provided by Dr. Stéphane ORY (Institute of Cellular and Integrative Neurosciences, University of Strasbourg, France). Dr. Marc Fiedler (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK) generously provided the construct of human full-length Dvl2. The human full-length Daam1 was kindly gifted from Dr. Raymond Habas (Departments of Biochemistry and Pharmacology and Cancer Institute of New Jersey, USA). Mutant fragments of Dvl2 and Daam1 were generated by restriction digestion or a PCR approach and subcloned in pEGFP-N1 or pCS2 vectors. Details of plasmids are available upon request.</p>
        <p>MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, high glucose) (Hyclone, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone) in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY) and cultured to 80∼90% confluence, and then transiently transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in serum-free OPTI-MEM according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were switched to fresh medium containing 10% FBS 6 h after the transfection and cultured for 48 h. The cells transfected with Dvl2, Daam1 and RhoA constructs were used for analyzing the expression of these proteins and cell migration.</p>

        <p>MDA-MB-231 cells were plated onto 96-well cell culture clusters (Costar) and grown to confluence, and then serum-starved for 24 h. Recombinant sFRP2 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and C3 exoenzyme (Enzo Life Sciences, Plymouth Meeting, PA) were used 60 min before the scratch was made. The cells transfected with indicated plasmids were switched to fresh medium containing 10% FBS 6 h after the transfection and cultured for 48 h, and then serum-starved for 24 h. The monolayer cells were scratched manually with a plastic pipette tip, and after two washes with PBS, the wounded cellular monolayer was allowed to heal for 4 h in DMEM containing 500 ng/mL recombinant Wnt5a (rWnt5a) (R&amp;D Systems). Photographs of central wound edges per condition were taken at time 0 and at the indicated time points using PowerShot G10 camera (Canon, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

        <title>Cell migration assays</title>
        <p>Cell migration was assessed in a modified Boyden chamber (Costar), in which the two chambers were separated by a polycarbonate membrane (pore diameter, 8.0 µm). Boyden chamber wells were coated with human collagen I (20 µg/mL) for 1 h at 37°C. MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells were grown to subconfluence in tissue culture plates and then detached, after which they were centrifuged and rendered into single cell suspensions in serum-free culture medium supplemented with 5 µg/mL BSA. The suspensions containing 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells were added to wells with a membrane placed in the bottom. For MDA-MB-231 cell migration, medium containing 500 ng/mL rWnt5a was added to the upper and lower compartment of the Boyden chamber. For MCF-7 cell migration, serum-free medium was added to the upper and lower compartment of the Boyden chamber. The cells were allowed to migrate for the indicated periods of time at 37°C in this assay. Thereafter, the medium was discarded, stationary cells were removed with a cotton-tipped applicator and the membranes were cut out of the chamber and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. The response was evaluated in a light microscope by counting the number of cells that had migrated into the membrane.</p>

        <p>To assess the effect of Wnt5a on breast cancer cell migration, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with different doses of recombinant Wnt5a (rWnt5a), and measured the migration rate by wound healing assay. MDA-MB-231 cells expressed lower levels of Wnt5a than breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0037823.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), which is consistent with the previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Lejeune1">[22]</xref>.

We found that Wnt5a had a potent stimulatory effect on MDA-MB-231 cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037823-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). An approximately 2-fold increase in cell migration was observed in cells treated with 500 ng/mL rWnt5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037823-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0037823.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).

Dvl2 has three major functional domains: the DIX domain, the central PDZ domain, and the C-terminal DEP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037823-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The DIX domain is essential for β-catenin signaling but dispensable for PCP, whereas both the PDZ and DEP domains are required for PCP function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Axelrod1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Boutros1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Tada1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Heisenberg1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Wallingford1">[30]</xref>.

To further investigate the role of RhoA in cell migration, we transiently transfected MDA-MB-231 cells with GFP-tagged WT-RhoA, V14-RhoA (constitutively active mutant), or N19-RhoA (dominant negative mutant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037823-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Overexpression of abundant WT-RhoA or V14-RhoA had no effect on cell migration, but overexpression of N19-RhoA completely abolished Wnt5a-induced cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037823-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Thus, we concluded that RhoA activation was involved in Wnt5a-induced MDA-MB-231 cell migration.</p>

        <p>To examine whether RhoA regulated Daam1 in MDA-MB-231 cells, we detected the activity of Daam1 after transiently transfecting MDA-MB-231 cells with WT-RhoA and RhoA mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037823-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). There was no change in Daam1 activity after transfection in the absence or presence of Wnt5a. We further studied the coordinating role of Daam1 and RhoA activation in cell migration by transiently co-transfecting N19-RhoA and ΔDAD-Daam1 into MDA-MB-231 cells. We found that N19-RhoA and ΔDAD-Daam1 abolished Wnt5a-induced MDA-MB-231 migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037823-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Then, we examined whether Daam1 could activate RhoA in other human breast cancer cells. We transiently transfected MCF-7 cells, which express high levels of Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0037823.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), with ΔDAD-Daam1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037823-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>) and found that ΔDAD-Daam1 enhanced RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037823-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). Based on the similar pattern of Daam1 and RhoA activation between MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines, we speculated that active Daam1 can induce the migration of MCF-7. Indeed, overexpression of ΔDAD-Daam1 can promote MCF-7 migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037823-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>). Together, these data strongly suggested that Daam1 was required to induce RhoA activation and participated in Wnt5a-induced MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 migration.</p>
        <p>Rho GTPases are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-EtienneManneville1">[35]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Wnt5a is one of the most highly investigated non-canonical Wnts and has been implicated in almost all aspects of non-canonical Wnt signaling. Wnt5a was able to polarise the cellular cytoskeleton of melanoma cells through a process dependent on dishevelled, RhoB and Rab4 to promote cellular migration towards the source of the CXCL12 chemokine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Witze1">[36]</xref>. The second main Wnt5a-dependent pathway is the calcium-dependent signaling pathway, which could have an oncogenic effect by stimulating cancer cell invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-McDonald1">[37]</xref>. Wnt5a can also bind and activate the ROR2 tyrosine kinase receptor resulting in the activation of the actin-binding protein and the JNK signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Oishi1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Nomachi1">[39]</xref>. In addition to activating non-canonical signaling, Wnt5a is also able to inhibit the activation of the canonical signaling pathway either by calcium signaling through CamK II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Torres1">[40]</xref> or through the ROR2 signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Mikels1">[41]</xref>. Wnt5a has ample opportunity to influence cancer cell signaling, resulting in functional promiscuity on cancer development. Wnt5a actually promotes cancer progression and metastasis, such as malignant melanoma and gastric cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Bittner1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Weeraratna1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Kurayoshi1">[11]</xref>. Previous finding suggested that Wnt5a released from tumor-associated macrophages could have a chemotactic effect on breast cancer cells and thereby increase metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Pukrop1">[20]</xref>. However, some evidence supports the hypothesis that Wnt5a acts as a tumor and developmental suppressor in other breast experimental systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Sfholm1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Jnsson1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Roarty1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Sfholm2">[43]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A primary observation in the present study is that Wnt5a induces the migration of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which lacks endogenous Wnt5a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Lejeune1">[22]</xref>. It would also be of interest to compare the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway in normal and breast cancer cells. We found that, similar to the findings by other investigators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Lejeune1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-FernandezCobo1">[44]</xref>, Wnt5a expression pattern in normal breast cells MCF-10A was similar to that in breast cancer cells (data not shown). However, Wnt5a expression in MCF-10A cells changes in response to <italic>in vitro</italic> growth such as in the presence of EGF, indicating that Wnt5a signaling cannot be reliably studied in such a model system. SFRP2 has been shown to also enhance canonical Wnt signalling, rather than just inhibit it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Mii1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-vonMarschall1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Bovolenta1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Mii2">[48]</xref>. The transcription of Wnt/β-catenin target genes was increased by forming a complex with LEF/TCF (lymphoid enhancer factor/T cell factor) DNA-binding proteins. We detected the nuclear translocation of β-catenin to illustrate the interaction of sFRP2 and canonical Wnt signaling. SFRP2 does not alter the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in MDA-MB-231 cells.</p>
      <p>A large number of studies have indicated that Wnt5a commands a tumor-suppressing effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Dejmek1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Jnsson1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Ying1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Blanc1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Liang1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-RomanGomez1">[52]</xref>. A few studies have pointed to Wnt5a having an oncogenic role in tumors arising from a variety of different tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Kurayoshi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-DaForno1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Huang1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Ripka1">[55]</xref>. Most studies have involved limited sample sets and a significant number have not detailed expression at both the RNA and protein levels. Studies with much larger sample sets will provide the necessary statistical power to validate the extent of the downregulation of Wnt5a in cancer. On the other hand, the potential role for increased Wnt5a expression in malignant melanoma has recently been outlined as a study established that nuclear beta-catenin levels are higher in primary tumors than in metastases and that low expression of nuclear beta-catenin expression in primary tumors predicts poor survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Chien1">[56]</xref>. Metastatic neuroblasts in a xenograft model displayed lower Wnt5a expression than the primary neuroblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Blanc1">[50]</xref>. These suggest that the Wnt5a effect is disparate between primary tumors and metastases. Most studies on Wnt5a expression in cancer patient materials focus on tumorigenesis of primary tumors. Studies of establishing cancer metastases models in cancer patient materials will bring new opinion about the clinical situation.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that Wnt5a may promote tumor progression through inducing actin reorganization and increasing cell motility <italic>via</italic> activating the PKC and calcium signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Weeraratna1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Witze1">[36]</xref>. However, the roles of Wnt5a/PCP signaling are poorly defined in cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated that Wnt5a promotes MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell migration by activating Dvl2/Daam1. Dvl phosphorylation, which is the most proximal signaling event downstream of membrane receptor activation, can be monitored by a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of phosphorylated Dvl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Lee1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-GonzlezSancho1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Matsuda1">[57]</xref>. Consistent with these reports, we found that Wnt5a induced Dvl2 phosphorylation rapidly and transiently in MDA-MB-231 cells. Blocking Dvl2 signaling by Dvl2 mutants or siRNA transfection completely abolished Wnt5a-induced cell migration, indicating that Dvl2 activation participates in the regulation of the MDA-MB-231 migration. However, overexpression of Dvl2 did not further promote cell migration, indicating that endogenous Dvl2 is sufficient for mediating Wnt5a-induced cell migration. By immunohistochemistry, Dvl1 was shown to be expressed in 50% of human breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Nagahata1">[58]</xref>. Wnt5a can also activate Dvl3 by a CK1-dependent mechanism in dopaminergic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Bryja1">[59]</xref>. Whether Dvl1 and Dvl3, homologs of Dvl2, induce the migration of breast cancer cells needs to be further studied.</p>
      <p>Daam1 contains multiple regulatory domains. In unstimulated cells, Daam1 exists in an auto-inhibited state by intramolecular interaction between its N-terminal GBD and C-terminal DAD domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Liu2">[32]</xref>. Our results showed that Wnt5a remarkably activated Daam1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. As previously reported, overexpression of <italic>N</italic>-Daam1 inhibits the interaction between Daam1 and Dvl2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Habas2">[31]</xref>. Interference of Daam1 function <italic>via N</italic>-Daam1 overexpression or knockdown of Daam1 expression <italic>via</italic> siRNA transfection inhibited RhoA activation and cell migration by Wnt5a/Dvl2 in MDA-MB-231 cells. But overexpression of <italic>C</italic>-Daam1 and ΔDAD-Daam1, two activated forms of Daam1, did not further promote cell migration. Furthermore, we tested the ability of ΔDAD-Daam1 in stimulating cell migration in a different breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Constitutively active ΔDAD-Daam1 induced RhoA activation, the formation of stress fibers, and migration of MCF-7 cells, indicating that Daam1 may be specifically required for the activation of Dvl2 after Wnt5a treatment in breast cancer cells.</p>
      <p>Wnt signaling activates the small GTPase Rho during <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryogenesis and neurite retraction of mouse neuroblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Habas2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Kim1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Tsuji1">[61]</xref>. In our study, specific downregulation of Dvl2/Daam1 signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells suppresses Wnt5a-induced activation of RhoA, and upregulation of Daam1 in MCF-7 cells induces RhoA activation. Furthermore, blocking RhoA activity significantly retards Wnt5a-induced stress fiber formation and cell migration. Similarly, previous studies have reported that activated RhoA is critical for breast tumor invasion and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Suwa1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Fritz1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037823-Bourguignon1">[64]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that Wnt5a-induced RhoA activation may participate in the regulation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell migration. Further studies are needed to decipher whether Wnt5a/PCP signaling products function in a common Rho pathway or in parallel pathways.</p>
      <p>In summary, we presented the first direct evidence that Wnt5a promotes breast cancer cell migration <italic>via</italic> Dvl2/Daam1/RhoA. These findings elucidate a molecular pathway linking Wnt5a signaling with RhoA in governing cytoskeletal architecture and cell motility, which may represent a rational molecular target for manipulating breast cancer.</p>
