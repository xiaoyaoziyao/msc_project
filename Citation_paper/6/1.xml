<title>Purpose</title>
<p>As result of the current demographic changes, osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures are becoming an increasing social and economic burden. In this experimental study, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), was evaluated as a treatment option for the improvement of osteoporotic fracture healing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A well-established fracture model in the metaphyseal tibia in the osteoporotic rat was used. 132 animals were divided into 11 groups, with 12 animals each, consisting of one sham-operated group and 10 ovariectomized (osteoporotic) groups, of which 9 received ESWT treatment. Different energy flux intensities (0.15 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, 0.35 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, or 0.55 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>) as well as different numbers of ESWT applications (once, three times, or five times throughout the 35-day healing period) were applied to the osteoporotic fractures. Fracture healing was investigated quantitatively and qualitatively using micro-CT imaging, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, histomorphometric analysis and biomechanical analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The results of this study show a qualitative and quantitative improvement in the osteoporotic fracture healing under low-energy (energy flux intensity: 0,15 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>) ESWT and with fewer treatment applications per healing period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, low-energy ESWT seems to exhibit a beneficial effect on the healing of osteoporotic fractures, leading to improved biomechanical properties, enhanced callus-quantity and -quality, and an increase in the expression of bone specific transcription factors. The results suggest that low-energy ESWT, as main treatment or as adjunctive treatment in addition to a surgical intervention, may prove to be an effective, simple to use, and cost-efficient option for the qualitative and quantitative improvement of osteoporotic fracture healing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Due to the continuous changes in the demographic age pattern, the number of elderly people, and with it the prevalence of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures, is steadily increasing. In 2000, there already were an estimated 9 million fractures caused by osteoporosis worldwide and this number will continue to rise in the decades to come [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref001">1</xref>]. Due to the elevation of the prevalence of osteoporosis and its fractures, and its potentially severe consequences, the World Health Organization (WHO) has decided to list this disorder among its ten most severe diseases of current times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref002">2</xref>]. Accompanied by a high morbidity and mortality as well as potentially resulting disability, immobility and extensive rehabilitational requirements, osteoporotic fractures have become a highly relevant clinical as well as economical issue for society and the medical health care system.</p>
<p>Regarding groups at risk, especially postmenopausal women are affected and have a significantly higher chance of sustaining an osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime than their male counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref003">3</xref>]. In fact, over 70% of all fractures occur in women aged 65 and older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref004">4</xref>]. During this postmenopausal phase, a hormonal change takes place, increasing general bone-turnover and resulting in greater bone resorption than bone formation, which increases bone frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref005">5</xref>]. Although there is also a certain decrease in cortical thickness, it is the deterioration of the trabecular microarchitecture, mainly located at the metaphysis, which leaves the bone in this area most prone to damage. Not only does the high incidence of osteoporotic fractures itself pose a problem, but so does the immediate and distant aftermath. Osteoporotic fracture healing is qualitatively inferior and significantly slower than normal, non-osteoporotic bone healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref010">10</xref>]. This leads to prolonged recovery periods with suboptimal bone formation and an increased risk for sustaining further fractures, possibly at the same site.</p>
<p>The severely diminished quality of bone in osteoporotic fractures usually requires surgical fixation with an adequate osteosynthesis technique. However, the frail microarchitecture and lowered bone mass density leads to instability and to longer healing periods, as well as related complications such as loosening or complete detachment of the hardware [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref011">11</xref>]. Therefore, an alternative or adjunct treatment option, improving this issue, is essential. The current treatment options concerning osteoporosis are limited mainly to pharmacological modalities. These primarily systemically administered medications are not only accompanied by a variety of side effects, but also by high costs and poor patient compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref012">12</xref>]. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) could therefore present a very promising alternative to systemic medication for osteoporotic fractures, with its simple application and few to no side-effects.</p>
<p>The benefits of ESWT on non-osteoporotic bone have already been reported in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref017">17</xref>]. To date, however, there has been very little published regarding the effect of ESWT on the healing of osteoporotic fractures and the existing studies have mainly examined the diaphyseal femur and tibia. However, since osteoporosis mainly affects the metaphyseal part of bone, which, contrary to the diaphyseal healing by periosteal callus formation, heals predominantly by endosteal callus formation, osteoporotic fracture healing should be investigated at the metaphyseal site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref021">21</xref>]. To date, a broad range of energy flux intensities have been used, ranging from 0.0031–0.890 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, and various numbers of ESWT treatments were reported, with no consensus on an intensity or the number of treatments during the healing phase for optimal osteoporotic fracture healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ESWT on the healing properties of metaphyseal fractures in a well-established osteoporotic rat model and to simultaneously investigate the optimal range of ESWT energy flux intensity and the ideal number of applications throughout the healing period able to achieve the most beneficial healing parameters regarding osteoporotic fracture healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref021">21</xref>].</p>

<title>General procedures</title>
<p>The animal study protocol received approval by the local regional government. It conformed to the German animal protection laws and received permission from the District Government of Koblenz (03.04.2012, 23177-07/G 12-7-027).</p>
<p>132, three-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Envigo (Veneray, Netherlands). 120 of these animals had undergone bilateral ovariectomy, while the remaining 12 animals were SHAM-operated, meaning they received identical procedures and incisions without removal of the ovaries. The SHAM-group served as the non-osteoporotic, positive control group. The ovariectomy-procedures were performed by Envigo (Veneray Netherlands) at an age of 2 months under isoflurane anesthesia. All rats were held under the same conditions prior to their delivery to the Ludwigshafen animal lab facilities.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, the 132 animals were divided into 11 study groups, each consisting of 12 animals. They were housed in standard Makrolon M-IV cages (Techniplast, Pontremoli, Italy) in non-changing groups of 3–5 animals per cage, under a 12-hour dark-light photo regimen and at 22 ± 2°C constant temperature as well as constant humidity of 50 ± 10%. The animal grouping did not change throughout the entire experiment. The animals were weighed and provided with Soy-, estrogen- and phytoestrogen-free food pellets (Ssniff, Spezialdiäten GmbH, Soest, Germany). All animals had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water and were allowed to move about their cages freely.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Bilateral osteotomy and ESWT-application</title>
<p>Eight weeks post ovariectomy, the ovariectomized animals had developed manifest osteoporosis according to a standardized protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref023">23</xref>]. The ovariectomized as well as the SHAM-ovariectomized animals then underwent a bilateral metaphyseal transverse osteotomy of the proximal <italic>tibia</italic> under general anesthesia with Isoflurane (2%, Isoflo, Albrecht, Aulendorf, Germany). A 1 mm osteotomy gap, 5 mm distal to the tibia plateau, was created using an oscillating, pulsed ultrasound saw (Piezosurgery<sup>®</sup>, Mectron Medical Technology, Cologne, Germany). The fracture fixation was conducted on the ventromedial aspect of the tibia with a 1.5 cm long and 0.6 mm profile 5-hole Y-plate (Biomet, Berlin, Germany) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189356.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Postoperative analgesia, consisting of Rimadyl (5mg/kg, Carprofen, Zoetis, Berlin, Germany), was weight-adjusted for each rat and administered for 2 consecutive days, with the first dose administered immediately postoperatively.</p>

<p>During the 35-day fracture-healing period, the animals were subjected to different regimes of ESWT according to their study-group designation. Both hindlegs of each animal received identical treatment. The ESWT applications were conducted under general anesthesia with Isoflurane. The ESWT was administered with an extracorporeal shockwave applicator (Duolith SD1, Karl Storz GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany). The study design contained three different energy flux intensities (0.15 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>; 0.35 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>; 0.55 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>) each at 2000 impulses and at 1 Hz, and three different numbers of applications of the ESWT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189356.t001">Table 1</xref>). The fracture healing period was set for 35 days. This time frame was chosen because callus formation at this point in time is stable, and peripheral resorption of the callus has not yet begun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref021">21</xref>].</p>

<title>Specimen preparation</title>
<p>At day 35 post osteotomy, the animals were anesthetized as previously described, followed by animal sacrifice utilizing an overdose of Narcoren (Merial GmbH, Halbergmoos, Germany). Then a vertical abdominal midline incision was performed, and the uterus of each animal was harvested and weighed. Both hindlimbs of each animal were reopened, the ligaments of the knee, as well as the patellar ligament were detached from the <italic>tibiae</italic>. The <italic>tibia</italic> and <italic>fibula</italic> were then freed of any remaining muscle-tissue and exarticulated at the proximal and distal <italic>tibia-fibulan</italic> joints. The Y-plates and screws were carefully removed prior to each experiment. For the PCR samples, the callus of the randomly designated <italic>tibiae</italic> was collected from the fracture site and immediately frozen at -80°C. All other tibiae were frozen at -20°C until conduction of the investigations via micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging, biomechanical analyses or histomorphometric analyses. From each animal study group, 6 <italic>tibiae</italic> were allocated to each of the four aforementioned investigations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Radiographic imaging and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT)</title>
<p>The frozen <italic>tibiae</italic> were thawed for three hours at room temperature. During this time the <italic>tibiae</italic> were subjected to radiographic imaging in an anterior-posterior and latero-medial fashion to verify the integrity of the fracture site and the alignment of the bone segments in relation to the fracture site. Immediately upon the cessation of the three hours, each <italic>tibia</italic> was then subjected to individual micro-computed tomography scans using an industrial micro-CT (Y.Fox; Yxlon International GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). For the evaluation of the images, the software OSIRIX (Pixmeo, SARL, Bernex, Switzerland) was used. The proximal <italic>tibia</italic> metaphysis above the fracture was visualized in the transverse plane, and the number of trabecular nodes present was counted. This was done as a means of confirming the presence of osteoporosis and adequate fracture alignment in the animals.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Biomechanical analyses</title>
<p>The newly formed <italic>tibial</italic> callus was analyzed for the biomechanical parameters stiffness (S), yield load (yL), maximum load (Fmax) and failure load (fL) through a 3-point bending/breaking test using a ZWICK-testing machine (ZWICK-testing machine type Z020/TND; ZWICK-/Roell, Ulm, Germany) according to an established protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref025">25</xref>]. Each <italic>tibia</italic> was individually placed onto a friction-minimizing mobile, ball-mounted platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref024">24</xref>]. The stamp was aligned onto the ventral <italic>tibia</italic> metaphysis to apply force (Newton) precisely onto the fracture site. The feed-motion’s speed was set at 1cm/min. The trial was automatically stopped when the stamp’s linear displacement distance exceeded 0.5 cm or if the force-drop exceeded 80% of the maximum applied force. Using the software “testXpert” (Zwick GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Ulm, Germany), the force was then graphically plotted against the travelled distance of the stamp, resulting in a curve with linear progression. Statistical evaluation of the different values for S, yL, Fmax, and fL were analyzed in an unconnected t-test. P &lt; 0.05 was considered to be significant.</p>

<title>Histomorphometric analyses</title>
<p>Intravital fluorochrome labeling (IFL) was used to determine the location, the amount, and the timing of callus and bone formation throughout the healing period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref026">26</xref>]. This was done by subcutaneously injecting fluorescent dyes on pre-determined days after the osteotomy. The stains used were Xylenol orange (XO, 90 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) applied on day 13, Calcein green (CG, green 10 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) applied on day 18, and Alizarin red (AR, red, 30 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) applied on days 24 and 26[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>After micro-CT and biomechanical analysis, the <italic>tibiae</italic> underwent histomorphometric analysis. For this, the tibiae underwent sequential, ascending concentrations of ethanol. Subsequently they were embedded in Technovit ® 9100 methylmethacrylate (Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Wehrheim, Germany). 10 μm longitudinal slices were cut in the <italic>tibia’s</italic> sagittal plane with a Microtome (Reichert Jung 2050 SuperCut Motorized Microtome, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and placed on slides, then dried under pressure and 42°C heat for 72 hours. The three consecutive center sections were digitalized using a digital light microscope (Axioskop, Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) at a magnification of 100x, the analysis software Axiovision (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) was used. The sections always included the whole proximal <italic>tibia</italic> and the distal <italic>tibia</italic> up to the distal third of the diaphysis, thereby always including the fracture site. The callus was divided into different areas of interest, namely the ventro-medial area, the endosteal area, and the dorsal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189356.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). These sections were evaluated for the amount of each individual fluorochrome dye bound to the newly build callus in mm<sup>2</sup> with the digital imaging software ImageJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189356.g002">Fig 2B</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref029">29</xref>].

<title>Gene expression analysis</title>
<p>The metaphyseal callus samples were homogenized using TriFast (VWR/PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany) and a rotor-stator-homogenizer (Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany). The total RNA was isolated using the Trizol method including DNA-digestion (RNase-free DNase Set Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA was eluted in a final volume of 30μl RNase-free H<sub>2</sub>O. The total RNA concentration was determined using an Eppendorf Biospectrometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) then stored at -80°C until further processing.</p>
<p>Reverse transcription of the RNA samples (1 μg per sample) was conducted using the OmniScript RT Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions for first-strand synthesis using random hexamer and oligo(dT) primers. The cDNA was stored at -20°C.</p>
<p>Relative quantification of mRNA was performed in a two-step real-time RT-PCR procedure using the fluorescent dye SYBR Green I (LightCycler480 SYBR Green I Master, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and a Light Cycler 480 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the following rat-genes: Osteocalcin (OC), Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), Collagen 1-alpha-1 (Coll1α1), Estrogen Receptor-α (ERα), Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP), and 18-Svedberg ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA). Primer sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189356.t002">Table 2</xref>. The PCR-reactions were performed with 2 μl of cDNA, 0.5 μM of sense and antisense primers and 10 μl of Lightcycler480 SYBR Green I Master reaction mix in a total volume of 20 μl. The cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 10 min at a ramp speed of 4,8°C/sec, 45 cycles consisting of 94°C for 15 sec at a ramp speed of 4,8°C/sec, 60°C for 10 sec at a ramp speed of 2,5°C/sec, 72°C for 10 sec at a ramp speed of 4,8°C/sec, followed by a melting point analysis: 95°C for 5 sec, 65°C for 30 sec, continuous heating to 97°C at a ramp speed of 0.1°C/sec (5 Acquisitions per second), and finally a cooling phase: 40°C for 30 sec at a ramp speed of 2°C/sec. All obtained results were corrected to 18S rRNA in each sample.</p>

<title>Histomorphometric analyses</title>
<p>Of the three different fluorochrome colors, it was not possible to evaluate the fluorescent dye Xylenol orange as the islands formed were very small and partially overpowered by intensely green colored areas of Calcein green, and could therefore not be evaluated. Thus, we had to exclude the dye Xylenol orange from this study. The investigated fluorochrome labeled sections, Calcein green and Alizarin red, showed that most callus apposition occurred in the endosteal region, followed by the dorsal region. Least callus was formed in the ventral section of the <italic>tibial</italic> fracture. The dorsal callus displayed a greater area of Calcein green while in the endosteal and ventral callus, the domains stained by Alizarin red dominated slightly.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Within the last decades, osteoporosis has grown into a major health care issue caused by the change in population age demographics and resulting in rising health care costs and health care resource depletion. This demonstrates the importance of establishing therapy options and treatment modalities which will improve the osteoporotic fracture healing process. This study looked at the influence of focused ESWT on the metaphyseal fracture healing in an osteoporotic rat model, and found an improvement in the quantitative and qualitative healing properties of osteoporotic metaphyseal fractures of the rat tibia under low-energy ESWT.</p>
<p>To ensure that our model was conducted in the proper osteoporotic setting, the success of the ovariectomy was confirmed by assessing changes in body weight and uterus weight at the time of sacrifice. The body weight of the OVXs animals was significantly higher compared to the SHAM animals, which is indicative of a successful ovariectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref030">30</xref>]. Additionally, the uterus weight of the ovariectomized animals was significantly lower than that of the SHAM animals, which can be attributed to the lack of hormonal uterus-tissue stimulation, again in accordance with a successful ovariectomy. Further, micro-CT evaluation of the number of trabecular nodes (n.Nd) showed the typical bone loss in the trabecular network (trabecular nodes) with a significant loss of trabecular nodes in the ovariectomized animals compared to the SHAM animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189356.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Therefore, the integrity of the osteoporotic rat model was verified.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action with which ESWT influences bone is not yet fully understood and remains subject of discussion. The positive influence of ESWT on fractures was initially attributed to the induction of microtraumata, microlesions and the formation of haematoma, which was thought to induce neo-vascularization and activate osteoblasts and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref032">32</xref>]. More recent literature showed that neovascularization is caused through increased expression of angiogenetic growth factors such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in tendons, bone and the tendon-bone transitions. Furthermore, there is a direct activation of fibroblasts and subsequent transformation into osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref034">34</xref>]. The expression of different mediators as the mechanism of action of extracorporeal shock waves is hypothesized to originate in the concept of mechanotransduction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref036">36</xref>]. It is assumed to be responsible for the activation of different genes and intracellular signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref037">37</xref>]. For example, Xu <italic>et al</italic>. have found that the expression of a transmembrane protein, the integrin α5ß1, found on the surface of osteoblasts, is elevated in response to extracorporeal shock wave treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref037">37</xref>]. Our study did not intend to investigate the mechanism of action, but rather the influence of ESWT on osteoporotic fracture healing.</p>
<p>The results of this study found that focused low-energy ESWT has a beneficial effect on the quantitative and qualitative healing properties and characteristics of osteoporotic fractures when compared to osteoporotic fractures without ESWT treatment. The biomechanical properties showed an improvement under low-energy (energy flux intensity 0.15 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>) ESWT. Van der Jagt <italic>et al</italic>., using an energy flux intensity of 0.16mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, also found that ESWT treatment led to significantly improved biomechanical properties of osteoporotic bone (without fracture) in an osteoporotic rat model. They found an increase in the stiffness of 10% and an increase of the maximum load of 14% when compared to non-osteoporotic bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref038">38</xref>]. Chen <italic>et al</italic>. had similar results in their osteoporotic <italic>tibia</italic> metaphyseal fracture rat model using an energy flux intensity of 0.25 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>. They found a significant increase in the maximum load (p &lt; 0.05) and a 25.5% increase in the failure load under high energy shock wave treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>The investigation of the trabecular nodes found in the micro-CT analysis showed that there was a significantly lower number of trabecular nodes in the ovariectomized groups than in the in the SHAM group (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the number of trabecular nodes between the ovariectomized groups themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189356.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Further parameters of the micro-CT analysis were not investigated, however it would be interesting to see in future experiments, under a comprehensive micro-CT analysis, if there is a significant difference in the trabecular network between ovariectomized animals with and without ESWT treatment. If there is no significant difference in the trabecular network between the osteoporotic groups with and without ESWT, it should be further investigated if ESWT within the examined time period solely exert an influence on the callus and not on the trabecular network. This could pose the question whether ESWT could be used for treating osteoporotic fractures, but may not exhibit a beneficial effect when used for treating osteoporosis in osteoporotic bone. In literature, Chen <italic>et al</italic>., in a <italic>tibial</italic> fracture model in osteoporotic rats, found a 20.9% higher average trabecular thickness in the ovariectomized group treated with ESWT (0.26 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>) than in the ovariectomized control group not treated with ESWT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref039">39</xref>]. They also found a 28.4% higher number of trabeculae in the treatment group compared to their control group. Van der Jagt <italic>et al</italic>. found, in an osteoporotic rat model without a fracture, that ESWT (0.3 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>) led to a higher trabecular thickness and a lower connectivity density of the trabeculae in the group treated with ESWT than in the ovariectomized control group without ESWT treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref038">38</xref>]. The differences were not significant however. The heterogeneity of results indicates that there is a need for further investigation regarding ESWT and the effect on the trabecular architecture.</p>
<p>Regarding callus quantity, this study found an increase in callus formation under low-energy ESWT, especially in the endosteal and dorsal areas. By the appositional pattern of Alizarin Red, it has been shown that there was more callus formed around days 24 and 26, than by apposition of Calcein Green around day 18. Chen <italic>et al</italic>., using 0.26 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, also found greater callus formation in the treated group than in the control group. In fact, the callus volume was 20.1% (p &lt; 0.05) higher in the fracture group treated with high energy shock waves (HESW) than the ovariectomized group without treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref039">39</xref>]. They did not, however, investigate the three sections (ventral, endosteal, dorsal) separately. Their study used intramedullary pins for fracture osteosynthesis, compared to the Y-plate system utilized in this study. This prevents full endosteal callus formation, and may have an impact on the mechanical environment influencing callus formation. Van der Jagt <italic>et al</italic>. also found that unfocused extracorporeal shock waves (UESW) have a beneficial effect on osteoporotic bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref040">40</xref>]. In their experiment, they used an energy flux intensity of 0.16 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> on the metaphyseal <italic>tibia</italic> in an osteoporotic rat model and found that 3 weeks after ESWT treatment, the trabecular volume was 110% of the baseline value, while the control group only displayed 101% of the initial baseline value (p = 0.001). However, they did not find the UESW therapy to have any effect on the fibular osteotomy regarding bone morphometric parameters. The said study, however, was done with unfocused ESWT and a <italic>fibular</italic> fracture model. Further investigations are necessary to analyze the influence of different study design parameters on the outcome.</p>
<p>This study also investigated osteoblast and osteoclast specific transcription factors and found that there was an increase in their gene-expression under low-energy ESWT therapy. There were increases in all tested osteoblast transcription factors, OC, IGF-1, Coll1α1, ERα, as well as in the tested osteoclast transcription factor TRAP, showing that both cell types were activated by the application of ESWT, supporting the idea that ESWT may have a fundamental influence leading to the activation of complex pathways within the cells. In current literature, the influence on gene expression of ESWT applied to osteoporotic fractures has to date not been sufficiently investigated. In a non-osteoporotic bone defect in a rat model, Chen <italic>et al</italic>. found, under ESWT with an energy flux density of 0.16 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, mesenchymal stem cells were recruited and the expression of TGF-ß1 and VEGF-A in the regenerating bone tissue was significantly increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref041">41</xref>]. Ma <italic>et al</italic>., in an experiment looking at necrotic femoral heads in a rabbit model, found an increase in gene expression of BMP-2 under ESWT application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref042">42</xref>]. Wang <italic>et al</italic>. also found an increase in BMP-2, VEGF, PCNA and eNOS in a rabbit study treating non-osteoporotic long bone fractures with ESWT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref016">16</xref>]. Further Wang <italic>et al</italic>. found, that the serum levels of BMP-2, VEGF, PCNA and eNOS in bony non-unions treated with ESWT in a clinical study were significantly elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref043">43</xref>]. An <italic>in vitro</italic> study done by Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>. looking at the influence of shock waves on human osteoblasts, did not find any change in the expression of TGF-ß1, Osteocalcin, Osteopontin, or Osteonectin. They did however find an increase of PTHrP and PGER3, factors important for osteoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref044">44</xref>]. Most of the literature published supports our finding that low-energy ESWT stimulate an increase in gene expression and thus transcription factors important to bone and fracture healing. Since the evidence of the influence of ESWT on osteoporotic bone and fracture healing to date is underrepresented, again, further investigations are necessary.</p>
<p>So far varying strengths of energy flux intensities have been used in past studies, ranging from 0.003–0.890 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref022">22</xref>]. Studies have shown that biological responses are initiated at around 0.15 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> and 500 pulses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref046">46</xref>]. In this study, the lower energy flux intensities (0.15 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>) had a more beneficial effect on the biomechanical properties, the amount of formed callus and the gene expression than did the higher energy flux intensities. The influence of the number of applications (once, three-times, five-times) did not seem to have as much of a notable influence on the osteoporotic fracture healing, suggesting that the important parameter influencing the quality and quantity of osteoporotic fracture healing is the energy flux intensity with which the fracture is treated. Looking at the results, the optimum beneficial range for osteoporotic fracture healing seems to lie in the combination of lower energy flux intensities, such as 0.15 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> and lower numbers of one to three applications during the fracture healing period. Energy levels of 0.54–0.9 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> have been shown to cause trabecular disruption and fracturing of the cortex, supporting our finding of the effectiveness of the lower energy intensities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189356.ref047">47</xref>]. Higher energy flux intensities, as well as higher numbers of applications thus seem to be rather detrimental to the cause, and was in concordance with our results. This may be due to the potential physical and mechanical damage done to the trabecular network and the newly formed callus and bone, accompanied by the subsequent possible interruption of the healing process.</p>
<p>There are certain limitations to our study. A limitation in this study is the fact that we were not able to evaluate the areas of the callus stained by Xylenol orange. In prior, preliminary studies that have been conducted, no problems evaluating this fluorescent dye were encountered. A possibility explaining the lack of early xylenol orange labeled bone could be the result of bone turnover by the time the specimens were collected and examined after 35 days of fracture healing. One possible cause may be the elevation of TRAP levels (especially as seen in the 1 x 0.15 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> group), which would have to be investigated in further studies. Since it was not possible to evaluate the callus stained by Xylenol orange in this study, we are not able to objectively make any assumptions regarding the very early phase of callus formation. A further limitation of this study is that energy intensities lower than 0.15 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> were not examined. This also needs to be investigated in further studies to see if there is a beneficial effect on the callus formation and fracture healing below our lowest intensity of 0.15 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>In summary, this study suggests that low-energy ESWT has a beneficial effect on the metaphyseal, <italic>tibial</italic> osteoporotic fracture healing in an osteoporotic rat model. This treatment modality led to an improvement of biomechanical properties, histomorphometrical parameters, also osteoblast and osteoclast activity. Further, the study suggests that the beneficial spectrum of energy flux intensities lies in the lower energy flux intensities, for example, as found in this study, around 0.15 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>. These results support the experimental basis for ESWT use. Translating these beneficial ESWT tendencies into clinical practice through further studies, this treatment potentially could, as either a single therapy modality or as an adjunctive treatment option, improve osteoporotic fracture healing, with the group of focus represented by especially the elderly population, maybe leading to faster and qualitatively superior callus properties. Furthermore, ESWT is simple to apply, cost efficient and has few to no side effects. Additional studies are needed, but it could hold potential for providing a new treatment modality, possibly improving the qualitative and quantitative outcome of the osteoporotic fracture healing process, potentially leading decreased patient morbidity and mortality as well as decreased health care costs.</p>
