<abstract>
<p>Molecular mechanisms employed by individual multipotent cells at the point of lineage commitment remain largely uncharacterized. Current paradigms span from instructive to noise-driven mechanisms. Of considerable interest is also whether commitment involves a limited set of genes or the entire transcriptional program, and to what extent gene expression configures multiple trajectories into commitment. Importantly, the transient nature of the commitment transition confounds the experimental capture of committing cells. We develop a computational framework that simulates stochastic commitment events, and affords mechanistic exploration of the fate transition. We use a combined modeling approach guided by gene expression classifier methods that infers a time-series of stochastic commitment events from experimental growth characteristics and gene expression profiling of individual hematopoietic cells captured immediately before and after commitment. We define putative regulators of commitment and probabilistic rules of transition through machine learning methods, and employ clustering and correlation analyses to interrogate gene regulatory interactions in multipotent cells. Against this background, we develop a Monte Carlo time-series stochastic model of transcription where the parameters governing promoter status, mRNA production and mRNA decay in multipotent cells are fitted to experimental static gene expression distributions. Monte Carlo time is converted to physical time using cell culture kinetic data. Probability of commitment in time is a function of gene expression as defined by a logistic regression model obtained from experimental single-cell expression data. Our approach should be applicable to similar differentiating systems where single cell data is available. Within our system, we identify robust model solutions for the multipotent population within physiologically reasonable values and explore model predictions with regard to molecular scenarios of entry into commitment. The model suggests distinct dependencies of different commitment-associated genes on mRNA dynamics and promoter activity, which globally influence the probability of lineage commitment.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Stem cells have the capacity to both self-renew and differentiate into specialized cell lineages, thus sustaining tissue formation during embryonic development and permitting tissue homeostasis throughout adult life. Previous studies have suggested that stem cell commitment to a specific lineage may constitute a discrete event of stochastic activation of a small number of key regulator genes. Experimental exploration of this question is challenging, in face of the elusive nature of the commitment transition and due to considerable gene expression heterogeneity between cells. Here, we implement a computational model that simulates gene expression variation through time and affords the capture of <italic>in silico</italic> commitment events. This model integrates statistical analysis of experimental single-cell gene expression data with dynamical modeling methods to implement a mechanistic framework for stochastic regulation of gene transcription and a probabilistic approach for the commitment rules. Applied to blood cells, our method identifies potential commitment-associated genes, explores how their expression patterns can define alternative commitment regimes, and suggests how differences in regulation of gene expression dynamics can impact the frequency of commitment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Understanding how primary stem and multipotent progenitor cells decide their fate is pivotal in studying mechanisms driving tissue development and maintenance in multicellular organisms. Despite considerable advances in ascribing key genes and regulatory circuits to specific lineages, the diversity of molecular mechanisms employed by individual cells to commit to particular lineage fates remains largely uncharacterized. Recent technical developments in quantitative measurements of single-cell gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Larson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Raj1">[2]</xref> have revealed stem and progenitor cell populations to be highly heterogeneous, and suggest that individual cells can exhibit transient biases towards different lineages, even in clonal populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Canham1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Moignard1">[10]</xref>. This molecular heterogeneity may result from stochastic fluctuations caused by noisy gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Raser1">[11]</xref>, leading to fluctuations in individual mRNA molecule transcription and degradation rates, and likewise for protein production in individual cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Elowitz1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Ozbudak1">[13]</xref>. Also, genes switch between active and inactive states, alternating between variable-length transcriptional bursts that can produce a large number of mRNA molecules, and refractory periods in which transcription is significantly reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Chubb1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Raj2">[15]</xref>. Molecular mechanisms of commitment have been suggested to involve various degrees of gene expression coordination, from activation of a few genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Eser1">[16]</xref> to gradual accumulation of a transcriptome-wide coordinated program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Chang1">[17]</xref>. Finally, the role of external cues (e.g. growth factors) in commitment remains unresolved, with a long-standing debate on whether they can instruct cells to commit to a particular fate, or do merely act as survival factors of cells that have committed through intrinsic mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Enver1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Rieger1">[19]</xref>. A considerable hurdle in elucidating these questions is the elusive nature of the lineage commitment transition, which confounds the experimental capture of cells undergoing commitment. Recent advances in microscopy and imaging techniques enabled the tracking of single cells in time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Schroeder1">[20]</xref>. However, the ability of such methods to simultaneously track expression of multiple genes at the single molecule level is still limited, more so for endogenous genes, which may have a role in effecting commitment decisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Raj1">[2]</xref>. Additionally, the molecular heterogeneity of individual committed cells poses a challenge for defining the relative contributions of single regulators, both individually and in combination, to transitions.</p>
<p>In this work we follow an integrative approach aiming at computationally modeling the stochastic dynamics of lineage commitment of individual multipotent progenitor cells. We do so using static gene expression profiles of individual self-renewing (SR), erythroid-committed progenitors (CP) and erythroid-differentiated (Ediff) cells, obtained from the bone marrow-derived multipotent hematopoietic cell line EML, for a panel of genes putatively relevant for erythroid and myeloid lineage development (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Pina1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>We first perform an exploratory analysis of the static gene expression data, which provides insight into relevant features of the multipotent and committed progenitor populations as well as the SR-to-CP transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g001">Figure 1</xref> - top panel):</p>

<p><italic>Top panel:</italic> Static data analysis allows inference of system-specific features: clustering analysis and multidimensional scaling (dimensionality reduction method) delineate a population of progenitors closer to commitment boundary; pairwise gene expression correlation analysis assesses presence or absence of regulatory interactions in self-renewing progenitors; machine learning methods identify candidate commitment-associated genes. <italic>Middle panel:</italic> The dynamical model framework is set by three fundamental components: the random telegraph model is used as the mechanistic formalism for the non-poissonian behavior of eukaryotic gene expression dynamics; a logistic regression model trained with single cell data defines the probability of commitment as a function of gene expression; a cell population dynamics model allows estimation of the overall commitment rate from culture data. <italic>Bottom panels:</italic> We implement a Monte Carlo simulator of stochastic commitment that integrates the static data analysis with the dynamical model framework.

We revisit the question of transcriptional program coordination at the outset of lineage specification through correlation analysis and infer putative regulators of the commitment transition. Additionally, we explore the regimens of transcriptional regulation for these genes in the context of a stochastic model of transcriptional bursting and implement expression-dependent rates of commitment which allow the capture of simulated cells at the moment of transition and the assessment of how mechanistic parameters of gene expression regulation impact on the frequency of commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g001">Figure 1</xref> - bottom panel).</p>

<title>The transition into commitment - static data analysis</title>
<p>The single-cell expression data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Pina1">[21]</xref> is a valuable resource for studying the regulation of commitment transitions as it captures SR and CP cells in direct ontogenic relationship. Of note, CP cells represent a uniquely early stage post-commitment but are also more molecularly heterogeneous. In order to focus on molecular programs at the commitment transition boundary, we used a combination of hierarchical clustering and dimensionality reduction methods to identify sub-compartments amongst CP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003197.s001">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We isolated a minor subset of cells (CP2) that are apparently late in their expression profiles and cluster with Ediff cells. The remaining CP cells, denoted CP1, are distinct from SR and Ediff and could not be further subdivided, and are thus used as early-committed CP cells in what follows.</p>
<p>We compared the frequency and level of expression of all 17 individual genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003197.s010">Text S1</xref>) in each of the compartments SR, CP1, CP2 and Ediff (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003197.s002">Figure S2</xref>). A set of genes displays monotonic increase in frequency and/or average level of expression from SR through Ediff (e.g. <italic>Gata1</italic>); the converse monotonic trend is observed for a smaller set of genes (e.g. <italic>Mpo</italic>). Interestingly, other genes have non-monotonic patterns of expression increasing at the SR to CP1 transition, to then decrease during differentiation (e.g. <italic>Gata2</italic>), or decreasing from SR to CP2, to increase in the Ediff compartment (e.g. <italic>Btg2</italic>). Pronounced changes between cell types can suggest functional relevance in commitment and/or differentiation.</p>
<p>We then calculated pairwise Spearman correlations for all genes within the SR and CP1 compartments to assess overall coordination of transcriptional programs at the commitment transition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003197.s003">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003197.s006">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003197.s007">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003197.s008">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Despite the choice of an inclusive correlation coefficient cutoff value, SR cells did not show broad gene-to-gene correlation. Similarly, gene expression in the CP1 population is essentially uncorrelated, with a low number of weak correlations. In contrast, a highly correlated and interconnected gene network could be observed for Ediff cells. Of note, <italic>Gata1</italic> and <italic>Epor</italic>, which are critical regulators of erythroid lineage development, are minimally or not at all correlated in SR or CP1 compartments. Hence, this analysis shows no evidence of significant gene regulatory interactions around or at the point of erythroid commitment within our dataset, consistent with the findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Pina1">[21]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Expression of Gata2 and Mpo are the best predictors of early committed cells</title>
<p>We sought to identify the genes that best distinguish between the SR and CP1 populations, which we assume may function directly or indirectly in the commitment transition. Using the single-cell expression data for all genes in both compartments, we first used a random forest classifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Breiman1">[23]</xref> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) and evaluated the importance of each gene for the overall performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In this analysis, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Mpo</italic> were by far the most important genes, with <italic>Gata1</italic> ranking at the top of a second line of predictors. Classifier performances are commonly measured by the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (ROC), which provides performance percentages for different discrimination thresholds. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC), which measure the ability of each gene on its own to discriminate between the two populations (1 being perfect and 0.5 no better than random), are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. Again, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Mpo</italic> ranked highest, with <italic>Gata1</italic> following at the top of a second line of predictors. The random forest classifier covers both linear and non-linear relations between the input variables (in our case gene expressions) and the output class, where linearity represents the weighted sum of the inputs and non-linearity encompasses more complicated relations (e.g. combinations of products). To investigate the presence of the latter we then explored an artificial neural networks (ANN) classifier using <italic>Gata1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Mpo</italic> expressions as inputs varying the number of hidden nodes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We did not observe a difference in validation performance when comparing non-linear and linear methods, suggesting the absence of more complex relations between the genes. In other words, for the genes in our dataset, the transition from SR to CP seems to be dominated by independent expression values adding up to a certain threshold with gene-specific weights set by the classifier (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Furthermore, to confirm the dominance of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Mpo</italic> when predicting the commitment probability, we trained ANN models with fixed complexity, using all possible combinations of one up to four genes as inputs. Consistently with our observations, all combinations with the highest cross validation performance included <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Mpo</italic> (data not shown).</p>

<title>Stochastic modeling provides mechanistic insight into modes of gene expression regulation in commitment-relevant genes</title>
<p>In order to explore the stochastic dynamics of gene expression for the putative key commitment-associated genes, we have used a random telegraph stochastic model for transcriptional bursting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Raj2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Peccoud1">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), which provides a mechanistic framework for the non-Poissonian behavior observed in eukaryotic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Considering our previous results, we followed a consensus approach and selected genes that consistently ranked high in all classification methods: <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Mpo</italic> were the two best predictors of the committed state and <italic>Gata1</italic>, which also ranked consistently high, is well-described as a master regulator of erythroid differentiation capable of myeloid and lymphoid cell reprogramming to an erythroid fate, making it a likely candidate driver of erythroid commitment. These three genes have distinct gene expression profiles in SR cells, providing an opportunity to assess how distinct modes of gene regulation can affect fate transitions. We fitted model parameters for each of the three genes through simulated annealing, followed by grid search optimization, minimizing the error towards the experimentally observed distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The mRNA decay parameter was fixed for each gene according to published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Ghinassi1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Tobler1">[37]</xref>. The best parameter sets reproduce experimental distributions and provide insight into the gene-specific stochastic dynamics of expression, suggesting that the three genes have distinct modes of regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003197.s009">Table S4</xref>). <italic>Gata1</italic> displays short infrequent bursts of transcriptional activity; <italic>Gata2</italic> expression is set by short but frequent transcriptional bursts with high mRNA production rate; <italic>Mpo</italic> is expressed through very long bursts of promoter activity resulting in near-constitutive expression. We tested the robustness of these parameter sets by exploring different combinations of parameters in the vicinity of the optimum solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Given its low frequency of expression, the <italic>Gata1</italic> distribution can be reconstituted by a fairly broad range of parameters and sensitivity is highest to parameters governing promoter activity. In contrast, the parameter space for <italic>Gata2</italic> is constrained to a smaller region around optimum values, with a clear positive correlation between mRNA production and promoter inactivation times. Finally, for <italic>Mpo</italic> the most important parameter is mRNA production time, with a very narrow region of tolerance around the optimal value. Overall, these results suggest that the observed gene expression distributions for the three genes may be governed by different regulatory mechanisms: <italic>Gata1</italic> primarily by promoter activity, <italic>Mpo</italic> primarily by mRNA dynamics and <italic>Gata2</italic> by both.</p>

For a given gene, the promoter can be in two different states, active or repressed, with the average time spent in each state being controlled by the average times for activation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003197.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and repression (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003197.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). When in the active promoter state, the gene is transcribed and produces mRNA molecules after an average production time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003197.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Finally, mRNA molecules are degraded after an average time, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003197.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, irrespective of promoter states. (B) Best parameter sets for each gene allow for the reconstitution of the experimentally observed distributions (top) within our model simulations (bottom). (C) The parameters suggest different modes of stochastic expression for the different genes, with highly variable burst frequencies and duration (grey bars) as well as mRNA dynamics (colored lines).</p>

<title>Expansion of the stochastic model includes expression-dependent commitment events</title>
<p>We selected the best set of parameters that describe the stochastic dynamics of expression for each of the three genes, and expanded upon the initial model to take into account the probability of a cell to commit as a function of gene expression. Our stochastic model includes an expression-specific commitment rate, proportional to the probability of commitment (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). This probability is given by an expression-dependent logistic regression model trained with experimental data, that separates SR from CP populations. The proportionality constant was set to reproduce the average commitment rate inferred from culture reconstitution assays. The logistic regression model captures all relationships between genes, given that non-linear relationships seem to be absent (see classifier analysis above). This simple model for commitment focuses on the experimental data and abstracts the underlying complexity, weighing the importance of individual genes, as well as their combined effects. Since we could not find significant correlations within the SR population suggesting regulatory interactions, we assumed complete independence in the stochastic dynamics of each gene. For most gene expression combinations, the corresponding commitment probability is low, consistent with the fact that commitment is a rare event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). However, for a small subset of expression states, the probability increases sharply. Due to the stochastic nature of the system, we can still observe instances where high probabilities do not lead to commitment, as well as others where commitment happens despite low probabilities.</p>

<title>Stochastic modeling of commitment highlights individual gene contributions and predicts the outcome of gene expression perturbations</title>
<p>Our modeling approach generated a population of <italic>in silico</italic>-committed cells, and we compared their expression of <italic>Gata1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Mpo</italic> at the moment of transition against experimentally observed values in SR and CP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> CP cells are located at the edge of the SR population and share some characteristics with experimental CP1. In particular, simulated CP cells can recapitulate expression patterns specific to experimental CP1 and absent from SR cells, such as absence of <italic>Mpo</italic> in the presence of <italic>Gata1</italic> and <italic>Gata2</italic>. Events of <italic>in silico</italic> commitment occur more often with high values of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata1</italic>, and indeed, absence of <italic>Gata2</italic> does not seem compatible with CP status. Nevertheless, cells can commit both experimentally and <italic>in silico</italic> with low levels of <italic>Gata2</italic> and in the presence of <italic>Mpo</italic>, if <italic>Gata1</italic> is also present. Given the stochastic nature of the commitment transition, it is possible for cells with commitment-permissive expression profiles not to effect commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). It is also possible for cells to commit as soon as they enter a commitment-permissive state, and to do so with different kinetics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003197.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Overall, the data are compatible with the existence of multiple transcriptional routes into lineage commitment.</p>
<p>We assessed how graded changes in the parameters governing gene expression regimens affect the frequency of transition to the committed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Strongest effects are observed upon perturbation of mRNA processing parameters (production and decay), particularly for <italic>Gata2</italic>, whereas similar perturbations at the level of promoter activity state do not seem to cause major commitment frequency changes. This suggests that for <italic>Gata2</italic> as for other putative regulators of lineage commitment with similar expression profiles, mRNA dynamics may play a more important role than the regulation of promoter status (e.g. through histone modifications) in influencing the commitment transition.</p>

<p>Such subtle changes at this level of gene regulatory mechanisms are seldom feasible in a tightly controlled manner within experimental settings. Instead, gain- or loss-of-function experiments are more often used to assess the functional relevance of a given gene, involving much more pronounced expression increase or decrease, respectively. In this context, we used our stochastic model to predict the impact of pronounced <italic>Gata1</italic> expression changes in the frequency of commitment in the EML model cell system. Despite <italic>Gata1</italic>'s capacity to reprogram cells to an erythroid fate through ectopic expression under a strong exogenous promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Heyworth1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Iwasaki1">[33]</xref>, our model suggested a less prominent though relevant role under its native expression regime, and we wished to test the consequences of enforcing its expression both <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. To this end, we set the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003197.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameter for <italic>Gata1</italic> to an infinite value, thus effectively keeping its promoter permanently in the active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The range of simulated values for <italic>Gata1</italic> expression in this perturbation scenario is comparable to wild type, but the fraction of high-expressing cells is greatly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The gene expression time-course reflects the permanent activity of the <italic>Gata1</italic> promoter resulting in more frequent high commitment probability peaks as compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g007">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These changes result in a 2-fold predicted increase in frequency of commitment from wild type to the <italic>Gata1</italic> ON perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). In order to test these results experimentally, we transduced EML SR cells with a GATA1-ERT fusion construct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Heyworth1">[32]</xref>, activated the resulting protein with a pulse of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), and assessed the status of the activated cells in clonal culture-reconstituting assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003197-g007">Figure 7E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our stochastic Monte Carlo model approach is to our knowledge novel. It integrates the random telegraph model framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Raj2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Peccoud1">[22]</xref> with commitment probabilities obtained from single cell classifiers and cell culture properties. Also, the robust conversion of static expression data, where each data point is considered a “snapshot”, into time series parameters is new in this context. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Wyart1">[38]</xref> cell cycle FISH data were analyzed with the same goal using template matching. Our approach, which can be expanded to a larger number of genes and extended to instances where regulatory interactions are present, provides insight into the mechanistic aspects underlying stochastic gene expression and, more importantly, establishes a link between such mechanisms and functional properties of individual cells, by assessing the relevance of promoter and mRNA regulation dynamics in the frequency of commitment.</p>
<p>The computational framework was designed and implemented using single cell expression data observations from different populations of the EML hematopoietic cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Pina1">[21]</xref>. Clustering analyses distinguished cellular sub-compartmentalization from molecular heterogeneity within the CP population and identified subsets of early (CP1) and late (CP2) committed cells, with distinct molecular profiles. Global characterization of CP1 cells revealed a heterogeneous population dispersed in their individual expression profiles, including absence of known erythroid regulators like <italic>Gata1</italic>, <italic>Klf1</italic> or <italic>Epor</italic> in a significant number of cells. Importantly, we observed only few and weak pairwise correlations between genes in CP1 cells, a pattern that was even more evident amongst SR cells. Hence, no significant level of gene expression coordination is discernible in the commitment transition, at least not within the gene signature analyzed.</p>
<p>We proceeded to infer potential key commitment regulators using machine learning methods to separate SR from CP1 cells across the commitment boundary. We identified increase in <italic>Gata2</italic> and decrease in <italic>Mpo</italic> expression as the best predictors of commitment, with changes in a second group of genes, including increase in <italic>Gata1</italic> expression, also of some relevance. Although we cannot directly equate predictors of the commitment event with commitment effectors, we have presumed it likely that those genes that best separate SR from CP1 states play a role in their identity or maintenance, and hence may directly effect or report the decision. Also, in exploring mechanisms of commitment, we are aware that our data is exclusively transcriptional and, consequently, mechanistic approaches cannot consider the effects of translational mechanisms and protein quantities. However, protein half-lives for <italic>Gata1</italic> and <italic>Gata2</italic>, for instance, are similar or even shorter than those of their respective mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Ghinassi1">[36]</xref> suggesting that regulation is in fact dominated by transcriptional events. Indeed, short half-lives of both mRNA and proteins seem to be a common feature of genes involved in regulatory mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Schwanhusser1">[39]</xref> and partially preclude the existence of buffering effects at the protein level, although they cannot account for all translational regulatory events.</p>
<p>A better understanding of the regimens of expression of <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Mpo</italic> and <italic>Gata1</italic> and their consequences for the SR-to-CP transition could illuminate specific and global mechanisms of lineage commitment. Thus, we explored the dynamics of these three genes by fitting the parameters of a stochastic gene expression model to experimentally observed distributions. These solutions, validated by a local robustness analysis, were taken as strong indicators of the qualitative behavior of the system. We found the genes to have different regulatory dynamics, compatible with global experimental observations in mammalian genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Suter1">[40]</xref>. In the case of <italic>Gata1</italic> and to some degree <italic>Gata2</italic>, the frequency of promoter activity bursts plays a fundamental role; <italic>Mpo</italic>, on the other hand, is most sensitive to variations in mRNA production times. These patterns are consistent with measurements in yeast, in which transcriptional bursts were more important for larger variations, whereas smaller variations were mostly attributed to transcription-initiation mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Zenklusen1">[41]</xref>. We extended the stochastic model to account for commitment events by means of a logistic regression model that maximizes the separation between SR and CP cells; stochastic commitment events were thus the result of (i) the inherent stochasticity resulting from the mechanistic parameters of <italic>Gata1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Mpo</italic> regulation, and (ii) the rate of commitment inferred from SR-seeded cell cultures, itself implemented as a random event. Within this framework, the probability of commitment is very low for the vast majority of the time, with infrequent and short transient peaks at high values. This behavior bears some resemblance to excitable systems of differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Eldar1">[42]</xref>. The extended model allowed us to recreate and capture <italic>in silico</italic> the moment of commitment. By analyzing the molecular patterns of simulated cells at the transition, we hypothesize that expression of <italic>Gata2</italic> defines two states in SR cells: a commitment-impeded state with low <italic>Gata2</italic> expression in which no commitment events were observed; and a commitment-permissive state with high <italic>Gata2</italic> expression where multiple entry points into commitment can be reached. Given the lack of correlations between the expression of <italic>Gata2</italic> and other genes, we could not further explore specific molecular mechanisms by which <italic>Gata2</italic> can drive cells into commitment. Nevertheless, we systematically assessed how gradual changes in the stochastic dynamics of gene expression regulation for <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Mpo</italic> and <italic>Gata1</italic> influence the frequency of commitment. Again, changes in <italic>Gata2</italic> regulation had the strongest impact, in particular when perturbing mRNA production and decay. Additionally, we tested the impact of more drastic changes in regulatory parameters, by simulating permanent activity of the <italic>Gata1</italic> promoter. The predicted 2-fold increase in frequency of commitment is in agreement with experimental results measuring loss of culture-reconstitution capacity in clonal assays, and is compatible with the reported role of <italic>Gata1</italic> in erythroid differentiation and reprogramming experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Heyworth1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Iwasaki1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Pevny1">[35]</xref>. Taken together, these observations bridge mechanisms of gene regulation and functional impact on lineage commitment, and highlight the role of intrinsic noise in cell fate decisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Balzsi1">[43]</xref>. This integrative approach can also be applied to other differentiating systems, generating hypotheses on transcriptional regulation dynamics and its impact on commitment.</p>

Our main goal was to broadly characterize the regulatory potential around or at the point of commitment, so we opted for an inclusive approach and considered as significant, correlations with coefficient values above 0.3 at a 99% significance level. This choice of cutoff is supported by recent literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Sthlberg1">[45]</xref>, and the significance level corresponds to a 0.01 probability of having a correlation as large or higher than the observed value, by chance, when the true correlation is zero. Calculations were performed using the Statistical Toolbox on Matlab (MathWorks). Interaction plots based on significant correlations for SR, CP1 and Ediff were produced using Cytoscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003197-Smoot1">[46]</xref>.</p>
