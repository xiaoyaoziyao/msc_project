<abstract>
<p>The sequence of a promoter within a genome does not uniquely determine gene expression levels and their variability; rather, promoter sequence can additionally interact with its location in the genome, or genomic context, to shape eukaryotic gene expression. Retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV), integrate their genomes into those of their host and thereby provide a biomedically-relevant model system to quantitatively explore the relationship between promoter sequence, genomic context, and noise-driven variability on viral gene expression. Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of the HIV Tat-mediated positive-feedback loop, we previously demonstrated that fluctuations in viral Tat-transactivating protein levels generate integration-site-dependent, stochastically-driven phenotypes, in which infected cells randomly ‘switch’ between high and low expressing states in a manner that may be related to viral latency. Here we extended this model and designed a forward genetic screen to systematically identify genetic elements in the HIV LTR promoter that modulate the fraction of genomic integrations that specify ‘Switching’ phenotypes. Our screen identified mutations in core promoter regions, including Sp1 and TATA transcription factor binding sites, which increased the Switching fraction several fold. By integrating single-cell experiments with computational modeling, we further investigated the mechanism of Switching-fraction enhancement for a selected Sp1 mutation. Our experimental observations demonstrated that the Sp1 mutation both impaired Tat-transactivated expression and also altered basal expression in the absence of Tat. Computational analysis demonstrated that the observed change in basal expression could contribute significantly to the observed increase in viral integrations that specify a Switching phenotype, provided that the selected mutation affected Tat-mediated noise amplification differentially across genomic contexts. Our study thus demonstrates a methodology to identify and characterize promoter elements that affect the distribution of stochastic phenotypes over genomic contexts, and advances our understanding of how promoter mutations may control the frequency of latent HIV infection.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The sequence of a gene within a cellular genome does not uniquely determine its expression level, even for a single type of cell under fixed conditions. Numerous other factors, including gene location on the chromosome and random gene-expression “noise,” can alter expression patterns and cause differences between otherwise identical cells. This poses new challenges for characterizing the genotype–phenotype relationship. Infection by the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) provides a biomedically important example in which transcriptional noise and viral genomic location impact the decision between viral replication and latency, a quiescent but reversible state that cannot be eliminated by anti-viral therapies. Here, we designed a forward genetic screen to systematically identify mutations in the HIV promoter that alter the fraction of genomic integrations that specify noisy/reactivating expression phenotypes. The mechanisms by which the selected mutations specify the observed phenotypic enrichments are investigated through a combination of single-cell experiments and computational modeling. Our study provides a framework for identifying genetic sequences that alter the distribution of stochastic expression phenotypes over genomic locations and for characterizing their mechanisms of regulation. Our results also may yield further insights into the mechanisms by which HIV sequence evolution can alter the propensity for latent infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Non-genetic heterogeneity is a ubiquitous feature of cellular gene expression that can significantly impact the genotype–phenotype relationship. Even under highly controlled culture conditions, a clonal population of cells may demonstrate a broad range of expression levels for a given gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Spudich1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Sigal1">[4]</xref>. At least some of this variability, often termed ‘noise’, is believed to arise from the intrinsically stochastic nature of the biochemical processes involved in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-McAdams1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Thattai1">[6]</xref>. Studies that couple quantitative experimentation with mathematical modeling have begun to reveal the mechanisms by which non-genetic variability is generated and moderated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Kaern1">[7]</xref>, finding that noise: differentially impacts the expression of functional classes of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Newman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Batada1">[9]</xref>; can be propagated, amplified, or attenuated by gene regulatory circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Hooshangi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Pedraza1">[11]</xref>; and is subject to selective pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Blake1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Wolf1">[15]</xref>. Stochastically-generated expression variability is increasingly appreciated to have important phenotypic consequences in diverse cellular settings, including bacterial evasion of antibiotic treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Balaban1">[16]</xref>, multi-cellular development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Raj1">[17]</xref>, cancer development and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Sharma1">[18]</xref>, and viral latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Singh1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Weinberger1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent evidence demonstrates that the chromosomal position of a gene, or its genomic context, affects both its mean expression level and expression noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Singh2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Batenchuk1">[24]</xref>. One mechanism by which genomic context modulates gene expression is by specifying the dynamics of the local chromatin state, which can impact multiple neighboring genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Raser1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Raj2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-MillerJensen1">[26]</xref>. Additionally, endogenous genes can sample different genomic environments through translocation and recombination, impacting diverse biological processes including species evolution, organism development, and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-De1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-De2">[28]</xref>. Human retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV), also sample genomic environments through semi-random integration into the host genome, which in turn affects viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Schrder1">[29]</xref>. Thus, genomic context impacts cellular phenotypes and offers additional dimensions of selectable variation that shape the architecture and evolution of eukaryotic genomes, as well as the retroviruses that invade them.</p>
<p>Stochastic gene expression phenotypes that are modulated by genomic context present new challenges for quantifying the genotype–phenotype relationship. In particular, understanding how genomic context and gene sequence cooperate to alter gene expression dynamics requires quantifying how the sequences of regulatory elements alter the distribution of expression phenotypes over the set of genomic environments sampled by a gene. Gene regulatory networks may further alter gene expression phenotypes by amplifying or minimizing noise in gene expression through positive and negative feedback. Thus, when a genetic mutation is linked to a change in the distribution of stochastic phenotypes over genomic contexts, a further challenge is to identify the underlying mechanism that drives this change.</p>
<p>In this study, we identify promoter mutations that modulate context-dependent stochastic phenotypes in a lentiviral human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) model system and investigate the mechanisms by which they impact viral gene expression. HIV exhibits a high degree of genetic variability due to its high replication rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Ho1">[30]</xref> and the error-prone nature of reverse transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Roberts1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Preston1">[32]</xref>. Following semi-random integration into the genome of host CD4+ T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Schrder1">[29]</xref>, HIV usually establishes a productive infection, but in rare cases can adopt a non-replicating but reversible latent phenotype, such as when an infected activated T cell transitions to a memory T cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Chun1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Brenchley1">[34]</xref>. Latently infected cells do not express virus and thus cannot be effectively targeted by current therapeutics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Finzi1">[35]</xref>; however, latent HIV can reactivate after long delays, leading to renewed viral spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Joos1">[36]</xref>. Consequently, latent infection represents the single greatest obstacle to fully eradicating HIV in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Richman1">[37]</xref>. Importantly, a number of studies have demonstrated that genomic context and non-genetic variability play important roles in determining the replication-versus-latency decision of integrated HIV within a cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Singh1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Singh2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-MillerJensen1">[26]</xref>. Thus, HIV provides an ideal system for studying the interplay between gene sequence, genomic environment, and stochastic gene expression.</p>
<p>The virally encoded transcriptional activator Tat plays an essential role in HIV expression dynamics and the replication-versus-latency decision. The nascent HIV transcript forms a RNA hairpin, termed the HIV transactivation response element (TAR loop), that causes RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to stall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Gatignol1">[38]</xref>. Tat binds to the TAR loop and in turn recruits the positive elongation factor b (p-TEFb), which phosphorylates RNAPII to relieve the stall and complete a cycle of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Zhou1">[39]</xref>. Transcript processing and translation then results in production of viral proteins, including more Tat. Thus, Tat enhances HIV transcriptional efficiency in a strong positive-feedback loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Feinberg1">[40]</xref> that is necessary for viral gene expression from proviruses that immediately initiate replication or from latent infections that reactivate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Jordan1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Lassen1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have previously demonstrated that an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of the HIV Tat positive feedback loop can generate a diverse range of stochastic phenotypes by sampling genomic contexts. These stochastic phenotypes include bimodal expression behaviors where non-expressing and highly expressing cells co-exist in a single clonal population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Weinberger1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Burnett1">[43]</xref> and random switching between these two expression states occurs with significant delays. Noise in basal viral gene expression in the absence of Tat varies systematically over genomic integrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Singh2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>, and its amplification by Tat feedback provides a possible mechanism to explain the diverse phenotypes generated in the presence of Tat. We have hypothesized that stochastically-driven delays in activation for some viral integrations are an intrinsic property of Tat positive feedback, and that these delays may provide a sufficient time window to establish latent infections <italic>in vivo</italic> when coupled to host-cell dynamics such as the transition to a memory T cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Weinberger1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Burnett1">[43]</xref>. Thus, HIV sequence mutations that affect the frequency of stochastic phenotypes <italic>in vitro</italic> may affect the frequency of latent infections <italic>in vivo</italic>. While isolated examples of promoter mutations that control context-dependent stochastic phenotypes have been investigated for HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Burnett1">[43]</xref>, no study has yet systematically identified such mutations or analyzed the mechanisms by which the distribution of phenotypes is modulated.</p>
<p>Here, we designed a forward genetic screen to select for HIV promoter mutations that increase the fraction of genomic integrations that result in stochastic gene expression phenotypes. Our screen identified important mutations in a number of core promoter regions, including Sp1 and TATA transcription factor binding sites. Through single-cell experiments, we confirmed that our strongest hits – point mutations in Sp1 site III and in the TATA box – increased the frequency of stochastic phenotypes several fold. We further demonstrated experimentally that the Sp1 mutation altered basal expression dynamics in the absence of Tat, and also impaired transactivated gene expression in the presence of Tat. Computational analysis demonstrated that the changes in basal expression observed for the Sp1 mutant could contribute significantly to the enrichment in stochastic phenotypes in the presence of impaired Tat feedback, if the mutation affected Tat-mediated amplification differentially across genomic contexts. Our analysis thus demonstrates a methodology for identifying genetic elements that affect the distribution of context-dependent stochastic phenotypes and the mechanisms by which they function. Our findings may also contribute to understanding how mutational selection could alter the frequency of latent HIV infection.</p>

<title>Quantifying context-dependent stochastic phenotypes in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of HIV-1 infection</title>
<p>To quantitatively study stochastic gene expression of HIV infections as a function of genomic context, we adapted a full-length HIV NL4-3-based LTR lentiviral packaging platform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Leonard1">[44]</xref> by introducing stop codons into all viral proteins except Tat and by replacing Nef with GFP (sLTR-Tat-GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This minimal viral system, referred to in this study as wild type (WT), is similar to a model vector used previously in which Tat and GFP are expressed from a bicistronic lentiviral vector under control of the same LTR promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Weinberger1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Burnett1">[43]</xref>. However, the new sLTR-Tat-GFP vector more closely mimics HIV gene expression, with Tat produced as a splice product of two exons as in natural HIV infection. The leukemic Jurkat T cell line was infected with sLTR-Tat-GFP at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI&lt;0.1), such that the majority of infected cells (&gt;95%) contained a single integrated provirus. The infected, GFP+ cells were then isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and cultured for ten days so that the population relaxed to a steady-state GFP expression profile. The resulting polyclonal or “bulk-infected” cell population showed bimodal gene expression, which indicated the presence and absence of Tat positive feedback in different cellular infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), as observed with the previously studied bicistronic lentiviral vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Weinberger1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Burnett1">[43]</xref>.</p>

<p>Bimodal Tat–GFP expression in the bulk-infected population arises from a mixture of integration events that result in either high or low gene expression, as well as individual integrations that result in variable or stochastic gene expression. To separate these contributions to the overall bulk distribution, we sorted individual cells – each containing a single (different) genomic integration of the provirus – from low, mid, or high ranges of GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We then expanded these individual sorted cells to yield 125 single-integration clonal populations and subsequently quantified their GFP expression phenotypes by flow cytometry. Consistent with earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Weinberger1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Burnett1">[43]</xref>, a diverse spectrum of clonal GFP expression phenotypes was observed, including narrow single peaks of low or high GFP expression (referred to here as Dim and Bright distributions, respectively), as well as wide and/or bimodal distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The wide/bimodal clonal distributions occurred with higher frequency within populations sorted from the mid-GFP range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and included both cells that are Bright, representing Tat-transactivated expression that would support viral replication, and cells that are Dim, representing low levels of basal expression that may be related to viral latency. Analogously, earlier work showed that when Dim cells are sorted from the bulk multi-integration population, a fraction eventually activated and migrated into the Bright range, and vice-versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Weinberger1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Burnett1">[43]</xref>. We collectively refer to these stochastic viral gene expression phenotypes as “Switching” and consider them to be a model for latent infections that can randomly “switch” from an inactive state to a productive state.</p>
<p>Given HIV's rapid mutation rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Ho1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Preston1">[32]</xref>, an interesting question is how changes in the viral promoter could affect the relative frequency of different expression phenotypes over the set of genomic environments that are sampled through infection and viral integration, and in particular whether specific mutations could increase the frequency of Switching phenotypes. As a first step in addressing this question, we developed objective, feature-based clustering criteria to classify gene expression behavior for a clonal population as Switching, Dim, or Bright. In this classification, cut-off values were manually selected for nine GFP-distribution measures that reflect expression heterogeneity, such as bimodality, width, and skewness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s004">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Distributions with a value exceeding the cut-off for any one of these features were labeled as Switching (details of methods described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s008">Text S1</xref>). By applying these criteria uniformly to our initial collection of single-integration clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), we estimated the fraction of integrations in our system that led to a Switching phenotype to be 8.2% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). We developed an alternate estimate of the Switching fraction based on sampling single-integration clones sorted only from the mid-GFP range and extrapolating to the full population (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s008">Text S1</xref>). This method resulted in a similar Switching fraction estimate of 8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), and was thus used in the remainder of our study for increased experimental efficiency.</p>

<title>A stochastic model of Tat positive feedback demonstrates delayed activation for Switching phenotypes</title>
<p>We next developed a stochastic model of HIV transcription and amplification by the Tat positive feedback loop to aid our intuition concerning the underlying gene expression dynamics that may account for the observed variation in HIV expression phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We previously built a model of basal LTR promoter-driven gene expression in the absence of Tat, which probabilistically described the processes of gene activation, transcription, and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>. Our analysis suggested that basal transcription from the LTR occurs in short, infrequent bursts, and we found that the size of these transcriptional bursts strongly correlated with mean gene expression from different viral integration positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>. Here, we extended this basic model to include Tat expression from the LTR, and Tat positive feedback on transcription from the LTR, by assuming a Michaelis-Menten-like dependence of transcriptional burst size and burst frequency on Tat concentration (full model description included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s008">Text S1</xref>). The assumption that Tat positive feedback enhances the frequency of transcriptional bursts from the LTR is consistent with observations that Tat interacts with transcription factors involved in gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Raha1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-DOrso1">[46]</xref>, and the assumption that Tat increases transcriptional burst size is based on observations that Tat enhances elongation by recruiting p-TEFb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Zhou1">[39]</xref>.</p>

<p>The model is specified by two basal transcription parameters, which set the average size and frequency of transcriptional bursts that occur in the absence of Tat, and three feedback parameters that describe transcriptional amplification in the presence of Tat. Two of these feedback parameters, which specify the average size and frequency of transcriptional bursts at saturating Tat concentrations (full transactivation), were set to give approximately a 100-fold increase in transcription rate at saturating Tat concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Feinberg1">[40]</xref>. The third feedback parameter, which specifies the Tat concentration at half maximal binding, was set to approximately the top of the mid range of our bulk expression distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The remaining model parameters (including degradation and translation rates) were set as in previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>. The model, which was solved numerically for steady-state protein distributions, reproduced each of our major experimental expression phenotypes over different ranges of parameter values (Dim, Bright, and Switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We qualitatively analyzed the relationship between transcriptional dynamics and expression phenotype in our model by generating a series of phase diagrams. These phase diagrams fix the Tat feedback parameters in our model as described above, and then systematically scan over basal transcription parameters, which are known to vary over genomic integrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Singh2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>. By applying our experimental criteria for Dim, Bright, and Switching phenotypes to our simulated distributions, we drew boundaries separating combinations of basal transcription parameters that lead to distinct expression phenotypes in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, near the range of model parameters that generate Switching phenotypes, small changes in basal transcription that occur in the absence of Tat result in large changes in phenotype when amplified by Tat feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, we found that Switching phenotypes exhibit delayed activation of gene expression. That is, if a simulated population of cells with model parameters corresponding to a Switching phenotype is initialized in the Dim state, a time-scale of one to many weeks is required for half of the population to cross a threshold of gene expression intermediate between Dim and Bright states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This is in contrast to a Bright steady-state phenotype initialized in the Dim state, which will cross an intermediate expression threshold on a time scale of days (corresponding to the time scale of protein dilution in our cells). The delayed activation observed for the Switching phenotype is approximately the time scale over which an activated CD4+ T cell may transition to a memory state, and memory T cells are a primary reservoir of latent HIV infection <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Chun1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Brenchley1">[34]</xref>. Thus, the delayed transcriptional activation exhibited by a Switching phenotype could substantially increase the opportunity for the memory state transition to occur in an infected T cell before viral production, and may therefore increase the probability of a latent infection.</p>
<p>The general relationship between Switching phenotypes and delayed activation is highlighted by superimposing a measure of distribution activation time on the phenotypic information in our phase diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Delayed activation results when transactivation depends on the probabilistic (infrequent) occurrence of multiple transcriptional bursts that are larger and/or more closely spaced than occur on average. In our model, such behavior occurs at intermediate values of basal transcriptional burst size and frequency, which are typically the same values that specify Switching phenotypes (additional discussion in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s008">Text S1</xref>). Our model thus supports the hypothesis that Switching phenotypes also exhibit delayed activation, which may underlie the establishment of latent HIV infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Weinberger1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Burnett1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that Switching phenotypes also exhibit delayed deactivation of gene expression as compared to Dim clones when initiated in a Bright state. Although delayed deactivation is not relevant to the establishment of latent infections <italic>in vivo</italic> (due to the fact that viral replication would kill the host cell and block any possible memory state transition before deactivation could occur), it is possible to observe this behavior in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model. Thus, we hypothesized that probabilistic delays in both activation and deactivation can be used to select for Switching phenotypes in our <italic>in vitro</italic> system.</p>

<title>Design of a dynamic forward genetic screen to select for promoter sequences that specify delayed activation and deactivation of viral gene expression</title>
<p>We exploited the delayed activation/deactivation of gene expression associated with Switching phenotypes to design a forward genetic screen to identify LTR promoter mutations that increase the prevalence of Switching phenotypes, and which could thus potentially influence the fraction of latent infections. We prepared a library of HIV-1 vectors in which the WT LTR promoter was subjected to random point mutations via error-prone PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Zhao1">[47]</xref>. The ∼10<sup>5</sup> member library had an average mutation rate of 0.6%, such that each position of the 634 base-pair promoter was mutated hundreds of times across the library. We packaged the library into our model vector, infected Jurkat cells, and isolated cell populations containing single viral integrations as described for the WT vector above. The resulting bulk population of singly infected cells, which was heterogeneous in both LTR sequence and viral integration position, was subjected to two alternate phenotypic screens. First, we implemented an ‘activation’ screen, in which infected cells with low GFP expression (low GFP gate) were isolated by FACS and allowed to grow for 5 days, at which point cells that had switched to high GFP expression (high GFP gate) were selected again by FACS. Second, a ‘deactivation’ screen reversed the order, selecting for high GFP expression first and low second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We refer to the fraction of cells selected in these screens as the activating and deactivating fraction, respectively.</p>

<p>To confirm that our activation screen effectively selected for clones with a Switching phenotype, we applied the activation screen to the WT virus and randomly selected a sample of single cells from the activating fraction, which were then expanded to clonal populations for analysis. Remarkably, nearly 54% of these clones (22 out of 42) showed Switching phenotypes, as compared to only 8% from the original population and 19% from the mid-sorted population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s001">Figure S1</xref>), confirming the effectiveness of the screen.</p>
<p>We thus implemented a larger scale analysis to identify viral promoter mutations that favor Switching phenotypes. Specifically, we performed multiple rounds of infection and FACS-based screening as described above to average the behavior of promoter sequences across different integration positions and thus identify genotypes that give rise to a higher fraction of Switching phenotypes across genomic contexts. After each round of infection, we recovered the viral LTRs from the genomic DNA of the selected populations (by PCR), re-cloned them into the sLTR vector, repackaged virus to produce a new library of selected promoters, and infected a new population of Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>After four rounds of selection, the fraction of activating cells increased 6-fold compared to the original library (<italic>p&lt;0.001</italic>, t-test on triplicate measurements) and 2-fold compared to the WT promoter (<italic>p&lt;0.01</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The fraction of deactivating cells increased by a factor of 1.7 compared to the original library (<italic>p&lt;0.04</italic>) and by a factor of 3 relative to WT (<italic>p&lt;0.002</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, the median GFP expression of the Tat-transactivated population (Bright peak in the bulk GFP histogram) was significantly lower for the unselected library than for WT, and it continued to decrease with each round of selection in both screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g003">Figure 3D–E</xref>). Importantly, the bulk gene expression distributions of the selected promoters also displayed an increased weight in the mid range of GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g003">Figure 3F–G</xref>), which we had found to be enriched in integrations that demonstrate a Switching phenotype for the WT promoter. Altogether, these results indicate that our dynamic screens for activation and deactivation effectively selected for mutations that increased the fractions of activating and deactivating cells, which is a hallmark of the Switching phenotype.</p>

<title>Genetic screens for delayed activation and deactivation of viral gene expression select for mutations in the core LTR promoter</title>
<p>To analyze the LTR promoter mutations that were enriched by the activation and deactivation screens, approximately 90 clones were sequenced from each selected library and compared to a control set of promoters from the unselected library. The average mutation frequency per position in the selected libraries was approximately 1.1% (as compared to 0.6% for the unselected library), but the distribution of mutation frequencies was long-tailed, with some positions mutated in as many as 20% of the promoters for a given screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We first analyzed how mutations were distributed across the LTR for the combined screens by comparing the mutation frequency for each regulatory region of the LTR with the average mutation frequency over the whole promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Pereira1">[48]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

In contrast, mutation rates were not increased above those in the initial library in the enhancer region, the U5 region downstream of TAR, and in the TAR region itself, possibly reflecting the essential role of the TAR loop secondary structure to enable efficient gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Feng1">[49]</xref>. The remaining regions displayed increased mutation frequencies that did not differ significantly from the average increase across the entire promoter for both selected libraries.</p>

<p>We next compared the mutation frequency at each position in the core promoter to the mutation frequency for the same base type in the unselected library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We identified two positions in Sp1 site III, one position in Sp1 site II, and two positions in the TATA box with significant mutation rates in both screens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s005">Table S2</xref>), with additional Sp1 and TATA positions significantly mutated in one of the two screens. The top hit was in Sp1 site III (position 4 of the 10 bp site, <italic>p&lt;0.0001</italic>). Selection for this mutation is consistent with our previous results demonstrating that simultaneous mutation of positions 3 and 4 in Sp1 site III, which had been shown to eliminate binding of Sp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Jones1">[50]</xref>, also increased delayed activation and deactivation in infected Jurkat cell populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Burnett1">[43]</xref>. The next strongest hit was in the TATA box (position 2 of the 8 bp site, <italic>p = 0.0005</italic>). The A to G mutation observed most frequently in our selected libraries has been previously shown to reduce the affinity of the TATA binding protein (TBP) for the TATA box <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Hoopes1">[51]</xref>. Notably, mutations at positions 3 and 4 of the TATA box, which are considered critical for TBP binding and thus TATA function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Hoopes1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Wobbe1">[52]</xref>, were not enriched in either screen.</p>
<p>Altogether, for the activation screen we found that 40% of the sampled sequences had mutations in Sp1 site III, and 25% had TATA mutations; for the deactivation screen, 20% had mutations in Sp1 site III, and 20% had TATA mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). All of these mutation frequencies were well above those for the same regions in the unselected library.

<title>Selected mutations in Sp1 site III result in small but significant differences in basal gene expression dynamics across integration positions</title>
<p>We next considered how promoter mutations might alter transcriptional dynamics to increase the fraction of infections that generate Switching phenotypes. For this analysis, we chose to focus on the Sp1 point mutation, because this point mutation exists in naturally occurring HIV isolates, while the TATA mutation was not found (as determined by searching the Los Alamos HIV sequence database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov" xlink:type="simple">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov</ext-link>).

<p>To infer the underlying transcriptional dynamics of our Tat-null clones, we systematically fit their GFP distributions using our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g002">Figure 2A</xref> with transactivation removed), following our earlier analysis of WT basal expression dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>. The sets of clonal WT and Sp1 distributions were all best accounted for by a bursting dynamic, whereby short infrequent transcriptional bursts generate large basal expression heterogeneities (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s008">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref> for further discussion). The basal transcription dynamics for each clonal population were fully quantified by a best-fit basal transcriptional burst size and burst frequency. Transcriptional burst sizes were found to vary from a few to tens of transcripts, and to be strongly positively correlated with mean expression level across different integration positions for both the mutant and for the WT vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, typical transcriptional burst frequencies were on the order of a few events per cell division time, and demonstrated little correlation with mean gene expression levels over integration positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). These findings are consistent with our earlier analysis of the WT promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the Sp1 mutant and WT promoters share the same qualitative basal expression dynamics, regression analysis revealed that the Sp1 mutant demonstrated an increased positive correlation between basal burst frequency and clonal expression mean, with burst frequencies decreased for Dim clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g006">Figure 6D</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). Thus, the selected Sp1 mutation does not change the qualitative bursting mode of transcription from the HIV LTR, but it does appear to modestly alter how the dynamics vary quantitatively across integration positions.</p>

<title>Altered basal gene expression dynamics for the Sp1 mutation may contribute to Switching-phenotype enrichment</title>
<p>We returned to our model to explore if the small changes in basal transcriptional dynamics quantified experimentally with our Tat-null vector could contribute significantly to the increased Switching fraction observed for the Sp1 mutant in the presence of Tat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). The phase diagrams developed for the WT promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) specify the predicted expression phenotype for every combination of basal transcriptional burst size and burst frequency parameters for fixed Tat feedback. Thus, model phase diagrams can be used to predict the Switching fraction that would result from a given probability density with which the virus samples basal transcriptional parameters through its sampling genomic locations via infection and integration, under the assumption of fixed Tat feedback. We used our experimental data to estimate the probability density with which the WT and Sp1 mutant promoters sampled combinations of basal transcription parameters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s008">Text S1</xref> for details), and then calculated model-predicted Switching fractions by integrating this sampling density over the Switching region of the phase diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).</p>

<p>We found that the changes in basal transcriptional dynamics observed for the Sp1 mutant – particularly the increased sampling of lower transcriptional burst frequencies, which specify noisier basal transcription – indeed resulted in higher model-predicted Switching fractions compared to WT for all sets of feedback parameters analyzed. In particular, for a set of feedback parameters that specify a model-predicted Switching fraction of 12% for the WT basal parameter sampling density, the model predicted a Switching fraction of 22% for the Sp1 mutant sampling density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that changes in Sp1 basal transcription dynamics can result in a substantial increase in the fraction of genomic integrations that lead to a Switching phenotype in the presence of Tat feedback.</p>

<title>Attenuated Tat positive feedback resulting from impaired transcriptional reinitiation can preserve increased Switching fractions for the Sp1 mutant</title>
<p>In addition to altering basal expression, mutations in Sp1 site III weaken Tat positive feedback, as demonstrated in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) and in previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Berkhout1">[53]</xref>; however our model had not yet accounted for this observation. We therefore explored if weakening Tat positive feedback in the model would maintain the predicted Switching fraction enrichment that arises from altered basal transcription, or even enhance it to more fully account for the nearly 6-fold enrichment observed in our experiments. In contrast to these expectations, we found that decreasing Tat-driven fold-amplification of basal transcription in the model typically decreased predicted Switching fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), a result which can be explained by our model phase diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Notably, weakening feedback shifts phenotypic boundaries to the right (towards larger basal transcriptional burst sizes), transforming Bright integrations to Switching, and Switching to Dim. The resulting Switching region typically enclosed a smaller fraction of the viral basal parameter sampling density, which is highly right skewed and heavily weighted at lower basal transcriptional burst sizes. Thus, our analysis suggests that the Sp1 site mutation specifies a more complex perturbation of the Tat positive feedback loop that differentially affects Bright and Dim integrations, rather than one that uniformly attenuates expression amplification over genomic integrations.</p>
<p>A biological mechanism by which the Sp1 site mutation could differentially affect Bright and Dim integrations is by impairing transcriptional reinitiation. In the bursting model of transcription, each gene activation event can drive multiple cycles of transcription, requiring multiple rounds of RNAPII binding and transcription-complex formation (i.e. reinitiation). In the absence of Tat, the rate-limiting step in HIV-LTR transcription is RNAPII stalling at the TAR hairpin that forms after transcriptional initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Gatignol1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, moderate impairment of the reinitiation rate via mutation would be masked during basal transcription, or for integrations that inefficiently activate Tat feedback. However, at higher concentrations of Tat, when the TAR-loop stall is no longer rate limiting, impaired reinitiation would significantly attenuate full Tat transactivation, and the effect would be more pronounced for Brighter genomic integrations. Because Sp1 and p-TEFb interact <italic>in vivo</italic> to activate HIV transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-DOrso1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Kamine1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Yedavalli1">[56]</xref>, a mutation in the Sp1 site could plausibly alter transcriptional reinitiation if it disrupted recruitment of p-TEFb.</p>
<p>To investigate this possibility, we extended our model to include a ‘reinitiation’ step between each transcript production event (rescaled model parameters included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g007">Figure 7</xref> legend and full model description and equations included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s008">Text S1</xref>). The effective transcript production rate in this extended model depends on both an elongation rate, which varies over genomic integrations, and a reinitiation rate, which is fixed (but may be altered through mutation). The elongation rate specifies the variation of the basal and transactivated transcription rates over genomic integrations, while the reinitiation rate specifies the maximal value at which the transcription rate saturates as a function of elongation rate. In this extended model, we found that a moderate decrease in the transcriptional reinitiation rate had little effect on the phenotypic boundaries of our phase diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), but significantly weakened Tat-transactivated expression from Bright integrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), consistent with our experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). As a result, predicted Switching fractions were preserved, though they were not further enhanced to the level observed experimentally. Thus, moderate impairment of transcriptional reinitiation could account for the observed attenuation in Tat-mediated gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), while preserving (but not increasing) the Switching fraction enhancement that was predicted for the observed changes in Sp1 mutant sampling of basal transcription parameters.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Amplification of HIV gene expression noise via Tat positive feedback results in a wide range of noise-driven phenotypes that vary across the diverse host genomic environments sampled during HIV infection. Here, using an <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-based HIV model system and a novel forward genetic screen, we identified LTR promoter mutations that increase the frequency of the Switching phenotype, a model for latent viral infections. Two key features of our screen are 1) its dynamic nature, which selects for stochastic phenotypes that ‘switch’ between quiescent and highly expressing states; and 2) integration randomization, which applies selective pressure on mutations affecting the fraction of integrations that specify Switching phenotypes rather than on the integration positions themselves. These features reflect the time-varying selective pressure that is likely applied by a dynamic immune system and therapy schedule, and the integration randomization that occurs when a viral lineage is propagated by new infections <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our forward genetics approach enabled the systematic identification of promoter elements that affect the Switching fraction, and complements prior reverse genetics approaches that analyzed how specific mutations affect gene expression and phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Burnett1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Berkhout1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Bonneau1">[57]</xref>. The screen identified strongly selected mutations in Sp1 and TATA transcription factor binding sites within the core transcriptional regulatory region of the HIV LTR, and we confirmed that these mutations led to higher frequencies of Switching phenotypes across integration positions.</p>

<title>Integrating models and measurements to identify biological mechanisms underlying experimental observations</title>
<p>Our study was enabled by the development of a computational model that described how promoter-driven expression fluctuations are propagated via Tat positive feedback to generate the wide range of expression phenotypes in our system. We used this model to investigate features of Tat feedback that generate stochastic phenotypes, to formulate hypotheses concerning the mechanisms by which these features may be varied through mutation, and to study the implications and consistency of these hypotheses with our experimental data.</p>
<p>The Tat transactivation circuit – an essential and conserved feature of the HIV virus across clades – is characterized in our model by positive feedback loops that enhance both the size and frequency of transcriptional bursts. HIV gene expression phenotypes range from Dim to Bright as the kinetic parameters of the circuit are varied, with intermediate parameter values generating the stochastic Switching phenotypes that our screen was designed to select. These Switching phenotypes, which we have suggested may serve as a model for latent infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Weinberger1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Burnett1">[43]</xref>, are characterized by Tat-amplified transcriptional fluctuations that drive stochastic switching between quiescent and highly expressing states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, all of the transcriptional and regulatory processes described in our model – and their underlying kinetic parameters – can be modulated by genomic environment. Thus, a viral sampling of genomic environments that range from repressive to permissive can tune the steady-state behavior of Tat positive feedback circuit to generate a distribution of expression phenotypes that span from Dim to Bright, with intermediate integrations generating Switching phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Jordan1">[41]</xref>. In this way, the possibility of stochastically-generated latent phenotypes at a subset of viral integrations may be an intrinsic feature of the Tat circuit and its sampling of host-cell genomic environments, and the virus may tune the fraction of integrations that specify this phenotype through mutation.</p>
<p>Guided by our model analysis both here and in previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>, we hypothesized that the Sp1 mutation may alter the prevalence of Switching phenotypes by modulating basal transcription dynamics. Although the underlying basal bursting dynamic of the WT promoter was essentially preserved in the Sp1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we were able to detect modest quantitative differences in the sampling of basal expression dynamics over integration positions. Our computational analysis confirmed that these small differences in basal expression for the Sp1 mutant could be amplified in the presence of Tat feedback to produce substantial increases in the Switching fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>The selected Sp1 mutant also demonstrated weaker Tat-transactivated expression, and we further used our model to investigate how this could affect the Switching fraction. Our model analysis demonstrated that weakening Tat feedback proportionately for all integrations would decrease, rather than increase, Switching fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, accounting for an increased Switching fraction in the presence of weaker Tat feedback required a mechanism by which the selected mutation could differentially affect basal and transactivated expression, which we suggested could be accomplished through impaired transcriptional reinitiation. A revised computational model that included impaired transcriptional reinitiation could thus account qualitatively for both trends observed experimentally for the Sp1 mutant: an enhanced Switching fraction accompanied by attenuated Tat-transactivated expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g007">Figure 7B–C</xref>). However, we note that our model still does not quantitatively account for the full increase in Switching fraction observed experimentally for the Sp1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003135-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). A complete explanation might thus require identification of additional mechanisms that differentially affect Tat transactivation across genomic integrations and a more detailed characterization of how the selected mutations perturb the transcription parameters sampled by the virus over genomic integrations.</p>

<title>Mechanisms by which Sp1 and TBP may control HIV expression phenotypes</title>
<p>Multiple studies have demonstrated that mutations in the Sp1 sites of the HIV LTR can significantly reduce HIV Tat-mediated transactivation, while minimally affecting basal expression (for those cases in which it was measured) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Berkhout1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Kamine1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Harrich1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Das1">[59]</xref>. Although the detailed mechanisms by which Sp1 regulates HIV expression remain unknown, there is evidence that Sp1 recruits P-TEFb <italic>in vivo</italic> to release the stalled RNAPII from the promoter proximal region and activate transcriptional elongation of HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-DOrso1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Kamine1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Yedavalli1">[56]</xref>. To our knowledge, a role for Sp1 in transcriptional reinitiation has not been directly tested. However, if Sp1 participates in recruitment of P-TEFb, then lower affinity Sp1 binding (caused by promoter mutation) may destabilize the P-TEFb complex in the promoter active state and thus lower the rate of transcriptional reinitiation (κ<sub>r</sub> in our model).</p>
<p>Interestingly, TATA mutations in the HIV LTR also substantially reduce Tat-mediated transactivation without affecting mean basal expression from the HIV LTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Berkhout1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Montanuy1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Olsen1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-vanOpijnen1">[61]</xref>, similar to observations by others and us for Sp1 mutation. Although we did not explore the mechanisms underlying mutation of the TATA box, an increase in the half-time of transcriptional reinitiation (1/κ<sub>r</sub> in our model) has been measured directly for a mutation at site 2 of the TATA box <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Yean1">[62]</xref>. Furthermore, TATA box mutations that decreased reinitiation also correlated with decreased stability of the TBP:TFIIA (general transcription factor) complex on the DNA, suggesting that retention of general transcription factors at the promoter is a primary determinant of the reinitiation rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Yean2">[63]</xref>. Our results motivate a future experimental study that directly measures if reduced transcriptional reinitiation provides a mechanistic explanation for the differential effect of Sp1 and TATA box mutations on basal and Tat-transactivated HIV transcription, as observed here and in many previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Berkhout1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Kamine1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Harrich1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Das1">[59]</xref>.</p>

<title>Implications for our understanding of HIV latency</title>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, infected CD4+ T cells that have transitioned to a memory state form a primary reservoir of latent infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Chun1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Brenchley1">[34]</xref>. However, HIV does not efficiently establish infection in resting memory CD4+ T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Zack1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Zhou2">[65]</xref>, and activated CD4+ T cells typically die within days after infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Ho1">[30]</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesize that transcriptional delays, such as those associated the Switching phenotype in our <italic>in vitro</italic> system and that occur on a similar time scale to the memory-state transition, could delay viral production and thus increase the time window during which the memory-state transition could occur post-infection. Thus, viral mutations such as the Sp1 and TATA mutations identified in our study, which result in an increased fraction of viral integrations demonstrating transcriptional delays, could lead to an increase in the fraction of memory T cells that harbor a latent infection.</p>
<p>If this <italic>in vitro</italic> model of latency has <italic>in vivo</italic> implications, then our results suggest that there may be enrichment for viruses with an Sp1 and/or TATA box mutation in the latent reservoir. Although we are unaware of any direct evidence of enrichment for either Sp1 or TATA box mutations in the latent pool, there is evidence that viruses with an Sp1 site III mutation are enriched during the course of disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Nonnemacher1">[66]</xref> and that viruses with impaired Tat activity are enriched in latent reservoirs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Yukl1">[67]</xref>. These studies are suggestive that some viral mutations, particularly ones affecting Tat transactivation as demonstrated in our study, may create favorable conditions for establishing latent infections. Interestingly, these studies suggested that lower transcriptional activity may underlie the propensity of these viruses to establish a latent infection, but our results suggest it is instead the increased probability for transcriptional delay that potentiates latent infection. A related and testable hypothesis is that the three HIV subtypes (D, F and H) with mutations in Sp1 site III may demonstrate an increased propensity for latency and thus give rise to larger latent reservoirs relative to subtype B infection. To our knowledge, there is no study that has examined the relative sizes of the latent viral reservoirs for different HIV subtypes, and therefore this may be an important translational study that is motivated by our work.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study provides an integrated experimental and computational framework for identifying genetic sequences that alter the distribution of stochastic expression phenotypes over genomic locations and for characterizing their mechanisms of regulation. Our results also may yield further insights into the mechanisms by which HIV sequence evolution can alter the propensity for latent infections.</p>

<p>Switching fractions, over the full set of genomic integrations, were estimated from mid-sorted sub-samples, via an application of Bayes theorem:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003135.e021"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003135.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>S</italic> is the event that an infected cell contains a Switching integration and <italic>M</italic> is the event that the cellular fluorescence is in the range of the sorting gate (i.e. mid range). The conditional probability, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003135.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, was estimated as the fraction of clones from a given mid sort that were labeled as Switching (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003135.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003135.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of clones analyzed from the mid sort and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003135.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number that were labeled as Switching).

<title>Computational modeling and distribution fitting</title>
<p>Our model of the transactivation circuit considers each reaction as a Markov process, proceeding with fixed probability per unit time (full model details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003135.s008">Text S1</xref>). For any fixed set of parameter values, the model was solved to obtain predicted steady-state protein distributions across a clonal population of cells by approximating and numerically integrating the master equation for the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Gardiner1">[70]</xref> in time until a stationary distribution was achieved. Protein numbers were convert to cytometer RFU by scaling, and distributions were convolved with a measured autofluorescence profile for comparison with experimental distributions, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Tat-null distributions were fit to the transactivation model with feedback from Tat removed based on the first 6 distribution moments (see Supplemental text for further details). Transcriptional bursting was assumed, so that transcriptional burst size (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003135.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and burst frequency (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003135.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) were the only model fit parameters, with the remaining model parameters calibrated following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>. The assumption of transcriptional bursting was checked by systematically varying the active-state duration (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003135.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and refitting the model at each value. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003135-Skupsky1">[22]</xref>, the best fits were always found in the transcriptional bursting regime (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003135.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). All analysis was done using in-house code written in Matlab (The Mathworks).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical significance of differences between means in triplicate experiments was assessed using a 2-sided t-test. Pearson Chi-squared statistics were calculated for the appropriate contingency tables to assess differences in mutation rates between libraries marginally and by regulatory region, and at individual positions along the promoter, after controlling for base type in the WT (parent) sequence. All quoted raw p-values for post-hoc analysis remain significant at the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003135.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> level for Type I error after Bonferroni correction, and corresponding global tests were always significant at least at this level. Equality of regression coefficients was assessed by partial F-test, and differences between individual regression parameters were assessed by t-test in post-hoc analysis. Confidence intervals for experimental Switching fraction estimates, and p-values for their differences, were estimated using a bootstrap procedure. Contingency table analysis was conducted using SAS/STAT software version 9.1 for Windows, Copyright 2012 SAS Institute Inc. All other computational analysis was performed using Matlab (The Mathworks).</p>
