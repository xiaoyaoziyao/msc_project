        <p>Vertebrate embryos exploit the mutual inhibition between the RA and FGF signalling pathways to coordinate the proliferative elongation of the main body axis with the progressive patterning and differentiation of its neuroectodermal and paraxial mesodermal structures. The evolutionary history of this patterning system is still poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role played by the RA and FGF/MAPK signals during the development of the tail structures in the tunicate <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, an invertebrate chordate belonging to the sister clade of vertebrates, in which the prototypical chordate body plan is established through very derived morphogenetic processes. <italic>Ciona</italic> embryos are constituted of few cells and develop according to a fixed lineage; elongation of the tail occurs largely by rearrangement of postmitotic cells; mesoderm segmentation and somitogenesis are absent. We show that in the <italic>Ciona</italic> embryo, the antagonism of the RA and FGF/MAPK signals is required to control the anteroposterior patterning of the tail epidermis. We also demonstrate that the RA, FGF/MAPK and canonical Wnt pathways control the anteroposterior patterning of the tail peripheral nervous system, and reveal the existence of distinct subpopulations of caudal epidermal neurons with different responsiveness to the RA, FGF/MAPK and canonical Wnt signals. Our data provide the first demonstration that the use of the antagonism between the RA and FGF signals to pattern the main body axis predates the emergence of vertebrates and highlight the evolutionary plasticity of this patterning strategy, showing that in different chordates it can be used to pattern different tissues within the same homologous body region.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Antagonism between the Retinoic Acid (RA) and FGF signalling pathways controls the development of the posterior vertebrate body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral2">[2]</xref>. The tailbud provides a posterior source of FGF8 that keeps the caudal presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells in an immature state and maintains the proliferative status of the spinal cord precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Dubrulle1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Mathis1">[7]</xref>. RA produced in the segmented somites and the anteriormost PSM by the enzyme Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase2 (Raldh2) promotes PSM segmentation and triggers spinal cord patterning and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Moreno1">[8]</xref>. The signalling cascades initiated by RA and FGF inhibit each other at multiple levels. In chicken, FGF8 prevents Raldh2 and the RA receptor RARβ from being transcribed in the intermediate and posterior PSM, while RA downregulates FGF8 in the anterior PSM and the overlying neuroepithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-OliveraMartinez1">[9]</xref>. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, RA induces the expression of MKP3, a phosphatase that inhibits the MAPK branch of the FGF signalling pathway, while FGF controls the expression of Cyp26, a P450-family cytochrome that hydrolyses RA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Moreno1">[8]</xref>. The posterior displacement of the FGF8-producing tailbud during embryo elongation results in the formation of a caudalward-travelling wave of RA signal. This determination front allows paraxial mesoderm segmentation and spinal cord differentiation to proceed coordinately with the elongation of the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Moreno1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Dubrulle2">[10]</xref>. The opposing RA and FGF signals also control the collinear activation of Hox gene transcription: FGF activates genes located at the 5′ end of the Hox cluster, while RA induces expression of the 3′ end Hox cluster members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Liu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-BelVialar1">[12]</xref>. Besides the RA/FGF system, a posterior-to-anterior gradient of canonical WNT activity has been described, with a role in coordinating the PSM maturation and segmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Aulehla1">[13]</xref>. Canonical WNT signalling also stimulates the expression of Raldh2 in the low FGF signalling environment of the anterior PSM, thus mediating the transition between FGF- and RA-sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-OliveraMartinez1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The strategy relying on opposing FGF/WNT and RA gradients to coordinate embryo elongation and patterning has been identified only in vertebrates, and it is unclear whether it is exploited by other chordates. Some support for the existence of a two opposing gradient system in the last common chordate ancestor comes from amphioxus, currently seen as the most basal extant chordate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Bourlat1">[14]</xref>. The amphioxus tailbud expresses several Wnt genes and at least one Fgf8-orthologue, Fgf8/17/18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Schubert1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Meulemans1">[16]</xref>; RA controls amphioxus Hox gene expression, as well as AP patterning of the spinal cord, the epidermis and epidermal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Escriv1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Schubert3">[19]</xref>. On the other hand, recent work only shows a role of FGF signalling in the formation of the anterior paraxial mesoderm in amphioxus, but not in the segmentation and patterning of the more posterior somites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Bertrand2">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Ascidians belong to the subphylum Tunicata (or Urochordata), the sister group to vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Delsuc1">[21]</xref>. Although their larvae have a tadpole-like chordate body plan, they show a number of derived features: their embryos are made of few cells and develop according to a fixed lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Lemaire1">[22]</xref>; elongation of the embryo takes place by spatial rearrangement of postmitotic cells without posterior growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Katsuyama1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Passamaneck1">[24]</xref>; mesoderm segmentation is absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Passamaneck1">[24]</xref>; the Hox gene cluster is disorganized and dispersed across two chromosomes; the temporal collinearity of Hox gene expression is lost and the spatial collinearity is only partially retained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Ikuta1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>If the last common chordate ancestor already exploited opposing FGF/WNT and RA signals to coordinate AP elongation and patterning, then such a mechanism is likely to have undergone profound modifications in tunicates: it may have been altogether lost for lack of selective constraints, simplified, adapted to different constraints such as a determinative mode of development or recycled to fulfil novel functions. In any case, a better understanding of the molecular and functional interactions between FGF, WNT and RA pathways in the development of the posterior structures of ascidian larvae will not only contribute to clarifying the existence of a common minimum blueprint for generating the chordate body plan, but also provide insights into how the evolution of gene regulatory networks and other complex patterning mechanisms accompanies and/or underlies morphological and morphogenetic simplification in an extremely derived organism that retained a prototypical chordate body plan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Lemaire1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Holland1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Davidson1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we show that in the elongating embryonic tail of <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, the RA pathway is specifically active within the anterior tail epidermis, while the activities of the FGF/MAPK and WNT canonical pathways are restricted to the tailtip epidermis, a situation reminiscent of the two opposing anterior RA and posterior FGF/WNT gradients described in vertebrates. The RA and FGF/MAPK signals counteract each other, and this antagonism is required for the proper AP patterning of the tail epidermis and PNS. Thus, our data provide the first functional evidence that a strategy relying on the mutual antagonism between RA and FGF acts to pattern the posterior body of an invertebrate chordate, although in the very derived <italic>Ciona</italic> this may be used only to control the patterning of epidermal structures. This could reflect either a shared ancestral chordate usage of this system to control the anteroposterior patterning of all posterior body structures, followed by taxon-specific losses, or a case of repeated cooption of a particularly efficient developmental regulatory network during the course of chordate evolution.</p>

        <title>Regionalized activity of the RA, FGF/MAPK and canonical WNT pathways in the <italic>Ciona</italic> tail epidermis</title>
        <p>To address the potential role of the RA, FGF/MAPK and WNT signals in the patterning of <italic>Ciona</italic> embryonic posterior structures, we first defined the territories where these pathways are active during the processes of tail patterning and elongation.</p>
        <p>We found that in the <italic>Ciona</italic> embryo tail, immunoreactivity against diphosphorylated Erk, a hallmark of the activation of the RTK-dependent MAPK pathway, is detected in the epidermal cells surrounding the tailtip from neurula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Shi1">[28]</xref> to tailbud stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">2K, L</xref>). The dpErk signal is expanded by treatment with bFGF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046193.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>) and is suppressed or decreased following the targeted epidermal expression of a dominant-negative form of the only <italic>Ciona</italic> FGF receptor, <italic>Ci-FGFR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>′). Two FGF factors are expressed in the tailtip region: <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic>, restricted to a very small population (2 to 4 cells) of epidermal cells at the tip of the extending tail from the gastrula stage onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g001">Fig. 1B–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Imai1">[29]</xref>) and <italic>Ci-fgf9/16/20</italic>, expressed by some tailtip muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Imai1">[29]</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046193.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). Likewise, only two WNT genes are expressed at the end of the <italic>Ciona</italic> tail: <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> is expressed in tailtip epidermal cells and their progenitors from the late gastrula stage and throughout tailbud stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g001">Fig. 1H–L</xref>); <italic>Ci-wnt11-1/Ci-orphan wnt e</italic> is expressed by a few tailtip muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Imai2">[30]</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aniseed-ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/gene-card.php?clusterid=cluster9820" xlink:type="simple">http://aniseed-ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/gene-card.php?clusterid=cluster9820</ext-link>). Although WNT5 and WNT11 have often been considered as members of a “non-canonical” signalling subgroup, it has been recently shown that whether the canonical or the non-canonical pathways are activated depends more on the receptor/co-receptor context than on strictly defined WNT functional classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Mikels1">[31]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that <italic>Ci-LRP5/6</italic>, the <italic>Ciona</italic> homologue of LRP5/6, the WNT co-receptor required for canonical pathway activation, is expressed in the ventral midline epidermis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046193.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). Consistently, WNT canonical activity, mapped with a reporter construct in which expression of β-galactosidase is under the control of multiple binding sites for the canonical WNT pathway effector, TCF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Rothbacher1">[32]</xref>, is restricted to two ventral territories in the <italic>Ciona</italic> tail, the endodermal strand and the posterior ventral midline epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). While the endodermal activity is the outcome of the pre-gastrula β-catenin requirement for endoderm specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Imai3">[33]</xref>, still visible due to the long half-life of β-galactosidase, the posterior epidermis activity likely reflects the activation of the WNT canonical pathway during tail elongation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046193.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>). Co-expression of an epidermally-targeted dominant-active form of β-catenin or embryo incubation with the GSK3-β inhibitor LiCl both result in ectopic reporter activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046193.s002">Fig. S2C</xref> and data not shown). Finally, expression of <italic>Ci-aldh1a1/2/3a</italic>, the <italic>Ciona</italic> homologue of the RA-synthesizing enzyme Raldh2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Caestro1">[34]</xref>, was first detected in the anterior muscle precursors at late gastrula stage, then confined to the anteriormost 3–5 muscle cell pairs throughout the process of tail extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g001">Fig. 1N–P</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Nagatomo1">[35]</xref>). The RA-responsive territories, identified by using the reporter construct pCi-Hox1(intron2)/lacZ, in which the RA-responsive cis-regulatory sequences of the <italic>Ci-Hox1</italic> gene control the expression of β-galactosidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Kanda1">[36]</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046193.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>), are localized in the trunk mesenchyme and epidermis, the muscle and the anterior tail epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g001">Fig. 1M</xref>). These structures coincide with, or are adjacent to, the territories expressing <italic>Ci-aldh1a1/2/3a</italic>.</p>

            <p>(<bold>A–K</bold>): The FGF/MAPK pathway controls both synthesis and degradation of RA. The expression of the RA-synthesising enzyme <italic>Ci-aldh1a1/2/3a</italic> in the anterior tail muscle cells (A) is not affected by treatment with RA (B), the Ci-aldh1a1/2/3a inhibitor DEAB (C) or recombinant bFGF (D), but is suppressed by the MAPK inhibitor UO126 (E). The RA hydrolysing enzyme <italic>Ci-cyp26</italic> is expressed in the anterior and posterior thirds of the tail epidermis (F). RA treatment results in a strong increase of <italic>Ci-cyp26</italic> expression (G), while DEAB leads to its loss from the anterior tail epidermis (H). Treatment with bFGF results in the upregulation of <italic>Ci-cyp26</italic> expression throughout the tail epidermis (I); treatment with U0126 leads to the loss of <italic>Ci-cyp26</italic> expression mostly from the anterior tail epidermis (J). Epidermal expression of a dominant-negative form of the <italic>Ciona</italic> FGF receptor results in a decrease of the Ci-cyp26 expression (K).

        <p>In conclusion, our data reveal that, despite the major morphogenetic differences in the posterior elongation process existing between <italic>Ciona</italic> and the vertebrates, the regions of activity of the RA, FGF/MAPK and canonical WNT pathways in the posterior body bear striking analogies: RA is active in the anterior territories, FGF/MAPK and canonical WNT in posterior ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g001">Fig. 1Q</xref>).</p>

        <title>Reciprocal control of FGF/MAPK and RA pathways</title>
        <p>In vertebrates, the signalling cascades triggered by RA and FGF have been found to inhibit each other at multiple levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Moreno1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-OliveraMartinez1">[9]</xref>. To address whether the RA and FGF/MAPK pathways also antagonize each other in the <italic>Ciona</italic> tail epidermis, we first analysed the expression of the RA-synthesising enzyme, <italic>Ci-aldh1a1/2/3a</italic>, and the RA-catabolising enzyme, <italic>Ci-cyp26</italic>, following activation or blockade of the RA and FGF/MAPK pathways between early gastrula and early tailbud stages. The expression of <italic>Ci-aldh1a1/2/3a</italic> is independent of RA signalling itself, as it is not modified by either exogenous RA, nor the known Raldh2 inhibitor DEAB (Diethylaminobenzaldehyde at any stage analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2B, C</xref> and data not shown). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2D</xref> and data not shown, the number of muscle cells expressing <italic>Ci-aldh1a1/2/3a</italic> does not appear to increase in response to treatment of embryos with recombinant bFGF. On the other hand, the expression of <italic>Ci-aldh1a1/2/3a</italic> in the anterior tail muscle cells was lost or severely downregulated in embryos treated with the MAPK inhibitor U0126 between early gastrula and neurula stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2E</xref> and data not shown).</p>
        <p><italic>Ci-cyp26</italic>, the <italic>Ciona</italic> homologue of the cytochrome enzyme responsible for degrading RA, has a complex pattern of expression in the tail epidermis, being strongly expressed in the anterior third of the tail, more weakly in the posterior third, and absent from the central third (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Nagatomo1">[35]</xref>). A feedback control exists between RA and <italic>Ci-cyp26</italic>, since its expression is strongly upregulated throughout the tail epidermis by treatment with RA at all stages analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>, data not shown and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Nagatomo1">[35]</xref>), and suppressed in anterior tail region by 150 mM DEAB between early gastrula and neurula stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2H</xref> and data not shown). At these stages, <italic>Ci-cyp26</italic> expression in the tail epidermis is also expanded by treatment with bFGF, albeit to a lesser extent than by RA and mostly within the anterior and middle third of the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2I</xref> and data not shown). On the other hand, treatment with U0126 results in a complete loss of the anterior expression of <italic>Ci-cyp26</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2J</xref>), a likely secondary effect of the suppression of <italic>Ci-aldh1a1/2/3a</italic> expression, as this loss is rescued in embryos treated with both U0126 and RA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046193.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>), while epidermally-targeted expression of a dominant-negative form of <italic>Ciona</italic> FGFR results in the partial loss of <italic>Ci-cyp26</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2K</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thus, our data show that the levels of RA in the <italic>Ciona</italic> embryo tail are regulated by both the RA pathway itself and the FGF/MAPK pathway, with MAPK controlling the production of RA within the anterior tail muscle cells and FGF promoting its degradation in the tail epidermis.</p>
        <p>To explore whether the FGF/MAPK control of the RA pathway is mirrored by a symmetrical control exerted by RA on the FGF/MAPK activity, we analysed the phosphorylation status of Erk in the tail epidermis of <italic>Ciona</italic> embryos treated with 1.5 µM RA at gastrula stage. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2L–O</xref>, RA treatment leads to a decrease of Erk diphosphorylation in the epidermis, distinct from the global extinction of the signal following treatment with the MAPK inhibitor U0126 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046193.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>To summarize, multiple levels of interaction exist between the FGF/MAPK and RA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2P</xref>).</p>

        <title>FGF/MAPK and RA pathways control the AP patterning of <italic>Ciona</italic> tail epidermis</title>
        <p>The timing of our pharmacological treatment experiments shows that the antagonism between the RA and FGF/MAPK pathways in the <italic>Ciona</italic> tail epidermis is set up between the mid-gastrula and late neurula stages, before the initiation of tail elongation and concomitantly with the establishment of the epidermal AP patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Ikuta1">[25]</xref>. We therefore explored whether the AP patterning of <italic>Ciona</italic> tail epidermis might be controlled by the RA and the FGF/MAPK signals.</p>
        <p>The tail epidermis shows only a limited degree of AP patterning: in addition to the above described expression of <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic> and <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> by cells at or around the tailtip, <italic>Ci-hox12</italic> is expressed by epidermal cells in the posteriormost third of the tail, and <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> by those of the anteriormost third (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Ikuta1">[25]</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3E–H</xref> and data not shown, treatment of embryos with 1.5 µM RA from early gastrula to neurula stages leads to an expansion of <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> expression throughout the entire tail epidermis and to a complete loss or a severe reduction of both <italic>Ci-hox12</italic> and <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> expression, with only a residual signal left in cells at the very tip of the tail, while the expression of <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic> is not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3H</xref>). When the RA signal is blocked by treatment with 150 µM DEAB at the same stages, the expression of <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> is completely lost from both epidermis and neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3I</xref>), whereas <italic>Ci-hox12</italic>, <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> or <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic> are not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3J–L</xref> and data not shown).</p>

            <p>(<bold>A–D</bold>): In control embryos, the expression of <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> (A) is restricted to the anterior third tail epidermal cells, that of <italic>Ci-hox12</italic> (B) to the posterior third epidermal cells, while <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> (C) is expressed in cells around the tailtip and <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic> (D) is restricted to 2–4 cells at the very tip of the tail. (<bold>E–H</bold>): treatment with 1.5 µM RA leads to an ectopic expression of <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> throughout the tail epidermis (E) and to a loss or a strong reduction of <italic>Ci-hox12</italic> (F) and <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> (G), without affecting the expression of <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic> (H). (<bold>I–L</bold>): inhibition of the RA synthesis by treatment with 150 µM DEAB leads to a loss of <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> expression (I), but has no effect on <italic>Ci-hox12</italic> (J), <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> (K) or <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic> (L). (<bold>M–P</bold>): treatment with 100 ng/ml bFGF results in a loss of <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> expression from the anterior tail epidermis in about 30% of the treated embryos (M). Conversely, the expression domains of <italic>Ci-hox12</italic> (N) and to a lesser extent of <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> (O) are expanded anteriorly. The expression of <italic>Cifgf8/17/18</italic> is not affected (P). (<bold>Q–T</bold>): Epidermal expression of a dominant-negative form of the <italic>Ciona</italic> FGF receptor leads to the ectopic expression of <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> (arrowhead in Q) and to the loss or decrease of <italic>Ci-hox12</italic> (R), <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> (S) and <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic> (T). The low percentage of embryos showing loss of <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic> expression is most likely due to the very small number of epidermal cells (2 to 4) which express <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic> and which fail to express dnFGFR due to the mosaicism inherent to the electroporation technique. (U-X): treatment with 10 µM U0126 results in a complete loss or a severe downregulation of both anterior and posterior genes. All embryos were treated at late gastrula stage and analysed at mid-late tailbud for <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> and <italic>Ci-hox12</italic>, at early-mid tailbud stage for <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> and <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic>.

        </fig>
        <p>On the other hand, treatment with recombinant bFGF from early gastrula to neurula results in an anterior expansion of the <italic>Ci-hox12</italic> and of the <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> expression domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3N, O</xref>), again without affecting the expression of <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3P</xref>). Interestingly, bFGF treatment leads to the loss of <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> expression from the anterior tail epidermis, but not from the anterior neural tube, in about 30% of the embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3M</xref>) and to a similar, albeit weaker, reduction of the pCi-Hox1(intron2)/lacZ reporter epidermal activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046193.s003">Fig. S3C</xref>). The upregulation of <italic>Ci-hox12</italic> and <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> following treatment with bFGF is at odds with a previous report in which SU5402, a pharmacological inhibitor of the FGF receptor, was used to rule out a role of the FGF pathway in controlling the expression of these markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Ikuta2">[37]</xref>. To better understand the role of the FGF pathway in patterning the tail epidermis, we analysed embryos in which the reception of the FGF signal was specifically disrupted in the epidermis by means of the dominant-negative form of Ci-FGFR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3Q–T</xref>, blocking the FGF pathway in the epidermis results in the ectopic expression of <italic>Ci-hox1</italic>, while leading to the decrease or loss of the expression of <italic>Ci-hox12</italic>, <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> and <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18.</italic></p>
        <p>Inhibition of the MAPK pathway with 10 µM U0126 leads to the complete suppression of <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3U</xref>), revealing an action of the MAPK pathway that does not depend on the reception of the FGF signal in epidermis, and is likely related to the MAPK requirement for <italic>Ci-aldh1a1/2/3a</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). U0126 treatment also leads to the downregulation of <italic>Ci-hox12</italic>, <italic>Ci-wnt5</italic> and <italic>Ci-fgf8/17/18</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3V–X</xref>).</p>
        <p>Overall, our data show that the RA and FGF/MAPK pathways exert partially opposing effects on the AP patterning of <italic>Ciona</italic> tail epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g003">Fig. 3Y</xref>): RA is required to establish and maintain the anterior identity of the tail epidermis and is sufficient to inhibit its posterior identity, while FGF is required to establish the posterior tail epidermis character, but also negatively controls the anterior epidermis identity. Therefore, the antagonism between the RA and FGF/MAPK signals in the <italic>Ciona</italic> tail is no mere atavism, but a functioning patterning system.</p>

        <p>We next searched for differentiated <italic>Ciona</italic> tail structures that could be under the control of the patterning system relying on the antagonism between RA and FGF.

We tested whether the CENs are regionalized along the AP axis by analyzing their birthdate and morphology. Examination of embryos hybridized with the neuronal-specific marker <italic>Ci-etr</italic> at initial- to early-tailbud stages revealed that the posteriormost ventral CENs (vCENs) are consistently born earlier than the anterior ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g004">Fig. 4C, C′</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Pasini1">[38]</xref>).

We found that all the dorsal CENs as well as the one or two posteriormost vCENs emit long axonal projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g004">Fig. 4B, D–E′</xref>), while the anteriormost vCENs have only short, stumpy axons or no axon at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g004">Fig. 4F, F′</xref>). Moreover, the posteriormost vCENs establish contact with the axonal projections of other GFP-positive cells, such as the dorsal CENs and the dorsal subepidermal bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g004">Fig. 4E, E′</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Imai4">[40]</xref>, while the anterior vCENs do not appear to establish contact with any other GFP-positive cell. To quantify the morphological differences between anteriormost and posteriormost vCENs, we measured the axonal length in fluorescence microscopy pictures of 42 randomly chosen pCi-VeGluT::GFP-expressing vCENs from 14 different larvae and plotted it against the cell body position along the larval tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>).

The number and distribution of <italic>Ci-etr</italic>-positive vCENs at late tailbud stage (stages 23 and 24 according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Hotta1">[43]</xref>) were thus analyzed in embryos treated at different time points with bFGF, RA or with the pharmacological inhibitors U0126 and DEAB. In addition, embryos treated with the GSK3-β inhibitors LiCl and BIO, as well as embryos expressing a dominant-active form of β-catenin, were also analyzed to explore a possible role of the canonical Wnt pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref> and data not shown, all the treatments tested have an effect on the number of vCENs. Treatment with RA starting at early gastrula to late neurula stages (stages 11 to 16 according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Hotta1">[43]</xref>) leads to a significant increase in vCEN number, mirrored by a comparable decrease in embryos treated with the RA pathway inhibitor DEAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref> and data not shown). Interestingly, posterior and anterior vCENs were differentially affected. RA stimulation leads to an increased number of anterior vCENs and to a loss of posterior ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g005">Fig. 5A, C</xref>). The supernumerary anterior vCENs in RA-treated embryos arise within the neurogenic midline region and are always intercalated with <italic>Ci-etr</italic> negative epidermal cells, thus placing RA downstream of the BMP signal which induces the neurogenic ventral midline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Pasini1">[38]</xref> and upstream of the Delta/Notch-dependent lateral inhibition process which controls the number of CENs and epidermal cells within the midline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Pasini1">[38]</xref>. Conversely, DEAB treatment had little effect on the posterior vCENs, but strongly affected the anterior ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g005">Fig. 5A, C</xref>). Consistent with the opposing activities of RA and FGF pathways during gastrula and early neurula stages, ectopic application of bFGF from the early gastrula stage repressed the formation of anterior vCENs, without effect on the posterior population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g005">Fig. 5A, B, C</xref>). Treatment with U0126 at early gastrula stage (stage 11) led to the loss of the posteriormost CENs, and also had a weak effect on the anterior ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), likely reflecting the control of RA synthesis by MAPK. On the other hand, U0126 treatment at later stages did not affect significantly the number of vCENs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g005">Fig. 5A, B, C</xref>). Finally, activation of the canonical Wnt pathway by treatment with either LiCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g005">Fig. 5A, B, C</xref>) or BIO (data not shown) or by epidermally targeted overexpression of activated β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046193-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) from the mid-neurula stage represses the formation of the anterior vCENs, without affecting the posterior ones.</p>

        <title>Conservation and adaptation of a signalling and transcriptional patterning network</title>
        <p>Although <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae and tailbud-stage vertebrate embryos have a remarkably similar body plan, the morphogenetic processes used to build their shared tadpole shape differ significantly. In vertebrates, embryo elongation is brought about by a combination of continuous cell proliferation in the tailbud and convergent-extension movements. On the other hand, <italic>Ciona</italic> embryos lack a posterior growth zone and tail elongation is mostly obtained via changes in the position and shape of postmitotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Katsuyama1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Passamaneck1">[24]</xref>. Moreover, the AP patterning of the <italic>Ciona</italic> epidermis is not progressively laid down throughout the course of tail extension, but initially established between the late gastrula and early tailbud stages, then maintained during the subsequent elongation step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Ikuta1">[25]</xref>. Despite the different morphogenetic strategies exploited by <italic>Ciona</italic> and the vertebrates to shape their posterior body and the divergence in the differentiated structures that constitute it, we found extensive conservation of a system of opposing RA and FGF/MAPK signals to control spatial <italic>Hox</italic> genes expression and posterior body patterning. This is in contrast with what described in insects, where two divergent morphogenetic strategies (short- and long-germband) use different segmentation and patterning mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Peter1">[44]</xref>, and is also surprising in view of the global divergence in orthologous gene expression patterns between ascidians and vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Sobral1">[45]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our data show that not only small cell-autonomous kernels based on interactions among transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Davidson1">[27]</xref>, but also a longer-range patterning mechanism relying on diffusible molecules may be conserved in its basic principles and some of its transcriptional targets over at least 500My of independent evolution. However, in the simplified context of <italic>Ciona</italic> embryos, the details of interaction between the RA and FGF signals differ from the model described in vertebrates. Accordingly, the mutual inhibition between RA and FGF in <italic>Ciona</italic> seems to take place only at the level of signal transduction or degradation rather than synthesis, as is the case in mouse or chicken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral2">[2]</xref>. Just as the regulatory interactions which structure the antagonism between the two pathways differ from the vertebrate paradigm, the links between this patterning system and its final output are modified. In vertebrates, the caudal-related homeobox transcription factors of the Cdx family mediate the FGF transcriptional activation of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-BelVialar1">[12]</xref>. In <italic>Ciona</italic>, the unique Cdx factor <italic>Ci-cdx</italic> is surprisingly expressed throughout the tail epidermis with the exception of the posteriormost cells, where FGF/MAPK signalling is active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Ikuta2">[37]</xref>. Despite these differences our data reveal an unexpected level of conservation in Hox gene regulation between <italic>Ciona</italic> and vertebrates: as in vertebrates, RA promotes the expression of the anterior gene <italic>Ci-hox1</italic> and represses the posterior <italic>Ci-hox12</italic>, while FGF has the opposite effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Liu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-BelVialar1">[12]</xref>. Thus, although in <italic>Ciona</italic> the loss of temporal collinearity has allowed for (or was allowed by) the disintegration of Hox clustering, the maintenance of spatial collinearity is accompanied by the conservation of upstream regulatory factors. To what extent this holds true in other metazoans with various degrees of Hox gene clustering and temporal/spatial collinearity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Duboule1">[46]</xref> remains an open question.</p>
        <p>Our work thus provides a further addition to a growing list of cases where the precise relationships among regulatory network components vary from one metazoan species to the next, but the ultimate outcome of the network is comparable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Peter1">[44]</xref>. In particular, recent work has revealed differences in the precise interactions of the RA, FGF and Wnt signalling cascades during posterior axis elongation and segmentation in different vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Krol1">[47]</xref>. Network wiring differences between <italic>Ciona</italic> and the vertebrates may be related to the different dynamics of the antagonistic RA and FGF activities: rather than generating a moving determination front that progressively shifts posteriorly during elongation, in <italic>Ciona</italic> embryos RA and FGF define two stable determination fields in the epidermis before the onset of the tail extension process or at its very beginning.</p>

        <title>Plasticity of an ancestral chordate strategy?</title>
        <p>In vertebrates the antagonism between RA and FGF has been shown to control the patterning of the paraxial mesoderm and spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-DiezdelCorral2">[2]</xref>, whereas our data show that in <italic>Ciona</italic> the opposition between these two signals is required to pattern the posterior epidermis. This raises the possibility that in ancestral chordates, the RA/FGF antagonistic coupling was exploited to regulate the patterning of a broad range of embryonic derivatives, including mesoderm, neurectoderm and non neural epidermis, and that in the course of evolution, different chordate taxa have undergone germ layer-specific losses of this patterning mechanism. Such a situation could reflect taxon-specific differences in the degree of patterning complexity of each germ layer, exemplified by the complex patterning of epidermis and the absence of paraxial mesoderm patterning in <italic>Ciona</italic>. Alternatively, it is possible that in some cases the requirement for the antagonism between RA and FGF has been overlooked. As an example, it has been shown in amphioxus that RA affects the AP patterning of the epidermis and the distribution of the epidermal neurones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Schubert2">[18]</xref>, but it is currently not known whether and how FGF also affects these processes; FGF controls the segmentation and patterning of the anteriormost Amphioxus somites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Bertrand2">[20]</xref>, but the role of RA in the segmentation and patterning of the paraxial mesoderm is still unclear. Similarly, almost no data is currently available concerning the AP patterning of trunk epidermis in vertebrates and the role that the antagonism between RA and FGF signals might exert on this process.</p>

        <title>Morphological heterogeneity of the <italic>Ciona</italic> CENs: a driving force for AP tail patterning?</title>
        <p>Our work reveals the existence of subpopulations of Ciona CENs with distinct morphologies and different susceptibility to the RA, FGF and Wnt signals. The morphological heterogeneity of the tail PNS neurons is most likely imposed by their function during the <italic>Ciona</italic> life cycle, which is still unknown. Whatever its function is, it is tempting to speculate that in <italic>Ciona</italic>, the presence of a strongly regionalized tail PNS represents the selective force requiring the maintenance of a complex signalling system responsible for controlling the AP pattern of the posterior body. In this respect, it is worth noting that in the larvacean <italic>Oikopleura dioica</italic>, which lacks a tail PNS analogous to that of <italic>Ciona</italic> (H. Nishida, personal communication), most of the RA signalling machinery is missing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Caestro2">[48]</xref> and the Hox cluster is completely disorganized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046193-Seo1">[49]</xref>. Confirmation of this hypothesis will require further investigation of the tail AP patterning, as well as of the PNS anatomy, development and function in a wider, evolutionarily significant range of ascidians and tunicates.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>We show that, regardless of the different morphogenetic strategies they adopt to build the chordate body plan, the vertebrates and the tunicate <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> exploit a very similar mechanism, based on the antagonism between the RA and FGF/MAPK signals, to pattern the posterior body of their embryos and larvae. Thus this mechanism, until now described only in vertebrates, likely represents an ancestral trait common to all olfactores. Remarkably, while in the vertebrates the opposition between RA and FGF/MAPK coordinates the patterning of the posterior neural tube and paraxial mesoderm, in <italic>Ciona</italic> it controls the AP patterning of the posterior epidermis and the associated PNS, suggesting a high degree of functional plasticity throughout evolution. We also propose that the presence of a relatively complex posterior PNS might have been the selective constraint responsible for retaining the RA vs FGF/MAPK antagonism in <italic>Ciona</italic>. Altogether, our work supports the existence of a common minimum blueprint for generating the chordate body plan but also shows how this has been modified and restricted or redeployed to only a subset of tissues in an extremely derived organism that retained a prototypical chordate body plan.</p>
