<abstract>
<p>The Wnts can be considered as candidates for the Congenital Anomaly of Kidney and Urinary Tract, CAKUT diseases since they take part in the control of kidney organogenesis. Of them <italic>Wnt5a</italic> is expressed in ureteric bud (UB) and its deficiency leads to duplex collecting system (13/90) uni- or bilateral kidney agenesis (10/90), hypoplasia with altered pattern of ureteric tree organization (42/90) and lobularization defects with partly fused ureter trunks (25/90) unlike in controls. The UB had also notably less tips due to <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficiency being at E15.5 306 and at E16.5 765 corresponding to 428 and 1022 in control (p&lt;0.02; p&lt;0.03) respectively. These changes due to <italic>Wnt5a</italic> knock out associated with anomalies in the ultrastructure of the UB daughter epithelial cells. The basement membrane (BM) was malformed so that the BM thickness increased from 46.3 nm to 71.2 nm (p&lt;0.01) at E16.5 in the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> knock out when compared to control. Expression of a panel of BM components such as <italic>laminin</italic> and of <italic>type IV collagen</italic> was also reduced due to the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> knock out. The <italic>P4ha1</italic> gene that encodes a catalytic subunit of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase I (C-P4H-I) in collagen synthesis expression and the overall C-P4H enzyme activity were elevated by around 26% due to impairment in <italic>Wnt5a</italic> function from control. The compound <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>+/-</sup>;<italic>P4ha1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> embryos demonstrated <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> related defects, for example local hyperplasia in the UB tree. A R260H WNT5A variant was identified from renal human disease cohort. Functional studies of the consequence of the corresponding mouse variant in comparison to normal ligand reduced Wnt5a-signalling <italic>in vitro</italic>. Together Wnt5a has a novel function in kidney organogenesis by contributing to patterning of UB derived collecting duct development contributing putatively to congenital disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Congenital anomaly of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) is a collective definition for a spectrum of structural kidney malformations that have their origin <italic>in utero</italic> being a frequent malformation type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref001">1</xref>]. Due to this and the fact that CAKUT can progress to the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) it is a considerable economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref002">2</xref>]. Better understanding of kidney organogenesis should identify novel CAKUT candidates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Wealth of factors that control kidney development have been identified during recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref005">5</xref>]. Initiation of organogenesis involves GDNF and its Ret receptor in the prospective collecting duct derived from the ureteric bud (UB) to advance UB arborisation in concert with FGF, BMP and Wnt growth factors (GFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref007">7</xref>]. The Wnt family members are involved, particularly in nephrogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref014">14</xref>]. Recently Wnt5a was implicated as a signal in kidney organogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref017">17</xref>] and based on the data in a cell model polarized Wnt5a secretion may advance lumen formation in tubulogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref018">18</xref>] with integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Integrins and cell surface proteoglycans (PGs) and their extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands contribute to kidney organogenesis as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref021">21</xref>]. The ECM accumulates GFs such as the Wnts to localise their signalling and availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref022">22</xref>]. In the context of organogenesis GFs encounter a specialized ECM lamina, the basement membrane (BM) that is considered to be involved in the reciprocal epithelial and mesenchyme tissue interactions coordinating organogenesis. For example, the ECM component type XVIII collagen binds Wnts and antagonises their signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref023">23</xref>]. How the concerted actions between BM, ECM and GFs regulate morphogenesis is still unclear.</p>
<p>Wnt5a appears to serve as a signal in coordination of UB development. It promotes prospective collective duct epithelial cell organization and the associated basement membrane formation such that type IV collagen and laminin expression is reduced in the absence of Wnt5a signalling. A R260H human WNT5A variant was identified in a human CAKUT cohort. This variant had reduced signalling in a model cell experiments. Thus Wnt5a advances prospective collecting duct development during kidney organogenesis at least in part via promotion basement membrane and the organization of the overlying epithelial cells.</p>

<title>Mouse models</title>
<p>Generation and genotyping protocols of the <italic>Wnt4</italic>, <italic>Wnt5a</italic> and the <italic>P4ha1</italic> knockout mice have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref025">25</xref>]. The <italic>Wnt4</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>;<italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> was generated by crossing <italic>Wnt4</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice. The embryos were considered to be E0.5 at noon of the day of the appearance of the vaginal plug. The pregnant females were sacrificed using CO<sub>2</sub> and cervical dislocation and the embryos were decapitated before sample collection to alleviate suffering. The animal care and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the Finnish national legislation for the use of laboratory animals, the European Convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purpose (ETS 123), and EU Directive 86/609/EEC.</p>

<title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>For histology the kidneys were prepared from mouse embryos at E10.5-E17.5 in ice-cold PBS, pH 7.3, and subjected immediately to 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After washes and dehydration the tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned serially for histology and immunological staining. Hematoxylin/eosin and periodic acid-Schiff staining (PAS) were used for the tissue sections. Primary antibodies against collagen IV (Millipore, AB756P, MA USA), laminin (Sigma-Aldrich, L9393, USA), Troma-1 (Hybridoma Bank, Iowa USA), caspase-3 (Cell Signalling, USA) and Ki-67 (DakoCytomation, M7249) were used. The Alexafluor 488, 594 or 546 conjugated antibodies (Molecular Probes, Oregon, USA) were used as secondary antibodies. The sections were inspected with the microscopes Olympus SZX12 (Japan) and Olympus FluoView FV1000 (Japan) that were attached to a CCD camera to document the sections. Photoshop CS5, F10-ASW 3.0 Viewer and Imaris were applied to process the images.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization</title>
<p>Section and whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref026">26</xref>]. The prepared <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and wild-type embryonic kidneys were fixed in 4% PFA and subjected besides sectioning to whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. For this purpose hybridization of the probes and the washes afterwards were performed with the aid of the Insitupro (Intavis AG Bioanalytical Instruments, Koeln Germany) or BioLane<sup>TM</sup> HTI (Hölle &amp; Hüttner AG, Germany) robots. The RNA probes to localise the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> and <italic>Wnt11</italic> transcripts were generated from linearized plasmids that were obtained as gifts from Prof. A.P. McMahon (Univ. Southern California, USA). The stained samples were inspected with an Olympus SZX12 (Japan) microscope, photographed with the Olympus CCD camera and processed with Photoshop CS5.</p>

<title>Optical projection tomography (OPT)</title>
<p>The optical projection tomography (OPT) technology was applied to obtain virtual, digital three dimensional (3D) images of the whole kidney and the main tissue compartments, the ureteric tree. The dissected kidneys (E15.5–16.5) were stained as whole mount with the Troma-1 antibody (Hybridoma bank, Iowa USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref028">28</xref>]. The kidneys were mounted to 1% low melting point agar and dehydrated overnight (o/n) in methanol at RT. The samples were cleared o/n at 4°C with benzyl alcohol and benzylbenzoate (1:2) and imaged with the OPT Scanner 3001M (Bioptonics Microscopy, UK). The Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich Switzerland) was used to analyze the OPT data. The branching morphology was assessed by filament tracing plug in and the branching angles were measured by Branching angle B function. It measures the angle between the root branch and extending neighbouring branching points.</p>

<title>Generation and analysis of the R260H Wnt5a variant</title>
<p>An R260H point mutation was made to the mouse <italic>Wnt5a</italic> cDNA sequence with a QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, CA USA). The putative impact of this point mutation was analysed by studying the capacity of the wild-type and the R260H Wnt5a to inhibit the Wnt3a induced TOP Flash reporter assay as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)</title>
<p>The kidneys were dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen to determine mRNA expression by qRT-PCR. Possible Wnt5a induced changes in gene expression were analysed also in an embryonic kidney-derived MK3 cell line. For this purpose, the cells were transduced with a virus expressing Wnt5a-GFP or GFP only. The total RNA was purified from wild-type, <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> kidneys and MK3cells with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and the cDNA was synthesized with the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas). The primers used to amplify the selected gene sequences are Col IV a1 TCCGGGAGAGATTGGTTTCC, CTGGCCTATAAGCCCTGGT; Col IV a2 GGACCCAAGGGACAACCAG, CCCAACAAGTGTGATGTCAGAT; Col IV a3 CAAAGGCATCAGGGGAATAACT, ACCCTTAGATCCGTTGCATCC; Ln a2 TCCCAAGCGCATCAACAGAG, CAGTACATCTCGGGTCCTTTTTC; Ln b1 GAAAGGAAGACCCGAAGAAAAGA, CCATAGGGCTAGGACACCAAA; LN b2 GAACTTCGCTTGGGCCTACTT, GGTGGCTGGATAGCAGCTT; Ln c2 TCGTATCAGCACAGTCTCCG, GCAACCTTCTGGCTAATAGAGG; Ln c3 TTGCAGGGCAGACACTCGTT, GTCCTCCAGTCTTACTACTACG; GAPDH AGAACATCATCCCTGCATCC, CAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAG. The qRT-PCR program consisted of 40 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec and at 60°C for 1 min in an MX3005 thermocycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, Ca, USA). The qPCR experiments were performed as triplicates and the data was normalized to GAPDH expression using the ΔΔCT method.</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity assay</title>

<p>The coding region and the intron-exon boundaries of the human <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene (NM_003392) were analysed by Sanger sequencing. The applied primers are; Exon 1 AGTGATCTCCTGGGACACTG, TCAGCTCCGGTTCACTG; Exon 2 CCATTCCCTAGGAGCTGAAG, AATCAGATTTCCTGGTGAGG; Exon 3 TCATCAGGTGTAGGGACAGG, TCATGAGGACAAGCAGGAG; Exon 4 ATAGCAAAGGAGTGGCAGAG, CCACCATTCCCTACCTTG; Exon 5a GTGCACTTCTTGCACTTGAC, GGAGAAGGTCGAGGAGAAC; Exon 5b CAGAGTTCTTAGATGGTAACAGG, CATGTAGCCTGAAGACATGC.</p>
<p><italic>WNT5A</italic> gene mutation analysis was performed in 129 patients. The in-house and the online available databases dbSNP and Exome Variant Server of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project were used to determine whether <italic>WNT5A</italic> variants had been detected previously.

<title><italic>In silico</italic> modelling of the putative structural effect of the identified WNT5A variant</title>
<p>Possible consequences of the R260H mutation on the structure and dynamics of the WNT5A protein were studied by conducting 20 nanoseconds molecular dynamics (20ns MD) simulations of the wild-type WNT5A and the mutant R260H WNT5A. The I-TASSER server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref032">32</xref>] was used to generate a model of the human WNT5A protein structure. WNT5A appeared to have 41.5% sequence similarity to Wnt8f for which a crystal structure is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref033">33</xref>] (PDB:4F0A). The Wnt8f structure was found to be the best available template and it was used to produce models of the WT WNT5A and the R260H mutant. Every model was used to perform an independent MD-simulation. The simulation boxes were cubes of 987.5nm<sup>3</sup>. The putative computer-generated WNT5A protein models were placed in the centre of the cube. The models were solvated with 31100 SPC water molecules.</p>
<p>To reach an ion concentration of 0.15mM and neutralize the electrostatic charges on the WT protein, 89 water molecules were replaced by Na<sup>+</sup> ions and 99 by Cl<sup>-</sup>. Similarly, 73 Na<sup>+</sup> and 82 Cl<sup>-</sup> ions were used for the mutant. Both systems were equilibrated through an energy minimization run and a ten ps position restrained simulation. The obtained coordinates were used to perform in the full 20 nanosecond simulations.</p>
<p>To account for the presence of ligands in the template structure and to focus our observations on the putative effects of the noted R260H mutation, position restrains of 1000 kJ mol-1 nm-1 were applied to the residues 30 to 49 and 222 to 380 in the WNT5A protein. All the simulations and their required setup were performed using the GROMACS software package and the GROMOS 53A6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref034">34</xref>] force field. The simulation conditions were set to a 300K temperature and a pressure of one bar with the aid of the Berendsen thermostats and barostats. The T-Test gave a P value of 0 (up to 20 decimal places).</p>

<title><italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficiency leads to severe metanephric kidney anomalies.</title>
<p>Embryonic urogenital systems (UGS) (A-D) and their kidneys (E-L) were dissected at E15.5 and E16.5. The UGS were inspected either as unstained (A-D) or their kidneys we subjected to Troma-1 antibody staining as whole mount and analysed with the optical projection tomography (OPT) to identify the pattern of the ureteric bud (UB) tree and the terminal UB derived tree tip counts (M) or sectioned (I-L). A) A normal urogenital system. The kidney (K), the gonad (G) and the adrenal gland (A) are marked. The <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficiency leads to three categories of phenotypes; B) a kidney with duplex UB highlighted in the boxed image (the stars in B´), kidney hypoplasia (compare B with A), bilateral (C) or unilateral (D) renal failure. The OPT reveals variation noted in the pattern of UB tree development in the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficient embryonic kidneys when compared to control (compare F—H with E). The altered UB tree pattern can be depicted in the sections of the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficient kidneys when compared to control (compare J with I, dotted line, arrows). <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficiency enlarges also the Bowman´s capsule lumen (asterisk) from control one (compare L with K, stars).

<p>Histology at E15.5 suggested that the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficiency would change spatial UB organization and the diameter of the UB branches that appeared visually larger than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147171.g001">Fig 1</xref>, compare J with I, shaded regions, arrows).

<p>We used the optical projection tomography (OPT) that offers quantitation of the morphological anomalies in the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficient kidneys. The OPT data revealed that at E15.5 the terminal branching tips of the Wnt5a <sup>-/-</sup> mouse ureter tree were decreased from WT controls 428 tips to 306 tips (p&lt;0.02) and E16.5 from 1022 to 765 (p&lt;0.03) respectively. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147171.g001">Fig 1M</xref>). In agreement with the histological findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147171.g001">Fig 1E–1H</xref>), the OPT indicated an overall increase in the UB tree branching angles in <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficient kidney in comparison to control, being 38.10 and 43.14 degrees respectively (p&lt;0.05). Together the findings point towards a possibility that Wnt5a appears to take part in the control of UB derived collecting duct tree development.</p>

<title>Changes in polarization of the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficient epithelial ureteric tree cells correlates with severely deregulated basement membrane organization</title>
<p>One of the typical manifestations of epithelial UB tree cell polarity is the associated polarized secretion of the BM components between the kidney assembling UB and the MM tissues by the UB cells. The noted defects in the overall altered UB tissue pattern due to <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficiency share resemblance to defects in the <italic>laminin γ1</italic> knock out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref035">35</xref>]. Thus we considered that the Wnt5a signal may coordinate UB development via involvement of the BM, its components such as laminins. This was addressed by dissecting embryonic kidneys at E11.5, E14.5 and E16.5 and by subjecting them to EM inspection.</p>
<p>At E11.5 when kidney organogenesis has initiated and a primitive BM is distinguishable between UB and MM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147171.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, arrow) the BM integrity of the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficient UB was compromised. The BM formed had become detached and fragmented in many locations. The BM had also formed folds that were not detected in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147171.g002">Fig 2</xref>, compare B, C with A, arrows). The noted <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficiency related phenotypes at E11.5 were noticeable at E 14.5 and E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147171.g002">Fig 2</xref>, compare E, F with D, arrows).</p>

The noted phenotypes were quantified by morphometric (G-H). The basement membrane (BM) that forms normally an extracellular matrix (ECM) sheet between ureteric bud derived epithelial tree and adjacent mesenchyme (A, D) becomes severely compromised in the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficient embryonic kidney already at the initiation of organogenesis at E11.5 (compare B, C with A, arrows) and is prominent also at E16.5 (compare E, F with D, arrows).

<p>Distance of ECM edge from cell surface and overall BM thickness at E16.5 were higher in the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficient samples than in control. At E14.5 the BM distance from plasma membrane was increased from WT 57.4nm to 90.4nm in <italic>Wnt5a</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and the thickness of BM was increased from WT being 40.0 and 58.9nm in <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>. At E16.5 the BM had increased its width to 71.2nm while in WT controls the BM width was 46.3 nm (p&lt;0.005) and the BM distance from the plasma membrane was 62.9nm in WT while in <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> it was increased to 95.1nm (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147171.g002">Fig 2G and 2H</xref> and data not shown).</p>
<p>To further substantiate the point of Wnt5a serving as a cell polarity cue to promote concurrently the polarized ECM secretion we localized type IV Collagen and Pan-Laminin expression in sections. In comparison to WT control, the expression of both type IV Collagen and Pan-Laminin were reduced in <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficient samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0147171.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, compare B, D with A, C, arrows). Similarly, <italic>Lama1</italic>, <italic>Lamb1</italic>, <italic>Lamc2 and Lamc3</italic>, <italic>Col4a1</italic>, <italic>Col4a2</italic> and <italic>Col4a3</italic> except <italic>Lamb2</italic> were reduced due to the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficiency as judged by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0147171.s001">S1E Fig</xref>) and was the case with Ln-111 depicted with immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0147171.s001">S1G Fig</xref>). Taken together the evidence points towards a conclusion that Wnt5a contributes to ureteric tree development via maintenance of the epithelial cell BM. One indicative output of this is the promotion of efficient polarized secretion of the ECM components between the UB and MM tissues.</p>

A) The R260H variant in the mouse Wnt5a-GFP reduces the capacity of the Wnt5a to inhibit the Wnt3a induced <italic>Top Flash</italic> luciferase activity when compared to the potential of the native Wnt5a by 17% (p&lt;0.05). B) The simulation suggests that the human R260H variant broadens the WNT5A frizzled receptor binding pocket from 3.06 nm (Wt, in red) to 3.74 nm (R260H WNT5A, in pale blue circle and dotted line). The spatial location of the residue 260 variant in the patient with CAKUT is highlighted as a green circle. CM, conditioned media. The data are shown as means ± SD, n = 7/group, * <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

<p>Modelling of the putative influence of the <italic>c</italic>.<italic>779G&gt;A</italic> to the <italic>in silico</italic> simulated 3D structure of the WNT5A protein suggested around 22% expansion of the frizzled receptor-binding pocked, the value changing from wild-type 3.06nm (SD 0.437nm) to the variant 3.74nm (SD 0.53nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147171.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, in red/blue, respectively). The frizzled receptor binding loop region of wild-type WNT5A protein oscillated in range of 1.5–4.3nm while the corresponding value for the R260H variant was 2.5–5.18nm. The <italic>in silico</italic> simulation itself does not show that receptor binding is in fact affected, the simulation result serves as a possible explanation for what was observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p>
<p>In summary the discovered R260H human WNT5A associated variant may have a reduced signalling capacity also <italic>in vivo</italic> and makes it as one putative candidate contributing risk factor for human CAKUT development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results provide evidence that Wnt5a has a novel and specific function in mammalian kidney organogenesis. Wnt5a maintains the UB derived tree epithelial development via a mechanism that is apparently associated to secretion of the ECM components into the overlying BM. It is noteworthy that Wnt5a has a role already at the formation of the first UB branch and thereafter during UB tree development since the BM is severely affected with reduced expression of a panel of laminins and collagens at an early organogenesis stage. The BM defects lead also later to compromised kidney filter in the adult <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficient mouse resembling the glomerulosclerosis condition. Based on the fact that CAKUT anomalies have their origin <italic>in utero</italic> as is the case with the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> knock out model, the impaired <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene may be considered a candidate CAKUT predisposing gene.</p>
<p>The <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficiency caused kidney related phenotypes with similarity to those of <italic>laminin γ1</italic> characterized also by duplex collecting system or failure in organogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref035">35</xref>]. We consider this correspondence relevant for the putative mode of Wnt5a action in UB tree development. Since laminin serves as an initiator for proper BM formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147171.ref038">38</xref>] the noted <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficiency dependent reduction of laminin and several other ECM components in the disorganized BM could be secondary reasons for primary changes in the UB cell polarity or they are direct targets of Wnt5a signalling. This possibility is supported by the presented data and those that indicated Wnt5a as being able to regulate a panel of specific BM component such <italic>type IV collagens a1-3</italic> and <italic>laminins a2</italic>, <italic>b1-2</italic>, <italic>c2-3</italic> respectively. <italic>Wnt5a</italic> deficiency also elevated <italic>P4ha1</italic> expression and the kidney glomerular BM anomalies were more pronounced in the <italic>Wnt5a</italic><sup>+/-</sup>;<italic>P4ha1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> embryos than in the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> knock out only. In summary, the Wnt family member Wnt5a signalling coordinates patterning of UB development during kidney organogenesis via BM formation.</p>
<p>Consistent with the possible relevance in CAKUT we report here in a conserved WNT5A region a R260H (c. 779G&gt;A, p. Arg260His) variant that was found in human cohorts with kidney diseases. As functional i<italic>n vitro</italic> experiments with identical mouse R260H variant showed reduction in Wnt5a capacity to inhibit Wnt3a signalling, we studied the possible explanation for the signalling reduction. <italic>In silico</italic> simulation of the R260H amino acid transition suggested enlargement of the frizzled receptor-binding pocket as one possible explanation. For the full proof of this hypothesis it would need to compute binding affinities for the native and the mutant with the ligand, for which structures of the ligand -bound complexes are required. Based on the acquired evidence we conclude that Wnt5a function is important for the development of the UB tree, the prospective collecting duct.</p>
<p>We report a specific function for Wnt5a in kidney basement membrane formation and mammalian kidney organogenesis. As a summary this provides evidence that WNT5A is a strong candidate for human CAKUT. The next step would be to conduct large-scale sequencing studies to further determine the diagnostic value of WNT5A gene and ultimately provide better support for CAKUT patients.</p>

<p>Sanger sequencing was performed for the coding region of the <italic>WNT5A</italic> from DNA samples that were derived from a cohort of 115 CAKUT and 14 Alport syndrome patients respectively. A) The status of the father is unknown, while the mother had been diagnosed to have CAKUT in the past. Sequence traces for the case-parent trio indicated the inheritance for the heterozygous c.779G&gt;A variant in the patient and the father, depicted by arrows. A reference sequencing that represents a consensus of 189 healthy Dutch control individuals serves as controls. B) Alignment of the human WNT5A amino acid sequence with those of several other vertebrates reveals conservation of the amino acid sequence where the variant p. R260H transition was identified.</p>
