        <p>Using stress sensitive FRET sensors we have measured cytoskeletal stresses in α-actinin and the associated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in cells subjected to chronic shear stress. We show that long-term shear stress reduces the average actinin stress and this effect is reversible with removal of flow. The flow-induced changes in cytoskeletal stresses are found to be dynamic, involving a transient decrease in stress (phase-I), a short-term increase (3–6 min) (Phase-II), followed by a longer-term decrease that reaches a minimum in ∼20 min (Phase-III), before saturating. These changes are accompanied by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton from parallel F-actin bundles to peripheral bundles. Blocking mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) with Gd<sup>3+</sup> and GsMTx4 (a specific inhibitor) eliminated the changes in cytoskeletal stress and the corresponding actin reorganization, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable MSCs participate in the signaling cascades. This study shows that shear stress induced cell adaptation is mediated via MSCs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Renal epithelial cells experience a wide range of shear stress due to urinary flow. Through various adaptation mechanisms cells adjust their cytoskeleton structure, adhesion assembly and cell-cell interactions, thereby accommodating the mechanical challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Ingber1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Weinbaum1">[2]</xref>. This remodeling minimizes local stresses and affects membrane transport and other cell functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Rohatgi1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Resnick1">[4]</xref>. Exposure of renal tubule cells to chronic flow results in reorganization of the cytoskeleton and an increase in the formation of cell-cell junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Duan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Essig1">[6]</xref>. While the molecular mechanisms of shear stress transduction remain unclear, flow shear stress appears to induce conformational changes in a variety of cytoskeleton proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Johnson1">[7]</xref>. These, in turn, can activate biochemical pathways that affect cell morphology, migration and growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Brown1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Tzima1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Chachisvilis1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The spatial and time-dependent distribution of external force applied to the cells is inherently non-uniform because the cytoskeleton is a heterogeneous and anisotropic collection of dynamically cross-linked proteins. Stress varies with the intrinsic elasticity of individual proteins, the dynamics of cross-links, and the degree of prestress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Gardel1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Orr1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Gardel2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Bursac1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Asparuhova1">[15]</xref>. The adaptation of cells to mechanical stimuli occurs over multiple time scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Matthews1">[16]</xref>. At short time scales, external force induces rapid and reversible changes in cytoskeletal stresses associated with elastic stretching of load-bearing proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Brown1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Matthews1">[16]</xref>. This is followed by conformational changes of the proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Johnson1">[7]</xref>. With longer term stimulation, the cytoskeleton undergoes chronic rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Bursac1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Chaudhuri1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Footer1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Ziembicki1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The response of cells to short term (∼seconds) mechanical stimuli has been studied by various means <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Riveline1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Giannone1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Galbraith1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Na1">[23]</xref>. Applying force to integrin receptors by a pipette or using ligand-coated magnetic beads attached to the cell surface causes cell stiffening via changes in focal adhesion assembly at the stimulation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Riveline1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Matthews2">[24]</xref>. This increase in stiffness can extend to periods lasting minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Matthews1">[16]</xref>. We have previously shown that a pulsatile shear stress results in reversible changes in stress within α-actinin, and these changes decay gradually with multiple challenges. Thus the adaptation begins at time scale of seconds (&lt;45 sec) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Rahimzadeh1">[25]</xref>. Although cells may use multiple sensors to activate adaptation mechanisms, the earliest adaptation response appears to be consistently towards increased stiffness. However, epithelial cells in the kidney experience chronic (long term) fluid shear stress (in the range of minutes to hours) and experience a large variation in mechanical forces. The dynamics of adaptation to flow involves polymerization and depolymerization of F-actin, changes in cross linking, and correlated changes in migration and growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Osborn1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Mott1">[27]</xref>. With the development of our genetically coded force sensitive fluorescent probes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Meng1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Meng2">[29]</xref>, we are able to directly measure the variation of stress in specific proteins and visualize the accompanying changes in cytoskeleton structure in real time and begin pinpointing which proteins are involved in adaptation.</p>
      <p>In this study, we have measured actinin stresses and simultaneously observed corresponding cytoskeletal anatomy in Madin Darbey Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells subjected to chronic fluid shear stress, using the stress sensitive FRET sensor referred to as spectrin repeat stress sensitive FRET (sstFRET) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Meng2">[29]</xref>. Our study reveals that long-term (∼3 hrs) exposure to fluid shear stress produces three distinct phases of cytoskeletal stress variation, each lasting for minutes. This process was inhibited in the presence of Gd<sup>3+</sup> and GsMTx4, blockers of mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Yang1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Caldwell1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Bowman1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Oswald1">[33]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Co-localization of actinin-sstFRET with F-actin in MDCK cells</title>
        <p>We expressed the FRET probe, actinin-sstFRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>), in MDCK cells and then subjected the cells to a constant flow in a microfluidic chamber. The sensitivity of this FRET sensor has been previously characterized using DNA springs in solution and is on the order of 5 pN. The sensor was also expressed in cells and it does not affect physiological function of the host protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Meng2">[29]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section for further details on the FRET stress sensor). Actinin-sstFRET co-localizes with F-actin, which allows us to use the FRET probe as a label for F-actin to monitor actin translocation. Colocalization is shown by expressing actinin-sstFRET in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>) and subsequently staining actin with phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 568 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>). As a control, we also transfected the free sstFRET cassette itself, i.e., without its linkage to actinin, and the fluorescence image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g001">Fig. 1d</xref> shows that free probe is uniformly distributed in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g001">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>

        <title>Dynamics of cytoskeletal stresses under chronic flow</title>
        <p>We followed changes in stress in cells subjected to a steady shear flow (0.74 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) for up to 3 hrs and found that the average stress decreased and then stabilized. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Figure 2a</xref> shows time dependent changes in the FRET ratio averaged over an entire cell under flow; the (red) line marks the start of flow. Remarkably, we consistently observed three distinct phases. In Phase-I, marked t1–t2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>, there was a rapid increase in FRET ratio (a decrease in stress) lasting 1–2 min. This was followed by a decrease in FRET (an increase in stress) that took ∼3–6 min to reach a minimum (Phase-II, t2–t3). This was followed by a long term (∼15 min) increase in FRET (decrease in stress) (Phase-III; t3–t4). Following this, the FRET ratio stabilized or slightly decayed under the continuous flow lasting up to 3 hrs (t&gt;t4). These dynamics were consistently observed in repeated experiments (n&gt;10) and the statistics of the peak FRET ratio change for each Phase (left axis) and the time period (right axis) for three phases are shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast, for cells under no-flow condition, the FRET ratio varied only slightly with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>) (its statistics are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>

The image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2e</xref> corresponding to Phase-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2e</xref>, t1–t2) did not show significant actin redistribution indicating that the decrease in stress at this stage is due to the deformation of actinin proteins themselves; this is consistent with our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Rahimzadeh1">[25]</xref>. The short-term increase in stress during Phase-II is associated with an inward contraction of F-actin. It is characterized by a shrinking nucleus and an increase in the density of F-actin around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2e</xref>, t2–t3). No such ‘ring formation’ around the nucleus was observed in cells under a static environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044167.s005">movie S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044167.s006">S4</xref>). Phase III, which was accompanied by a large decrease in stress, was found to be associated with an observable dissociation of actin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2e</xref> (t3–t4). Longer times following t4 are characterized by actin reassembly, resulting in F-actin bundles at the cell perimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2e</xref>, t5). Although the above results are shown for a shear stress of 0.74 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>, cells responded similarly to stresses as low as 0.3 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> but the magnitude of responses was reduced (data not shown).</p>
        <p>The spatiotemporal changes in cytoskeletal stress is further analyzed by mapping time-dependent changes in FRET ratio and F-actin distribution across a given region of interest (red windows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Figs. 2d,e</xref>), and this analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2f and 2g</xref>, respectively. (For convenience, the FRET ratio in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2a</xref> is also shown juxtaposed with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2f,g</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2g</xref>, there is no significant change in F-actin density or redistribution over the course of phase-I (t1–t2), representing the earlier stage of deformation of actinin proteins. A decrease in FRET ratio (increase of stress) corresponding to phase-II (t2–t3) is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2f</xref> as a color change from warm (red/yellow) to cool (blue/green); the accompanying inward movement of enhanced actin density is marked by the black arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2g</xref> indicating contraction of the actin network around the nucleus by the end of phase-II. The correlated increase in stress and actin contractile motion suggests that the cytoskeletal tension is responsible for the increase in F-actin concentration around the nucleus. Notice that the dense actin ring persists in Phase-III (t3–t4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2g</xref>), however, the mean cytoskeletal stress decreases to a minimum during this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2f</xref>). This observation suggests that contraction triggers F-actin disassociation in cells. At t5, there is a high actin density at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2g</xref>) marking actin reassembly under flow shear stress.</p>
        <p>We showed that flow-induced cytoskeleton reorganization is a reversible process at short times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Rahimzadeh1">[25]</xref>. To examine whether reorganization can be reversed at longer times, we applied a steady flow (0.74 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 3 hrs and then stopped the flow. By measuring the changes in stresses and the structure we found that cytoskeleton reorganization is also reversible over a time scale of hours. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g003">Figure 3a</xref> shows the average stress in a cell measured as the FRET ratio and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g003">Fig. 3b</xref> shows the simultaneously recorded F-actin structure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g003">Figure 3a</xref> shows that flow causes an increase in FRET ratio that returns reversibly to its initial state upon removal of flow. The corresponding images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g003">Fig. 3b</xref> show that under flow (blue arrows) the actin fibers gradually disappear, but they reappear after the flow is stopped. It shows that the flow induced softening and correlated cytoskeleton reorganization is reversible; the parallel F-actin bundles were restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>) and the cells returned to a state of higher stress (lower FRET) when the flow was stopped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>

        <title>Shear stress reduces cell mobility via MSC dependent pathway</title>
        <p>To determine whether the F-actin rearrangement induced by shear stress affects mobility, we analyzed cell movement with a 2D map of the nucleus location with and without flow. Under static (no flow) conditions the cells were motile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g006">Fig. 6a</xref>), and the time lapse images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g006">Fig. 6d</xref>) show typical movements.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Tubular fluid flow in the kidney causes drag on the apical surface of epithelial cells and these forces modulate cytoskeletal stress. This in turn activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways causing reorganization of cytoskeleton and cell remodeling. Our experiments allowed us to dissect the reorganization into several distinct stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). The process seems to involve a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through MSCs.</p>
      <p>The initial decrease in cytoskeletal stresses is consistent with our previous findings that sudden change in shear stress causes reversible compression in α-actinin. Repetitive application results in progressive adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Rahimzadeh1">[25]</xref>. The shear stress amplitude in this study is an order of magnitude smaller than in our previous study indicating that we are far from saturation in these experiments. F-actin shows no significant change within this time suggesting that this process only involves the conformational changes of the linking proteins or deformation of actinin itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2e</xref>). This adaptation to mechanical stress has also been observed with magnetic beads attached to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Matthews1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The shear-induced increase in cytoskeletal stress and corresponding inward contraction of F-actin with time appears to be an essential process for reorganization of the cytoskeleton since this is followed by extended reduction in cytoskeletal stresses and redistribution of F-actin to the periphery. Similar increase in cytoskeletal stress (as in Phase-II) has also been observed using magnetic beads at early stages of cell adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Matthews1">[16]</xref>. Recently, Martin, <italic>et. al.</italic> reported that pulsed apical contractions powered by actomyosin pull the cytoplasm inward towards the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Martin1">[36]</xref>. This contractile force is known to facilitate actin polymerization via actin binding proteins at focal adhesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Hirata1">[37]</xref>. Thus, the observed inward movement of actin during phase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2e,g</xref>) indicates the contraction of actin network that triggers the subsequent actin reassembly. Our results thus suggest that such actin-myosin contraction can be activated by flow shear stress so that the net effect of fluid shear stress acts via body stress in the cell.</p>
      <p>Long term adaptation seems to involve Rho GTPases and its downstream targets. Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) is a key regulator for cytoskeleton reorganization, focal adhesion development and cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Amano1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Imamura1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Shiu1">[40]</xref>. In MDCK cells, application of 20 µM Y27632, a Rho-ROCK inhibitor, caused disassociation of F-actin, and blocked the cytoskeleton remodeling in flow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044167.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Our results suggest Rho GTPases may participate in flow induced actin reorganization. It has been reported that applying a mechanical force to the cell surface of MDCK cells leads to Rho translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Ziembicki1">[19]</xref>, and Rho-kinase regulates myosin light chain phosphorylation that increases cell contractility and alters the formation of actin stress fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Ziembicki1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Imamura1">[39]</xref>. The observed contractile force in phase-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2d,e</xref>) seems to be the result of Rho mediated myosin contraction that facilitates the actin restructuring. In addition, flow-induced Rho activation facilitates cytoskeleton reorganization in endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Ziembicki1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Mott1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Maekawa1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Tzima2">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Birukov1">[43]</xref> with an initial transient inactivation that is followed by an increase peaking at ∼60 minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Tzima1">[9]</xref>. Although this time scale (in the range of 5–60 min) is similar to our observation for actin disassociation and reassembly under flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g002">Fig. 2e</xref>), the cytoskeletal dynamics are different for endothelial and epithelial cells probably because they have different cytoskeletal prestress and organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Duan1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The whole adaptation process can be initiated by MSCs since changes in structure and motility were blocked by Gd<sup>3+</sup> and GsMTx4. A similar effect has been reported with Gd<sup>3+</sup> for stresses from magnetic beads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Matthews1">[16]</xref>. Flow-induced MSC activation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients have been observed in MDCK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Liu1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Praetorius1">[44]</xref>. We have also shown that shear stress causes a transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in MDCK cells and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can be blocked by MSC inhibitors Gd<sup>3+</sup> and GsMTx4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044167.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The time dependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response shows that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> peaked within 1 min in flow, preceding the contractile actin ring formation. These observations suggest a connection between Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase and downstream signaling pathways, such as Rho GTPases activation. The reorganization, however, does not require a continued elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but the transient elevation appears to lead to activation of a long lived later messenger such as Rho or possibly altered prestress in the cytoskeleton.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, fluid shear stress regulates cytoskeletal dynamics triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable MSCs and progressing through a series of structural adaptations, leading to a reduction of cytoskeletal tension. The process is illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044167-g007">Fig. 7</xref>. This remodeling is important for the cell to minimize the stress that it experiences and/or to optimize its structure to resist the external force so as to minimize the internal stress gradients.</p>

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) having 10% fetal bovine serum, with 1% penicillin and streptomycin. To seed the cells in the flow chamber, the microfluidic chamber were first coated with fibronectin and then the media with suspended cells was perfused into the chamber using a pipette. The microfluidic chip was placed in the incubator and culture media was changed every 24 hours. Experiments were conducted after culturing the cells for 3 days with typical confluence of 80–90%. Cells were transfected with sstFRET α-actinin 24 hours before the experiments using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (3.3∶1, FuGENE 6 volume to DNA weight ratio). Average transfection efficiency was 20–30%. During the experiments, the chamber was perfused with Phenol-red free DMEM (Invitrogen™) in order to eliminate background fluorescence from the media.</p>

        <title>FRET imaging and analysis</title>
        <p>Fluorescence imaging was done using a Zeiss inverted microscope with 63× oil immersion objective (Axiovert 200 M, Zeiss). Images were acquired using Hamamatsu EM-CCD camera (ImagEM C9100-13, Hamamatsu, Japan). Both emission wavelengths (CFP and YFP) were acquired simultaneously using a dual-view optical system (Optical Insights, USA) having an excitation filter set that includes a bandpass filter (436±20 nm) and a dichroic mirror (455DCLP), and an emission filter set that includes two emission filters (480±30 nm and 535±40 nm) and a dichroic mirror (505DCXR). Time-lapse images were obtained using Zeiss software (Axiovision, Zeiss). The images from CFP and YFP channels were aligned and processed to obtain the ratio of acceptor to donor (FRET A/D ratio) using Image-J (NIH) software following previously published methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Meng1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044167-Xia1">[46]</xref>. The bleedthrough of CFP into YFP was measured prior to the experiments and subtracted from YFP images to obtain the true FRET signal. The spatiotemporal variation of the FRET ratio is shown in a 16 color map. The warm colors (red) indicate a higher ratio, i.e., a lower α-actinin stress, while cool colors (blue) indicate a lower FRET ratio (higher α-actinin stress).</p>

        <title>Immunostaining F-actin</title>
        <p>Cells were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 minutes and washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then incubated in 0.5% Triton X-100 solution for 15 min and washed three times with PBS. Cells were stained with 0.16 µM phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen) for 20 minutes, washed three times with PBS and were then observed under the microscope.</p>
