<abstract>
<p>The large variability in mRNA and protein levels found from both static and dynamic measurements in single cells has been largely attributed to random periods of transcription, often occurring in bursts. The cell cycle has a pronounced global role in affecting transcriptional and translational output, but how this influences transcriptional statistics from noisy promoters is unknown and generally ignored by current stochastic models. Here we show that variable transcription from the synthetic tetO promoter in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is dominated by its dependence on the cell cycle. Real-time measurements of fluorescent protein at high expression levels indicate tetO promoters increase transcription rate ∼2-fold in S/G2/M similar to constitutive genes. At low expression levels, where tetO promoters are thought to generate infrequent bursts of transcription, we observe random pulses of expression restricted to S/G2/M, which are correlated between homologous promoters present in the same cell. The analysis of static, single-cell mRNA measurements at different points along the cell cycle corroborates these findings. Our results demonstrate that highly variable mRNA distributions in yeast are not solely the result of randomly switching between periods of active and inactive gene expression, but instead largely driven by differences in transcriptional activity between G1 and S/G2/M.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>There is an astonishing amount of variation in the number of mRNA and protein molecules generated from particular genes between genetically identical single cells grown in the same environment. Particularly for mRNA, the large variation seen from these “noisy” genes is consistent with the idea of transcriptional bursting where transcription occurs in random, intermittent periods of high activity. There is considerable experimental support for transcriptional bursting, and it is a primary feature of stochastic models of gene expression that account for variation. Still, it has long been recognized that variation, especially in protein levels, can occur because of global differences between genetically identical cells. We show that in budding yeast, mRNA variation is driven to a large extent by differences in the transcriptional activity of a noisy gene between different phases of the cell cycle. These differences are not because of specific cell-cycle regulation, and in some cases transcription appears restricted to certain phases, leading to pulses of mRNA production. These results raise new questions about the origins of transcriptional bursting and how the statistics of gene expression are regulated in a global way by the cell cycle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At the single-cell level, mRNA and protein levels of regulable genes are often found to be highly variable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Raj1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Taniguchi1">[5]</xref>. The resulting long-tailed mRNA and protein distributions are well-described by stochastic models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Raj1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Taniguchi1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Shahrezaei1">[7]</xref> of transcriptional bursting, where a promoter undergoes random and intermittent periods of highly active transcription. Real-time observations of transcription in multiple organisms appear consistent with this behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Taniguchi1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Golding1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Suter1">[14]</xref>. Thus, both static and dynamic views attribute much of the observed mRNA variability to the stochastic nature of reactions intrinsic to transcription. Consequently, the standard stochastic model of gene expression has been widely used to infer steady-state dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Raj1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-To1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Mao1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Munsky1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, earlier studies examining the origin of variability in protein expression found such variability is not solely due to stochasticity in reactions intrinsic to gene expression, but also extrinsic factors. This was done by looking for correlations in expression between identical copies of one promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Elowitz1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Volfson1">[20]</xref> and/or between that promoter and a global or pathway-specific gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Pedraza1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-ColmanLerner1">[22]</xref>. Not only is the importance of extrinsic factors clear, without time-series measurements the intrinsic noise measured by these techniques may not completely be ascribed to stochastic reactions in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Hilfinger1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Huh1">[24]</xref>. While global extrinsic factors have been suggested to largely impact translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Raj1">[1]</xref>, their influence on transcription and transcriptional bursting is unclear.</p>
<p>The cell cycle has global effects on total protein and RNA synthesis that should play a role in transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Larson1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Volfson1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Trcek1">[25]</xref>. With few exceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Volfson1">[20]</xref>, most deterministic and stochastic models of gene regulation do not account for cell cycle variability. Using both dynamic real-time protein and static single molecule mRNA measurements in single cells, we show that much of the variability in a synthetic tetO promoter typical of noisy genes in yeast is driven by differences in transcription rate between G1 and S/G2/M.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We examined cell-cycle dependent effects by microscopically monitoring fluorescent protein expression every 5 minutes in growing monolayers of yeast within a microfluidic chamber. We used a “3-color” diploid yeast strain with homologous 7xtetO promoters (P<sub>7xtetO</sub>) driving either Cerulean (CFP) or Venus (YFP) and a constitutive <italic>PGK1</italic> promoter (P<italic><sub>PGK1</sub></italic>) driving tdTomato (RFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Correlations in transcriptional activity between different promoters allowed distinction between different sources of fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Volfson1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-ColmanLerner1">[22]</xref>. We developed a method to infer the instantaneous transcription and protein production rates in single cells from the microscopy movies. We segment cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), define budding times, track cell lineages and generate time series for volume and protein concentration (measured by average fluorescence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g001">Fig. 1C&amp;D</xref>), similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Gordon1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Cookson1">[27]</xref>. Two new features of our analysis enabled us to identify transitions in transcriptional state from these time series: precise assignment of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) and using splines to stably estimate first and second time derivatives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s022">Text S1</xref>). The product of volume and protein concentration time series gives total protein, <italic>P</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), from which we infer the protein production rate (proportional to mRNA per cell, <italic>M</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>), and transcription rate, <italic>A</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>) using a system of two differential equations describing transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The single-cell, instantaneous transcription rate estimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>) represents a rate smoothed over a 15–20 minute window (due to measurement and spline fitting errors) and delayed 10–15 minutes due to fluorophore maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s022">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine the effects of cell-cycle phase on expression, we aligned growth and expression data with respect to cell-cycle progression. We subdivided single-cell time series data between division events, synchronized the data by bud formation time, and rescaled time such that the pre- and post-bud phases mapped to the population average time in those phases. Thus, division occurs at 0 and 1, and all traces bud at the same cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). While reporter concentration is nearly flat across the cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), cells exhibit a slow growth phase up to bud formation corresponding to G1 and very early S, followed by faster growth in S/G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Cookson1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Goranov1">[28]</xref>. The instantaneous protein production rate similarly has two modes, but lags the instantaneous growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). In contrast, the instantaneous transcription and growth rate correlate, approximately doubling in S/G2 relative to G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). This does not invalidate observations that total protein production rates correlate with average growth rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Boehlke1">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). The gradual rise in transcription rate over ∼30 min may mask a sharper change because of smoothing and reporter maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). These findings are robust to changes in cells' average growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g002">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s005">Fig. S5</xref>) and remain present even without rescaling time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Instantaneous transcription rate in single yeast cells correlates with growth across the cell cycle.</title>
<p>Single-cell data was binned by cell-cycle progression and averaged. (A) Because of the small (&lt;10%) decrease in CFP concentration across the cell cycle, (B) total CFP rises rapidly with volume post-bud formation, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Cookson1">[27]</xref>, but at slightly different rates. (C) Mean instantaneous growth and protein production rates are lower in G1 and peak in S/G2/M. Instantaneous transcription rate of P<sub>7xtetO</sub> and P<italic><sub>PGK1</sub></italic> correlates with instantaneous growth rate for growth in (D) 2% glucose (N = 171 cell cycles/bin) and in (E) 2% raffinose (N = 246 cell cycles/bin). <italic>YFP</italic> and <italic>RFP</italic> transcription averages were normalized to that of <italic>CFP</italic> in glucose (D).

<p>We next added 50 ng/mL dox to reduce P<sub>7xtetO</sub> expression in the 3-color diploid to levels where transcription is thought to occur in infrequent, independent bursts at each locus that are presumably resolvable by the real-time analysis. Single-cell traces of transcription rate show occasional “on” periods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s006">Fig. S6</xref>) that are restricted to S/G2, generally begin within 20 minutes of bud formation, and last until division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). If both P<sub>7xtetO</sub> copies turn on, &gt;70% of the time they do so within 15 minutes of each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The “on” periods are not independent (p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>, χ<sup>2</sup> test; ρ = 0.42) at each locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). These results are in striking contrast to the view of transcriptional bursting as intrinsically driven with exponential interarrival times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Raj1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Raj2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Golding1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Larson2">[30]</xref>.</p>

<p>We sought further support for these real-time observations by using single-molecule mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to probe how mRNA numbers in single cells varied with cell-cycle phase, classified based on the presence and size of a bud (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g004">Fig. 4A&amp;B</xref> describes mRNA distributions from cells with P<sub>1xtetO</sub> and P<sub>7xtetO</sub>, but no activator present (basal expression). The G1 distributions are zero-peaked with a long-tail that disappears by early S, suggesting transcription does not occur in G1, consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>. Progression through S/G2/M leads to a unimodal non-zero-peaked distribution in G2/M consistent with real-time observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) indicating the time when an inactive promoter turns ON in S/G2 is variable. With intermediate expression, there is also increased activity in S/G2/M, but the G1 distribution is qualitatively different: a non-zero peak indicates transcription now occurs in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g004">Fig. 4C&amp;D</xref>). However, low transcription activity does not imply G1 inactivity. The weak but constitutive <italic>DOA1</italic> promoter (P<italic><sub>DOA1</sub></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Zenklusen1">[31]</xref> has a non-zero G1 peak even with low mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>

<p>While the overall mRNA distributions exhibit excellent fits to a negative binomial predicted by the standard model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Raj1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Paulsson1">[32]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), partitioning the data by cell-cycle phase reveals it is incorrect. We sought to understand to what extent the overall variability could be explained by a model with a constant transcription rate that increased by <italic>f</italic>-fold between G1 and S/G2/M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s022">Text S1</xref>). When <italic>f = 2</italic> as expected based on S-phase replication, the model qualitatively describes the progression of the observed distributions for P<italic><sub>DOA1</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g004">Fig. 4E&amp;F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s021">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). However, <italic>f&gt;2</italic> better describes tetO promoter measurements, with <italic>f</italic>&gt;100 for basal expression, consistent with no G1 transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g004">Fig. 4A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). Still, noisy tetO promoters have more variable transcription than this model can generate. The real-time protein data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s006">Fig. S6</xref>) also indicate variability in the amount of mRNA produced in S/G2/M.

<p>P<sub>1xtetO</sub> and P<sub>7xtetO</sub> were activated in the kinetic strain background (A) by a step change in phosphate concentration. (B) The time to localization of chimeric Pho4-tetR-YFP and (C) the subsequent kinetic transcription activation are identical for both promoters, when grown in 2% glucose and transcription rate traces are normalized by the average first peak height. Distributions of all single-cell (D) localization and (E) transcription activation delay times were calculated from the time of the phosphate switch to the time to cross an effective threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s011">Fig. S11</xref>). (F) Each cell's delay to respond is calculated as the difference between the cell's transcription and localization times. (G) Separating the response delay time distributions by cell-cycle phase at the time of localization reveals faster activation post-budding. (H) Long response delays occur only when Pho4-tetR-YFP localizes in G1. Each cell is plotted as a stem where the distance along the abscissa corresponds to the cell-cycle progression at the time of TF localization; the height of the stem endpoint along the ordinate corresponds to the cell-cycle progression at the time of transcription activation; and the length of the stem from the green diagonal to the endpoint represents the response delay.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Transcriptional bursting, whereby a promoter occasionally transitions from a long-lived inactive to a short-lived active state that produces a burst of mRNA, is commonly invoked to explain the observed single-cell variability in mRNA numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Raj1">[1]</xref> of noisy genes. In contrast, we demonstrate that large differences in transcriptional activity between G1 and S/G2 that go beyond gene dosage effects drive much of the observed single-cell variability in mRNA numbers. Genome-wide studies in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Newman1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-BarEven1">[35]</xref> have identified noisy promoters as those associated with strong TATA boxes and highly regulated by chromatin remodeling factors. The tetO promoters, whose core region is derived from the native <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Gari1">[36]</xref>, have similar characteristics. Likewise, constitutive, housekeeping promoters and highly expressed tetO promoters previously associated with low expression variability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-To1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Newman1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Zenklusen1">[31]</xref> exhibit only ∼2-fold changes in transcription throughout the cell cycle consistent with gene dosage effects. None of these promoters are classified as cell-cycle regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Granovskaia1">[37]</xref>. While the cell cycle has been appreciated to be an important source of extrinsic noise, our findings suggest there may be a specific role beyond gene dosage for noisy genes that have not been associated with cell-cycle regulation. Transcriptional bursting may still occur, but it is not needed to explain most of the variability in mRNA levels given the variability in timing of the G1 to S transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Bean1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-DiTalia1">[39]</xref>. The heretofore unexplored connection between noisy gene expression and large differences in G1 and S/G2 transcriptional activity raises fundamental questions concerning its origin and prevalence amongst noisy genes in various organisms and its implications in stable gene network regulation.</p>
<p>Studies monitoring transcripts in synchronized yeast cells with tiling microarrays identify ∼10% of genes that exhibit cell-cycle-dependent expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Granovskaia1">[37]</xref>. The mechanistic basis of their cycling, through regulation by cyclin-dependent transcription factors, is well-understood. The <italic>CYC1</italic> gene, whose core promoter is present in the tetO promoters, is not part of this class. Because we observed cycle-dependent basal expression for tetO promoters in the absence of any tTA, the <italic>CYC1</italic> gene might be expected to behave similarly. If we surmise that this cycle-dependent expression occurs at a majority of the ∼20% of genes whose expression has been identified in genome-wide studies as noisy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-BarEven1">[35]</xref>, why has not previous work, which monitors expression in populations of synchronized cells, identified these genes? First, normalized microarray data represent a mole <italic>fraction</italic> of mRNA species in the population. As such, they will never identify, say, two-fold changes in mRNA <italic>abundance</italic> due to replication when normalized to the concurrent rise in total mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Zhurinsky1">[40]</xref>. Second, we see large differences in <italic>transcription rate</italic> between G1 and S/G2 but because of the finite mRNA lifetime, differences in mRNA abundance are smaller. The discrepancies are much more pronounced with slower growth conditions (as the mRNA reaches the new steady-state in each growth phase), but the microarray studies were done in fast growth conditions. Third, under conditions with the largest cell-cycle phase-dependent differences in transcription, S/G2 transcription is a <italic>probabilistic</italic> event. Microarray experiments measure the <italic>population average</italic> mRNA mole fraction in each phase, and hence the relative difference between S/G2 and G1 will be quite low on average. Therefore, monitoring expression in single living cells through multiple cell cycles is crucial to observing cell-cycle-dependent transcription.</p>
<p>Single-cell studies do not suffer from the averaging effects of microarray analysis. Still, our data alters the interpretation of static single-cell studies where mRNA/protein distributions are fit to stochastic models of gene expression to infer steady-state dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Raj1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-To1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Mao1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Munsky1">[17]</xref>. This difficulty of using static data to pinpoint origins of variability has been anticipated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Taniguchi1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Hilfinger1">[23]</xref> although here we have shown that even static mRNA FISH data can reveal additional dynamic information by disaggregating mRNA distributions by cell-cycle phase. Consistent with our observations, control measurements made in a study examining cycle-dependent mRNA degradation kinetics using mRNA FISH show an approximately 2-fold increase in mRNA levels as cells progress through S/G2/M for the <italic>ADH1</italic> and <italic>DOA1</italic> promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Trcek1">[25]</xref>. Our results suggest that burst sizes and burst frequencies obtained from fitting static mRNA distributions to a negative binomial distribution may be of limited use beyond the fact that they describe the first two moments of the distribution (and hence its noise). If we titrate tTA levels and infer burst statistics from the aggregate distribution, it appears that burst size increases at low expression levels, then burst frequency increases at high expression levels. This transition roughly corresponds to moving from little or no transcription in G1 (with a burst frequency corresponding to one cell cycle) to robust G1 expression (Quinn, Maheshri, unpublished results). Because of the ease of grossly classifying cell-cycle phase in yeast, an exciting and straightforward exercise would be to reanalyze existing mRNA FISH datasets published from multiple labs to determine the prevalence of cycle-dependent expression. Morphological measurements might also be combined with two-color FISH measurements using a second transcript with known cell-cycle regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Wyart1">[41]</xref>. Such an approach with high abundance transcripts has already revealed independent cell and metabolic cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Silverman1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent real-time single-cell measurements of transcription may not have seen the cycle-dependent transcription we report for various reasons. In the one yeast study, mRNA expression of a housekeeping gene was measured in real-time with no accounting for cell-cycle phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Larson1">[12]</xref>. In mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Suter1">[14]</xref>, transcriptional bursts with a refractory period were inferred from real-time measurements of luciferase protein levels expressed by multiple promoters, but again there was no accounting for cell-cycle phase. The bursts occurred on time scales much shorter than cell-cycle transitions, but revisiting the data still may reveal a cell-cycle phase dependence. Interestingly, real-time measurements of mRNA expression from two housekeeping promoters in undifferentiated single <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells do show a weak cell-cycle dependence, with the frequency of transcriptional burst or pulses dropping 2–3 fold from the beginning to the end of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Muramoto2">[43]</xref>. However, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> lack a G1 period and have an extended G2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Weijer1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Weeks1">[45]</xref>; the reduction in expression later in the cell cycle might be due to mitotic repression of transcription, which is a well-established phenomenon in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Dynlacht1">[46]</xref>. It remains unclear how widespread cycle-dependent transcription is in other organisms and awaits further study.</p>
<p>What might be the mechanistic basis for the large differences in G1 and S/G2 transcriptional activity? At low expression tetO promoters exhibit transcriptional pulses that originate around the G1 to S transition when DNA replication occurs. S phase progression has been suggested to affect transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Wolffe1">[47]</xref> and has been established as important to (de)silence gene loci in a manner that either requires replication fork progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Crowe1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Fisher1">[49]</xref> or not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Kirchmaier1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Li1">[51]</xref>. Replication-dependent transcriptional activation of viral genes has been reported in transient transfection assays, and depends on <italic>trans</italic> activators that bind to either the proximal promoter or and enhancer region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Wilson1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Williams1">[53]</xref>. In these cases, there does not appear to be cycle-dependent changes in the activity of the <italic>trans</italic> activators. Furthermore, in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system replication potentiates Gal4-VP16 transcriptional activation during S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Kamakaka1">[54]</xref>. In our case, cycle-dependent activity of tTA can be ruled out because we observe the phenomenon even in the absence of tTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g004">Fig. 4A&amp;B</xref>). In S phase, activity of the Cdc28 kinase leads to upregulation of the basal transcriptional machinery which has been shown to lead to similarly timed pulses of transcription in ∼200 yeast genes not classified as cycle-dependent, but these are enriched in housekeeping genes and <italic>CYC1</italic> did not exhibit this behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Chymkowitch1">[55]</xref>. Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that temporary disruption of a repressed promoter's chromatin architecture during DNA replication could explain the pulse timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) and the increased tendency of tetO promoters to not activate until the G1 to S transition even when Pho4-tetR enters the nucleus in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003161-g005">Fig. 5H</xref>). (We observe a similar cycle-dependence at the native <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter where gene activation tends to occur in early S/G2 – Zopf, Maheshri, unpublished results.) Because nucleosomes that are deposited following passage of the replication fork consist of an equivalent mixture of maternal and newly synthesized histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Annunziato1">[56]</xref>, as this chromatin matures there may exist a period permissive for transcription. Even if this permissive period is short-lived, once activated, transcription-mediated deposition of histone marks could maintain an active transcription state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Shilatifard1">[57]</xref>.</p>
<p>The return to inactive state in G1 might be brought about during mitosis. Repressive modifications in general transcriptional machinery, changes in histone marks, and chromatin condensation all contribute to mitotic repression of RNA transcription in higher eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Gottesfeld1">[58]</xref>. In budding yeast, transcription was originally proposed to occur throughout mitosis as total RNA synthesis appeared to increase at and after nuclear migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Elliott1">[59]</xref>, but recent work shows Cdc14 inhibiting RNA Pol I transcription during anaphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-ClementeBlanco1">[60]</xref>. Still, mitotic repression of RNA Pol II transcription remains unclear, and we did observe an increased number of nascent spots of transcription in cells with large buds indicative of late G2 or M phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003161.s009">Fig. S9</xref>). Exploring genetic and chemical perturbations in the activity of factors involved in chromatin maturation during DNA replication and mitosis for their effect on the cycle-dependent transcription pattern should aid in elucidating precise mechanisms.</p>
<p>Our results should spur the development of new models that incorporate cell-cycle linked pulses of transcription and analyze its effects on the dynamics and function of genetic regulatory networks. Global extrinsic factors influence the behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-ColmanLerner1">[22]</xref> and previous work identifies two important roles of cell division: in the stochastic partitioning of cellular contents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Huh1">[24]</xref> and in setting the timescale at which extrinsic fluctuations decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Rosenfeld1">[61]</xref>. The latter especially has been incorporated in models of global extrinsic fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003161-Shahrezaei2">[62]</xref>. Revised models in light of our results may be particularly exciting to develop in networks containing positive feedback loops, where switching from an OFF to ON state relies heavily on the statistics of transcription at low expression. Because here transcription appears prohibited in G1, this would introduce a sizeable refractory period to switching. Finally, since poorer nutrient conditions increase cell division time by extending G1 in yeast, prohibited G1 transcription may alter the dynamics of regulatory networks in cells in different growth conditions in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>Yeast nitrogen base without phosphate (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA; #4027-812) was mixed with monobasic potassium phosphate solution (Sigma-Aldrich P8709) to set phosphate levels, and the pH was lowered to 4.
