<abstract>
<p>Gene expression in individual cells is highly variable and sporadic, often resulting in the synthesis of mRNAs and proteins in bursts. Such bursting has important consequences for cell-fate decisions in diverse processes ranging from HIV-1 viral infections to stem-cell differentiation. It is generally assumed that bursts are geometrically distributed and that they arrive according to a Poisson process. On the other hand, recent single-cell experiments provide evidence for complex burst arrival processes, highlighting the need for analysis of more general stochastic models. To address this issue, we invoke a mapping between general stochastic models of gene expression and systems studied in queueing theory to derive exact analytical expressions for the moments associated with mRNA/protein steady-state distributions. These results are then used to derive noise signatures, i.e. explicit conditions based entirely on experimentally measurable quantities, that determine if the burst distributions deviate from the geometric distribution or if burst arrival deviates from a Poisson process. For non-Poisson arrivals, we develop approaches for accurate estimation of burst parameters. The proposed approaches can lead to new insights into transcriptional bursting based on measurements of steady-state mRNA/protein distributions.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>One of the fundamental problems in biology is understanding how phenotypic variations arise among individuals in a population. Recent research has shown that phenotypic variations can arise due to probabilistic cell-fate decisions driven by inherent randomness (noise) in the process of gene expression. One of the manifestations of such stochasticity in gene expression is the production of mRNAs and proteins in bursts. Bursting in gene expression is known to impact cell-fate in diverse systems ranging from latency in HIV-1 viral infections to cellular differentiation. Recent single-cell experiments provide evidence for complex arrival processes leading to bursting, however an analytical framework connecting such burst arrival processes with the corresponding higher moments of mRNA/protein distributions is currently lacking. We address this issue by invoking a mapping between general models of gene expression and systems studied in queueing theory. The framework developed and the results derived lead to new approaches for testing commonly used assumptions in modeling gene expression and for accurate estimation of burst parameters. Notably, the phenomenon of stochastic bursting has been observed in a wide range of disciplines ranging from neuroscience and finance to cell biology. The approaches developed and results obtained in this work will thus contribute towards quantitative characterization of burst processes in diverse systems of current interest.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cellular response to fluctuating environments requires adjustments to cellular phenotypes driven by underlying changes in gene expression. Given the inherent stochasticity of cellular reactions, biological circuits controlling gene expression have to operate in the presence of significant noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref015">15</xref>]. While noise reduction and filtering is essential for several cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref016">16</xref>], cells can also amplify and utilize intrinsic noise to generate phenotypic diversity that enables survival under stressful conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref017">17</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of such bet-hedging survival strategies in diverse processes ranging from viral infections to bacterial competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref017">17</xref>]. Quantifying the kinetic mechanisms of gene expression that drive variations in a population of cells will thus contribute towards a fundamental understanding of cellular functions with important applications to human health.</p>
<p>Recent experiments focusing on gene expression at the single-cell level have revealed striking differences from the corresponding population-averaged behavior. In particular, it has been demonstrated that transcription in single cells is sporadic, with mRNA synthesis often occurring in bursts followed by variable periods of inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref028">28</xref>]. Such transcriptional bursting can give rise to high variability in gene expression products and to phenotypic variations in a population of genetically identical cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref032">32</xref>]. Furthermore, dynamical parameters that characterize transcriptional bursting of key genes can significantly influence cell-fate decisions in diverse processes ranging from HIV-1 viral infections to stem-cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref017">17</xref>]. Correspondingly, there is significant interest in developing approaches for quantifying parameters related to transcriptional bursting such as frequency and mean burst size.</p>
<p>In recent years, multiple studies have provided evidence for bursty synthesis of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref034">34</xref>] and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref036">36</xref>]. Experimental approaches in such studies include both steady-state measurements and time-dependent measurements of the mean and variance of gene expression products at the single-cell level. While obtaining time-lapse measurements of bursts at the single-cell level can be challenging, steady-state measurements at the single-cell level are now carried out routinely. It would thus be desirable to develop approaches for making inferences about burst parameters in gene expression using steady-state measurements at the single-cell level.</p>
<p>As noted in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref037">37</xref>], steady-state measurements of the mean and variance alone cannot be used for estimating burst parameters for general models of gene expression, e.g. when burst arrival is governed by complex promoter-based regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref038">38</xref>]. Additional insights into processes leading to transcriptional bursting can potentially be obtained using measurements of higher moments. However, analytical results for higher moments of steady-state mRNA and protein distributions in general models of expression have not been obtained so far. The derivation of the corresponding analytical expressions will elucidate how measurement of higher moments can potentially lead to quantification of burst parameters. To address these issues, it is essential to develop and analyze a general class of stochastic models of gene expression.</p>
<p>A simple stochastic model that is widely used in analyzing bursting in gene expression is the random telegraph model that takes into account the switching of promoter between transcriptionally active (ON) and inactive (OFF) states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref041">41</xref>]. This model has been used as the basis for several studies focusing on inferring gene expression parameters based on observations of the mean and variance of mRNA/protein distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref042">42</xref>]. In this model, in the limit that we have transcriptional bursting, the arrival of bursts is a Poisson process. Correspondingly, the waiting-time distribution between arrival of mRNA bursts is assumed to be exponential. In general, this assumption is not valid as there are multiple kinetic steps involved in promoter activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref044">44</xref>]. Recent experiments on mammalian genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref046">46</xref>] have demonstrated that the waiting-time for arrival of bursts does not have an exponential distribution. In view of these experimental observations, it is natural to ask: Using steady-state measurements, can we infer if the burst arrival process is <italic>not</italic> a Poisson process? If so, how can we estimate the corresponding burst parameters?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in estimating burst size it is commonly assumed that mRNA/protein bursts are geometrically distributed. This assumption, which has been validated by experimental observations for some genes, is derived from the corresponding distribution of bursts in the random telegraph model. However, given the complexity and diversity of gene expression mechanisms, it is possible that several promoters involve multiple rate-limiting steps in the transition from the ON state to the OFF state. In such cases, the transcriptional burst size distribution will not be a geometric distribution. This observation leads to the following question: Can we use steady-state measurements of moments to determine if the burst distribution deviates from a geometric distribution?</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to address the above questions by considering models with general arrival processes for mRNA creation. The paper is organized as follows. First, we introduce a class of gene expression models with general arrival processes leading to mRNA/protein bursts with arbitrary burst distribution. Then we review the mapping from gene expression models to systems studied in queuing theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref048">48</xref>] and use this mapping to derive steady-state moments for mRNA/protein distributions. The analytical expressions obtained for the steady-state moments are used to develop approaches for estimating burst parameters for general arrival processes. Finally, we use the results obtained to derive conditions relating experimentally measurable quantities that determine if the arrival of mRNA bursts deviates from a Poisson process and if the distribution of mRNA bursts deviates from a geometric distribution.</p>

<p>We consider a general model of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref043">43</xref>] as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004292.g001">Fig 1</xref>. In the model, mRNAs are produced in bursts, with <italic>f</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) representing a general arrival time distribution for mRNA bursts. The mRNA burst distribution can be arbitrary. Each mRNA then produces proteins with rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, and finally, both mRNAs and proteins decay with rates <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, respectively. Note that the model also allows for post-transcriptional regulation since the protein burst distribution from each mRNA can be arbitrary; the only assumption is that each mRNA produces proteins independently.</p>

<p>In the limit <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> ≪ <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>, we can use the bursty synthesis approximation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref040">40</xref>] for analyzing protein dynamics. This approximation consists of two steps: 1) obtaining the distribution of proteins produced from each mRNA and 2) assuming that the proteins are produced in instantaneous bursts. The corresponding distribution for the number of proteins created is referred to as the protein burst distribution. A detailed justification of the validity of this approximation has been provided in previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref049">49</xref>].</p>

The above relation follows from the observation that the number of proteins produced in a burst is a compound random variable: the sum of <italic>m</italic> independent identical random variables, each of which corresponds to the number of proteins produced from a single mRNA in the burst and <italic>m</italic> itself is a random variable denoting the number of mRNAs produced in the burst.</p>
<p>While the analytical results that we derive are valid for general mRNA and protein burst distributions, we will primarily focus on a specific class of burst distributions. Simple kinetic models and the results from multiple experiments indicate that mRNA burst distributions are geometric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref035">35</xref>]. Similarly, the burst distribution of proteins produced from a single mRNA is a geometric distribution with mean ⟨<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩ = <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>/<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>.

with (1 + ⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩) as the mean mRNA burst size. Note that in the limit ⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩ → 0, this distribution reduces to exactly 1 mRNA produced in each burst. Thus the conditional geometric distribution provides a unified representation of both Poisson arrival process for mRNAs (⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩ → 0) and processes leading to transcriptional bursting (⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩ &gt; 0).</p>

This is the generating function for a geometric distribution with mean <italic>b</italic> = (1 + ⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩)⟨<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩), where ⟨<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩ = <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>/<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> represents the mean protein burst size from a single mRNA.</p>
<p>Single-cell experiments have demonstrated that the protein burst mean <italic>b</italic> can be directly measured in some cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref035">35</xref>]. However, if the protein production rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> is not known, the preceding analysis implies that measurements of protein burst distributions (which determine <italic>b</italic>) cannot be used to determine the degree of transcriptional bursting (1 + ⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩). Since the mean transcriptional burst size is an important parameter characterizing bursting, it is of interest to develop approaches for estimating it based on available experiments. Previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref050">50</xref>] has argued that the mean transcriptional burst size cannot be determined using measurements of protein burst distributions alone or by using only protein steady-state distributions. It was suggested that combining such measurements can potentially provide a way of determining the mean transcriptional burst size. To explore this possibility, it is necessary to derive analytical results connecting moments of burst and steady-state distributions for general kinetic schemes.</p>

<title>Mapping to queueing theory: Results for moments</title>
<p>To obtain steady-state moments for the model outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004292.g001">Fig 1</xref>, we invoke the mapping of this gene expression model to systems studied in queueing theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref052">52</xref>]. Broadly speaking, queueing theory is the mathematical theory of waiting lines formed by customers who, arriving according to some random protocol, stay in the system until they receive service from a group of servers. Such queues are typically characterized by specifying a) the stochastic process governing the arrival of customers, b) distribution of number of customers in each arrival, c) the stochastic process governing departure of customers, and d) the number of servers. When the gene expression model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004292.g001">Fig 1</xref> is expressed in the language of queueing theory, individual mRNAs/proteins are the analogs of customers in queueing models. The production of mRNAs/proteins in bursts corresponds to the arrival of customers in batches. Just as the customers leave the queue after receiving service, mRNAs/proteins exit the system upon degradation. Thus the waiting-time distribution for mRNA/protein decay is the analog of service time distribution for customers in queueing models. For the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004292.g001">Fig 1</xref>, their decay time distribution is the exponential distribution. Also, since mRNAs/proteins are degraded independently of each other, the corresponding number of servers in queueing models is ∞ (which ensures that presence of a customer in the system does not affect the service time of any other customer in the system).</p>
<p>Based on the above mapping, the queueing system corresponding to the model outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004292.g001">Fig 1</xref> is the <italic>GI</italic><sup><italic>X</italic></sup>/<italic>M</italic>/∞ system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref048">48</xref>]. In this model, the symbol <italic>G</italic> refers to a general waiting-time distribution for the arrival process, <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>X</italic></sup> denotes customers arriving in batches of independently distributed random sizes <italic>X</italic>, <italic>M</italic> stands for Markovian (i.e. exponential) service-time distribution for customers and ‘∞’ stands for infinite servers.</p>
<p>For the <italic>GI</italic><sup><italic>X</italic></sup>/<italic>M</italic>/∞ model, exact results for iteratively obtaining the moments of the steady-state distribution of the number of customers have been derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref048">48</xref>]. Using these results, explicit expressions for the first four moments of the steady-state distribution are provided in the Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004292.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Applying the mapping discussed above, these results can be translated into exact expressions for the moments of mRNA/protein steady-state distributions, as discussed below.</p>
<p>Let us first examine the expressions for steady-state means of mRNAs, ⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>⟩, and proteins, ⟨<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>⟩, which are given by

Although <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004292.e007">Eq (2)</xref> has been derived by assuming that the arrival of mRNAs/proteins is a renewal process, it is valid for arbitrary arrival processes. This is because <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004292.e007">Eq (2)</xref> is a direct consequence of Little’s Law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref053">53</xref>] which is valid for general arrival processes.</p>
<p>The above equations, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004292.e007">Eq (2)</xref>, can be used to determine the mean transcriptional burst size, provided the protein burst distribution can be measured experimentally.

Since the steady-state means ⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>⟩ and ⟨<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>⟩ as well as the degradation rates <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> are parameters that can be measured experimentally, the above equation implies that the ratio <italic>b</italic>/⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩ can be determined experimentally. Given <italic>b</italic>/⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩ = <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>/<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>, this implies that the mean protein production rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> can also be determined experimentally. This is an important result since it provides an approach for determining the mean protein production rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> that is valid for arbitrary arrival processes for mRNAs. Furthermore, the above equation implies that, if the mean of protein burst distribution <italic>b</italic> can be measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref036">36</xref>], then the mean transcriptional burst size ⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩ can also be determined. Thus, if we have measurements for mean mRNA and protein numbers and also the mean of protein burst distribution, then these measurements can be used to determine the degree of transcriptional bursting ⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩ as well as the parameters ⟨<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩ and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>.

<p>We note from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004292.e009">Eq (4)</xref> that, for Poisson arrivals, i.e. <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = 1, and geometrically distributed burst, i.e. <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004292.e014"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004292.e014g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004292.e014"/><mml:math id="M14" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi> <mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi> <mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mrow><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi> <mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo>〉</mml:mo></mml:mrow> <mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo></mml:mrow> <mml:mrow><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi> <mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo>〉</mml:mo></mml:mrow> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>), the equations for the noise and mean have only two unknown burst parameters, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> and ⟨<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>⟩. In this case, experimental measurements of the first two moments of the steady-state distribution are sufficient to estimate the burst parameters, as has been done in multiple studies. However, when the arrival process is non-Poisson or if the burst distribution deviates from a geometric distribution, measurements of the first two steady-state moments are not sufficient for estimating the burst parameters. This observation motivates the need for analytical expressions for the higher moments which we turn to next.</p>
<p>We now derive analytical expressions for the third moment, specifically the skewness parameter. For mRNAs, the exact expression for skewness <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub></sub> is given by

Similarly, expressions for higher order moments of protein and mRNA steady-state distributions can be obtained iteratively. The corresponding expressions for the kurtosis are provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004292.s001">S1 Text</xref>.</p>
<p>The analytical results derived above for proteins are exact in the burst limit, which assumes that proteins are produced instantaneously from all the mRNAs in a burst. Going beyond the burst limit (i.e. not limited to <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ≫ <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>), exact results for the higher moments of the protein steady-state distribution will, in general, depend on the details of the kinetic scheme for gene expression. However, we can derive approximate analytical expressions for general schemes by requiring that: a) the results reduce to the exact results in the burst limit and b) they match the exact results for the two-stage model of gene expression. For the two-stage model, exact results for the first four moments have been derived by Bokes et. al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref055">55</xref>].

<p>It is noteworthy that the results derived are valid for a general class of kinetic schemes of gene expression. For a specific kinetic scheme, we can determine the corresponding waiting-time distribution for the arrival process and the burst distributions for mRNA and proteins. Substituting these results in the equations derived leads to the corresponding expressions for the moments of the steady-state distribution. The results obtained can thus provide insight into how specific kinetic schemes of gene expression (e.g. combining promoter-based regulation and post-transcriptional regulation) can be used to impact the noise and higher moments of steady-state distributions.</p>

<title>Estimation of burst parameters</title>
<p>The results derived for the steady-state moments indicate that, if the burst arrival process is not a Poisson process, then it is no longer accurate to estimate burst parameters based on measurements of mean and variance only, as has been done in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref013">13</xref>]. In the following, we present approaches for estimating burst parameters in the general case.</p>
<p>We begin by considering the general kinetic scheme shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004292.g003">Fig 3</xref>. This form for the kinetic scheme is supported by recent experiments in mammalian cells which suggest the presence of multiple rate-limiting steps between transition of the promoter from OFF to ON state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref057">57</xref>]. However, as observed in these experiments, a promoter in the ON state switches to the OFF state by a single rate-limiting step. We model the promoter switching from OFF to ON state by a general waiting-time distribution, <italic>g</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). The switching rate from ON to OFF state is given by <italic>β</italic>.</p>

<title>Burst parameters from the sequence-size function</title>
<p>To extract burst parameters for the general scheme considered above, we first note that bursts are generated due to the interplay of two time scales, one that corresponds to production of mRNAs (when the gene is active) while the other one corresponds to the waiting-time between production events (when the gene is in inactive state). For bursty gene expression, we expect a clear separation of time-scales between the characteristic time periods for these two cases. Following [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref041">41</xref>], it is convenient to define a sequence-size function,

where <italic>f</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the waiting-time distribution for the arrival of a <italic>single</italic> mRNA starting with the promoter in the ON state. For a fixed <italic>τ</italic>, the sequence-size function can be used to categorize time intervals larger than <italic>τ</italic> as separating bursts. Correspondingly, the term <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004292.e031"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004292.e031g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004292.e031"/><mml:math id="M31" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∫</mml:mo> <mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow> <mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:msubsup> <mml:mi>f</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo> <mml:mi>t</mml:mi> <mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow> <mml:mi>d</mml:mi> <mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> represents the fraction of all mRNA arrivals that correspond to the arrivals produced in a single burst; thus <italic>ϕ</italic> provides the corresponding mean burst size. For bursty gene expression with a separation of time-scales, for a specific choice of <italic>τ</italic> = <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, the sequence-size function can be related to the actual mean burst size. If <italic>f</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) can be measured, then determination of <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> can result in accurate estimates of the burst parameters such as mean burst size and frequency. In the following, we discuss how to determine <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> for the general class of arrival processes considered in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004292.g003">Fig 3</xref>.</p>
<p>The key insight is based on the observation that, due to the separation of time scales within bursts and between consecutive bursts, determination of <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> can be done by using a simple two-state model as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004292.g002">Fig 2a</xref>. Even though the actual waiting time distribution between bursts (<italic>g</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)) may differ from the exponential distribution for the two-state model, the short-time behavior of the sequence-size function will be indistinguishable between the two cases (given separation of time-scales). If <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> can be connected to the short-time behavior, then analytical expressions for the sequence-size function <italic>ϕ</italic>(<italic>τ</italic>) for the two-state model can be used to estimate <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and thereby the mean burst size.</p>
<p>For the two-state model, we find that burst size can be determined using a specific <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, which corresponds to an inflexion point where the curvature of <italic>ϕ</italic>(<italic>τ</italic>) changes its sign. Specifically, for the two-state model, we obtain <italic>f</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) by taking inverse Laplace transform of <italic>f</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004292.e063">Eq (23)</xref>.

<title>Estimation of <italic>f</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) from steady-state moments</title>
<p>The procedure outlined in the previous section assumes that the waiting-time distribution <italic>f</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) can be determined. However, this can be challenging experimentally, thus it is desirable to develop approaches for estimating <italic>f</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) based on measurements of steady-state distributions.</p>
<p>To proceed in this direction, let us first obtain a relation connecting the two waiting-time distributions <italic>f</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (for single mRNA arrival) and <italic>g</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (for burst arrival). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004292.g003">Fig 3</xref>, we note that when the promoter is in the active state, <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>, it can make multiple trips to <italic>D</italic><sub>0</sub> before producing mRNA. Whenever gene is in <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> state, it can either create mRNA or can switch back to <italic>D</italic><sub>0</sub> state. Gene in <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> state can produce mRNA either in a single step, i.e., without switching back to <italic>D</italic><sub>0</sub> state, or by making multiple trips to <italic>D</italic><sub>0</sub> before producing mRNA.

<title>Effect of extrinsic noise on burst estimation</title>
<p>The burst estimation approach discussed in the preceding section assumes that the dominant contribution comes from intrinsic sources of fluctuations. However, extrinsic noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref012">12</xref>], e.g. arising from different concentration of cellular components such as RNA polymerase, can also contribute significantly to the observed variations. It is thus of interest to examine how the proposed burst parameter estimation procedure works if we also consider sources of extrinsic noise.</p>
<p>To explore the effects of such fluctuations, we consider the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004292.g005">Fig 5</xref>. In this kinetic scheme, the activation of gene from OFF to ON state involves two sequential steps, with rates <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub>. To include extrinsic fluctuations in the model, we consider that the rate of transcription <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> is a Log-normally distributed random variable with mean ⟨<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>⟩ and standard deviation <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub></sub>.

<title>Signatures for non-Poisson arrivals</title>
<p>The analytical expressions derived for the steady-state moments for mRNAs and proteins can also be used to make inferences about the burst arrival process based on steady-state measurements. Since multiple studies assume that the burst arrival process is characterized by an exponential waiting-time distribution, it would be useful to determine if this assumption is invalid using measurements of steady-state distributions. As shown below, we can obtain conditions for the same using the results derived for higher moments.</p>
<p>In the following, we will first focus on the cases that the mRNA burst distribution is conditional geometric and the protein burst distribution is geometric, which is consistent with multiple experimental observations. As discussed, choosing the conditional geometric distribution for mRNAs allows us to consider both single mRNA arrivals and geometric mRNA bursts in one framework. Since experiments can provide measurements of both mRNA and protein steady-state distributions, it is useful to have conditions for the arrival process using either mRNA data or protein data or both mRNA and protein data. Based on these three possibilities, we present three different conditions in the following.</p>

<title>Signatures for non-geometric bursts</title>
<p>As discussed in the previous section, it is widely assumed that the mRNA burst distribution can be represented by a conditional geometric distribution (i.e. including both single mRNA arrivals and geometrically distributed burst arrivals). While this assumption is consistent with multiple experimental observations, for general kinetic schemes the possibility of non-geometric mRNA burst distributions has to be considered. Thus, it is of interest to examine if the results obtained can be used to determine if the mRNA burst distribution deviates from a conditional geometric distribution.</p>
<p>To address the possibility of non-geometric mRNA burst distributions, let us first consider that the random variable corresponding to the mRNA burst distribution (<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>) has a conditional geometric distribution.

<p>We note that the above expression has been derived by making just one assumption, namely, the mRNA burst distribution is a conditional geometric distribution. The derived expression thus indicates that a combination of experimentally measurable quantities has to deviate from 1 if the mRNA burst distribution deviates from a conditional geometric distribution. Thus the analytical results derived provide a signature for deviation from conditional geometric mRNA bursts using measurements of the first three moments of the mRNA steady-state distribution.</p>
<p>The main requirement for using the above relation is that measurements of mRNA steady-state distribution can be carried out at two different rates of the mRNAs <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and 2<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>. Given that mRNA degradation rates can be tuned experimentally, a straightforward strategy to ensure that the degradation rate is tuned to twice the original value (2<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) is to compare the mean mRNA levels at <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and 2<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>.

The strength of this result lies in the fact that it holds for general arrival processes for mRNA bursts with arbitrary waiting-time distributions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we study stochastic gene expression models with a general renewal-type arrival process for mRNAs. By mapping such a generic model of gene expression to systems studied in queueing theory, we derive analytical expressions for the moments for mRNA and protein steady-state distributions. While the focus of this work is on using approaches drawn from queueing theory, it is noteworthy that the kinetic scheme defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004292.g001">Fig 1</xref> can also be analyzed using the general theory of branching processes with immigration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref058">58</xref>]. In future work, it would be of interest to explore potential connections between complementary approaches to such models based on branching processes and queueing theory.</p>
<p>While previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004292.ref043">43</xref>] have focused on protein noise, in the present work we derive analytic expressions for higher order moments of both mRNA and protein steady-state distributions. For arbitrary kinetic schemes, the results obtained determine how the moments of steady-state distributions depend on model parameters. They elucidate how different sources (promoter-based regulation, transcriptional bursting, post-transcriptional regulation) combine to determine the overall noise and higher moments. Furthermore, the results derived show how parameters of interest (such as mean protein production rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>) can be estimated for general models (i.e. without making any assumptions about specific features of the models).</p>
<p>The expressions derived for the moments can also be used to infer if the arrival process for mRNAs is non-Poisson or if the mRNA burst distribution deviates from the geometric distribution. Correspondingly, we obtain analytic conditions that provide signatures for non-Poisson arrivals of mRNA bursts and for non-geometric mRNA burst distributions. These conditions involve relations between combinations of of experimentally measurable quantities and can thus be tested by using measurements of either mRNA steady-state distributions or protein steady-state distributions or both. Apart from obtaining insights into the statistics of the arrival process, we can use the results derived for steady-state moments for accurately estimating burst parameters using an iterative approach. Notably, the results and the approaches developed in this work are valid for general models of gene expression i.e., given the general assumptions made, they do not depend on the specifics of the kinetic schemes.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the burst parameter estimation approaches presented in this paper rely on the accurate measurements of higher order moments, such as skewness or kurtosis. This, in turn requires that we have relatively large sample sizes. For example, simulations of two state random telegraph model (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004292.s005">S5 Text</xref>) indicate that for the standard error in skewness to be below 10%, the sample size should be ∼ 1000. Current experimental limitations on measurements of mRNA distributions (e.g. using RNA FISH) do not allow for such large sample sizes and thus do not lead to accurate computation of skewness or kurtosis. While accurate measurements of higher moments are not readily available in the existing data, it is hoped that our results will provide motivation for carrying out the corresponding experiments in future. The combination of these experimental results with our theoretical approaches can be used in obtaining accurate representations of the arrival process and burst parameters for a wide range of cellular systems.</p>
