<p>A current challenge in biology is to understand the dynamics of protein circuits in living human cells. Can one define and test equations for the dynamics and variability of a protein over time? Here, we address this experimentally and theoretically, by means of accurate time-resolved measurements of endogenously tagged proteins in individual human cells. As a model system, we choose three stable proteins displaying cell-cycle–dependant dynamics. We find that protein accumulation with time per cell is quadratic for proteins with long mRNA life times and approximately linear for a protein with short mRNA lifetime. Both behaviors correspond to a classical model of transcription and translation. A stochastic model, in which genes slowly switch between ON and OFF states, captures measured cell–cell variability. The data suggests, in accordance with the model, that switching to the gene ON state is exponentially distributed and that the cell–cell distribution of protein levels can be approximated by a Gamma distribution throughout the cell cycle. These results suggest that relatively simple models may describe protein dynamics in individual human cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A goal of systems biology is to understand the dynamics of protein levels, as proteins are produced and degraded. One aims for a mathematical description of these processes that captures the essentials and that can be understood intuitively.</p>
<p>Most current models of protein dynamics have been established and tested in micro-organisms. Proteins in bacterial cells, for example, are well described by production-degradation equations. These show that protein mass increases exponentially over time in growing cells, and that protein concentration approaches steady-state with exponential decays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Price1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Rosenfeld2">[5]</xref>. Such models have been shown to be useful for describing the measured dynamics of protein circuits with several interactions, such as feed-forward loop network motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Mangan1">[6]</xref> and auto-regulatory loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Rosenfeld1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Becskei1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Alon2">[9]</xref>. Similarly, experiment and theory has established an understanding of cell-cell variability of protein levels in bacterial and yeast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Ozbudak1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Golding1">[15]</xref>. Protein distributions in micro-organisms have been measured at steady-state and are well described by Gamma distributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Paulsson1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Friedman1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Much less is known about the cell-cell variability of protein dynamics in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Raser2">[18]</xref>. Differences in expression levels between individual cells of a clonal population were previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Ko1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Walters1">[22]</xref> and related to stochastic processes. More recently, Raj <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Raj1">[23]</xref> have followed mRNA and protein to show bursts of mRNA production. Sigal <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal1">[24]</xref> measured variability and memory in nuclear proteins, finding that the time it takes for cells expressing a protein above or below the population mean to ‘relax’ towards the average is longer than one cell generation. More work is needed to understand the basic dynamics and differences of human protein levels and its variation across the cell cycle in individual cells.</p>
<p>To address this, we experimentally followed the dynamics of selected human proteins in human cancer cells and test simple models to describe these dynamics. The experiments were made possible by recent advances in obtaining dynamics of endogenously expressed proteins in individual human cells at very high resolution and accuracy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal2">[25]</xref>. This is based on a library of cell clones, each expressing a different fluorescently tagged protein expressed from its natural chromosomal location and under its native regulation. From this library, we chose three proteins that accumulate throughout the cell cycle, but are degraded every time that the cell divides. These proteins show little memory of previous cell cycles, and thus are a good starting point for testing models based on current cell properties. In the present study, we calibrated this assay to provide units of protein concentration.</p>
<p>We find that the proteins are found to follow either an approximately linear or a quadratic dependence on time. They also differ in their onset time of production and in their variability across the cell cycle. We find that these features can be understood in terms of a single unified model. Approximately linear accumulation results from short mRNA half-life, and quadratic accumulation from long mRNA half-life, as suggested by transcription inhibition experiments. Cell-cell variability of all three proteins is consistent with a stochastic model with slow gene ON- and OFF-transitions suggested by Raser and O'shea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Raser1">[14]</xref>. The measured cell-cell distribution of onset time of protein accumulation supports such slow transitions. We further show experimentally and theoretically that the protein distribution is well approximated by a Gamma distribution (described in detail at the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> section) at all time points, even though dynamics are not in steady-state. Finally, we show that memory of protein levels of previous cell-cycles is lost due to the early degradation and variability in onset times of protein production. In summary, the present study presents a basis for future understanding of more complex protein circuits in human cells.</p>

<title>Dynamics of PRC1, ANLN, and YB1 in individual cells</title>
<p>We used an approach for dynamic proteomics to measure the protein levels of PRC1 (protein regulator of cytokinesis 1, NM_003981), ANLN (anillin, NM_018685) and YB1 (Y-box binding protein-1, NM_004559) in individual living human cancer cells over several cell cycles. Cell clones were used in which these genes are tagged at their endogenous chromosomal locus with yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) as an internal exon. The proteins are expressed as full length proteins tagged with fluorescent YFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In each of the clones only one allele is tagged. The clonal cell lines in which PRC1, ANLN and YB1 are tagged originate from the same parental cell (H1299 non small cell lung cancer cell line).</p>
<p>The cells were followed using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy in incubated conditions controlled for temperature, humidity and CO2. This resulted in time-lapse movies over days of growth, showing about 10–20 cells per frame at a 20 minute temporal resolution. Movies were analyzed using automated image analysis software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal3">[26]</xref>. Cell segmentation was achieved by means of a second, red fluorescent labeling in these cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>) that allowed automated detection of the boundaries of the cell and of its nucleus.</p>
<p>The three proteins showed cell-cycle dependent dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g001">Figure 1A</xref> for PRC1 and YB1 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s007">Figure S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s008">Figure S8</xref> for ANLN). The qualitative temporal and spatial dynamics observed for all three tagged proteins agree with previous studies of the native proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Jiang1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Straight1">[30]</xref> and are summarized below. PRC1 functions to organize microtubules during cell division. Newly made PRC1 accumulates in the nucleus. Then, at mitosis it localizes to the spindle poles and then, during cytokinesis, it localizes to the cell midbody. Following cell division, the protein concentrated at this spot is shuttled to one or both daughter cells (for example, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s010">Movies S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s011">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s012">S3</xref>). Finally, the protein is degraded in the first hours following cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Jiang1">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s002">Figure S2A and S2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell cycle–dependent behavior of PRC1 and YB1.</title>
<p>(A) Each image is an overlay of the fluorescence of the tagged protein on the corresponding phase-contrast image. One cell for each tagged protein is shown. Images are ordered according to the fraction of the time elapsed between two division events. The cells are automatically centered and neighboring cells are removed for clarity. The percentage of elapsed cell cycle is indicated at the bottom. Bar denotes 10 µm. Note the asymmetric partition of fluorescently tagged PRC1 between the two daughter cells following cell division. (B,C) For each protein, PRC1 and YB1, tracks of 150 cells are plotted. Each line denotes the total cell fluorescence level as measured during the cell cycle of a single cell. Cells are <italic>in-silico</italic> synchronized to beginning of their cell cycle. Each cell has different cell cycle length (PRC1: μ = 21.6±2 hr, YB1: 17.2±2 hr). Both proteins are degraded following cell division.</p>

<p>The second protein studied here, YB1, is a transcription and translational regulator related to cell cycle events and other processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Kohno1">[31]</xref>. It also shows cell-cycle dependent dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Jurchott2">[32]</xref>. YB1 accumulates in the nucleus, and has a relatively constant level in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s002">Figure S2B and S2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s013">Movies S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s014">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s015">S6</xref>). Like PRC1, it is degraded in the first hours following cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The third protein ANLN, is an actin bundling protein crucial for abscission at the final stage of the cytokinesis and is involved in coordinating the contractile activity of myosin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Field1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Straight1">[30]</xref>. It too is degraded after cell division but accumulation over the cell cycle occurs both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s007">Figure S7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s008">S8A and S8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s016">Movies S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s017">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s018">S9</xref>). For the sake of clarity we will focus from here on on two proteins PRC1 and YB1. Data for ANLN, whose behavior is similar to PRC1, appear in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s007">Figure S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s008">Figure S8</xref>.</p>
<p>The degradation of these proteins in the early phase of the cell cycle is useful for the present study because it minimizes the effects of proteins carried over from previous generations. In practice, for PRC1 there was no correlation across cell cycles (R = 0.07±0.09 where R is the average Pearson correlation coefficient of accumulated protein levels at equal time points at two consecutive cell cycles of individual cells ), while YB1 showed weak correlation between daughter and mother cells (R = 0.38±0.18). See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s003">Figure S3A and S3B</xref> for correlations across cell cycles of total protein levels and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s009">Text S1</xref>, part 1, for correlations of other parameters across the cell cycle.</p>

<title>Calibration of fluorescence units in terms of protein levels</title>
<p>We calibrated the YFP fluorescence from the movies in terms of number of tagged protein concentrations and total number per cell. Calibration of concentrations was achieved using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy inside the cell's cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Kopito1">[33]</xref> (detailed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). To estimate total protein in a cell, we used a nominal cell volume of 4×10<sup>3</sup> µm<sup>3</sup> (estimated based on the measured area of a cell ranging between 300–1500 µ<sup>2</sup> and an estimated height ranging between 2–8 µ). We find that PRC1 reaches estimated maximal levels of about 250,000 molecules per cell on average, and YB1 reaches levels of 500,000 molecules per cell. Quantitatively similar calibration results were also obtained by comparing fluorescence of cells to that of purified GFP (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The calibration factor (proteins per fluorescence units) was within a factor of two for the different tagged proteins in this study.</p>

<title>Average protein accumulation increases with time linearly for YB1 and quadratically for PRC1</title>
<p>Image analysis of the time-lapse movies allowed accurate quantitation of the total protein level in each cell, defined as the total YFP fluorescence within the cell boundaries. Cells were synchronized <italic>in silico</italic>, by noting the time of each division event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal3">[26]</xref>. Thus, cells could be aligned according to the time that has elapsed since the last cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). Relative error of the average fluorescence measurements between day-day repeats is about 10%.</p>
<p>We first consider the average protein accumulation over the cell population, and then, in the next sections, the variability between cells. Protein accumulation was considered for each cell as the increase of fluorescence above the basal fluorescence at the end of the degradation event that occurs after division (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>). The protein accumulation onset was defined for each cell as the time at which protein levels reached their minimum level. Each cell was then synchronized to the protein accumulation onset time and initial fluorescence levels were subtracted.</p>
<p>We find that the mean protein level increases over the cell cycle. PRC1 showed a quadratic increase with time, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004901.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, to good accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, relative error = 2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

<title>Model suggests that linear accumulation results from unstable mRNA and quadratic accumulation from stable mRNA</title>
<p>To understand the different accumulation profiles, we used a classical model of transcription and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Thattai1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-McAdams1">[35]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Here mRNA, r, is produced at rate k<sub>r</sub> and degraded at rate α<sub>r</sub>, so that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004901.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Protein is produced from the mRNA at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004901.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and degraded at rate α<sub>p</sub>, so that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004901.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This model makes several predictions. First, the only way to fit the non-saturating curves of both PRC1 and YB1 is to assume that protein degradation is negligible (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004901.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In other words, protein life-time exceeds the cell cycle, ∼20 h in the present experiment. Second, the model predicts that the quadratic accumulation of PRC1 corresponds to very long life-time of its mRNA, so that α<sub>r</sub> is negligible. In this case <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004901.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and protein increases quadratically with time <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004901.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>In contrast to this quadratic accumulation, the approximately linear accumulation of YB1 is predicted to mainly result from a high degradation rate of its mRNA. In this case the mRNA concentration reaches a steady-state concentration, and as a result protein level increases linearly with time, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004901.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<title>Experiments indicate that PRC1 mRNA is stable and YB1 mRNA is short-lived, and that both proteins are stable</title>
<p>To test the model predictions, we inhibited transcription by adding α-amanitin, a commonly used transcription inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Lindell1">[36]</xref>. This drug (at 100 µg/ml) completely shuts down the action of RNA polymerase 2 in the cells, approximately 2 hours after addition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Nguyen1">[37]</xref>.</p>

<p>Fitting the differential equations describing mRNA and protein levels to measured protein levels of YB1 following addition of α-amanitin (detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s009">Text S1</xref> part 2) suggest an mRNA half life of 0.77±0.2 hr<sup>−1</sup>. Using this mRNA life-time in equations describing behavior in un-perturbed cells, we find that mRNA levels reach 90% of steady state in 3 hrs and 99% in 6 hrs. These results agree with the model predictions, suggesting stable mRNA for PRC1, short-lived mRNA for YB1. That both proteins are highly stable is evidenced by the fact that their levels do not decrease following inhibitor addition. In summary, this experiment supports the simple model predictions.</p>

<p>So far we have discussed the average behavior of the cell population observed in the movies.

The individual-cell trajectories of YB1 have an approximately linear dependence on time (best fit of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004901.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to individual cell data is for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004901.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

<p>We quantified this variation between cells using the noise strength, defined by ratio of the variance to the mean. Thus, noise strength, is NS = variance/mean. We note that a second common measure, the coefficient of variation CV = std/mean was more susceptible to noise in the present data.

<p>We also found that different cells began to significantly accumulate the proteins at different times after cell division. In particular, there appeared to be a large cell-cell variation of such ‘onset times’ for PRC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Some cells showed protein accumulation after an hour and others after five or more hours. We measured the distribution of the time at which protein levels first begin to rise in each cell. We find that this distribution has an exponential tail, with a decay time of 1.02±0.36 hrs. For YB1, we also find an exponential tail but with a shorter decay time 0.37±0.09 hrs.

<title>A model based on slow gene switching captures the variability</title>
<p>To understand the present data on cell-cell variability, we employed models for stochasticity in protein expression. The observed exponential distribution of times for the onset of protein accumulation is consistent with a slow process that turns expression ON with a timescale of hours. This corresponds to a picture, suggested in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Blake1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Raser1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Ross1">[20]</xref>, and observed in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Raj1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Chubb1">[39]</xref>, in which genes switch slowly from ON to OFF states, and transcription occurs from the ON state alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). We find that such a stochastic model captures the present data on noise strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, solid lines), with parameter sets shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g005">Figure 5D</xref>.</p>
<p>We also compared the data to a model with no gene switching. This model is a straightforward stochastic version of the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g002">Figure 2C</xref> where each rate is interpreted as a probability per unit time. We found that such a model can only explain the extent of the observed variability when one uses parameters that give very low mRNA levels: only a few mRNA/cell leading to high variability due to small-number fluctuations. Given our estimates of several hundred thousand proteins per cell, this leads to a very high translation rate in the model, in order to provide the observed number of proteins/mRNA. Such a rate is at the limit of physical limitations of the cell (maximal ribosomal packing along the transcript, in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s009">Text S1</xref> part 8).</p>
<p>In summary, the slow-switching model in which genes switch from OFF to ON on the timescale of hours seems to generate the large observed variability naturally, because of the long times between opening and closing events, resulting in relatively rare bursts of mRNA production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Golding1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Friedman1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Raj1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Chubb1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Cai1">[40]</xref>.

Gamma distributions are single-peaked distributions. They have a sharp peak and an exponential tail at low average protein numbers, and have a bell-shaped distribution at high average protein numbers. The formula for the probability of having n proteins has two parameters, a and b, and is:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004901.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where a = m<sup>2</sup>/σ<sup>2</sup> and b = σ<sup>2</sup>/m (m and σ denote mean and standard deviation respectively). These theoretical results were obtained for steady-state processes. Here, we extended this theoretical analysis also to the case of dynamics that are not in steady-state. The present system is out of steady state, because the average protein level rises with time. We used a moment analysis to determine the distribution at different time points (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s009">Text S1</xref> part 5).

<p>We found that Gamma distributions describe the observed experimental data well at all times.

<title>Cellular mixing occurs at early stages of the cell cycle and is independent of protein accumulation patterns</title>
<p>Tracking changes of protein levels at the individual cell level over time allows following the mixing of protein level ranking between cells over time..

While cells exhibit faster mixing for PRC1 at the beginning of the cell cycle compared to YB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), similar mixing was observed for both proteins in the protein accumulation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), despite their different accumulation rates (approximately constant for YB1 and linear for PRC1). Loss of cellular memory of previous protein levels seems to occur at early stages of the cell cycle due to degradation and varying onset times of accumulation. Mixing occurs to a much lesser extent in the accumulation phase of newly synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004901-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study presented an experimental and theoretical analysis of the detailed dynamics and variability of selected proteins in human cells. This analysis was made possible by an experimental advance that allows highly accurate, time-resolved measurement of proteins expressed from their native chromosomal position, and under their natural regulation, in individual cells. We chose proteins that are degraded upon cell division and that accumulate throughout the cell cycle, and which do not significantly carry memory of their levels in the previous cell cycle.</p>
<p>We find either a linear accumulation with time or a quadratic accumulation with time. Linear accumulation is found to correspond to short mRNA life-time, and quadratic accumulation to long mRNA life-time, in accord with simple transcription-translation equations. The theoretical predictions were tested by using a transcription inhibitor, which showed how quadratic profiles turn to linear, and linear profiles turn to constant protein levels, as predicted.</p>
<p>Note that linear and quadratic accumulation of total protein/cell are quite different from the typical patterns found in bacteria, in which total protein levels typically rise exponentially (or nearly exponentially) across the cell cycle.</p>
<p>We also studied the cell-cell variability in the protein levels. A model with slow transitions between ON and OFF gene states captures the observed variability, including the exponential distribution of onset times and the Gamma-shaped cell-cell distribution of protein levels. The extent of the noise seems to be too large to be explained by stochastic models that lack slow ON-OFF transitions.</p>
<p>In addition to single-time point statistics, we also considered the rate at which protein levels mix so that cells higher or lower than average return to average. Except for a short period after cell division, in which memory of previous levels is rapidly lost, the protein levels seem to show a small extent of mixing, with accumulation trajectories that are similarly shaped and roughly parallel for different cells in the population. Thus, the proteins display distinct cell-cell individuality over the cell cycle.</p>
<p>One may ask whether the different accumulation profile shapes we observed for YB1 and PRC1 correspond to their biological function. PRC1 is essential for the final stage of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Mollinari1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Zhu1">[42]</xref>, where it acts to control the spatiotemporal formation of the midzone during cytokinesis. In contrast, YB1 is involved in processes throughout the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Kohno1">[31]</xref>, such as transcriptional regulation, translational regulation, DNA repair, stress response and cell proliferation. A quadratic accumulation as in PRC1 prepares most of the protein in the last stage of the cell cycle. A linear accumulation profile as in YB1 may be better suited for proteins that need to serve the gradually growing cell content across the cell cycle.</p>
<p>This study raises the hope that relatively simple models might accurately capture the behavior of protein dynamics. Future work can explore whether such models can be used as building blocks to understand more complex protein circuitry. It would be important to further test this approach by measurements of additional proteins. For this purpose, the present experimental approach may be of use, especially in conjunction with a comprehensive library of tagged human proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal2">[25]</xref>, to characterize the mean and individual cell behavior under diverse conditions.</p>

<title>YFP CD-tagging of endogenous proteins</title>
<p>PRC1 and YB1 were chosen from a library of tagged proteins in the H1299 non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line. This library was constructed as described in Sigal <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal3">[26]</xref>. Briefly, the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein coding region (EYFP), flanked with splice acceptor and donor sequences, was placed on a retroviral vector (pBabeAE) and integrated into the genome. Three vectors were used, one with EYFP in each reading frame. EYFP is expressed when the virus integrates into an intron of an expressed gene in the right frame and orientation, leading to incorporation of YFP as a new exon in the spliced mRNA. This method is known as Central-Dogma tagging (CD-tagging) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Jarvik1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Jarvik2">[44]</xref>. Cells positive for YFP fluorescence were sorted using flow cytometry into 384-well plates and grown into cell clones. Tagged protein identities were determined by 3′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that amplified the section between EYFP and the polyA tail of the mRNA of the host gene. PCR products were sequenced directly and aligned to the genome.</p>

<title>Image analysis using a red tag in the parental cell line</title>
<p>The present library has an additional feature which is crucial for accurate image analysis, and which goes beyond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal3">[26]</xref> : the parental cell was tagged with a second red fluorescent tag, mCherry. This tag was inserted by two rounds of CD tagging into two genes, one expressed in the nucleus and the other expressed in the entire intracellular volume. This tagging was used in the parental cell of the present library in order to enable computerized segmentation of the whole cell. Our previous studies used the EYFP tag for image analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal3">[26]</xref> and cell tracking, but was generally limited to cells with nuclear protein localization. The present red tag allows automated analysis of cells with arbitrary EFYP protein localization. There was a need for tagging two proteins with mCherry for segmentation purposes; the cytoplasmic red tagged protein enabled segmentation of cells from background, while the stronger nuclear tag served both as a seed for each cell in the segmentation process and enabled segmentation of nucleus from cytoplasm. The library of CD-tagged proteins with a red tag currently includes over 1300 unique proteins and is detailed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dynamicproteomics.net" xlink:type="simple">http://www.dynamicproteomics.net</ext-link>.</p>

A seeded watershed segmentation algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Vincent1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Beucher1">[47]</xref> was carried out on the red fluorescent images using the strong fluorescence of the nuclei as seeds. Nuclei were seperated from cytoplasm using the sharp difference of fluorescence between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Tracking of cells was performed by analysing the movie from end to start and linking each segmented cell to the cell in the previous image with the closest centroid. Cell divisions were automatically detected by a sharp twofold drop in total fluorescence between consecutive images <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal3">[26]</xref>. Tracking, bleaching and image corrections are described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Sigal3">[26]</xref></p>

<title>Protein accumulation onset times</title>
<p>Protein accumulation onset was defined for each of the cells as the time at which protein level reached its minimum level. To compute the time delay between end of degradation to beginning of accumulation, the minimum level of each cell was subtracted from its profile. A threshold chosen to be 1 percent of the maximum mean protein levels was computed. For each cell the first and last time points in which the threshold was crossed were denoted as the end of degradation and beginning of accumulation phases, respectively. Results are robust to threshold levels between 0.03–3% of the maximum level.</p>

<title>Calibration of YFP fluorescence to protein molecules</title>
<p>Calibration between number of EYFP molecules and measured fluorescence levels was carried out using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Chen1">[48]</xref> for the protein YB1. The FCS specific setup is detailed at Kopito <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004901-Kopito1">[33]</xref>. Cells were grown on standard 1-×3-inch microscope slides and prior to measurement were covered by glass coverslips and sealed immediately with paraffin wax. Then laser illumination was calibrated to photon counts per YFP in the YB1 sample.(about 400 photons per molecule within illumination volume). Once calibrated, measurements were taken from the cytoplasm of ∼20 cells (cytoplasm concentrations are relatively constant throughout the cell cycle). Mean photon count in laser illumination volume (0.25 µm3) is 15,000 and equivalent to about 37 protein molecules. Using mean cell volume to be 20×20×10 µm and cytoplasm to constitute 2/3 of the cell volume and that protein amount in the cytoplasm is 1/5 of total protein level at end of cell cycle (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s002">Figure S2</xref>), sums up to ∼500,000 molecules in cell at end of cell cycle. Mean total fluorescence at end of cell cycle is ∼400,000 thus leading to ∼0.8 fluorescence counts per molecule.</p>
<p>A second method for calibration used purified protein standards in the following way: 5 µL of purified GFP solution containing ∼10<sup>12</sup> molecules of GFP were placed under a slide cover slip with diameter of 13 mm. Images with linearly increasing exposure times were taken in order to compute the gain of the mean pixel level. Number of GFP molecules per pixel was computed (∼7700) and compared to the mean pixel fluorescence (∼3000 fluorescence A.U. per 1000 msec exposure), and summed up to ∼0.4 fluorescence counts per molecule.</p>

<title>Estimation of of mRNA life time after cell division</title>
<p>Time-lapse movies were acquired for several hours in 2 ml RPMI medium. Then the medium was switched to 2 ml of medium containing 100 nM of α-amanitin and time –lapse movie acquisition was continued. Cells were manually chosen so that only cells that were in the accumulation stage and did not divide for 8 hours following drug adittion were used. To compare to theory, mean of data was fit to two functions. The first describing the mean behavior until the inhibitor becomes fully active (∼2 hrs) and the second from that stage allowing mRNA degradation rate to be obtained (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004901.s009">Text S1</xref>, part 2).</p>
