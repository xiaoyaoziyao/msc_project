        <p>The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, recommended by the World Health Organization, categories drugs into different classes according to their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. For a set of query compounds, how can we identify which ATC-class (or classes) they belong to? It is an important and challenging problem because the information thus obtained would be quite useful for drug development and utilization. By hybridizing the informations of chemical-chemical interactions and chemical-chemical similarities, a novel method was developed for such purpose. It was observed by the jackknife test on a benchmark dataset of 3,883 drug compounds that the overall success rate achieved by the prediction method was about 73% in identifying the drugs among the following 14 main ATC-classes: (1) alimentary tract and metabolism; (2) blood and blood forming organs; (3) cardiovascular system; (4) dermatologicals; (5) genitourinary system and sex hormones; (6) systemic hormonal preparations, excluding sex hormones and insulins; (7) anti-infectives for systemic use; (8) antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents; (9) musculoskeletal system; (10) nervous system; (11) antiparasitic products, insecticides and repellents; (12) respiratory system; (13) sensory organs; (14) various. Such a success rate is substantially higher than 7% by the random guess. It has not escaped our notice that the current method can be straightforwardly extended to identify the drugs for their 2<sup>nd</sup>-level, 3<sup>rd</sup>-level, 4<sup>th</sup>-level, and 5<sup>th</sup>-level ATC-classifications once the statistically significant benchmark data are available for these lower levels.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Nowadays, the <bold>A</bold>natomical <bold>T</bold>herapeutic <bold>C</bold>hemical (ATC) classification system, recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), is the most widely recognized classification system for drugs. This classification system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Accordingly, the ATC classification is very helpful for studying utilization of drugs and categorizing them according to different purposes, therapeutic properties, chemical and pharmacological properties (see Report of the WHO Expert Committee, 2005; World Health Organ Tech Rep, Ser:1–119). In the ATC classification system, drugs are classified into 14 main classes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/</ext-link>). In order to understand this kind of complicated classification system, some efforts have been made <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Dunkel1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Gurulingappa1">[2]</xref>. In a pioneer study, Gurulingappa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Gurulingappa1">[2]</xref> proposed a method to study the ATC-classification system by combining the information extraction and machine learning techniques. However, their method can be used to identify the drug compounds only within the class of “Cardiovascular System”, one of the 14 main ATC classes.</p>
      <p>During the past decade, many compound databases, such as KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Kanehisa1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Kanehisa2">[4]</xref>, have been established. From these databases many compounds and their properties can be acquired. Such abundant informations provide an opportunity to analyze ATC classification system in greater detail. Encouraged by the successes of using machine learning and data mining methods to investigate complicated problems in a variety of biological areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Cai1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Cai2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou3">[9]</xref>, the present study was initiated in an attempt to develop a powerful method by which one can identify query drugs compound among all their 14 posible main classes.</p>
      <p>According to a recent comprehensive review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou4">[10]</xref>, to establish a really useful statistical predictor for a biological system, we need to consider the following procedures: (i) construct or select a valid benchmark dataset to train and test the predictor; (ii) formulate the samples concerned with an effective mathematical expression that can truly reflect their intrinsic correlation with the target to be predicted; (iii) introduce or develop a powerful algorithm (or engine) to operate the prediction; (iv) properly perform cross-validation tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated accuracy of the predictor. Below, let us describe how to deal with these steps one by one.</p>

      <title>Materials and Methods</title>
      <p>Recently, the information of protein-protein interactions have been used for predicting various attributes of proteins (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Sharan1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Huang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Hu1">[13]</xref>), implying that interactive proteins are more likely to share common biological functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Sharan1">[11]</xref> than non-interactive ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Karaoz1">[14]</xref>. Likewise, it is more likely that two interactive drug compounds may have the similar biological function. Actually, it is generally accepted that compounds with similar physicochemical properties often involve in similar biological activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Dunkel1">[1]</xref>. Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that the interactive drugs may likely belong to the same ATC-class, and so do those drugs with similar structures. Based on such rational, let us construct the following benchmark to develop a new method for identifying the ATC-classes of drugs.</p>
      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>Benchmark Dataset</title>
        <p>The dataset for drugs was obtained from the public available database KEGG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Kanehisa1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Kanehisa2">[4]</xref> at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/medicus/drug/drug" xlink:type="simple">ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/medicus/drug/drug</ext-link> (June, 2011). There are totally 9,758 drugs. After excluding those without the information of ATC-codes, the remaining are 4,376 drug samples, from which further screening was performed to remove those without the information of both chemical-chemical interactions and chemical-chemical similarities. After the above winnowing procedures, we finally obtained the benchmark dataset <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> containing 3,883 drugs classified into 14 main ATC-classes, as can be formulated by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the subset for the 1<sup>st</sup> main ATC class called “Alimentary tract and metabolism”, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the subset for the 2<sup>nd</sup> main ATC class “Blood and blood forming organs”, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the subset for the 3<sup>rd</sup> main ATC class “Cardiovascular system”, and so forth (cf. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035254-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>); while <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the symbol for “union” in the set theory.

        <p>Likewise, based on the fact that the compounds with similar physicochemical properties often have the same biological activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Dunkel1">[1]</xref>, we can also use the information of chemical-chemical similarities as another feasible avenue to predict the ATC-class for a query drug. To realize this, let us first introduce how to use graphical representation to measure the similarity between two drug compounds.</p>
        <p>Graphical approaches can provide intuitive pictures and useful insights for studying and analyzing complicated biological systems, as demonstrated by many studies on a series of important biological topics (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou8">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Zhou1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou9">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou10">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Althaus1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou11">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Andraos1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou12">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Zhou2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou13">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Zhou3">[30]</xref>). Here, a special graphic approach was utilized to estimate the similarity of two compounds. Hattori <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Hattori1">[31]</xref> first proposed a means to measure the similarity of two compounds via their graph representations. Since each chemical structure can be easily represented by a 2D (two-dimensional) graph where vertices stand for atoms and edges for bonds between them, the similarity of two compounds can be estimated by the Jaccard coefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Jaccard1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Watson1">[33]</xref> based on their maximum common subgraph. The similarity scores between compounds by this method can be obtained from the website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/ligand-bin/search_compound" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.jp/ligand-bin/search_compound</ext-link>. According to the graphical method by Hattori <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Hattori1">[31]</xref>, given two drug compounds <italic>d</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub>2</sub>, their similarity score was denoted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. When the similarity score between <italic>d</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub>2</sub> does not exist in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/ligand-bin/search_compound" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.jp/ligand-bin/search_compound</ext-link>, their similarity was set as zero; <italic>i.e.</italic>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>Thus, the prediction method based on the chemical-chemical similarities can be formulated in a way almost completely parallel to that of the chemical-chemical interactions as done in the preceding section.</p>
        <p>Now, instead of Eq.6, we have<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e052" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>where the superscript and subscript “s” stands for the 1<sup>st</sup> letter of “similarity”, implying that the calculation is now based on “chemical-chemical similarity” instead of “chemical-chemical interaction” as done in <bold>Eq.6</bold>.</p>

        <title>Jackknife Cross-Validation</title>
        <p>In statistical prediction, the following three cross-validation methods are often used to examine the quality of a predictor: independent dataset test, subsampling (or k-fold crossover) test, and jackknife test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou14">[34]</xref>. However, of the three test methods, the jackknife test is deemed the least arbitrary that can always yield a unique result for a given benchmark dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou15">[35]</xref>. The reasons are as follows. (i) For the independent dataset test, although all the samples used to test a predictor are outside the training dataset used to train the prediction engine so as to exclude the “memory” effect or bias, the way of how to select the independent samples for testing the predictor could be quite arbitrary unless the number of independent samples is sufficiently large. This kind of arbitrariness might lead to completely different conclusions. For instance, a predictor achieving a higher success rate than the other for a given independent testing dataset might not able to keep so when tested by another independent testing dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou14">[34]</xref>. (ii) For the subsampling (or k-fold crossover) test, the concrete procedure usually used in literatures was the 5-fold, 7-fold or 10-fold cross-validation. The problem with this kind of subsampling test was that the number of possible selections in dividing a benchmark dataset would be an astronomical figure even for a very simple dataset, as elucidated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou15">[35]</xref> and demonstrated by Eqs.28–30 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou4">[10]</xref>. Therefore, in any practical subsampling cross-validation tests, only an extremely small fraction of the possible selections were taken into account. Since different selections would always yield different results even for a same benchmark dataset and a same predictor, the subsampling test could not avoid the arbitrariness either. A test method unable to generate a unique outcome should not be deemed as a good one. (iii) In the jackknife test, all the samples in the benchmark dataset will be singled out one-by-one and tested by the predictor trained by the remaining samples. During the process of jackknifing, both the training dataset and testing dataset are actually open, and each sample will be in turn moved between the two. The jackknife test can exclude the “memory” effect. Also, the arbitrariness problem as mentioned above for the independent dataset test and subsampling (or k-fold crossover) test can be avoided because the outcome obtained by the jackknife cross-validation is always unique for a given benchmark dataset. Accordingly, the jackknife test has been widely recognized and increasingly adopted by many investigators to examine the quality of various predictors (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Esmaeili1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Georgiou1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou16">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Mohabatkar1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Chou17">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Wu2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Gu1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Lin1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Mohabatkar2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Xiao1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Lin2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0035254-Wang1">[47]</xref>). Accordingly, in this study we are to use the jackknife test to examine the prediction quality as well.</p>

        <title>Accuracy Measurement</title>
        <p>For any given set of query drugs, we can obtain a series of candidate ATC-classes using the aforementioned prediction methods. Ranked by the likelihood according to their descending order, the prediction accuracy can be defined as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e054" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>CP<sub>j</sub></italic> denotes the number of drugs whose <italic>j</italic>-th order predicted ATC-class is one of the true ATC-class, and <italic>N</italic> denotes the total number of query drugs whose ATC-classes are to be identified. According to such a definition, the result of higher <italic>AC<sub>j</sub></italic> with smaller <italic>j</italic> or lower <italic>AC<sub>j</sub></italic> with larger <italic>j</italic> indicates that the predicted hits are more concentrated meaning a better prediction.

        <p>The average number of ATC-classes for the <italic>N</italic> query drugs is defined as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e055" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>T<sub>i</sub></italic> is the number of ATC-classes for the <italic>i</italic>-th query drug.

        <p>The average number of ATC-classes for the drugs in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was 1.24 (see <bold>Eq.12</bold>), and hence we have <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<bold>Eq.14</bold>), meaning that the first 2-order predictions should be taken into account. Substituting these data into <bold>Eq.13</bold>, we obtained the overall success rate by the 1<sup>st</sup> two orders predictions for the 2,138 drugs in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by the interaction-based method (<bold>Eq.6</bold>) was 71.26%, while that by the similarity-based method (<bold>Eq.10</bold>) was only 43.69%, indicating that the interaction-based method is superior to the similarity-based method in identifying the ATC-classes of drugs. That is why in the integrated method the first step was to use the interaction method (<bold>Eq.6</bold>) to identify the ATC-classes for any query drugs. When, and only when no meaningful result was obtained by the interaction-based method, was the similarity-based method (<bold>Eq.10</bold>) used as a backup to continue the prediction (see the Section of “Prediction by Integrating the Interaction-Based and Similarity-Based Methods”).</p>

        <p>Shown in the 4<sup>th</sup> column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035254-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref> are the results obtained by the integrated method in identifying the 14 main ATC classes for the 3,883 drugs in the benchmark dataset <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As we can see there, the 1<sup>st</sup>-order prediction accuracy was 72.55%. The average numbers of ATC-classes for the drugs in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <bold>Eq.12</bold>). Thus, it follows according to <bold>Eq.14</bold> that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, meaning that the first 2-order predictions should be taken into consideration. Substituting these data into <bold>Eq.13</bold>, we obtained the overall success rate by the first two orders predictions for the drugs in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035254.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was 73.25%.</p>
        <p>These results indicate that the integrated method performed quite well in identifying drugs among their 14 main ATC-classes, and that more attention should be paid to the results hit by the first two order predictions because they covered more than 70% of the true ATC-classes.</p>
        <p>Finally, it is instructive to point out that although the above demonstrations were given for identifying query drug compounds among their main (or 1<sup>st</sup> level) classification, the method developed here can be straightforwardly extended to cover the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> or any lower-level classification as long as the corresponding statistically significant datasets for training the predictor are available.</p>
