      <abstract>
        <p>Prediction of secondary site mutations that reinstate mutated p53 to normalcy has been the focus of intense research in the recent past owing to the fact that p53 mutants have been implicated in more than half of all human cancers and restoration of p53 causes tumor regression. However laboratory investigations are more often laborious and resource intensive but computational techniques could well surmount these drawbacks. In view of this, we formulated a novel approach utilizing computational techniques to predict the transcriptional activity of multiple site (one-site to five-site) p53 mutants. The optimal MCC obtained by the proposed approach on prediction of one-site, two-site, three-site, four-site and five-site mutants were 0.775,0.341,0.784,0.916 and 0.655 respectively, the highest reported thus far in literature. We have also demonstrated that 2D and 3D features generate higher prediction accuracy of p53 activity and our findings revealed the optimal results for prediction of p53 status, reported till date. We believe detection of the secondary site mutations that suppress tumor growth may facilitate better understanding of the relationship between p53 structure and function and further knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and biological activity of p53, a targeted source for cancer therapy. We expect that our prediction methods and reported results may provide useful insights on p53 functional mechanisms and generate more avenues for utilizing computational techniques in biological data analysis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Prediction of proteins, structures and methods to re-establish the normal state of activity in a biological structure is a significant task with profound social impact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Brachmann1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-May1">[2]</xref>.Earlier studies on rescue mutants have detailed information reporting the results obtained using genetic strategies and p53 assays in the yeast and mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Brachmann1">[1]</xref>. A number of human malignancies including lung, breast, head and neck, colorectal, pancreatic and gastric cancers confirmed the presence of high frequency of p53 mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Brachmann1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Harris2">[6]</xref>. It was also reported that many malignancies detected at a young age could be successfully eradicated even in highly advanced stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Brachmann1">[1]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Harris2">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Harris3">[7]</xref>. Moreover re-establishing wild type p53 function would benefit a large sector of cancer victims by providing ample scope for therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Harris3">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-International1">[8]</xref>. In-vitro experimentation of each mutation site and patient record is a labour- and resource –intensive task consuming voluminous quantity of time, expertise and capital <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Brachmann1">[1]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Harris3">[7]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Hock1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Schmitt1">[10]</xref>. In view of this, we believed there was adequate justification to carry out a detailed exploration on the use of computational techniques to investigate the occurrence and activity of p53 mutants that could further lead to novel measures of developing therapeutic remedies from the structure and functional mechanism of cancer rescue mutations.</p>
      <p>P53, also known as TP53 or tumor protein or tumor suppressor p53 is a tetramer multi domain transcription factor that has an essential role in maintaining the genomic integrity of the cell by controlling the cell cycle and inhibiting the formation of tumours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Brachmann1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-May1">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Bioinformatics1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Soussi1">[13]</xref>. Wild-type p53 negatively regulates cell growth and division, whereas p53 mutants do not suppress cell growth and in some cases promote the growth of tumour cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Baroni1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Hainaut1">[16]</xref>. In nearly half of all human cancers, this inactivation was an obvious consequence of mutations in the p53 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Hainaut1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-The1">[18]</xref>. However previous research and reports have affirmed the fact that loss of p53 activity due to missense mutations at the core DNA Binding Domain (DBD) could be restored by second site suppressor mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Brachmann1">[1]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Kern1">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Gasco1">[17]</xref>. Considering the cost of labour and resources involved in in-vitro experimentation of p53 mutations, it was highly essential and imperative to formulate computational strategies and techniques to analyze the consequences of diverse mutations and detect pertinent features that reinstated inactive (non-functional) mutations to active (functional) state.</p>
      <p>Previous work on p53 mutant transcriptional activity prediction is attributed to Mathe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Mathe1">[19]</xref>who reported a Residual Score Profile (RSP) predicted transactivation accuracy varying from 64.2% to 78.5% using decision –tree models on missense mutants obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Recent work on multiple-site p53 transcriptional activity was carried out by Huang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang1">[20]</xref> in which the authors used eight types of features to represent the mutants and then selected the optimal prediction features based on the maximum relevance, minimum redundancy (mRMR) approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Peng1">[21]</xref>, and Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) method. The Mathew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Baldi1">[22]</xref> obtained by using Nearest Neighbour (NN) algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Jacob1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Jacob2">[24]</xref> and jack-knife cross validation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Baldi1">[22]</xref>for one-, two-, three- and four-site p53 mutants were 0.678, 0.314, 0.705, and 0.907, respectively. Their investigation however did not include five-site and six-site p53 mutants and the authors have not reported on the performance of other standard feature selection or classification algorithms.</p>
      <p>In order to portray the impact of applying computational techniques in predicting clinical outcomes, the current investigation focussed on the recent article by Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang1">[20]</xref> published in this journal that reported the MCC of Nearest Neighbor algorithm on predicting p53 mutant transcriptional activity by means of Incremental Feature Selection with the mRMR method. We chose this paper for three main reasons. First, their work is the most recent and the data is publicly available to replicate the work. Second, p53 mutants are a great challenge to both biological and computer science researchers because of their imbalanced class distributions and voluminous records. Third, their work presented both biological and computational advancement that led researchers to focus on specific regions in the p53 core domain that significantly influenced p53 activity. However their results did not support a comparative study of classifier performance and focussed only on the predictive power of the NN algorithm. Moreover they had introduced a novel predictor approach to predict all types of mutation records irrespective of the nature of records (class distribution), number of instances and type of mutation (independent/co-occurring). We believed it was quite unlikely that a single predictive technique be able to classify well such diverse nature of data.</p>
      <p>This research was dedicated to formulating novel computational approaches to predict and classify the transcriptional activity of multiple site (one-site, two-site, three-site, four-site, and five-site) p53 mutants using optimal set of predictive features that generated higher MCC and accuracy in prediction compared to previous work. Our method placed emphasis on the 2D structure surface of the p53 mutants and the 3D structural changes of the tumor protein, that have been reported to be highly essential in deciding the p53 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Peng1">[21]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Wang1">[25]</xref>. In this work we introduced three novel predictor methods. The first method targeted the detection of single independent p53 mutation activity while the second and third approaches were found suitable to predict the activity of co-occurring mutations that combined with the one-site p53 mutants. The second approach generated higher MCC in prediction with both a very large/small number of instances and imbalanced class distribution of records while the third approach served well with fewer instances and balanced records. To maintain brevity, we will call the first, second and third approaches as Independent Predictor (IP), Imbalanced Mutation Predictor (IMP) and Balanced Predictor (BP) methods respectively. We utilized the feature sets obtained by the CFS Subset Evaluator commonly for all the approaches. The features extracted by this technique were passed in an incremental manner to the classifiers to determine the prediction accuracy. Three benchmark classification algorithms viz, Bayesian Network Learning algorithm and Ensemble classifiers viz, AdaBoost Learning using Decision Stump (ABDS) algorithm and Random Committee using Random Tree (RCRT) algorithm showed improved results in prediction. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using Jack-knife cross-validation technique based on the following scores: Mathews Correlation Coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, Accuracy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, Sensitivity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and Specificity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We also establish the fact that the utilization of 2D and 3D structural details of the p53 mutants showed higher prediction accuracy in detecting the p53 mutant transcriptional activity. It has also been validated by analysis of the feature sets that 2D structure features constituted a substantial portion of the optimal feature sets and played a pivotal role in transcriptional activity prediction of p53 site-specific mutations.</p>
      <p>Previous, recent and related research on p53 mutants, Cancer and computational approaches have reported that the following requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Wang1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Chou1">[26]</xref> be met for a successful predictor for biological data. They are stated to be the need for an authenticate, standard dataset to train and test the predictor, formulation of suitable statistical/scientific expressions that rightly signalled the inherent association of the predictor features with the target attribute, the existence of an algorithm or system that performed the prediction followed by the statement of evaluation measures to rank the estimated accuracy of the predictor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Chou2">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Chou3">[28]</xref>. We deal with the aforementioned methodology in the following sections.</p>

Biophysical models of mutant p53 proteins yielded the features to predict the transcriptional activity. All class labels were determined via in vivo assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Danziger2">[31]</xref>. There were a total of 5409 attributes per instance. The attribute description is provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055401.s001">Table S1</xref>. Attributes named V1–V4826 represented 2D electrostatic and surface based features. Attributes V4827–V5408 represented 3D distance based features. The target attribute was denoted by V5409 that carried two possible values to represent p53 transcriptional activity (Active/Inactive). The dataset initially comprised of 16772 p53 mutant records. This was primarily analyzed to filter the records that could not be encoded (records held missing values specific to 2D/3D structural properties). This resulted in the removal of 180 instances thus reducing the total size of the data to 16592 records. The data was further partitioned to identify the structural features pertaining to specific secondary-site mutations resulting in 5 subsets as depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055401-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

Each node was associated with a probability function that took in as input a particular set of values for the node's parent variables and gave the probability of the variable represented by the node <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-O1">[69]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Friedman2">[70]</xref>.

        <title>Jack-knife Cross-Validation Method</title>
        <p>Statistical prediction methods generally involved verification of the predictor performance to estimate their effectiveness in practical applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Geisser1">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Kohavi1">[73]</xref>. Cross-validation (rotation estimation), was a technique that assessed how the results of a statistical analysis could generalize to an independent data set. It was a way to predict the fit of a model to a hypothetical validation set when an explicit validation set was not available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Geisser1">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Kohavi1">[73]</xref>. In <italic>k</italic>-fold cross-validation, the original sample was randomly partitioned into <italic>k</italic> equal size subsamples. Of the <italic>k</italic> subsamples, a single subsample was retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining (<italic>k</italic> –1) subsamples were used as training data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Kohavi1">[73]</xref>. The cross-validation process was then repeated <italic>k</italic> times with each of the <italic>k</italic> subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The <italic>k</italic> results from the folds were later averaged to produce a single estimation. In this study, the jack-knife cross validation method was used for validation since previous reports have stated it to be least arbitrary in nature and widely recognized by researchers to assess the performance of predictors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang1">[20]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Geisser1">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Kohavi1">[73]</xref>. In jack-knife cross-validation, each one of the statistical samples in the training dataset was in turn singled out as a tested sample and the predictor was trained by the remaining samples. During the jack-knifing process, both the training dataset and testing dataset were actually open, and a statistical sample moved from one set to the other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang1">[20]</xref>. However since the second site mutations held voluminous records, in order to reduce the memory effects and computational complexity we used the three-fold cross-validation technique to rate and compare the performance of the prediction techniques. Moreover the analysis of the second site p53 mutation dataset exposed heavy imbalance of the active and inactive records. In view of this, the following indexes were adopted to test our proposed predictors.<disp-formula id="pone.0055401.e019"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e019" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pone.0055401.e020"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e020" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pone.0055401.e021"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e021" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pone.0055401.e022"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e022" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(13)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>reflected the Mathews Correlation Coefficient; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>reflected the accuracy, i.e., the rate of correctly predicted mutation activity; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reflected the sensitivity, i.e., the rate of inactive records correctly predicted; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055401.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reflected the specificity, i.e., the rate of active records that were correctly predicted.</p>

        <title>CFS Subset Attribute Evaluation Results</title>
        <p>The feature set size filtered by the attribute evaluator techniques are tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055401-t002">Table 2</xref>. The CFS Subset Evaluator, Information Gain, Gain Ratio and Symmetric Uncertainty Attribute Evaluators were compared in this work. It is evident from the results that the minimal feature set was generated by the CFS Subset Evaluator. Hence focus was placed on exploiting this technique to build predictor models with the minimal set of predictive features. Moreover the rank and score of the predictors generated by the other predictor models were more often negligible and hence their contribution to the prediction was questionable. Combining the CFS Subset Evaluator with the feature ranking methods was found to be very time-consuming and computationally expensive since the data spanned large number of attributes. On smaller datasets, the results showed only marginal variation. In the case of the site –two mutation data, the CFS subset Evaluator was applied on subsets of the mutation records with the 2D and 3D features being considered separately for analysis in order to speed up the execution process. Since the evaluator method filtered attributes with respect to its contribution to the target class and relevance to the other attributes, the cumulative results of the subset data were taken as the minimal feature set for the site-two predictor model. The CFS Subset Attribute Evaluator results for site-specific mutant data are provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055401.s002">Table S2</xref>.</p>

        <title>Performance Comparison of Proposed Predictors with Other Methods</title>
        <p>We investigated the performance of Bayesian and Ensemble learning methods and found that a single technique did not generate optimal results on all site-specific mutation data with the CFS Subset attribute evaluator methods. So we attempted to identify the specific combination of attribute evaluator and prediction algorithm that generated optimal results with minimal features. The improved performance of our work was validated by the results of the previous work on predicting site-specific p53 mutant activity by Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang1">[20]</xref>. The comparative performance of the classification algorithms on site-specific p53 mutation data is given as <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055401-t004">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055401-t005">Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055401-t006">Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055401-t007">Table 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055401-t008">Table 8</xref> for one-, two-, three-, and four- and five-site mutation data. The Information Gain, Gain Ratio and Symmetric Uncertainty Attribute Evaluators used the Ranking method to generate the attribute evaluation results. With respect to the Independent and Balanced Predictor models, we considered all the ranked values for comparison. However for the two-site mutation data, since the features spanned large dimensions we set the information gain score to 0.02, gain ratio and symmetric uncertainty score to 0.05 to select the ranked attributes and the comparison among the methods was recorded accordingly. All the performance parameters were obtained by Jack-knife cross-validation approach for one-site, three-site, four-site and five-site mutants. However in order to reduce the memory effects and computational complexity, we used the three-fold cross-validation approach to compare the performance of two-site predictor models.</p>

        <p>The Independent Predictor (IP) model utilized the CFS Subset Evaluator followed by the ABDS algorithm to obtain the optimal MCC. The algorithm was executed with default parameters with the number of iterations set to 100 to avoid over fitting of the data and obtain reliable results. Though the other attribute evaluator methods also showed promising results, the size of the feature set was taken into consideration to choose the most optimal approach. However the proposed approach equalled or bettered the other compared methods as depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055401.s003">Table S3</xref> using Incremental Feature Selection. The Imbalanced Mutation Predictor (IMP) model utilized the CFS Subset Evaluator with RCRT algorithm to obtain the optimal MCC. The algorithm was run with default parameters and evaluated by 3-fold cross validation for two-site mutation data on account of large number of instances and increased computational complexity. The execution time of Jack-knife cross validation on site-two mutation data with default parameters was 24 hours and 17 minutes to validate the RCRT approach and reported an MCC of 0.293 with 52 features. The same predictor model was applied to five-site mutation data and generated an MCC of 0.655 with the smallest feature set comprising of 1 feature. However attributes generated by the Information Gain, Gain Ratio and Symmetric Uncertainty Attribute Evaluators generated a high MCC of 1 using ABDS algorithm with default parameters on the five-site mutation data. Since the results appeared to over fit the data on account of very small number of instances, the imbalanced predictor model was believed to be a more reliable technique. The Balanced Predictor (BP) model utilized the CFS Subset Evaluator with Bayesian Network Learning Algorithm and obtained an optimal MCC of 0.784 with 30 features on the three-site mutation data and an optimal MCC of 0.916 with 15 features on the site-four mutation data. The results were validated by Jack-knife cross-validation method. The feature set analysis of site-specific mutants is discussed below.</p>

        <title>Site –Wise Feature Set Analysis</title>
        <p>On analysis of the feature sets that generated optimal results, it was concluded that the 2D features played a dominating role when compared to the 3D features and hence an in-depth analysis of 2D structural properties could provide novel insights into p53 functional mechanism. Site-1, Site-3 and Site-5 mutation data attained the optimal MCC with the inclusion of 2D features alone. However site-2 and site-4 mutation data attained the highest MCC only on inclusion of the 3D predictor features. We also attempted to explore the 2D and 3D features that were found relevant for the different site-wise subsets representing p53 transcriptional activity using structural properties and identify if there existed any common relevant features that deserved further attention. Hence we made use of visualization tool NodeXL available at [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nodexl.codeplex.com/releases/view/96383" xlink:type="simple">http://nodexl.codeplex.com/releases/view/96383</ext-link>] that generated the site-wise feature-activity relevance graph depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055401-g003">Figure 3</xref> to represent the relevant features reported for each site. The visualization of the p53 site-wise feature relevance graph is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055401-g003">Figure 3</xref>. We used the top 10 features for the site-5 mutation data. The graph clearly depicts that not a single feature was commonly relevant to any of the sites. The features were mutually exclusive and hence we believed it was acceptable that any further investigations of the p53 functional activity would certainly warrant a site-wise analysis of structure and function.</p>

        <title>Comparison to Previous Work</title>
        <p>The most recent and previously reported results of predicting p53 mutants transcriptional activity was stated by Huang et al., in 2011. The comparative performance to the previous work is depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055401-t009">Table 9</xref>. One-site mutation was optimally predicted at 0.678 MCC with 8 features whereas the proposed predictor model predicts at 0.775 MCC with 7 features while two-site mutation data was predicted at an optimal 0.314 MCC with 50 features while our approach attained an optimal prediction of 0.341 with 52 features. However they have excluded the memory effects of running Jack-knife cross validation on the 16376 records. Our results were drawn with 3-fold cross-validation that is reported to be a benchmark validation technique for large datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Jaynes1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Kotsiantis1">[51]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Kohavi1">[73]</xref>. For the three-site mutation data, the proposed approach generated an optimal MCC of 0.784 with 30 features while the previous optimal MCC of 0.705 included 282 features. The four-site mutation data was predicted at 0.916 by our proposed approach with 15 features while the previous approach reported an optimal MCC of 0.907 with 25 features. Our findings agree with the previous results stating 2D features to be the major contributory factors to p53 mutant transcriptional activity prediction. The MCC and accuracy parameters of the predictor methods were found to be highly irrelevant in estimation of predictor performance of unbalanced datasets. Since this research was oriented towards both balanced and unbalanced datasets, MCC was utilized as the primary criterion for ranking the predictor models.</p>

        <title>CFS Subset Vs mRMR Method</title>
        <p>Previous work on prediction of p53 transcriptional activity made use of the Maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) approach in order to select the features most relevant to the target class and least redundant to one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang1">[20]</xref>. The mRMR method ranked features based on the Mutual Information criterion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang2">[77]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang4">[79]</xref>. In this study however we chose to investigate other possible feature selection algorithms for three main reasons: (i) Performance of the mRMR method has already been discussed in p53 transcriptional activity prediction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang1">[20]</xref>whereas this is the first study on utilization of CFS Subset evaluator and the other ranking methods (Information Gain, Gain Ratio and Symmetric Uncertainty) in p53 activity prediction (ii) Human intervention is required in deciding the feature subset size for the mRMR method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Peng1">[21]</xref>whereas in the CFS Subset method, the default parameters of Best First Search with a search termination threshold of five, generated the appropriate and relevant feature subset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Waikato1">[35]</xref> (iii) It is evident from the work on p53 transcriptional activity prediction by Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang1">[20]</xref> where roughly 100 to 1000 ranked features from the mRMR method were included for the Incremental Feature Selection process to obtain optimal results whereas in this investigation the feature subset size returned by the CFS Subset Evaluator on the same datasets was of considerably smaller dimension thus entailing less human effort and time while generating improved results. Moreover we believed the CFS Subset Evaluator would certainly prove to be an effective algorithm in other biological data prediction also and hence propose a reasonably acceptable alternative to the mRMR method. Further extensions to this work would involve investigating the use of this novel methodology in DNA and protein sequence analysis.</p>

        <title>Influence of Structure on P53 Function</title>
        <p>This research has clearly revealed the contribution of the structural features in predicting p53 transcriptional activity. Previous authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang1">[20]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Wang1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Chou1">[26]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Danziger1">[30]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Zakeri1">[44]</xref> have stated that structural features played a dominant role in p53 status prediction. However this study has clearly portrayed through the use of computational techniques that 2D properties played the most contributing role in P3 transcriptional activity prediction. A characteristic feature of the p53 mutational map is the frequency of missense point mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Joerger1">[74]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Kato1">[75]</xref>. Structural studies have revealed a higher concentration of amino acid residues pertaining to the mutation hot spots of p53 within the central region (residues 102–292), encoding the central DNA binding domain of the protein, and a trivial number of p53 mutations in the regulatory domains (N terminus, residues 1–99; C terminus, residues 301–393) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Joerger1">[74]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Bai1">[76]</xref>. This drives research focus towards concluding that intense analysis of p53 structure could reveal yet unknown facts on p53 activity thus leading to novel therapeutic solutions.</p>

        <title>Rewards of Computational Strategies</title>
        <p>Previous work on p53 Mutants and related studies have brought to light the hurdles encountered in in-vitro experimentation with mutation data in view of the resources, labour and time involved, but with irresolute rewards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-May1">[2]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Harris2">[6]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Soussi1">[13]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Hainaut1">[16]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Huang1">[20]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Danziger1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Danziger3">[32]</xref>. On the contrary, computational strategies and algorithms expend comparatively less time, resources and labour with a clear idea of expected end results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Mathe1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Peng1">[21]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Wang1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Chou3">[28]</xref>. The broad goal of this work was to provide an influential assessment of the functional activity of p53 cancer mutants and their secondary-site suppressor mutations through the use of computational techniques. A functional census of suppressor mutations for p53 cancer mutants was believed to appreciably further existing knowledge of p53 rescue mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Danziger3">[32]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Joerger1">[74]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055401-Bai1">[76]</xref>. Knowledge of possible regions of the p53 core domain that generated stability when altered provided insights in detecting probable alteration sites for small molecules. The methodology could be generalized to other mutational systems where mutants needed to be classified as functional/non-functional. Moreover computational classifiers that predicted mutant function would allow experimentalists to map structure/function relationships for proteins in other mutation-related diseases.</p>
        <p>With the advances in technology and their applications in the field of biology and medicine influencing the focus of research in remarkable ways, we believed research and analysis of the effects of computational methods on biological data analysis was certainly an essential breakthrough. However a limiting factor in computational analysis was the measure of time spent on preparing biological data for process on software tools. Efficient data pre-processing techniques specific to biological data could spur great opportunities for further investigation in the field of Bioinformatics and Computer Science.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>Intense research on p53, its structure, function and therapeutic strengths has drawn the attention of researchers from varied domains that include medical science, technology and informatics. This research was focused on revealing the significance of computational techniques in predicting the most optimal set of structural features that contributed predominantly to designating the nature of p53 transcriptional activity. We compared the performance of four feature evaluator and three classification techniques to determine the optimal set of features that predicted p53 activity with higher MCC. Our findings revealed the optimal MCC in prediction of p53 transcriptional activity with the most predictive feature set for each site-specific mutation subsets. Moreover visualization of the site-specific relevant features indicated that the contributing features were mutually exclusive for each site and appeared only on a section of the mutation sites. This could be attributed to the fact that unselected mutations contributed nothing to the p53 activity while selected features played the crucial role in regulation of p53 activity. We also warrant the fact that the 2D structural properties deserved more attention and further analysis of their influence on p53 mutations could reveal latent facts on the underlying mechanism of p53 and provide novel and informative insights into p53 transcriptional activity and their restoration.</p>
