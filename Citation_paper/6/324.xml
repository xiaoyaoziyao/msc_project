<abstract>
<p>Viral sewage metagenomics is a novel field of study used for surveillance, epidemiological studies, and evaluation of waste water treatment efficiency. In raw sewage human waste is mixed with household, industrial and drainage water, and virus particles are, therefore, only found in low concentrations. This necessitates a step of sample concentration to allow for sensitive virus detection. Additionally, viruses harbor a large diversity of both surface and genome structures, which makes universal viral genomic extraction difficult. Current studies have tackled these challenges in many different ways employing a wide range of viral concentration and extraction procedures. However, there is limited knowledge of the efficacy and inherent biases associated with these methods in respect to viral sewage metagenomics, hampering the development of this field. By the use of next generation sequencing this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of four commonly applied viral concentrations techniques (precipitation with polyethylene glycol, organic flocculation with skim milk, monolithic adsorption filtration and glass wool filtration) and extraction methods (Nucleospin RNA XS, QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, NucliSENS<sup>®</sup> miniMAG<sup>®</sup>, or PowerViral<sup>®</sup> Environmental RNA/DNA Isolation Kit) to determine the viriome in a sewage sample. We found a significant influence of concentration and extraction protocols on the detected viriome. The viral richness was largest in samples extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or PowerViral<sup>®</sup> Environmental RNA/DNA Isolation Kit. Highest viral specificity were found in samples concentrated by precipitation with polyethylene glycol or extracted with Nucleospin RNA XS. Detection of viral pathogens depended on the method used. These results contribute to the understanding of method associated biases, within the field of viral sewage metagenomics, making evaluation of the current literature easier and helping with the design of future studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Within raw sewage, feces, urine and other biological fluids from thousands of humans are mixed together with food and household waste, industrial waste, and runoff water. Every individual, who is connected to the drainage system, contributes with his or hers own microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref001">1</xref>], including infecting pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref002">2</xref>]. This makes sewage an attractive matrix for epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref003">3</xref>], microbial source tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref004">4</xref>], and for controlling the efficacy of pathogen removal in wastewater treatment plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref006">6</xref>]. Sewage has been shown to harbor a diverse viral population including enteric, respiratory and oncogenic viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref007">7</xref>]. The high viral diversity and the continuous mutation of viral species makes identification with traditional methods difficult and time consuming, therefore many studies have turned to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches instead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref009">9</xref>]. Metagenomic sequencing of the virus associated nucleic acids is considered to be an unbiased approach enabling the detection of all known viral species, as well as the discovery of novel and emergent species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref010">10</xref>]. Three main challenges exist for viral sewage metagenomics. First, only a small fraction of the total nucleic acids are of known viral origin, hence mechanical and enzymatic viral purification is often needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref009">9</xref>]. Second, the low abundance of viral particles in the samples requires the use of viral concentration methods prior to nucleic acid extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref011">11</xref>] and is often combined with subsequent random DNA amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref012">12</xref>]. Third, the nucleic acid extraction procedure has to cover the large variety in viral structures and genome types. To overcome these biases, different methods to concentrate viruses from water samples have been developed, including: polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref008">8</xref>], FeCl<sub>3</sub> precipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref013">13</xref>], skimmed milk flocculation (SMF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref014">14</xref>], glass wool filtration (GW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref015">15</xref>] or monolithic adsorption filtration (MAF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref016">16</xref>]. The influence of concentration method on viral recovery has been evaluated on sea water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref017">17</xref>], spiked tap water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref018">18</xref>] and raw sewage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref019">19</xref>], cautioning of method associated biases. To our knowledge, no major comparison studies using metagenomics have been performed with sewage water.</p>
<p>Biases caused by nucleic acid extraction kits have been well documented for both bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref021">21</xref>] and viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref023">23</xref>]. In addition, contaminants have been found to be ubiquitous in some extraction kits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref024">24</xref>] and laboratory reagents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref025">25</xref>], potentially giving rise to false positive results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref027">27</xref>]. A better understanding of specific method associated biases, in respect to viral wastewater metagenomics, would make evaluation of the current literature easier, and help guide future studies.</p>
<p>In this study we evaluated four previously published concentration methods, PEG, MAF, SMF, and GW, as well as four extraction kits, Nucleospin RNA XS (NUC), QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIA), NucliSENS<sup>®</sup> miniMAG<sup>®</sup> (MIN), or PowerViral<sup>®</sup> Environmental RNA/DNA Isolation Kit (POW), for wastewater viral metagenomics, in a full factorial design resulting in 16 combinations of procedures. Aspects studied included viral community composition, viral selectiveness, viral richness, viral pathogen detection, and viral contaminants. Extracted nucleotides were amplified with PCR and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform.</p>

<title>Sample collection, spiking and pooling</title>
<p>In July 2015 raw sewage (130 L) was collected at the waste water treatment plant BIOFOS Lynetten in Copenhagen, Denmark, receiving waste water from about 550,000 inhabitants. Approval was granted from BIOFOS Lynettefællesskabet A/S before sampling. The sewage was mixed thoroughly in a single container and spiked to a concentration of 1.74×10<sup>8</sup> RT-PCR units/L of murine norovirus (MNV) (kindly provided by Dr Virgin, Washington University School of Medicine, USA), and 2.13×10<sup>9</sup> genome copies/L of human adenovirus 35 (HAdV). The sample was mixed for 5 min before aliquoted and stored at—20°C until further processing.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Concentration methods</title>
<p>Four different methods were used to concentrate virions from the sewage samples: protein precipitation with PEG, organic flocculation with SMF and filtration with positively charged filters, MAF, or GW. All concentration methods were done in triplicate together with a negative control using sterile molecular grade water (VWR—Bie &amp; Berntsen, Søborg, Denmark).</p>

<title>PEG</title>
<p>The PEG protocol was based on the procedure as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref008">8</xref>]. Initially, 25 mL of glycin buffer (0.05 M glycine, 3% beef extract, pH 9.6) was added to 200 mL of sewage and mixed, to detach virions bound to organic material. The sample was then centrifuged at 8,000×g for 30 min, and the collected supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm polyethersulfone (PES) membrane (Jet Biofil, Guangzhou, China) to remove bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Viruses were precipitated from the supernatant by incubation with PEG 8000 (80 g/L) and NaCl (17.5 g/L) during agitation (100 rpm) overnight at 4°C, followed by centrifugation for 90 min at 13,000×g. The resulting viral-containing pellet was eluted in 1 mL phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and stored at -80°C until further processing.</p>

<title>MAF</title>
<p>The principle of the MAF adsorption/elution method was based on the procedure as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref018">18</xref>]. Monolithic discs, diameter 3.86 cm and height 1.0 cm, were synthesized by polymerization of polyglycerol-3-glycidyl ether (Ipox chemicals, Laupheim, Germany). An 80:20 mixture of toluene and tert-buthyl methyl ether was used as porogen to create monoliths with a pore size of ca. 20 μm. After synthesis, functionalization was performed by recirculating 10% diethylamine in 50% ethanol at 60°C through the monolithic disks for 3 h to create positively charged diethylaminoethyl groups on the pore surface. Afterwards the monoliths were rinsed with ultrapure water and stored at 4°C until further use. One liter of raw sewage was filtrated through a MAF disc (Microarray and Bioseparation Group of the Institute of Hydrochemistry, Technical University of Munich, Germany) assembled as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref028">28</xref>]. Viruses were eluted from the filter by soaking 2×2 min in a total of 20 mL high salt buffer (1.5 M NaCl, 0.05 M HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) buffer, pH 7). The eluate was further concentrated to 3 mL by 100 kDa Amicon ultra centrifugation filters (Merck Millipore, Cork, Ireland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The viral concentrate was stored at -80°C until further processing.</p>

<title>SMF</title>
<p>Organic flocculation with skimmed milk was based on the procedure as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref007">7</xref>]. In brief, 100 mL pre flocculated skimmed milk solution (1% (w/v) skimmed milk powder (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA), 3.2% (w/w) sea salts (Sigma Aldrich Chemie GMBH, Steinheim, Germany)) at pH 3.5 was added to 10 L of acidified (using HCl to pH 3.5) raw sewage and mixed for 8 h. Flocculants were allowed to sediment for 8 h, and centrifuged at 8,000×g for 40 min. The pelleted viral concentrate was suspended in 15 mL phosphate buffer (1:2 (v/v) mixture of 0.2 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and 0.2 M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). The phosphate suspension was eluted in 30 mL 0.25 M glycine buffer (pH 9.5) with slow agitation for 45 min at 4°C. Suspended solids were separated by centrifugation at 8,000×g for 40 min at 4°C. The sample was neutralized to pH 7 by adding 1 M HCl. Virions present in the supernatant were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 90,000×g for 90 min (Sorvall Discovery 90SE) at 4°C and suspended in 2 mL PBS. The viral concentrate was stored at -80°C until further processing.</p>

<title>GW</title>
<p>The glass wool filters were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref029">29</xref>]. Sodocalcic glass wool (15 g) (Ouest Isol, Alizay, France) was packed into a PVC tube with the density of 0.11 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and pretreated with the following solutions, 100 mL NaOH (1 M) for 15 min, 1 L sterile distilled water, 100 mL HCl (1 M) for 15 min, and 1 L sterile distilled water. Samples of raw sewage (4 L) were filtered through the glass wool column. Viruses were eluted by incubating 100 mL elution buffer (3% beef extract, 0.5 M glycine, pH 9.5) for 15 min. Secondary concentration was done by PEG precipitation (as above) to a final volume of 1 mL.</p>

<title>Bioinformatic analyses</title>
<p>The distribution of viral species was determined using MGmapper software version 2.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MGmapper/" xlink:type="simple">https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MGmapper/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref031">31</xref>]. The MGmapper tool follows three main steps: quality assessment of the raw reads, mapping of reads to the reference databases, and post-processing of mapping results. Quality assessment was done using cutadapt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref035">35</xref>] which performs common adapter removal, trimming of the low-quality ends from reads with a minimum Phred quality score of 20, and later discards reads that are shorter than 40 bp. Later, already trimmed pair-end reads were aligned to a pre-defined set of reference sequence databases using bwa mem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref036">36</xref>] ver. 0.7.7-r441 with default settings. In this study, reads were mapped against three viral reference databases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170199.s006">S2 Table</xref>): whole genomes virus sequences (Virus) and viral sequences extracted from nt database (Virus_nt), obtained from Genbank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/</ext-link>), as well as Vipr database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245011" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245011</ext-link>). Samtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref037">37</xref>] were used to remove singletons and filter reads where neither a read nor its mate is mapped. Reads were mapped in best-mode, meaning that mapping was performed against all databases, simultaneously, and later for each read pair the best hit among all alignments is chosen. A pair of reads is considered as a hit only if the sum of the alignment scores (SAS) is higher than any SAS values from other database hits. If a pair of reads has identical SAS values when mapping to several databases, the only one pair, associated with the database that was specified first in the list of reference databases, is kept. In the last, post-processing step, alignments are filtered based on matches/mis-matches threshold. In this analysis, 70% matches/mis-matches threshold needed to be satisfied in order the hit to be considered significant. The metagenomic sequences are available from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) under accession number PRJEB15242.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this study different virus concentration and nucleic acid extraction methods were evaluated for metagenomic analysis of sewage samples. Sequencing results showed that the majority of the mapped reads (&gt;80%) were of viral origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170199.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). However, between 60 and 90% of the total reads were unmapped. The three main viral families detected were Adenoviridae (human viruses) including the spiked HAdV 35, Virgaviridae (plant viruses), and Siphoviridae (bacteriophages). The sequencing data were analyzed further to determine the viral community composition, viral specificity, viral richness, and detection of pathogenic species.</p>

<title>Viral community composition</title>
<p>To compare the viral community composition resulting from the individual concentration and extraction methods, a series of PCAs were made using the relative abundances from the nine most abundant viral families, accounting for more than 99% of the mapped viral sequences. The effect of extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170199.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170199.g002">Fig 2</xref>) were plotted independently for easier visualization. Samples plotted close together have similar viral community compositions, whereas samples far away from each other are less alike.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the presented study we evaluated the influence of four commonly applied concentration and extraction methods on viral metagenome analysis.</p>
<p>The viral community composition was heavily biased by the type of concentration procedure, which dramatically skewed the relative abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170199.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Choice of extraction kit did not influence the viral community composition to the same degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170199.g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, the results from the NUC extraction kit were remarkably different from samples extracted with the three other kits. The NUC kit includes an “on column DNase step” after viral capsid disruption, which selects for RNA viruses and could explain the separate clustering in the PCA plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170199.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Based on the results from this study it seems inadvisable to compare results, in relation to viral community composition, between studies using different concentration methods and to some degree also extraction methods.</p>
<p>A high species richness have been linked to several ecosystem functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref043">43</xref>], and is often included as a factor in ecological studies. In this study we included the measure to discern if some methods were better at catching the entire spectrum of viral species. Our results show that the choice of extraction method is of more importance than the choice of concentration method with regard to viral richness. However, samples concentrated with GW had a slightly higher richness compared to the other concentration methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170199.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The low mean richness of the samples extracted with NUC can probably be explained by the DNase step, degrading the genomes of DNA viruses and the species rich bacteriophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Viral specificity, or how large a fraction of the sequencing reads is of viral origin, is important for sensitivity reasons, increasing the chance to detect rare or less abundant species. A high viral specificity also has financial implications, causing large savings on both sequencing, and for subsequent CPU hours used in the bioinformatics analyses. In this study, the PEG protocol was the best concentration method, in respect to viral specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170199.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This might be explained by the initial filtration step, not part of the other evaluated protocols. Pre-filtration might have improved the viral specificity in the other concentration methods, although clotting might become a problem due to the increased volumes processed with these methods. The NUC had a consistent high viral specificity (three times that of POW and QIA), probably due to the effective removal of DNA from other organisms, and contaminants, during the DNase step. Overall, there was a 10-fold difference in viral specificity between the lowest and the highest method combination, highlighting the potential savings associated with choice of method. We observed a generally high viral specificity in this study compared to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref045">45</xref>]. This might be due to the addition of the spiked HAdV, inflating the amount of virus in the sewage matrix, but should not have any influence on the method comparisons.</p>
<p>Sewage metagenomics is often used to detect human viral pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref008">8</xref>] including the important enteric RNA viruses as norovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref046">46</xref>], rotavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref047">47</xref>] and Hepatitis A and E virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref048">48</xref>] that has a big impact on public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref049">49</xref>]. These RNA viral families were best detected when using the NUC extraction kit compared to the other tested extraction kits, especially in combination with the concentration method SMF. However, if looking at DNA viruses exclusively, the MIN extraction combined with PEG, MAF, or GW may be preferable, since it produced the highest read counts for the spiked Adenoviridae. Low detection of Adenoviruses using SMF concentration has previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref007">7</xref>], and were also observed in this study. In addition, SMF failed to detect the low numbers of reads of polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses observed by the other methods.</p>
<p>The larger initial sample volume, and associated organic material and inhibitors, for SMF (10 L) compared with the other methods (4, 1 and 0.2 L for GW, MAF, and PEG, respectively), could be an explanation for the low recovery of the spiked viruses. Inhibitors can affect PCR amplification, quality of the prepared library, and subsequent virus detection. This theory was further supported by the qPCR results were extracts obtained from SMF had a high level of inhibition. Extraction with QIA has previously been shown to impair detection of HAdV in samples with high levels of organic matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref023">23</xref>]. This was also the case in our study, where extraction with QIA inhibited HAdV detection in all cases except when combined with PEG concentration which both had the lowest starting volume (0.2 L) and an additional filtration step.</p>
<p>Sampling volume is an important factor in viral metagenomics, enhancing the sensitivity and increasing the chances of detecting rare viruses. However, in this study, we did not find a positive relation between methods with high sampling volumes and increased sensitivity. This could be due to an increase in inhibitors or other aspects of the employed concentration methods, although this question was not within the scope of this study. Further studies are needed to investigate the influence of sample volumes and viral metagenomics.</p>
<p>In this study, the bioinformatic analyses were done using alignment of single reads to three virus databases, using the program MGmapper. The choice of bioinformatics pipeline can affect results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref050">50</xref>] but any biases of our particular approach should be the same on all samples and should therefore not affect the conclusions of this study.</p>
<p>Low levels of MNV were detected in the metagenomics analysis compared to the amounts used for spiking. However, the reasonable high values that could be detected using qPCR, indicated that the initial extraction was successful. Noroviruses have previously been documented to be difficult to detect using metagenomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref052">52</xref>] possibly because of the small genome, robust nucleocapsid, or inhibitory RNA secondary structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref053">53</xref>]. Virus species specific extraction efficiency biases are well documented in viral metagenomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref054">54</xref>] and should always be considered when interpreting the results. Quantitative conclusions from viral metagenomics are not possible for all viral species, illustrated by the good correlation between RPM and qPCR data found for HAdV where no correlation was found for MNV.</p>
<p>Several viruses were detected in higher amounts in the negative controls than in the corresponding samples, strongly suggesting them to be procedure contaminants. Contaminating DNA is a huge challenge for low input metagenomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref024">24</xref>], and contaminating viral nucleotides have previously been detected in polymerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref025">25</xref>], spin columns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref027">27</xref>] and DNases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref054">54</xref>]. The specific origin of the contaminating viruses in our study was not clear although some avian herpesviruses were only linked to the QIA extracts. The ubiquitous presence of contaminating viruses stress the importance of including negative controls in future viral metagenomics studies, as well as adding measures to reduce the problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0170199.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>When evaluating the efficiency of the tested methods, clear differences were observed. No single method was superior to the others in all of the tested parameters. However, some trends were observed for the concentration methods as PEG scored higher in viral specificity and SMF inhibited detection of both spiked viruses. In the evaluation of the tested extraction methods the NUC kit stood out in regard to viral specificity and RNA virus detection. Nevertheless, if the focus is only on DNA viruses, for example phage studies, NUC might not be the best option since it scored low in viral richness which could result in loss of rare species. Practical aspects of the concentration and extraction methods were not within the scope of this paper, but may also influence the choice of method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170199.s008">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170199.s009">S5</xref> Tables).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found a significant influence of concentration and extraction protocols on viral richness, viral specificity, viral pathogen detection, and viral community composition for metagenomic analyses of sewage. This is of major importance when interpreting results from the literature and conducting meta-studies. The use of data base resources, such as the European nucleotide archive (ENA) and short read archive (SRA) are also severely hampered by this fact since extraction kit, volume sample, and concentration procedure are not usually included in the metadata of published viromes. We suggest that such metadata will be included in the future, to allow researchers to select and compare studies conducted with similar methodologies.</p>
