				<p>WNT5A, a member of the WNT family of secreted lipid-modified glycoproteins, is a critical regulator of a host of developmental processes, including limb formation, lung morphogenesis, intestinal elongation and mammary gland development. Altered WNT5A expression has been associated with a number of cancers. Interestingly, in certain types of cancers, such as hematological malignancies and colorectal carcinoma, WNT5A is inactivated and exerts a tumor suppressive function, while in other cancers, such as melanoma and gastric carcinoma, WNT5A is overexpressed and promotes tumor progression. The mechanism by which WNT5A achieves these distinct activities in cancers is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that the <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene produces two protein isoforms, WNT5A-long (WNT5A-L) and WNT5A-short (WNT5A-S). Amino-terminal sequencing and a WNT5A-L specific antibody demonstrate that the mature and secreted isoforms are distinct, with WNT5A-L carrying an additional 18 N-terminal amino acids. Biochemical analysis indicates that both purified proteins are similar with respect to their stability, hydrophobicity and WNT/β-catenin signaling activity. Nonetheless, modulation of these two <italic>WNT5A</italic> isoforms, either through ectopic expression or knockdown, demonstrates that they exert distinct activities in cancer cell lines: while WNT5A-L inhibits proliferation of tumor cell lines, WNT5A-S promotes their growth. Finally, we show that expression of these two WNT5A isoforms is altered in breast and cervix carcinomas, as well as in the most aggressive neuroblastoma tumors. In these cancers, WNT5A-L is frequently down-regulated, whereas WNT5A-S is found overexpressed in a significant fraction of tumors. Altogether, our study provides evidence that the distinct activities of WNT5A in cancer can be attributed to the production of two <italic>WNT5A</italic> isoforms. </p>

			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>The <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene encodes one of the 19 WNT ligand family members. Through binding to FZD (Frizzled)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], ROR1/2 (Receptor tyrosine kinase-like Orphan Receptors)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or RYK (Receptor-like tyrosine kinase)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] receptors and LRP5/6 (Low density lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein) co-receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], WNT proteins modulate the canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, as well as a number of non-canonical β-catenin-independent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. WNT pathways play important roles during embryogenesis and adult tissues homeostasis by regulating cell growth, proliferation, survival, adhesion and migration. Alterations in WNT signaling are frequently associated with oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Notably, aberrant expression of certain WNTs, inactivating mutations of the APC and AXIN tumor suppressors and oncogenic activating mutations of β-catenin (CTNNB1) have been shown to contribute to cell transformation via deregulation of genes, such as <italic>c-MYC</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> (cyclin D1). Epigenetic silencing of genes encoding WNT antagonists, such as the soluble decoy receptors SFRP (Secreted Frizzled Related Protein) or DKK, also leads to deregulation of the pathway and has been observed in several cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A recent comprehensive study of colorectal cancers found that over 94% of cancers carry mutations in one or more WNT signaling components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. </p>
			<p>Among WNT signaling components implicated in oncogenesis, WNT5A is particularly interesting: it acts both as an oncoprotein and a tumor suppressor. In melanomas and gastric and pancreatic carcinomas, <italic>WNT5A</italic> is recurrently overexpressed and exerts a pro-oncogenic function by promoting proliferation and/or invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>Wnt5a</italic> heterozygous mice are predisposed to develop B cell lymphoma through loss of Wnt5a function, and <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene inactivation by somatic deletions or hypermethylation is frequent in human leukemia, lymphoma and colorectal carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, WNT5A inhibits proliferation of leukemia, lymphoma and colorectal carcinoma cells, demonstrating its tumor suppressive function in these cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Finally, we and others have shown that <italic>WNT5A</italic> expression is down-regulated in human breast carcinomas and plays a tumor suppressor role by inhibiting proliferation and/or metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Differences in the WNT receptor repertoire, and hence in the signaling pathways triggered by WNT5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], could explain these opposing activities of WNT5A in cancer. Here, we explored an alternative mechanism by which WNT5A could exert these distinct activities, namely through the expression and production of distinct WNT5A isoforms. Specifically, we found that an amino-terminally truncated WNT5A isoform exhibits tumor-promoting activities, while the full-length WNT5A protein exhibits tumor-suppressive activities. </p>

				<title>The <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene encodes two protein isoforms</title>
				<p>To determine whether <italic>WNT5A</italic> encodes several protein isoforms, we analyzed sequences deposited in databases and searched for possible alternative transcripts. We found the <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene produces at least 3 possible <italic>WNT5A</italic> transcripts from alternative transcriptional start sites. One transcript initiates at exon 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and is predicted to encode a 380 amino-acid WNT5A protein precursor, from hereon referred to as WNT5A-L (Long) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g001">Figures <bold>1A, B</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001">Figures <bold>S1A</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001"><bold>S1B</bold></xref>). The other two transcripts initiate 718 and 578 nucleotides upstream of exon 2, in an alternative exon 1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g001">Figure <bold>1A</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001">Figures <bold>S1A</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001"><bold>S1B</bold></xref>). Both exon 1β-initiated transcripts are predicted to encode a 365 or 360 amino acid (depending on use of start codon at position 16 or 21 relative to start codon of WNT5A-L) precursor protein, referred to as WNT5A-S (Short), and lack the first 15 or 20 N-terminal amino acids as compared with the WNT5A-L precursor ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g001">Figures <bold>1A, B</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001">Figures <bold>S1A</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001"><bold>S1B</bold></xref>). </p>

				<p>The overall exon-intron structure of the human <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene is highly conserved in other vertebrates, including mouse, chicken and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s002">Figure <bold>S2A</bold></xref>). The <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene is split into 5 conserved exons. The length, sequence, and splice sites in codons across exons 2 - 5 are highly conserved. The untranslated region of exon 1 is more diverged, but the splice site is conserved. This exon-intron arrangement is also conserved in the closely related <italic>WNT5B</italic> gene, as annotated in mammalian genomes. Interestingly, the alternative exon 1β, which is embedded in the first intron, is also present in these vertebrates. In mice, exon 1β is detected in alternative Wnt5a transcripts and shares significant homology with the human sequence. In a pairwise alignment, the element encompassing the upstream regulatory region and exon 1 β are 95% conserved between human and mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s002">Figure <bold>S2B</bold></xref>). In birds (chicken and zebra finch), this alternative exon has not been annotated, but the presence of a highly conserved sequence with a splice donor at the 3’ end indicates that this exon 1β is present. The pairwise alignment between chicken and zebra finch of this element shows 96% conservation. Furthermore, two short sequences within these elements are highly conserved between mammals (mouse and human) and birds (chicken and zebra finch) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g002">Figure <bold>2B</bold></xref>). Fish (zebrafish and stickleback) also contain a highly conserved element within this region. Although this element has not been annotated as an exon in any database, the elevated conservation (74%) suggests the presence of an additional exon in fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g002">Figure <bold>2B</bold></xref>). Together, the observed high degree of genomic sequence conservation suggests that alternative Wnt5a transcripts, similar to the ones described here, are present in multiple vertebrate species. Finally, alignment of the amino terminal amino acids of human, mouse and chicken Wnt5a shows that start codon M21 (position relative to start codon of WNT5A-L) is completely conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g001">Figure <bold>1B</bold></xref>), suggesting that WNT5A-S initiates at this position.</p>

						<title>Effects of WNT5A isoforms on the β-catenin/TCF pathway and Disheveled proteins phosphorylation.</title><p>Both WNT5A proteins block Wnt3a-activation of β-catenin/TCF-driven transcriptional activity in HEK 293 (TOP-Luciferase, <bold>A</bold>.) and MDA-MB-231 (TOP-GFP reporter, <bold>B</bold>.). Cells were treated with purified Wnt3a and an increasing concentration of WNT5A for 24 hours (A) or 48 hours (B). <bold>C</bold>. Upon transfection, both WNT5A isoforms interfere with endogenous (MDA-MB-231, left panel) and WNT1-induced (HeLa, right panel) β-catenin/TCF-driven transcription in MDA-MB-231 (left panel) and HeLa cells (right panel). Cells were transfected with control, WNT5A-L or WNT5A-S expression vectors alone, or together with a WNT1 expression vector and assayed for β-catenin/TCF-driven TOP-Luciferase reporter activity. An expression vector encoding a dominant-negative form of TCF4 (ΔNTCF4) was used to interfere with the endogenous reporter activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. <bold>D</bold>. Both WNT5A isoforms promote DVL phosphorylation. L cells (left panel) and C2C12 cells (right panel) were treated with WNT5A isoforms (10 nM, 2 hours) and whole cell lysates were immuno-blotted with the indicated antibodies. Both WNT5A isoforms, as well as Wnt3a (10 nM, 2 hours), led to a mobility shift of Dvl1 and Dvl2 proteins, suggesting that Dvl proteins are post-translationally modified by phosphorylation in response to both canonical (Wnt3a) and non-canonical Wnt (WNT5A) signaling. Only Wnt3a induced accumulation of the β-catenin protein. Note: β-catenin accumulation in response to Wnt3a in C2C12 cells is not detectable in these whole cell lysates because these cells contain large amounts of membrane/adherens junction associated β-catenin.</p>

				<p>As is the case for most secreted proteins, Wnt precursors are cleaved at the amino terminus to remove the signal sequence thereby producing the mature polypeptide. A signal peptide cleavage prediction algorithm (<italic>SignalP 4.1</italic> - http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) predicts that both WNT5A precursors yield proteins of either 343 amino acids (start with QVVIEA…) or 338 amino acid (start with ANSWWS…). The latter predicted cleavage site has the highest cleavage score (Y-score of 0.625 for WNT5A-S [start at M21] and 0.246 for WNT5A-L). However, amino-terminal sequencing of mouse Wnt5a indicated that signal sequence cleavage occurred at a position 24 residues downstream from the predicted site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, since the 15 amino-acid difference in the N-terminal sequence of WNT5A-L and WNT5A-S precursors may influence the position of signal peptide cleavage, we experimentally determined the identity of the amino termini of the mature proteins. </p>
				<p>To identify the position of signal peptide cleavage and the first amino acid of the mature proteins, we purified both WNT5A isoforms. Using a previously developed CHO expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], we independently overexpressed each WNT5A isoform and purified them from the conditioned media (CM), according to published protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Both WNT5A isoforms were secreted into the CM at equal levels (data not shown), and were purified to near homogeneity (~95% pure, as assessed by Coomassie staining, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g001">Figure <bold>1C</bold></xref>). Amino-terminal sequencing showed the purified WNT5A-L protein to start one amino acid downstream of the predicted signal peptide cleavage site, thus generating a 337 amino acid protein starting with the sequence NSWWS… (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g001">Figure <bold>1B</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001">Figure <bold>S1B</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001"><bold>S1C</bold></xref>). The secreted WNT5A-S protein lacked an additional amino-terminal 18 amino acid to generate a protein of 319 amino acid starting with the sequence IIGAQ… (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g001">Figure <bold>1B</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001">Figure <bold>S1B</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001"><bold>S1C</bold></xref>). Therefore, the two isoforms generate proteins with distinct amino terminal sequences. The WNT5A-S amino terminus matches that of mouse Wnt5a, which was previously identified by amino-terminal peptide sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Interestingly, the signal peptide cleavage algorithm did not predict this position as a likely site of signal sequence cleavage for either WNT5A-L or WNT5A-S (Y-score of 0.16 for WNT5A-S and 0.113 for WNT5A-L).</p>
				<p>To confirm the distinct amino terminal composition of both mature WNT5A isoforms, we generated an antibody directed to the WNT5A-L-specific 18 amino acid (NSWWSLGMNNPVQMSEVY). In immuno-blots, the WNT5A-L-specific antibody only recognized WNT5A-L and not WNT5A-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g001">Figure <bold>1D</bold></xref>). This demonstrates that the exon 1- and exon 1β-initiated <italic>WNT5A</italic> transcripts produce distinct WNT5A proteins that differ in their amino termini. The mechanism by which these two precursors are differentially processed to yield distinct mature proteins is currently unclear, however, we speculate that differences in the amino termini influence the choice of the processing machinery to cleave the proteins at distinct positions. Further studies are needed to address these questions.</p>
				<p>WNT proteins are highly hydrophobic, a property imparted by the covalent attachment of at least one lipid molecule to a conserved residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This modification is important for proper processing and secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, as revealed by the Wnt-Fzd co-crystal structure, the lipid moiety is critical for receptor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. To address whether the two WNT5A isoforms differed in their hydrophobic properties, and hence in their lipid modifications, we used the phase separation property of the detergent Triton X-114. We observed no difference between the two isoforms, as they both partitioned equally to the organic phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g001">Figure <bold>1E</bold></xref>), thus suggesting that both isoforms are similarly modified. To test whether the two isoforms differed in their stability, we incubated each protein at 37°C for up to 60 hours. Immuno-blot detection indicated that both proteins degraded at equal rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g001">Figure <bold>1F</bold></xref>). Therefore, the two WNT5A isoforms behave similarly with respect to their <italic>in vitro</italic> stability and hydrophobicity. It is, however, possible that each isoform has distinct biochemical properties in an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, a possibility we have not addressed.</p>

				<title>Effects of WNT5A-L and WNT5A-S isoforms on signaling pathways</title>
				<p>Several WNT signaling pathways have been described and proposed. The most commonly studied and best-established pathway, often referred to as the canonical WNT pathway, involves β-catenin as a central mediator. Other non-canonical pathways, which act independently of β-catenin, are poorly understood. At the very minimum, these two pathways are thought to share the following components: WNT ligands, FZD receptors and Dishevelled (DVL) signal transducers. Although WNT5A is predominantly associated with non-canonical WNT signaling, it has also been found to activate canonical β-catenin signaling in certain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We investigated if the WNT5A isoforms differentially impact the β-catenin/TCF signaling pathway. To this end, we generated two cell lines, HEK 293 and MDA-MB-231, carrying a WNT/β-catenin specific reporter system. This reporter system consists of a WNT responsive element comprised of 7 multimerized TCF binding sites (referred to as TOP for <underline>T</underline>CF <underline>O</underline>ptimal <underline>P</underline>romoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]), which regulates the expression of a reporter gene, either Luciferase for HEK 293 cells (HEK293-TOP-Luciferase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g002">Figure <bold>2A</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s003">Figure <bold>S3A</bold></xref>) or GFP for MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-MB-231-TOP-GFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g002">Figure <bold>2B</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s003">Figure <bold>S3B</bold></xref>). These reporter cells are potently activated by Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g002">Figure <bold>2A and B</bold></xref>), a WNT protein commonly used to stimulate the canonical signaling pathway. In contrast, neither WNT5A isoform activated or consistently modulated the basal activity of these reporters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s003">Figure <bold>S3A</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s003"><bold>S3B</bold></xref>), indicating that these cellular systems do not provide the appropriate milieu to connect WNT5A signaling to the canonical β-catenin pathway. </p>
				<p>Sensitive and robust cell-based assays for non-canonical WNT signaling are scarce. However, non-canonical WNT signaling has been shown to antagonize WNT/β-catenin signaling, an activity that can be assayed using the TOP-reporter system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We found that both WNT5A isoforms inhibit WNT3A-induced reporter activation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g002">Figure <bold>2 A and B</bold></xref>). These results show that, despite the difference in their amino-termini, both WNT5A proteins potently antagonize the WNT/β-catenin signaling. Similar inhibitory effects of WNT5A-L and WNT5A-S isoforms on the WNT/β-catenin-driven reporter were observed when cells were transfected with expression vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g002">Figure <bold>2C</bold></xref>) rather than treated with purified WNT5A-L and WNT5A-S proteins. Therefore, in these assays, the WNT5A isoforms exhibit similar biological activities when delivered as purified proteins or transfected genes.  </p>
				<p>WNT signaling, canonical and non-canonical, leads to the hyperphosphorylation of Dvl proteins, signaling molecules that act immediately downstream of FZD receptors. This post-translational modification of Dvl proteins can be readily detected by an electrophoretic mobility shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We found that treatment of two cell lines (mouse L cells and the mouse myoblast C2C12 cell line) with either WNT5A isoform, as well as WNT3A, induces a mobility shift of Dvl proteins, as detected by immuno-blotting for Dvl1 and Dvl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g002">Figure <bold>2D</bold></xref>). However, in agreement with the distinct activities of WNT3A and WNT5A isoforms on WNT/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g002">Figures <bold>2A, 2B</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s003">Figure <bold>S3A</bold></xref><bold>, S3B</bold>), only Wnt3a, but not WNT5A isoforms, induced accumulation of the β-catenin protein, as evidenced in L cells. This β-catenin protein accumulation is not apparent in C2C12 cells, which already express high levels of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g002">Figure <bold>2D</bold></xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that the two WNT5A isoforms exhibit identical biological activities in the established cell-based WNT signaling assays. </p>

				<title>Expression of WNT5A isoforms in cancer cell lines and normal tissues</title>
				<p>Previous studies of WNT5A expression have not discriminated between the two isoforms described here. Therefore, we measured their transcript levels in cancer cell lines and in normal tissues by performing quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) with isoform-specific primers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s007">Table <bold>S1</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001">Figure <bold>S1</bold></xref>). This analysis showed that expression of these isoforms is highly variable between individual cancer cell lines. For example, while MDA-MB-231 (derived from a breast carcinoma) and SH-SY5Y (derived from a neuroblastoma) express predominantly <italic>WNT5A-L</italic>, HeLa cells (derived from a cervix carcinoma) express predominantly <italic>WNT5A-S</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3A</bold></xref>). Other cell lines, including MCF-7 (derived from a breast carcinoma) or IMR-32 (derived from a neuroblastoma) express extremely low levels of either WNT5A isoform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s004">Figure <bold>S4A</bold></xref>).

				<title>WNT5A-S promotes and WNT5A-L suppresses growth of cancer cell lines</title>
				<p>To study the functions of the WNT5A isoforms, we manipulated their expression in several cell lines, including MDA-MB-231, HeLa and SH-SY5Y, and analyzed the phenotypic consequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3B-D</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s005">Figure <bold>S5</bold></xref>). Since signaling activities of purified WNT proteins are short-lived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and biological assays generally require long periods of stimulation, we utilized transfection of <italic>WNT</italic> genes rather than application of purified proteins. Ectopic expression of WNT5A-L substantially reduced cell numbers in these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3B</bold></xref>). No evidence of increased cell death was observed (data not shown), indicating that WNT5A-L acts to inhibit cell proliferation. In contrast, ectopic expression of WNT5A-S promoted proliferation of MDA-MB-231, HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3B</bold></xref>).</p>
				<p>Using isoform-specific siRNAs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s001">Figure <bold>S1</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s008">Table <bold>S2</bold></xref>), we disrupted expression of each WNT5A isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3C</bold></xref>). The siRNAs were able to specifically knockdown their targets up to 80% as determined by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3C</bold></xref>). Importantly, each WNT5A isoform was selectively inhibited by the corresponding siRNA without affecting levels of the other isoform. Consistent with the proliferation promoting effects of WNT5A-S ectopic expression, knockdown of WNT5A-S reduced cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3D</bold></xref>). Even in cells expressing low WNT5A-S levels, such as MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3A</bold></xref>), knockdown of the WNT5A-S isoform produced a strong inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3D</bold></xref>). The cell inhibition resulting from WNT5A-S siRNA was rescued in all tested cell lines by co-transduction with a WNT5A-S vector devoid of the siRNA target sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3D</bold></xref>, KD WNT5A-S + rescue). These rescuing data demonstrate that the effects of this siRNA are due to WNT5A-S knock-down rather than non-specific off-target effects. Furthermore, WNT5A-S knockdown increased cell death in the three cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s005">Figure <bold>S5A</bold></xref>) and induced caspase activity in MDA-MB-231 and HeLa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s005">Figure <bold>S5B</bold></xref>). However, the ≥3-fold reduction in cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3D</bold></xref>) exceeded the observed modest increase in cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s005">Figure <bold>S5A</bold></xref>), suggesting that WNT5A-S knockdown mainly impaired proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of WNT5A-L had no effect on cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3D</bold></xref>), cell death or caspase activity in the 3 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3D</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080526.s005">Figure <bold>S5A, B</bold></xref>). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that endogenously and ectopically expressed WNT5A isoforms exert distinct effects in breast, cervix and neuroblastoma tumor cell lines, with WNT5A-S promoting and WNT5A-L inhibiting cell proliferation. Since we did not observe distinct signaling activities for WNT5A-L and WNT5A-S in WNT/β-catenin and DVL phosphorylation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g002">Figure <bold>2</bold></xref>), we speculate that these growth promoting and inhibiting activities of WNT5A are independent of the canonical WNT signaling pathway. </p>
				<p>In an attempt to identify a mechanism by which WNT5A isoforms exert differential effects on proliferation, we screened the expression of several known WNT regulated genes. We found that expression of two genes, <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>CDK8</italic>, both of which have been implicated in various aspects of WNT signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], were differentially regulated by isoform-specific knockdown of WNT5A. Knockdown of WNT5A-L, but not WNT5A-S, led to a decrease in <italic>AXIN2</italic> expression in 3 tested cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HeLa and SH-SY5Y, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3E</bold></xref>). In contrast, knockdown of WNT5A-S, but not WNT5A-L, led to an increase in <italic>CDK8</italic> expression in 2 out of 3 cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and HeLa) and a decrease in SH-SY5Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g003">Figure <bold>3E</bold></xref>). This data offers a potential molecular link between the observed differential effects of WNT5A isoforms on proliferation and gene regulation and indicates that each WNT5A isoform impinges on gene expression in a distinct manner. Further exhaustive studies, such as transcriptome analysis, will be needed to identify and define pathways that mediate these differential effects. </p>

				<title>Down-regulation of WNT5A-L and overexpression of the WNT5A-S isoform in cancers</title>
				<p>To determine whether the respective pro- and anti-proliferative functions of the WNT5A-S and WNT5A-L isoforms are relevant to oncogenesis, we analyzed their expression levels by qRT-PCR in primary tumor samples from breast and cervix carcinomas and neuroblastomas. As compared to normal breast tissues, <italic>WNT5A-L</italic> was down-regulated ≥3-fold in 46% (14 of 30) of breast carcinomas (<italic>P</italic>= 0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g004">Figure <bold>4A</bold></xref>). <italic>WNT5A-S</italic> was undetectable in normal breast tissue and overexpressed in a small subset of breast cancers (4 of 30, 13%, n. s.)  (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g004">Figure <bold>4A</bold></xref>). In normal uterine cervix epithelium, both <italic>WNT5A-L</italic> and <italic>WNT5A-S</italic> were expressed, <italic>WNT5A-L</italic> being the predominant isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g004">Figure <bold>4B</bold></xref>). In comparison with normal cervix, <italic>WNT5A-L</italic> was down-regulated ≥3-fold in 53% (8 of 15) of cervix carcinomas (<italic>P</italic>= 0.047). In contrast, <italic>WNT5A-S</italic> was up-regulated ≥4-fold in 40% (6 of 15) of these tumors (<italic>P</italic>= 0.045) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g004">Figure <bold>4B</bold></xref>). Neuroblastomas, pediatric cancers of the sympathetic nervous system, can be classified into low and high risk tumors with 90% and 30% of survival, respectively. Half of the high risk neuroblastomas are fatal within 2 years from diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. High risk neuroblastomas showed low <italic>WNT5A-L</italic> expression more frequently than low risk tumors (55% -22 of 40- versus 21% -8 of 37-, <italic>P</italic>= 0.004), thus suggesting that WNT5A-L down-regulation correlates with high risk neuroblastoma. Furthermore, elevated <italic>WNT5A-S</italic> expression was associated more frequently with high risk than with low risk neuroblastomas (17% -7 of 40- versus 5% -2 of 37-, n. s.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080526-g004">Figure <bold>4C</bold></xref>). In our cohort, 5% (2 of 40) of patients with low risk neuroblastomas died over a 10-year follow-up period, in contrast with 70% (half of them within 2 years from diagnosis) in the high risk group. In this latter group of the most aggressive tumors, low expression of <italic>WNT5A-L</italic> or high expression of <italic>WNT5A-S</italic> were both associated with shorter survival (mean= 26.05 versus 37.1 months for <italic>WNT5A-L</italic> and 27.56 versus 36.2 months for <italic>WNT5A-S</italic>). However, this association was not statistically significant. High risk neuroblastomas carry several genetic alterations, each of high prognostic value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, only analysis of larger cohorts of patients will determine whether the expression status of <italic>WNT5A-L</italic> or <italic>WNT5A-S</italic> isoforms is of further relevance to clinical outcome. </p>

			<title>Discussion</title>
			<p>Our work reveals that the <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene encodes two distinct transcripts expressed from alternative transcriptional start sites, producing messenger RNAs with distinct translational start sites. These two types of transcripts lead to production of two distinct WNT5A proteins, a long 337 amino acids isoform (WNT5A-L) and a short 319 amino acids isoform (WNT5A-S). Amino-terminal peptide sequencing and a WNT5A-L specific antibody confirmed the existence of two distinct WNT5A proteins. A recent study analyzed the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene and, consistent with our studies, identified two isoforms that differed in their transcriptional start sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. While this previous study elegantly elucidated the upstream regulatory elements controlling expression of each isoform, our current study demonstrates that two distinct WNT5A proteins (post-signal sequence cleavage) are produced and that the two isoforms exert opposing activities in cancer cell lines. </p>
			<p>Alternative promoter usage to generate multiple transcripts is common, including among <italic>WNT</italic> genes. In addition to <italic>WNT5A</italic>, <italic>WNT16</italic> and <italic>WNT2B</italic> also produce alternative transcripts that are differentially expressed in human tissues and cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Therefore, through use of alternative transcriptional start sites, the resulting Wnt family of proteins may be significantly more complex and diverse than expected for 19 genes. </p>
			<p>Importantly, we showed, through ectopic expression and knockdown studies, that the WNT5A-S isoform promoted cell proliferation while the WNT5A-L isoform inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, we found that WNT5A-S expression was elevated in a fraction of breast and cervix carcinoma as well as neuroblastoma tumors, whereas WNT5A-L expression was down-regulated in these cancers. These findings offer a novel mechanism by which WNT5A can exert either oncogenic or tumor suppressive activities. Our observations indicate that the distinct functions of WNT5A in cancer are not only due to differences in cellular context (e.g. expression of receptors and other signal transducers). Instead, we propose that two distinct WNT5A isoforms, WNT5A-L and WNT5A-S, possess intrinsically different activities and behave as tumor suppressor and oncogene, respectively. The mechanisms by which these differential effects are achieved are currently unknown. Along these lines, we found that expression of two genes, <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>CDK8</italic>, is differentially regulated by these two isoforms. Future studies are needed to further define how gene regulation is differentially affected by these two WNT5A isoforms.</p>
			<p>The <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene was previously found silenced in colorectal and hematological cancers due to hypermethylation of a CpG island encompassing exon 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the initiation site of the WNT5A-L isoform. Here, we have shown that normal colon and normal blood cells exclusively express WNT5A-L and that this isoform is frequently silenced in hematological cancers. Together, these observations indicate that the WNT5A-L isoform mediates the tumor suppressive functions of WNT5A in colorectal and hematological cancers. It will be of high interest to determine which isoform of WNT5A exerts oncogenic functions in melanomas and gastric and pancreatic carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and monitoring the respective expression levels of WNT5A-L and WNT5A-S may be a useful cancer biomarker. The roles of WNT5A during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] also warrant evaluation of the functions of the isoforms in normal ontogenesis and their potential implications in developmental disorders. </p>
			<p>Finally, we have shown that the distinct effects of WNT5A-L and WNT5A-S isoforms on proliferation of several cell lines are not due to differential effects on the WNT/β-catenin pathway. The WNT5A-L and WNT5A-S isoforms may therefore regulate distinct alternative signaling pathways that mediate their respective tumor suppressive and oncogenic functions. Characterization of these pathways, including the identification of possible receptors, signal transduction components and target gene expression, will be necessary to gain a better understanding of the roles of these isoforms in carcinogenesis and may enable the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Indeed, treatments that could restore the effects of the tumor suppressive WNT5A isoform or block that of the oncogenic variant may confer clinical benefit in cancers in which alterations of these isoforms are implicated. </p>

WNT yields were determined by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Yields for WNT5A isoforms averaged at 40µg per liter of CM. Stability of WNT5A isoforms was tested by spiking HEK 293 growth media with equal amounts of purified WNT5A isoforms, and incubating at 37°C for the indicated time points. Hydrophobicity of WNT5A proteins was assessed by Triton X-114 phase separation. 500µl of CM was mixed with 500µl Triton buffer (2.2% Triton X-114; 300mM NaCl; 20mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5).

Intronic sequences are in blue lower case italics. Intron 1 (6061 nucleotides, nt) is spliced from the mature WNT5A-L transcript, which initiates in exon 1. Exon 1β, which is located within intron 1 splices to exon 2 and produces the WNT5A-S transcript (see text and Figure 1A), is in blue capitals with purple shaded frame. The 412 nt region spliced from mature exon 1β-initiated transcripts is delineated by red brackets and is in blue lower case italics. Sequences complementary to the qPCR TaqMan probe and reverse primer, both common to all WNT5A transcripts, and isoform-specific forward primers are underlined by arrows.
