        <p>Bark beetles (<italic>Coleoptera: Curculionidae</italic>,
                        <italic>Scolytinae</italic>) feed and breed in dead or severely weakened
                    host trees. When their population densities are high, some species aggregate on
                    healthy host trees so that their defences may be exhausted and the inner bark
                    successfully colonized, killing the tree in the process. Here we investigate
                    under what conditions participating with unrelated conspecifics in risky mass
                    attacks on living trees is an adaptive strategy, and what this can tell us about
                    bark beetle outbreak dynamics. We find that the outcome of individual host
                    selection may deviate from the ideal free distribution in a way that facilitates
                    the emergence of tree-killing (aggressive) behavior, and that any heritability
                    on traits governing aggressiveness seems likely to exist in a state of flux or
                    cycles consistent with variability observed in natural populations. This may
                    have implications for how economically and ecologically important species
                    respond to environmental changes in climate and landscape (forest) structure.
                    The population dynamics emerging from individual behavior are complex, capable
                    of switching between “endemic” and “epidemic” regimes
                    spontaneously or following changes in host availability or resistance. Model
                    predictions are compared to empirical observations, and we identify some factors
                    determining the occurrence and self-limitation of epidemics.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Bark beetles have coexisted with their tree hosts since the early Mesozoic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Franceschi1">[1]</xref>, and while
                often regarded as pests, bark beetles and their associated fungi also play important
                roles in nutrient cycling, forest dynamics and biodiversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Bourtzis1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Raffa2">[5]</xref>. But of the more than 5800
                described bark beetle species, less than a dozen, mostly in the genera
                    <italic>Dendroctonus</italic> and <italic>Ips</italic> (e.g., <italic>Ips
                    typographus</italic>, <italic>Dendroctonus ponderosae</italic>, <italic>D.
                    frontalis</italic>) are known to colonize and kill even healthy host trees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Bourtzis1">[2]</xref> when
                population densities are high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Raffa1">[3]</xref>. Aggregation pheromones released by beetles while they are
                boring into and excavating mating galleries in host trees elicit attraction of
                conspecifics of both sexes, and the greater the number of beetles attacking, the
                greater their probability of exhausting host defences and achieving successful
                oviposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Paine1">[4]</xref>.
                The beetles also vector presumably mutualistic microorganisms (mostly fungi), some
                of which contribute to tree mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Bourtzis1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The Pinaceae have evolved defences against bark beetles and their associated fungi
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Raffa2">[5]</xref>:
                resin-filled ducts can mechanically seal off the entrance holes, a number of
                compounds (terponoids and phenolics) with inhibitory or toxic effects on the beetles
                and fungi increases in concentration, and cell structure changes in the surrounding
                tissue helps contain the infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Franceschi1">[1]</xref>. The effectiveness of these
                defences varies over time within and between trees, as it is vulnerable to water
                stress and other biological factors. While a fallen tree with remaining root contact
                may still have partially active defences, broken trees are defenceless <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Franceschi1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Weslien1">[6]</xref> and suppressed
                trees have reduced defences. As modular organisms, the “death” of a tree
                is neither instantaneous nor necessarily affecting the whole individual. Here,
                however, we define a “dead” tree as one that has no effective defense
                against a given species of bark beetle. This often results from loss of root
                contact, extreme drought stress, mechanical damage or parasites.</p>
      <p>Failure to find a suitable host is a major source of beetle mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Wermelinger1">[7]</xref>, and usable
                breeding habitat is patchy, stochastic and transient, as dead host trees appear
                randomly in the landscape through wind-felling or logging, after which the phloem
                decays within months, while forest succession take decades to centuries. On the
                other hand, partaking in an unsuccessful aggregation is at best a waste of time and
                at worst fatal, and the risk is likely to be greatest for the ones initiating the
                attack. Since the maximum reproductive success may be achieved at low to
                intermediate gallery densities, the beetles seem to face both positive and negative
                density dependence, on slightly different spatial scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Holt1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Fretwell1">[14]</xref>. At very low densities, mate
                finding may be problematic, while increasing densities both cause crowding and
                facilitates colonization of living trees. Early colonizers of living trees meet the
                strongest tree defences and uncertain success, latecomers meet higher competition
                and, perhaps, increased predation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Aukema1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>From an evolutionary perspective, this raises several questions: Why do individual
                beetles initiate or join with unrelated conspecifics in risky
                “cooperative” attacks? This is especially puzzling considering that the
                beetles initiating the attack face the greatest risks, and thus are the least likely
                to reap the benefits. Conversely, if such attacks represent an adaptive strategy,
                why are they nevertheless only sporadic, usually local and self-limiting, but at
                other times forming large-scale outbreaks that kill virtually all host trees over
                large areas, persisting long after the triggering resource pulse has ceased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Christiansen1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-McGregor1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Carroll1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Holt1">[12]</xref>?</p>
      <p>Here we develop an individual-based model, hereafter called the Sequential Restricted
                Distribution (SRD), to study the adaptive strategies of host selection (dead vs.
                living hosts) that lie behind the dynamics approached at the population level by
                traditional population models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-kland1">[13]</xref>. The model explores what behavior is adaptive (i.e.,
                maximizing fitness, here measured as expected reproductive success) under what
                circumstances. It then uses the results to explore the population dynamics that
                emerge from the predicted behavior. Thus, we can approach the evolutionary
                mechanisms behind the conditional strategies that make some species and populations
                switch between endemic and epidemic states. (The term “epidemic” is here
                used to denote all populations that kill living trees. This does not imply that all
                populations entering the “epidemic” state will produce large-scale tree
                killing, only that large-scale forest mortality results when populations in a large
                number of patches become epidemic within a relatively short time due to a
                combination of dispersal and autocorrelated climate and landscape effects. Also,
                some obligatory saprophagous species are not necessarily described in this
                model.)</p>
      <p>To do this, we couple a set of monotonic functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) representing the trade-offs facing the
                individual beetle: the probability that a living tree will become colonisable (Eq.
                1), the risk suffered by the first beetles boring into a still living tree (Eq. 2),
                the decrease in reproductive success caused by high gallery densities (Eq. 3), and
                migration risk (Eq. 4). We scale the parameters (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Analysis</xref> section belo and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0018274-t001">Table 1</xref>) so that model runs are biologically reasonable, investigate the
                effect of varying parameters representing biological differences, and calculate to
                what degree our inclusions of relative risk and sequential choice predict divergence
                from the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD).</p>

      <p>The IFD (conceptually similar to the game theory term Nash Equilibrium) is a central
                idea in evolution and behavioral ecology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Fretwell1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Cressman1">[15]</xref>. It predicts that organisms
                should distribute themselves proportionately to the amount of resources available in
                each patch. The relationship with evolutionary game theory is that when an IFD is
                achieved, no individual can do better by changing patch. Imperfect information,
                unequal competitive abilities, time lags and costs of redistribution can inhibit the
                formation of an IFD, but it is a very useful null assumption, as systematic
                deviations from it alerts us to the existence of costs and/or constrains that need
                to be accounted for.</p>
      <p>Finally, the results are compared to empirical data and existing population models
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-kland1">[13]</xref>, and
                discussed in relation to evolutionary, ecological and management issues.</p>

                assume monotonic but not linear transitions between the biologically plausible
                extremes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Raffa3">[18]</xref>. For
                instance, a single beetle will never overwhelm a tree but an infinite number of
                beetles always will, the risks of attacking or migrating are between zero and
                certain death, and mean number of offspring per adult is between zero and the
                maximum for the species. Our results are general over a biologically plausible range
                of parameters (see below), and do not depend on the exact functions or parameter
                values as long as they are monotonic and scale relatively to each other. The
                following assumptions are made in the SRD model:</p>
      <list list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>
            <bold>The beetles show an adaptive behavioural reaction norm.</bold>
          </p>
          <p>Thus, we assume that they have had time to evolve, and that there are no
                        strong evolutionary trade-offs with processes invisible to this model, or
                        manipulation from other organisms such as parasites. Kin-selected altruism
                        is assumed to play no significant part, since at least some important
                        species are outbreeding and widely dispersing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Allender1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Piel1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Sall1">[21]</xref>,</p>

          </p>
          <p>While uncertain, the beetles' estimates are assumed to be unbiased. This
                        is supported by the observation that beetles respond to host volatiles,
                        conspecific pheromone concentrations and post-landing host inspection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Byers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Zhang1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Erbilgin1">[24]</xref>,

          <p>Individuals must at some point make a choice of one resource over the other.
                        As they can only be aware of conspecifics that have already settled and
                        started releasing volatiles and pheromones, they have no information about
                        the presence of unsettled individuals or about individuals that will arrive
                        later.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>The model proceeds through several steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). First, beetle no. 1 selects the strategy
                (settling in a dead tree, settling in a living tree, or migrating away) that gives
                it the highest expected number of offspring. Then beetle no. 2 does the same, but
                the outcome may be influenced by the choice already done by beetle no. 1. This is
                repeated until all N beetles that encounter the patch during a swarming period have
                settled or migrated. The result of these choices determines the adult (gallery)
                densities in dead and live trees respectively, and thus the number of realized
                offspring.</p>
      <p>The patch size is an abstraction of the maximum distance over which the beetles
                integrate information about their hosts and conspecifics using olfactory and, at
                close range, even visual/tactile clues. From pheromone trapping experiments, we
                consider that about a hundred meters or less in radius seems a realistic scale
                approximation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Byers4">[28]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Franklin1">[29]</xref>, and it
                can reasonably be visualized as a stand of host trees. N is the number of
                beetles/patch, defined as the number of beetles that will respond to a patch during
                the flight period. Using the patch (stand) as the spatial unit, N is hence referred
                to as “population density”.</p>
      <p>The amount of breeding material in a patch exists either in the form of dead (i.e.,
                undefended) and living (i.e., defended but susceptible to colonization) trees, which
                are denoted K<sub>D</sub> and K<sub>L</sub> respectively. This is conceptually
                related to the “carrying capacity”, and is scaled to the density at

                        (green) or migrating (blue) in one flight season as functions of swarm
                        density (N). Here K<sub>D</sub> = 5,
                        K<sub>L</sub> = 10, median
                        Ω = 0.6, α = 1,

                        τ = 0.5. The threshold T = 15
                        is marked and shows where living trees would be colonized with
                        P = 0.5 if all beetles had joined attacks.

                        resources (dotted lines) and when they are not solid). The grey line shows
                        the probability of successful colonisation of living trees increasing with
                        population density. <bold>c</bold>) The colours show total population growth
                        rates as a function of beetle distributions, showing the stable
                        distributions as predicted by the IFD (dotted) and SRD (green and brown
                        solid) lines. Below the diagonal, the horizontal axis shows population
                        density(N), the vertical axis the number of beetles settling in dead trees
                            (N<sub>d</sub>). Above the diagonal, the vertical axis shows population
                        density, the horizontal axis the number of beetles settling in living trees
                            (N<sub>s</sub>). <bold>d</bold>) As in (c), except that colours show per

                        Following the brown (dead-tree) line, we see that at low densities (interval
                        A) both the SRD and IFD predict all beetles to settle in dead trees. As
                        living trees are settled (interval B) we see marked deviations from the IFD
                        as individuals colonizing living trees enjoy increased fitness. However, as
                        population density increases further, the SRD and IFD converge (interval C)
                        as both resources become crowded.</p>

      <p>The SRD predict that only dead trees will initially be colonized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>), but as the local
                population density increases, these grow increasingly crowded until density
                dependence outweighs the risks of either settling in a living tree or emigrating
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g002">Fig. 2a–d</xref>). The
                observed dynamics emerge from a single, flexible strategy shared by the whole
                population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Byers4">[28]</xref>,
                but individuals maximizing their fitness does not necessarily imply maximized
                population growth: the distributions between dead and living trees mostly result in
                population growth rates far from maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>). At low and very high population
                densities, the SRD and IFD converge, but for a range of population densities when
                living trees are being colonized, they diverge considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>

        <title>Population dynamics</title>
        <p>There is a considerable volume of parameter space where aggregative attacks may
                    occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g003">Fig. 3</xref> summarizes
                    model behaviour for such a case), and in a subset of these the population growth
                    function gives three non-zero population equilibrium points. The population
                    trajectories can thus be rather complex, and have two attractor basins; one
                    lower (“endemic”) and one higher (“epidemic”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>). The position of the
                    attractor basins are found to depend on the expected payoff from migration
                    (ω,γ), the risks incurred by initiating an attack (c<sub>L</sub>), the
                    beetles having a substantial effect on the trees (c<sub>0</sub>), the degree to
                    which beetles settling in dead trees first sample random live trees (τ), and
                    of course the abundance of dead (K<sub>D</sub>) and living trees (K<sub>L</sub>)
                    that are not too vigorously defended (T<sub>L</sub>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Analysis</xref> section).</p>
        <p>The population can shift between the endemic and epidemic attractor basins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) by several mechanisms.
                    An epidemic state can be triggered by increased population density, such as
                    following an increased abundance of dead hosts (K<sub>D</sub>), immigration, or
                    increased survival rates. It can also be triggered by drought stress, or
                    increased aggressiveness (in the beetles or the composition of their
                    host-pathogenic fungi), both in effect lowering the colonization threshold
                        (T<sub>L</sub>), increasingly explorative search patterns (increased τ),
                    or even spontaneously when the dynamics are unstable. Even increased
                    environmental variability alone can increase the odds that a population will
                    enter the epidemic attractor basin within a given time period.</p>
        <p>Likewise, epidemics may cease from density-dependent offspring reduction,
                    emigration, poor survival (low R), lack of resources (low K), abundant rainfall
                    (increased T<sub>L</sub>) or decreased aggressiveness or exploration (increased
                    T or decreased τ). Another factor shaping dynamic structure is whether
                    early-arriving individuals are able to monopolize resources, thus making them
                    less affected by increasing density than latecomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>) and stabilizing the dynamics around
                    an equilibrium point.</p>
        <p>Low-threshold systems where few beetles are needed to kill moderately healthy
                    hosts can appear stable and endemic as long as beetle populations are low (for
                    instance due to winter mortality, predation and low host abundance), but can
                    easily switch to stable epidemic (i.e., potentially causing large outbreaks)
                    when populations increase (for instance due to increased survival or decreased
                    predation). However, when defence thresholds are very high, living trees are
                    colonized only at densities where reproduction is severely depressed by density
                    dependence and migration mortality, and the population tends to decline rapidly
                    and return to the endemic cycle.</p>

        <title>Evolutionary dynamics</title>
        <p>The Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) is a central theoretical concept in ecology,
                    behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology. The term was first coined by
                    Fretwell and Lucas in 1970 to 1971, and has been of central importance in theory
                    development and studies for a range of ecological and evolutionary systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Fretwell1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Cressman1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Haugen1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-vanBaalen1">[39]</xref>. It
                    describes the way in which animals distribute themselves among resource patches,
                    stating that individual animals will aggregate proportionately to the amount of
                    resources available in each patch. So for instance, if patch A contains twice as
                    much food as patch B, there will be twice as many individuals foraging in patch
                    A as in patch B. The relationship with evolutionary game theory is that when an
                    IFD is achieved, no individual can do better by changing patch. Simple IFDs are
                    rarely observed in nature, as imperfect information, unequal competitive
                    abilities, time lags and costs of redistribution can inhibit the formation of an
                    IFD. However, it is a very useful null assumption, because systematic deviations
                    from it alerts us to the existence of costs and/or constrains that need to be
                    accounted for, or to search for a cause of maladaptive behavior.</p>
        <p>The density at which living trees are settled is determined by the beetles'
                    evolved “expectations” of density dependence, but also migration
                    mortality and probability of successfully colonizing living trees. Thus, the
                    patchy and unpredictable distribution of dead trees is a prerequisite for the
                    risky colonization strategy to arise.</p>
        <p>As long as redistribution is penalized, there is a considerable population
                    density interval over which individuals settling in living trees, despite the
                    risks from tree defences, have higher expected reproductive output than those in
                    dead trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>), thus
                    deviating from the IFD. However, selection for aggressiveness is decreased at
                    very high densities, and reversed at very low densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>), and as all populations exhausting
                    their local host base quicker than it replenishes sooner or later are likely to
                    return to low population densities, selection is highly unlikely to stay
                    directional. As the selective pressure changes depending on the time scale of
                    population fluctuations, this suggests a fitness premium on rapid trait
                    selection such as maternal or epigenetic effects. Such rapid responses to
                    selection would materialize as heterogeneities in aggressive behaviour between
                    otherwise genetically homogenous populations. (It also suggests that if some
                    species could redistribute so as to follow the IFD, this would be antagonistic
                    to the evolution of aggressive strategies, as the best a beetle could hope for
                    when initiating a risky attack on a healthy host would be to break even with its
                    conspecifics in the same patch.)</p>
        <p>The “random sampling coefficient” τ represents a little explored
                    effect of beetle behaviour. It denotes the proportion of beetles in a patch that
                    will sample one or more trees by burrowing, and thus contribute to the depletion
                    of tree defences, before they decide to settle in a dead tree. The density
                    threshold at which colonization occurs increases markedly with low values of
                    τ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>), suggesting
                    that species with finely grained host localisation will have fewer
                    outbreaks.</p>
        <p>Simulations of the model suggests that there is selection for different levels of
                    “aggressiveness” depending on population density (N) relative to
                    defence threshold (T) and landscape connectivity/patch abundance (Ω).</p>

                    still living than in dead trees at the same sites, despite a clear general

                    fat means less chance of surviving to find another host. The SRD model implies
                    that an adaptive reaction norm to signs of increasing migration risk include a
                    higher propensity for attacking trees. Thus, beetles emerging from crowded,
                    brood trees should be more likely to start an infestation close to their
                    parental tree instead of migrating, both due to their density and to their lower
                    energy reserves.

                    increasing migration risk as the season progresses
                    (ω<sub>1</sub> = −2,

                    no beetle would take the risk of initiating an attack on a living tree, and the
                    shape is consistent with the SRD general function choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g005">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p>

                    when the dead trees nearby were colonized at high density, as measured by

                    trees with decreased defences (low T) (i.e., trees with partial root contact)

The bimodal density dependence
                suggests that zones of moderate beetle density may attract individuals from
                surrounding areas, facilitating waves of attack emanating from outbreak patches. A
                good example may be the <italic>D. ponderosae</italic> on the Chilcotin Plateau,
                where strong spatial and temporal dependencies at small scales (&lt;18 km), indicate

                increasing gallery densities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Weslien1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Zhang2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Wallin1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Eriksson1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Robins1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Anderbrant1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Gilbert1">[51]</xref>. Whatever the consequences for the residents,
                late-arriving beetles will be selected for entering a crowded bole. The exception
                would be under strong kin selection, which is unlikely in widely dispersing species
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Allender1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Sall1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Franklin2">[43]</xref>. We see that
                simply dividing the number of beetles on the available resources may give wrong
                estimates of population growth and stability properties, as the population
                distributions may not follow an IFD or maximize tree colonization.</p>
      <p>The exact host defence threshold (T) only matters when it is higher than the beetle
                density at which crowding occur in dead trees, meaning that there is no fixed
                defence threshold below which trees become at risk (complicating predictive risk
                models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Nelson2">[17]</xref>).
                Thus, the gallery densities found in colonized trees are not just a reflection of
                how many beetles it takes to kill a tree, but the risk of initiating a colonization
                attempt in a living tree. This is in accordance with the observation that even
                healthy hosts can be successfully colonized if pheromone-baited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Raffa3">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>When the SRD and IFD deviate, the “random landing” on a stand scale
                observed for several species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-SaintGermain1">[30]</xref> may be adaptive: beetles sampling living trees may
                increase their fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>)
                by being more likely to become part of an early-stage attack on a living tree than
                beetles that steer directly to the available dead trees. The exploratory landing
                pattern is therefore in a feedback relationship with aggressiveness, as less
                aggressive species will have less to gain by exploratory sampling of living hosts,
                which again makes colonization less likely and selects for more precise localisation
                of dead hosts etc. Landing and search patterns are thus predicted to also shape
                larger-scale spatial dynamics: if the beetles do not sample living hosts to assess
                defence levels and quality, and are “invisible” to each other while
                flying (i.e., not emitting pheromones), no living trees will be colonized without
                sufficient dead hosts nearby to inform beetles about high conspecific densities.
                Thus landing patterns determine to what degree epidemics can start at random
                locations and spread efficiently through healthy forests.</p>
      <p>The deviation from the IDF may point to a feedback process facilitating the evolution
                of aggressiveness: as sex pheromones easily lead to beetles aggregating in
                considerable numbers there is a fitness gain from settling in a living but possibly
                succumbing tree at the right moment. However, the expected fitness differences
                converge when dead wood is scarce and beetle densities are high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018274-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>), and the selection
                pressure is reversed when resource depletion, density dependence or reduced survival
                (cold winters, predation, etc.) depresses the population below the threshold where
                successful colonization is likely. Thus, “aggressiveness” in bark
                beetles and their associated fungi seem likely to exist in a state of evolutionary
                flux or cycles. As heritability on the traits shaping aggressiveness might be
                mediated through maternal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Mousseau1">[52]</xref> and epigenetic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Bossdorf1">[53]</xref> effects as well as allele
                differences, this may explain evidence for multiple strategies and strongly
                heritable differences between individuals and populations of the same species when
                it comes to aggressiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Raffa2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Raffa3">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Wallin1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Pureswaran1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Wallin2">[55]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Also, the similarities in selective forces and starting points suggest that
                aggressive life strategies may easily have evolved independently from non-aggressive
                ancestors in different genera such as <italic>Ips</italic> and
                    <italic>Dendroctonus</italic>.</p>
      <p>If beetles continue to be aware of the rest of the patch after starting to burrow
                into a host, and can relocate without fitness costs, they will distribute
                proportionally between dead and live trees, and an IFD state will be reached.
                However, once gallery construction has begun, this is not likely to be the case.
                Beetles may re-emerge to start a second brood after some time, but for the purposes
                of this model, any re-emerged individuals are treated as new arrivals and fitness is
                calculated per brood. The possibility of re-emergence is an incentive to breed as
                soon as possible. For some individuals, it may still be adaptive to “wait and
                see” instead of being the first to attack, and the complex pheromone systems
                of many bark beetles show signs of individual variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Raffa4">[42]</xref>. But time is limited, and the
                beetles with the least fat reserves must commit first, enforcing the sequential
                individual decisions driving the SRD.</p>
      <p>While increasing migration range generally may increase the range of spatial
                synchrony, this may not be the case under chaotic or strongly resource-driven
                population dynamics, with consequences for adaptive dispersal patterns. Everything
                else being equal, species with a lower cost of migration are less prone to attack
                living trees. But when they do, the epidemics may be more prolonged, as individuals
                can migrate away rather than cause population crashes. Similarly, if early settlers
                can monopolize gallery space, density dependence will rarely cause populations to
                crash.</p>
      <p>Integrating data and processes on different scales is difficult, but these results
                show the need to examine population models for implicit evolutionary assumptions,
                and doing so generates hypotheses that may explain otherwise puzzling aspects of the
                species' ecology. In general, the inherent bistability and strong endogenous
                feedbacks of bark beetle systems makes them particularly sensitive to perturbations
                such as climate change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Raffa1">[3]</xref>, and adaptations to rapidly fluctuating selective
                pressures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018274-Mousseau1">[52]</xref>
                may allow species to respond quickly to ecological changes such as decreased host
                defences following changes in climate or forestry.</p>
