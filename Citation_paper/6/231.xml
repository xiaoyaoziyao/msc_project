          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Wnt signaling is important in development and can also contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. The Secreted Frizzled Related Proteins (SFRPs) constitute a family of Wnt modulators, crucial for controlling Wnt signaling. Here we investigate the expression and role of SFRP3 in melanoma.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We show that SFRP3 mRNA is down-regulated in malignant melanoma tumors as compared to normal/benign tissue. Furthermore, we found that SFRP3 expression was lost in the malignant melanoma cell lines, A2058, HTB63 and A375, but not in the non-transformed melanocyte cell line, Hermes 3A. Methylated CpG rich areas were detected in the SFRP3 gene in melanoma cell lines and their SFRP3 expression could be restored using the demethylating agent, 5′aza-deoxycytidine. Addition of recombinant SFRP3 to melanoma cells had no effect on viable cell numbers, but decreased cell migration and invasion. Wnt5a signaling has been shown to increase the migration and invasion of malignant melanoma cells, and high expression of Wnt5a in melanoma tumors has been connected to a poor prognosis. We found that recombinant SFRP3 could inhibit Wnt5a signaling, and that it inhibited melanoma cell migration and invasion in a Wnt5a-dependent manner.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion/Significance</title>
          <p>We conclude that SFRP3 functions as a melanoma migration and invasion suppressor by interfering with Wnt5a signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Wnt signaling is essential in many different biological processes during development and tissue maintenance. Tight homeostatic control of Wnt signaling is crucial for the organism, as aberrant Wnt signaling can lead to developmental defects and plays important roles in many cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Chien1">[1]</xref>. The Frizzled proteins are a family of G-protein coupled receptors considered to be the principal receptors for Wnt proteins. However, there are also other putative Wnt receptors such as Ror2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Mikels1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-OConnell1">[3]</xref>. All Wnt-ligands and most of their cognate receptors contain a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), through which their binding is thought to be mediated. Activation of Wnt signaling by proteins such as Wnt3a and Wnt1 activates canonical signaling that leads to inhibition of β-catenin proteolytic degradation. This results in β-catenin accumulation and subsequent transcription of β-catenin-dependent promoters via interaction with transcription factors such as TCF/Lef. In contrast, non-canonical Wnt signaling activated for example by Wnt5a and Wnt11, inhibits the transcriptional activation of β-catenin but also triggers calcium signaling and JNK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-OConnell2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Rao1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Control of Wnt signaling is executed by a variety of different modulators including the Dickkopf proteins, the Wnt Inhibitory Factor-1 and LRP5/6 Wnt co-receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Chien1">[1]</xref>. Wnt signaling is also regulated via the family of Secreted Frizzled-Related Proteins (SFRPs). There are five human SFRPs and all contain a CRD homologous to the Frizzled CRD, which binds to Wnt ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Chong1">[6]</xref>. SFRP proteins can inhibit activation of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Jones1">[7]</xref>. All SFRP members also share a conserved Netrin domain in common with tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases and Netrin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Banyai1">[8]</xref>. SFRPs are down-regulated in several cancers and this is often correlated with poor prognosis, as has been shown for breast, colorectal, and a number of other cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Shi1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Wnt signaling affects malignant melanoma progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Chien1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-OConnell2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Larue1">[10]</xref>. Malignant melanoma comprises about 4% of skin cancers and 80% of skin cancer deaths are related to malignant melanoma due to its highly metastatic behavior. Once melanoma has spread there are currently few effective treatment options, thus there is a great need for a better understanding of melanoma progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Houghton1">[11]</xref>. Wnt signaling is crucial for cell fate determination of melanocytes from neural crest progenitor cells, and is connected to malignant melanoma development in several ways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Larue1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Larue2">[12]</xref>. Canonical Wnt signaling leads to differentiation and decreased proliferation of melanoma cells, and non-canonical signaling antagonizes this effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Chien2">[13]</xref>. Non-canonical signaling also increases the migration and metastatic potential of melanoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Dissanayake1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Weeraratna1">[15]</xref>. Increased expression of Wnt5a in malignant melanoma tumors is correlated with poor prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-DaForno1">[16]</xref>. Conversely, canonical signaling leads to better prognosis in melanoma patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Chien2">[13]</xref>. Currently the role of Wnt modulators in melanoma is poorly characterized.</p>
      <p>Here, we show reduced SFRP3 expression in malignant melanoma tissues and cell lines compared to normal cells. We demonstrate that this down-regulation is related to methylation of the SFRP3 gene. Addition of SFRP3 to melanoma cells had no effect on the number of viable cells, but decreased migration and invasion in a Wnt5a-dependent manner. This work suggests that SFRP3 functions as a migration and invasion suppressor in malignant melanoma.</p>

        <title>SFRP3 mRNA is reduced in melanoma</title>
        <p>The expression levels of SFRP3 mRNA were analyzed using two microarray datasets, GDS1375 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Talantov1">[17]</xref> and GDS1989 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Smith1">[18]</xref>, from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Edgar1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The samples were categorized as two groups, normal skin or benign nevi (normal/benign) and melanoma. In both datasets, there was a statistically significant difference between the normal/benign and the melanoma groups. To further investigate SFRP3 expression in melanoma we used one non-transformed immortalized human melanocyte cell line, Hermes 3A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-GraySchopfer1">[20]</xref>, and three human melanoma cell lines, A375, A2058 and HTB63. We analyzed SFRP3 mRNA levels using reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) and SFRP3 protein levels using an ELISA kit and immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g001">Figure 1C, 1D, 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018674.s001">S1</xref>). Low expression of SFRP3 mRNA was detected in the three melanoma cell lines in contrast to the higher expression in the melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The same was true at the protein level; the ELISA kit detected higher SFRP3 levels in the melanocyte media than in the melanoma cell media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The same pattern was also observed when the intracellular SFRP3 protein levels were analyzed and quantified by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018674.s001">S1</xref> respectively). The fact that we detect higher SFRP3 protein levels in media from melanocytes than in media from melanoma cells indicates that SFRP3 can exert its function as a secreted Wnt modulator to a greater extent in melanocytes than in melanoma cells.</p>

        <title>Methylation of SFRP3 in melanoma cell lines</title>
        <p>We hypothesized that methylation might be the cause of SFRP3 down-regulation in malignant melanoma tissue and cell lines. To analyze possible methylation of the SFRP3 gene, the gene sequence and promoter region of SFRP3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Kent1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Li1">[22]</xref> were analyzed for CpG rich areas and one was found in the first exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This region was analyzed using methylation specific PCR in Hermes 3A melanocytes and the malignant melanoma cell lines A375, A2058 and HTB63. Methylated DNA was not present in Hermes 3A cells. However, methylated DNA was present in all three melanoma cell lines, using universally unmethylated and methylated DNA as controls, suggesting that the methylation could be a cancer specific event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In melanoma cells that had been treated with 5′aza-deoxycytidine (5′AZA) there was a decrease in methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This data indicates that in malignant melanoma cells, there are methylated CpG sites in the SFRP3 gene that can be demethylated, whereas in melanocytes no methylated CpG sites could be detected. To investigate whether this methylation had a functional effect on expression of SFRP3, we used RT-QPCR and immunofluorescence. Upon treatment with 5′AZA, expression of SFRP3 mRNA did not increase in the melanocytes but there was an increase in all the melanoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We also detected increased SFRP3 protein levels in the melanoma cell lines after demethylation treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g002">Figures 2D, 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018674.s002">S2</xref>). In HTB63 cells, the increase in SFRP3 protein level was detected in media but not intracellularly. These data suggest that the SFRP3 gene is methylated in malignant melanoma cells but not in melanocytes and that expression and secretion of SFRP3 can be restored in malignant melanoma cells following demethylation.</p>

        <p>As Wnt signaling plays a role in melanoma progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-OConnell2">[4]</xref>, we investigated the effects of SFRP3 on proliferation/survival, migration and invasion.

We next investigated the effects of rSFRP3 on migration and invasion. The effect of rSFRP3 on invasion of A2058 cells was analyzed using a 3D Matrigel invasion assay. A2058 cells treated with 1 µg/ml rSFRP3 or carrier (0.1% BSA in PBS) were allowed to invade for 24 h. There was a statistically significant decrease in the number of invaded cells when treated with rSFRP3 as compared to carrier-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

        <p>To investigate the effects on migration more directly, we performed wound healing assays where A2058 cells were grown to confluency and treated with carrier or rSFRP3 after which scratches were made in the monolayer. Images were taken of the scratches after 0, 16, 24 and 48 h and the scratch area was analyzed at each time point. rSFRP3 treatment significantly decreased the migration of A2058 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To further analyze the effects of SFRP3 on melanoma cell migration, time-lapse microscopy was used. A2058 cells were treated with 1 µg/ml rSFRP3 or carrier and the speed of migration was tracked manually. Cell migration speed was decreased with rSFRP3 treatment over a 12-hour period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Taken together our data show that, in malignant melanoma cells, treatment with rSFRP3 has an inhibitory effect on cell migration and invasion.</p>
        <p>In order to investigate possible mechanisms behind the decrease in migration and invasion induced by SFRP3 in A2058 cells, we investigated the expression of Wnt5a in these cells since Wnt5a is the only Wnt protein seen to increase migration and invasion of melanoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Weeraratna1">[15]</xref>. We detected significantly more Wnt5a protein in HTB63 cells compared to A2058 cells, in accordance with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Jenei1">[23]</xref>. The upper band most likely represents glycosylated Wnt5a, which is the secreted and functional form of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Consequently, Wnt5a is expressed in small amounts in the A2058 cells and therefore SFRP3 treatment could be assumed to have a limited effect on Wnt5a-dependent functions.</p>

        <p>As the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway has been found to be important for the invasive capacities of Wnt5a in melanoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Jenei1">[23]</xref>, we analyzed the effect of SFRP3 on Wnt5a induced intracellular calcium signaling. A2058 cells were serum starved and pre-treated with carrier or rSFRP3 for 24 h before measuring intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling induced by rWnt5a. In carrier pre-treated cells Wnt5a induced a prominent increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, a signal that was inhibited by more than 50% in cells that were pre-treated with rSFRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next investigated if inhibition of Wnt5a signaling by SFRP3 was also the mechanism of the inhibition of migration observed by stimulation of melanoma cells with rSFRP3. Wnt5a expression was down-regulated in A2058 cells using siRNA. siRNA transfected cells were treated with either carrier or 1 µg/ml rSFRP3 and differences in migration were traced manually using time-lapse microscopy. In cells transfected with scrambled siRNA there was a decrease in migration upon rSFRP3 treatment. Interestingly, there was no decrease in migration after treatment with SFRP3 in cells where Wnt5a had been knocked down, suggesting that SFRP3 inhibits migration in melanoma cells via inhibition of Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The knock-down of Wnt5a was validated on the RNA and protein level by RT-QPCR and western blot, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018674.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g005">5B</xref>). In order to further validate if SFRP3 could inhibit migration induced by Wnt5a, A2058 cells were pre-treated with rSFRP3 or carrier in serum free media for 24 h after which rWnt5a was added. rWnt5a increased the migration of A2058 cells and this increase was inhibited in cells pre-treated with rSFRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

        <p>To complement this finding, we investigated the effects of SFRP3 in the melanoma HTB63 cells which have a higher Wnt5a expression compared to A2058 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). However, we saw no effect of 1 µg/ml of rSFRP3 on migration of these cells (data not shown), which could be due to too low a concentration of SFRP3 to have an inhibitory effect on migration of cells with a high endogenous expression level of Wnt5a. To overcome this problem we used conditioned medium from HTB63 cells transfected with a SFRP3 vector (CM-SFRP3, expression validated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018674.s005">Figure S5</xref>) or an empty vector (CM-EV) in order to investigate the effect of SFRP3 in HTB63 cells. In migration experiments using time-lapse microscopy there was a pronounced and statistically significant decrease in migration of cells treated with CM-SFRP3 compared to cells treated with CM-EV for 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018674-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). The large decrease of HTB63 cell migration upon CM-SFRP3 treatment is in agreement with the high level of Wnt5a in these cells. Consequently these data are in line with the previous assumption that SFRP3 inhibits migration in melanoma cells by inhibiting Wnt5a signaling.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present finding, that mRNA expression levels are lower in malignant melanoma tissue than in normal skin/benign nevi is in agreement with our observation that the SFRP3 gene is methylated in melanoma cell lines but not in the Hermes 3A melanocyte cell line. SFRP3 down-regulation has been demonstrated in other cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Kongkham1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Lee1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Mandal1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Marsit1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-McRonald1">[33]</xref>, and it was speculated that the cause for SFRP3 down-regulation could be loss of heterozygosity in the SFRP3 loci, 2q31-33 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Lee1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Mandal1">[31]</xref>. However, in parallel it was found that the other members of the SFRP family (SFRP1, -2, -4 and -5) were methylated in different types of cancer, such as breast and colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Suzuki1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Suzuki2">[35]</xref>. One of these studies reports no methylation of the SFRP3 gene and presumably because of this, many subsequent studies of SFRPs in cancer have not investigated SFRP3 methylation. However, McRonald <italic>et al.</italic> detected down-regulation of SFRP3 mRNA due to methylation in a global methylation analysis of renal cell carcinoma patient material. Furthermore, Kongkham <italic>et al.</italic> has detected methylation of SFRP3 in medulloblastoma, and Marsit <italic>et al.</italic> reported increased methylation of the SFRP3 gene in invasive bladder cancer compared to non-invasive cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Kongkham1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Marsit1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-McRonald1">[33]</xref>. Taken together with previous reports on the methylation of SFRP3 in other cancers, our data suggests that gene methylation is a major reason for the down-regulation of SFRP3 in malignant melanoma.</p>
      <p>Wnt5a signaling has been demonstrated to affect motility of melanoma whereas SFRP3 has been shown to reduce growth and motility in other types of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-OConnell2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Zi1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Guo1">[37]</xref>. Therefore, we speculated that down-regulation of SFRP3 might affect the Wnt5a-driven aggressiveness of melanoma. We detected a decrease in migration and invasion in A2058 cells upon SFRP3 treatment. Since Wnt5a increases migration and invasion of melanoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Weeraratna1">[15]</xref>, these findings supported our idea that inhibition of Wnt5a signaling could be the mechanism by which SFRP3 decreased the migration and invasion of A2058 cells. SFRP3 could inhibit Wnt5a signaling but did not induce canonical signaling nor did it inhibit canonical signaling induced by Wnt3a. SFRP3 could also inhibit Wnt5a induced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, a functional molecular read-out of Wnt5a signaling. In A2058 cells in which Wnt5a had been down-regulated by siRNA, the inhibitory effect on migration of SFRP3 was lost. Also, when Wnt5a was added to A2058 cells, migration was increased and SFRP3 was found to be able to inhibit this effect. In HTB63 cells that express a higher level of Wnt5a, conditioned media from SFRP3 over-expressing cells caused a large decrease in migration. Our assumption that SFRP3-mediated inhibition of Wnt5a is the mechanism by which it affects melanoma cell migration, readily explains the relatively small effect of SFRP3 on migration and invasion in A2058 cells with low expression of Wnt5a.</p>
      <p>The inhibitory effect of SFRPs can occur either by their ability to bind Wnt receptors and induce signaling on their own or by inhibiting Wnt signaling through binding Wnt proteins or their receptors. The first option is for several reasons unlikely in the present context. First, SFRP3 alone did not induce canonical signaling in the Topflash assay. Secondly, SFRP3 had no effect by itself on migration in Wnt5a-depleted cells. We therefore conclude that the effects of SFRP3 on melanoma cell migration are due to impaired Wnt5a signaling, either via binding between the CRD of SFRPs to the CRD of the Wnt protein or its receptors, in accordance with previous findings in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Dann1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Rodriguez1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Wang1">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The notion that SFRP3 affects melanoma cell migration via modulation of Wnt5a signaling is supported by numerous studies on how Wnt5a regulates melanoma cell migration. For example, Wnt5a can mediate migration via PKC activation, by inducing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), by inhibiting metastasis suppressors such as matrix metalloproteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Dissanayake2">[41]</xref> and by regulating expression of tumor antigens via STAT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Dissanayake1">[14]</xref>. Although not related to Wnt5a signaling, SFRP3 has been shown to reverse EMT, decrease activity and expression of matrix metalloproteases and decrease activation of β-catenin in other types of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Zi1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018674-Guo1">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, our data reveal that SFRP3 expression is down-regulated in malignant melanoma tissue and melanoma cells and can be restored in malignant melanoma cell lines following demethylation of the SFRP3 gene. Functionally, addition of SFRP3 to these cell lines decreased their migration and invasion. This effect is readily explained by SFRP3-induced inhibition of Wnt5a signaling. These data suggest that SFRP3 acts as a metastasis suppressor in malignant melanoma.</p>
