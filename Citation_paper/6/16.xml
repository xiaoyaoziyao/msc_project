        <p>A new device was designed to generate a localized mechanical vibration of flexible gels where human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured to mechanically stimulate these cells at subcellular locations. A Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based calcium biosensor (an improved Cameleon) was used to monitor the spatiotemporal distribution of intracellular calcium concentrations in the cells upon this mechanical stimulation. A clear increase in intracellular calcium concentrations over the whole cell body (global) can be observed in the majority of cells under mechanical stimulation. The chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA or the blockage of stretch-activated calcium channels on the plasma membrane with streptomycin or gadolinium chloride significantly inhibited the calcium responses upon mechanical stimulation. Thapsigargin, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium pump inhibitor, or U73122, a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, resulted in mainly local calcium responses occurring at regions close to the stimulation site. The disruption of actin filaments with cytochalasin D or inhibition of actomyosin contractility with ML-7 also inhibited the global calcium responses. Therefore, the global calcium response in HUVEC depends on the influx of calcium through membrane stretch-activated channels, followed by the release of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) via PLC activation to trigger the ER calcium release. Our newly developed mechanical stimulation device can also provide a powerful tool for the study of molecular mechanism by which cells perceive the mechanical cues at subcellular levels.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mechanical cues, such as substrate properties and mechanical forces, can affect a wide variety of cell behaviors and diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Ingber1">[1]</xref>. For example, the substrate stiffness where cells are cultured can be determinant to the differentiation of stem cells, embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Engler1">[2]</xref>, and cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Lo1">[3]</xref>. Different patterns of fluid shear stress may also be related to the development of atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-White1">[4]</xref>. However, it remains unclear how cells perceive mechanical forces and correspondingly coordinate intracellular molecular signals.</p>
      <p>Different techniques have emerged to allow the analysis of influence of mechanical forces in cellular biochemistry. For example, by adjusting the suction forces, patch-clamp techniques can induce the conformational changes of ion channels and the alteration of their properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Maroto1">[5]</xref>. Force can also be applied to cells through fluid shear stress in a flow chamber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-White1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Hong1">[6]</xref> or by stretching a flexible substrate where the cells are plated on, such as a silicone membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Sung1">[7]</xref>. Another way to deliver mechanical forces is through laser tweezers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Finer1">[8]</xref>, where a laser trap system is able to apply and measure forces on a cell-bound bead in the order of pN. Beads previously attached to the cell membrane can also be used to apply force from a glass probe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Hayakawa1">[9]</xref> or simply from a magnetic field, if the beads are magnetized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Feneberg1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Na1">[11]</xref>. Glass probes were also shown to touch the cells and evoke calcium signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Hamilton1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The intracellular calcium concentration has been shown to play crucial roles in a variety of physiological consequences and is sensitive to mechanical cues. In fact, shear stress can cause the rise of intracellular calcium concentration, which is involved in many signaling pathways, like the production of nitric oxide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Hong1">[6]</xref>. When actin stress fibers were directly stretched by optical tweezers or when fibronectin-coated beads previously attached to the apical surface of the cell were moved, stretch-activated calcium channels can be opened to trigger the alteration of intracellular calcium signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Hayakawa1">[9]</xref>. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration can also be observed to propagate among astroglial cells after mechanical stimulation by a glass probe touch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Hamilton1">[12]</xref>. Other reports indicate that the local deformation of a cell substrate caused an increase in intracellular calcium concentration of NIH3T3 cells, accompanied by changes in traction forces and cell orientation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Munevar1">[13]</xref>. Calcium can also be involved in actomyosin contractility to regulate the tension in stress fibers. In fact, calcium was shown to change mechanical properties of cells, such as the stiffness of apical surfaces in HUVECs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Feneberg1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To visualize intracellular calcium concentration in real time with high spatiotemporal resolution, one could use calcium dyes, such as Fura-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Williams1">[14]</xref>. Another way is to use genetically encoded molecular biosensors. For example, Cameleon, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor based on the interacting pair Calmodulin and M13, can allow the detection of intracellular calcium concentration with high precision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Miyawaki1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Palmer1">[16]</xref>. These biosensors have the advantage over calcium dyes of targeting subcellular regions or compartments instead of being diffused in the cytoplasm as a typical dye does <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Seong1">[17]</xref>. We have previously discovered a FRET pair, ECFP and YPet, which allows a high sensitivity for the detection of a variety of molecular activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Na1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Seong1">[17]</xref>. The FRET pair in Cameleon was also replaced by ECFP and YPet and applied throughout this work to monitor the mechanical-force-induced calcium signaling.</p>
      <p>In this work, a mechanical stimulation was applied to a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) by vibrating a probe positioned close to the cell on an elastic gel. The vibration of the gel caused deformations over a limited distance from the probe and the cell received only a local stimulation at subcellular levels. Cells were shown to have a significant calcium response upon this mechanical stimulation, which is dependent on the coordinated calcium influx across the plasma membrane as well as the calcium release from ER.</p>

        <p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), pooled from multiple donors, were generously provided by Prof. Shu Chien's laboratory (University of California, San Diego). The cells were cultured in 60×15 mm cell culture dishes (Corning) in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C and passed when achieved confluency. Growth medium was changed every other day or when the confluency reached 70% or more. The growth medium was composed by 25% Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (Cell Applications, 211–500), 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (Atlanta Biologicals, S11050H), 52% Medium 199 (Gibco, 11150), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco, 15140), 1% L-Glutamine (Gibco, 25030) and 1% Sodium Pyruvate (Gibco, 11360).</p>

        <title>Genetically encoded FRET biosensor</title>
        <p>A genetically encoded FRET biosensor based on ECFP and YPet was used to monitor the intracellular calcium concentration as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Na1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Miyawaki1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Seong1">[17]</xref>. The method of choice for delivering the DNA into the cell was the adenovirus infection (Adeno-X Expression System 1, Clontech), in which the biosensor plasmid was incorporated. Between 16 and 18 hr before the infection, the cells were passed from a confluent dish into a 35×10 mm glass-bottom dish. The cells were then infected with the adenovirus carrying the FRET biosensor and the infected medium was changed to normal growth medium after 4 hr of incubation. In the next day, the infected cells were passed to polyacrylamide gel dishes at the count of around 1,000 cells/dish. These gel dishes were ready for the vibration experiments about 20 hr later.</p>

        <title>Polyacrylamide gel preparation</title>
        <p>The polyacrylamide gel dishes were prepared according to a well-established protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Lo1">[3]</xref> with the following reagents: Acrylamide at 8% (40% solution stock, Bio-Rad, 161-0140), Bis at 0.13% (2% solution stock, Bio-Rad, 161-0142), TEMED at 1∶2000 (Bio-Rad, 161-0801) and 10% w/v Amonium Persulfate at 1∶200 (Bio-Rad, 161-0700) in 10 mM HEPES buffer (Sigma, H4034). The stiffness of the gels was 20 kPa approximately <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Tang1">[18]</xref>. The gels were cast on 35×10 mm glass-bottom dishes using a 12 mm round cover glass (Fisher, 12-545-80) to shape the droplet of gel solution. The volume of the gel solution droplet was calculated to allow an average thickness of 70 µm. To obtain the gel with beads, a second layer of polyacrylamide with embedded beads was prepared on top of the clear gel layer in a similar fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Bridgman1">[19]</xref>, resulting in almost all of the beads in a single layer and at the same focal plane when observed through a 40×/0.75 objective. In brief, the solution for the polyacrylamide was mixed with a 1 µm-bead suspension (Invitrogen, F-8821) at 1∶250. A small amount of this gel solution containing beads was applied on top of the first gel layer and pressed by a cover glass on top to create a very thin polymerized gel layer embedded with beads (around &lt;1 µm). Measurements of the thickness of these 2 combined layers with a calibrated micrometer showed no noticeable difference in thickness when compared to that of the first gel layer alone. The beads were also confirmed to localize at the same focal plane when observed through the microscope. To allow cell attachment, gel surfaces were then coated with the UV-activatable cross-linker Sulfo-SANPAH (Thermo Scientific, 22589). After the activation, the gel is coated with bovine fibronectin (Sigma, F1141) at 2 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> and maintained in the cell culture incubator overnight. The gels were rinsed with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and incubated in growth medium for 15 min before the cells were passed and seeded on them.</p>

        <title>Stimulation equipment</title>
        <p>The stimulation equipment was designed to insert the probe tip in the substrate gel and cause a vibration of the gel where cells were seeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026181-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, upper left panel). The probe tip consists of a glass capillary prepared by a micropipette puller and had a diameter of approximately 50 µm. The probe tip was mounted on a small aluminum rod attached to a small XYZ stage (Newport MT-XYZ model), which serves as a connector to an aluminum arm mounted on a larger XYZ linear stage (Newport 461 Series) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026181-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, large XYZ stage in red). The tip was precisely positioned by the larger XYZ linear stage 13 µm away from the cell edge and 25 µm deep penetrating into the substrate. Once positioned, the vibration mechanism was activated, locally vibrating the substrate and stimulating the cell. The vibration was dependent on an aluminum block clamped to the aluminum arm via a sheet of spring steel. The vibration was triggered by removing a spacer between the aluminum block and the arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026181-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, aluminum block in green, spacer in blue). The resultant collision between the block and arm initiated a vibration, which was propagated through the structure and transmitted to the gel substrate by the small aluminum rod and probe tip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026181.s001">Video S1</xref>).</p>

        <p>To keep the cell environment stable during imaging and vibration stimulation, a chamber was designed to allow the access of the probe to the cell dish as well as the constant entry of pre-mixed and humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (along with 10% O<sub>2</sub> and 85% N<sub>2</sub>). A controlled heater (Nevtek ASI 400) was connected to maintain the temperature around 37°C throughout the experiment in the chamber.</p>

        <title>Imaging</title>
        <p>A Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with an oil-immersed 40×/1.3 objective was controlled by a computer through the software MetaFluor 6.3r7 (Molecular Devices) to obtain the live cell images of the biosensor FRET signals. The xenon arc lamp can excite the donor fluorophore ECFP by using a 420/20 nm filter. 475/40 nm and 535/25 nm filters were used to observe the emissions from the donor (ECFP) and acceptor (YPet), respectively. For all samples, the cells were imaged for a few minutes to record the basal FRET ratio. The imaging was then paused to place the probe tip in position and resumed immediately after the mechanical stimulation was triggered.</p>
        <p>For the vibration characterization, a fast camera (Vision Research Phantom v9.1) with 1,000 frames/second capacity was coupled to a phase contrast microscope with a 40×/0.75 objective to image the trajectory of the probe tip and the displacement caused on the flexible substrate gel containing beads. An extra halogen light was employed to obtain enough illumination for the high frame rates.

        <p>Live cell images of the biosensors were captured and analyzed by MetaFluor 6.3r7. In the screenshot captured by the camera, the probe tip was positioned below the monitored cell and vibrated in the horizontal direction. The cell was divided vertically in three regions with equal height: (1) closer to the probe, (2) middle of the cell, and (3) farther from the probe. The FRET ratio was calculated from each region by dividing the average intensity of YPet by that of ECFP. The classification of response in global or local depended on the ratios of FRET signal over the regions closer and farther from the probe. The response was deemed global if the stimulated FRET increase on the farthest region away from the probe was at least half of that in the closest region. Otherwise, the response was deemed local. This criterion is systematic and robust, which allowed the comparison between different groups with statistical means and significance. If the ratio change upon stimulation remained within 10% of the basal level, it was considered as non-responsive. A region not covered by the cells and away from the probe tip was selected to assess the background signal and subtracted from each image.</p>
        <p>To characterize the vibration, the images from the fast camera were analyzed using an ImageJ (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij" xlink:type="simple">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>; developed by Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) plugin, bUnwarpJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-ArgandaCarreras1">[20]</xref>. This plugin was used to compare the position of the beads between two frames: a frame displaced by the probe motion and a reference frame with the probe merely positioned but not moving. Matlab (MathWorks) was applied to reconstruct the displacement map obtained from bUnwarpJ, plotting it as a colormap combined with the vectors for a convenient and clear comprehension of the data. A colormap for the strain at each point was also calculated and plotted, with vectors denoting the displacement directions. The total strain <italic>E</italic> was calculated as:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026181.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where E<sub>x</sub> and E<sub>y</sub> are the strain in x and y axis.<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026181.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where u<sub>x</sub> and u<sub>y</sub> are the displacements in x and y axis, with each derivative numerically calculated by finite differences (2-point estimation for the boundaries, 3-point estimation for interior points).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this work, we have developed a new probe device to mechanically stimulate cells at precisely controlled subcellular locations without the direct contact with cell membrane. The results indicate that a mechanical vibration induced by the device in the substrate gel where cells are seeded can mainly cause global calcium responses of the cells. This global response was initiated by the influx of calcium across the stretch-activated channels in the plasma membrane. The subsequent production of IP3 via PLC activation triggers the calcium release from ER to cause a global intracellular calcium fluctuation over the whole cell body. This global calcium response was also shown to depend on actomyosin contractility and F-actin integrity, probably controlling the membrane stretch-activated channels. This whole mechanistic scenario is summarized in the diagram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026181-g006">Figure 6</xref>.</p>

      <p>Although a simple stretch of the substrate gel with a micro-needle has been nicely employed to mechanically stimulate cells by Krishnan et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Krishnan1">[36]</xref>, the high temporal frequency and repeated pattern of the vibration stimulation of our system should be able to elicit a stronger and robust signal. Indeed, when the stimulation was manually applied while maintaining the same magnitude of stretch, no calcium response was observed in the cells (data not shown). This is consistent with a previous report that mechanical stimulation with a faster transient acceleration rate can trigger stronger cellular responses in neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Lusardi1">[37]</xref>. Higher temporal gradients was also more effective than spatial gradients when stimulating endothelial cells with shear stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-White1">[4]</xref>. The strain and strain rate imposed on the substrate in this study were similar to those used for other cell studies involving mechanical stretch and calcium signaling, both towards cell injury: one involving rat primary hippocampal neuronal cells with strains up to 28% in a cycle as short as 70 ms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Lusardi1">[37]</xref>; another involving human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells with applied uniaxial strains up to 30% for 3 sec <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Ito1">[38]</xref>. Thus, the strain and strain rate were larger at regions closer to the probe, which showed the localized nature of the stimulation delivered and was consistent to the region of stronger intracellular calcium rise in local responses. This localized stimulation was essential to study the details of the calcium signaling propagation.</p>
      <p>Hence, the main motivation of our device development was to build a system capable of delivering a local and robust mechanical stimulation with highly integrated spatiotemporal characteristics so that we can investigate the fundamental mechanism of mechanotransduction at subcellular levels. Another advantage of this technique is that it is less invasive to the innate cellular functions since there is no direct contact between the stimulating probe and the cell body, avoiding the possible membrane penetration by the probe or the integrin/cytoskeleton alteration and clustering around the adhesion beads before mechanical stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Feneberg1">[10]</xref>. Therefore, our novel system can also allow a non-invasive mechanical stimulation at subcellular levels. Even though the present work was focused on calcium signaling, it is important to notice that the benefits of using this stimulation device can be extended to other signaling pathways as well. Indeed, the activation of signaling events other than the intracellular calcium may also be sensitive to temporal gradients of mechanical stimulation, such as ERK1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-White1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The extracellular calcium and its influx across the plasma membrane is apparently the trigger of the whole calcium signaling cascade as the chelation of extracellular calcium by EGTA or the blockage of stretch-activated channels on the plasma membrane by streptomycin and gadolinium chloride drastically inhibited the calcium response to mechanical stimulation. The activation of these stretch-activated channels may be mediated by actin cytoskeleton and actomyosin contractility as ML-7 and CytoD both inhibited the mechanical-stimulation-induced calcium response, which is also consistent with previous reports that the activation of stretch-activated channels are mediated by the actin filaments in HUVECs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Hayakawa1">[9]</xref>. It is interesting that the inhibitory effect of CytoD was different from that of ML-7. It is possible that the activation of stretch-activated channels is affected mostly by the cortical actin network and the CytoD treatment may have a less inhibitory effect on short cortical actin networks than on long stress fibers. Blebbistatin should have similar effect as ML-7. However, Blebbistatin was not employed in this study since it introduces intensive background fluorescence which interferes with the wavelengths for the biosensor imaging.</p>
      <p>The PLC/IP3 pathway and ER calcium release are clearly involved in the mechanically induced calcium response as the inhibition of PLCs by U73122 and the depletion of ER calcium by Thapsigargin inhibited the response. PLC-δ is usually inactive at basal calcium concentrations and activated when the intracellular calcium concentration rises <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Guo1">[39]</xref>. Other proteins (such as RhoA and transglutaminase) can also act as regulators to lower the required activation concentration of calcium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Homma1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026181-Im1">[41]</xref>. Thus, it is possible for the rise of the local calcium concentration due to the mechanical stimulated membrane channel opening to activate PLC-δ, triggering the IP3 signaling pathway and ER calcium release to yield a global response.</p>
