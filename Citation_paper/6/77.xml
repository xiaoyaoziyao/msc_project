<abstract>
<p>Isogenic cells sensing identical external signals can take markedly different decisions. Such decisions often correlate with pre-existing cell-to-cell differences in protein levels. When not neglected in signal transduction models, these differences are accounted for in a static manner, by assuming randomly distributed initial protein levels. However, this approach ignores the <italic>a priori</italic> non-trivial interplay between signal transduction and the source of this cell-to-cell variability: temporal fluctuations of protein levels in individual cells, driven by noisy synthesis and degradation. Thus, modeling protein fluctuations, rather than their consequences on the initial population heterogeneity, would set the quantitative analysis of signal transduction on firmer grounds. Adopting this dynamical view on cell-to-cell differences amounts to recast extrinsic variability into intrinsic noise. Here, we propose a generic approach to merge, in a systematic and principled manner, signal transduction models with stochastic protein turnover models. When applied to an established kinetic model of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, our approach markedly increased model prediction capabilities. One obtains a mechanistic explanation of yet-unexplained observations on fractional killing and non-trivial robust predictions of the temporal evolution of cell resistance to TRAIL in HeLa cells. Our results provide an alternative explanation to survival via induction of survival pathways since no TRAIL-induced regulations are needed and suggest that short-lived anti-apoptotic protein Mcl1 exhibit large and rare fluctuations. More generally, our results highlight the importance of accounting for stochastic protein turnover to quantitatively understand signal transduction over extended durations, and imply that fluctuations of short-lived proteins deserve particular attention.</p>

<p>TRAIL induces apoptosis selectively in cancer cells and is currently tested in clinics. Having a mechanistic understanding of TRAIL resistance could help to limit its apparition. Several observations suggested that protein level fluctuations play an important role in TRAIL resistance and its acquisition. However, quantitative, systems-level approaches to investigate their role in cellular decision-making processes are lacking. We propose a generic and principled approach to extend signal transduction models with protein fluctuation models for all proteins in the pathway. The key aspect is to use standard protein fluctuation models for long-lived proteins. We show that its application to TRAIL-induced apoptosis provide a quantitative, mechanistic explanation to previously published but yet unexplained critical observations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing-Ligand (TRAIL) is a promising therapeutic agent against cancer because it induces apoptosis specifically in tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Wiley1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Johnstone1">[3]</xref>. This motivated dozens of clinical trials based on TRAIL-related therapies. However, efficiency was usually limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Dimberg1">[4]</xref>. Most of the molecular events leading from TRAIL exposure to cell death are known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Johnstone1">[3]</xref>. After TRAIL binding to death receptors, initiator caspases are activated, which in turn promote effector caspases activation either directly or via a mitochondrial pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). In most cells, Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP) is required to efficiently activate effector caspases. Several kinetic models have been proposed to describe a part or all of those biochemical reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Albeck1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Bentele1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Not all cells of an isogenic population die after TRAIL treatment, even at saturating ligand doses. This fractional killing property is widely shared among cell lines and is critical for therapeutical applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>. In addition, surviving cells were shown to be transiently resistant to a second TRAIL treatment. This reversible resistance property was observed in various cell lines and could also have important implications for therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Flusberg1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Flusberg2">[15]</xref>. Fractional killing is generally thought to result from cross talks between the apoptosis pathway and survival pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Falschlehner1">[16]</xref>. Indeed, several studies reported that TRAIL increases the production of anti-apoptotic proteins, via the activation of survival pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Chaudhary1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Sun1">[19]</xref>. While fractional killing illustrates cell-to-cell variability in the decision between life and death, variability is also observed among cells that die: they commit to death after a highly variable delay from one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Rehm2">[20]</xref>. This variability cannot be explained by differences in TRAIL-induced gene regulation: it is also observed when cells are co-treated with cycloheximide (CHX), an efficient inhibitor of protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>. Rather, it was proposed to originate mostly from pre-existing differences in the levels of proteins composing the apoptosis pathway. Indeed, recently divided sister cells die almost synchronously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Rehm2">[20]</xref>, as expected if protein content is equally shared between daughters and if noise in signaling reactions play a marginal role. This explanation was supported by modeling: when taken as initial conditions of a deterministic, kinetic model describing signaling reactions, differences in protein levels are sufficient to explain observed variability in death times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Another observation indicated that this cell-to-cell variability in protein levels is not frozen but result from a dynamical equilibrium driven by fluctuations in individual cells: death synchrony between sister cells was weaker as the duration between division and treatment increased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Rehm2">[20]</xref>. To quantitatively assess this effect, the previously mentioned modeling approach, where only the consequences of protein fluctuations (cell-to-cell variability at a fixed time) are accounted, is inadequate. Instead, protein fluctuations themselves should be modeled. The need to account for protein fluctuations is even more stringent when considering observations after treatment with TRAIL alone. In that case, protein synthesis is not blocked and thus can impact the decision between life and death. Even if TRAIL does not change protein synthesis (via induction of survival pathways), significant differences with TRAIL and CHX treatments are expected, as the constitutively noisy protein synthesis will interact with signaling reactions. Thus, before complexifying the model to account for eventual regulations via survival pathways induction, it is critical to assess how much can be explained when protein synthesis is not altered by TRAIL signaling. Here, we investigate this question by enabling a kinetic model of TRAIL-induced apoptosis with stochastic protein turnover for all proteins, following a generic and principled approach. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically include gene expression noise in a signal transduction model. It enriches the model with a fundamental property as the dynamics of cell-to-cell variability is represented, allowing disentangling the effects of constitutive protein fluctuations, signaling protein-protein reactions and potentially induced changes in protein synthesis.</p>

<title>Extended vision of signal transduction pathways</title>
<p>Protein synthesis and degradation are subjected to noise, resulting in fluctuations of protein concentrations in individual cells and in cell-to-cell variability at the population level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-McAdams1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Raser1">[22]</xref>. Such variability could have consequences on signal transduction: aside of conventional epigenetic differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Rando1">[23]</xref>, unequal access to ligand molecules or simply noise in signaling reactions, it often contributes importantly to heterogeneous behavior within an isogenic population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-GevaZatorsky1">[24]</xref>. One approach to account for those differences is to incorporate protein level variability as random initial conditions of an ODE model describing the signaling reactions (“extrinsic noise approach”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Gaudet1">[25]</xref>. However, variability is imposed at time zero and then behavior is deterministic: it is thus not appropriate to study transduction on long time scales, during which protein levels dynamically fluctuate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Sigal1">[26]</xref>. A more natural manner to account for protein level variability is to represent their stochastic synthesis and degradation (“intrinsic noise approach”). Although several studies did account for cell-to-cell differences in protein levels in an extrinsic, static manner via random initial conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Aldridge1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Stoma1">[28]</xref>, and many models of signal transduction considered the effect of noise in protein-protein reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Shibata1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Lapidus1">[30]</xref> or in the expression of signal transduction target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Tay1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Lipniacki2">[33]</xref>, no kinetic model of signal transduction pathways considering systematically noise in protein synthesis and degradation has been developed so far. Here by systematically we mean for all the proteins acting in the pathway.</p>
<p>We propose a modeling approach to account for gene expression noise within kinetic models of signal transduction pathways. Following Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Singh1">[34]</xref>, we model protein turnover with stochastic processes describing mRNA level fluctuations, and deterministic processes for protein translation and degradation (random telegraph model, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Raj1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Sherman1">[41]</xref>). These processes are integrated into a kinetic model of protein-protein reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). While the rates of such stochastic protein turnover models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) are rarely directly measurable, their value can be constrained by using experimentally measurable data and analytical results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Recently, significant progress has been made on both experimental and theoretical sides to enable this inference approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Singh1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Sherman1">[41]</xref>. Importantly, we found that for typical protein and mRNA half-lives, a large set of promoter rate combinations lead to similar fluctuations at the protein level, as characterized by protein level variability (coefficient of variation) and mixing time (half-autocorrelation time). Interestingly, the obtained mixing time is around 40 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), in the middle of the range of experimentally estimated values for twenty endogenous proteins in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Sigal1">[26]</xref>. Thus, standard stochastic protein turnover models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) can provide a good approximation of protein fluctuations for most proteins. Only short-lived proteins necessitate particular attention (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). This finding is a cornerstone of our approach.</p>

<title>Accounting for stochastic protein turnover in signal transduction pathways.</title>
<p>Scheme of the modeling approach. Protein-protein interactions mediating signal transduction (signal transduction layer) are modeled by ordinary differential equations. In parallel, promoter activity changes, mRNA production and degradation (gene expression layer) are seen as stochastic events and generate fluctuations in mRNA levels. This impacts the synthesis rates of the corresponding proteins. Together with protein degradation, it generates fluctuations in protein levels (here shown in absence of transduction). Only a fragment of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway is shown. Deterministic/stochastic interpretation of chemical reactions is represented with black/red arrows respectively.</p>

<title>Modeling stochastic protein turnover in TRAIL-induced apoptosis</title>
<p>We applied this approach to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, using EARM kinetic model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Albeck1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref> to describe protein-protein reactions taking place between TRAIL exposure and cell death commitment. We equipped all native proteins with a default model of stochastic protein turnover, with the exception of proteins with fast turnover, here Flip and Mcl1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Nijhawan1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Laussmann1">[44]</xref>. Details of model construction are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s016">Text S1</xref> (see dedicated section, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s004">Fig. S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s013">Tables S1-3</xref>). Importantly, all parameters have been constrained based on experimental data and analytical results, with the exception of four parameters (“ON” and “OFF” promoter switching rates, mRNA and protein half-lives for Flip and Mcl1). Note that because of their similar protein and mRNA half-life, we use the same couple of promoter switching rates for both proteins in our exploration of parameter space. This drastically limited the number of introduced degrees of freedom and made it possible to systematically explore realistic ranges for remaining parameters. To study the influence of stochastic protein turnover on fractional killing and reversible resistance, we sought to confront our model with existing quantitative data about TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. Those experiments, described in detail later, can be classified into two groups based on the type of information they contain: 1) quantification of the variability in cell fate, 2) characterization of the transient memory in cell state. While previous approaches using ODE models with distributions for initial protein levels (capturing a static description of cell-to-cell variability) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Gaudet1">[25]</xref> are potentially able to reproduce the first type of data, a dynamic view on cell-to-cell variability as proposed in our model is needed to account for both types of data. We adopted the following strategy: first, search for models able to reproduce observations on cell fate variability; and second test whether valid models can robustly predict observed behaviors where transient memory matters.</p>

<title>Stochastic protein turnover models predict transient memory in cell sensitivity to TRAIL and CHX</title>
<p>Using live-cell microscopy, Spencer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref> investigated the fate of hundreds of cells after exposure to TRAIL and CHX (10 ng/mL and 2.5 µg/mL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). All cells undergo MOMP with a highly variable delay (from 2 to 8 hours, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). To study cell fate inheritance, the authors also recorded 20 hours before treatment to identify sister cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). They were found to have highly correlated MOMP times (correlation coefficient close to 1 for recently divided cells, about 0.5 for older sisters - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, black curve). Here, the MOMP time distribution provides a quantification of the cell fate variability, while MOMP time correlations between sister cells also give information on the transient memory in cell state. Within our framework, <italic>in-silico</italic> reproduction of those experiments is straightforward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g003">Figs. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g004">4C</xref>), enabling us to investigate possible origins of transient cell fate inheritance. We first asked if the observed cell fate variability could be reproduced. In the model, it is only determined by protein levels at treatment time (behavior is deterministic as synthesis is assumed to be fully blocked by CHX and noise in signaling reactions is neglected), and differences between sister cells are only caused by protein synthesis noise occurring between division and treatment (in agreement with the fact that recently divided sisters died almost synchronously, we assumed an equal repartition of protein content at division). We found that excellent agreement with observed MOMP time variability can be obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Further analysis revealed that such agreement requires Flip and Mcl1 protein half-life to be short and to fall within a narrow range (between 0.3 and 0.6 hours, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s005">Fig. S5-C</xref>). This model prediction is consistent with previous measurements in HeLa cells (30 and 40 minutes for Flip short isoform and Mcl1 respectively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Nijhawan1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Poukkula1">[43]</xref>). In contrast, Flip and Mcl1 mRNA half-life and promoter switching rates are not strongly constrained, probably because their influence on cell fate is limited by the rapid protein level decrease caused by synthesis blockade. We then asked whether our extended model also capture transient cell fate inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). It is the case: fitted models accurately predict the MOMP time correlation between sister cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g004">Fig. 4D</xref> - black curve, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s005">Fig. S5-C</xref>). Of note, assuming standard promoter switching rates for Flip and Mcl1 (but accounting for their short mRNA and protein half-life - this parameterization will later be referred as the “non-fitted” model) already provides a good agreement for both MOMP time distribution and MOMP time correlation between sister cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). This non-trivial result shows that the speed at which the sensitivity to TRAIL and CHX fluctuates in single cells is well captured and thus suggests that our generic approach permits to describe fluctuations of protein levels with sufficient accuracy.</p>

<title>Large, rare fluctuations of short-lived anti-apoptotic proteins explain fractional killing and predict transient cell fate inheritance</title>
<p>Spencer and colleagues repeated this experiment but treated cells with TRAIL alone (250 ng/mL). In this condition, an important fraction of cells died fast (MOMP in ∼2 hours) but 40% were still alive after 8 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), illustrating the fractional killing property. Also, cell fate inheritance between sister cells was markedly changed: only young sister cells that underwent MOMP rapidly were importantly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, grey curve). We asked whether the observed cell fate variability, including fractional killing, could be reproduced <italic>in-silico</italic>. Within our modeling assumptions, absence of co-treatment with CHX makes a fundamental difference: as synthesis continues, the effect of gene expression noise during TRAIL-induced apoptosis could be investigated, and comparison with the TRAIL and CHX condition is insightful. Strikingly, we found that quantitative agreement for both MOMP time distribution and surviving fraction could be obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). Robustness analysis showed that rates of the Flip and Mcl1 stochastic protein turnover model, and particularly promoter switching rates, are in this case strongly constrained. Interestingly, MOMP time distribution and surviving fraction constrain those values differently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g005">Fig. 5A–B</xref>), resulting in an narrow ranges for their values: agreement for both observations together is obtained only when promoter switching rates are both low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Such low switching rates lead to large, rare fluctuations of protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Those atypical fluctuations phenotypes are expected to leave a signature at the population level: the shape of the protein level distribution would be bimodal rather than resembling a lognormal distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). This property is thus a model prediction. Those fluctuations are likely to impact how the fate of sister cells diverge with time. Thus, we asked whether the model could also account for the observed fast loss of cell fate inheritance. Remarkably, the fitted models accurately and robustly predict MOMP time correlations between sister cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g004">Figs. 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g005">5E</xref>). As mentioned earlier, the same couple of promoter switching rates was used for Flip and Mcl1 during exploration, but further analysis showed that assuming low promoter switching rates for Mcl1 alone was sufficient to obtain quantitative agreement for MOMP distributions surviving fractions, and that sister cells MOMP time correlations were still correctly predicted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). Thus, comparison with transient cell fate inheritance data supports that large, rare fluctuations of Mcl1 could be responsible for the observed cell fate variability.</p>

<title>Accounting for stochastic protein turnover predicts reversible resistance</title>
<p>Recently, reversible resistance was observed among various cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Flusberg1">[14]</xref>. Cell populations were submitted to two consecutive TRAIL treatments. The duration between treatments was varied from 1 day to 1 week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). One-day survivors were significantly more resistant than the initial population, but such resistance was significantly decreased or even lost in one-week survivors.

Remarkably, <italic>in-silico</italic> reproduction of those (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) showed that our model predicts the presence of reversible resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>): one-day survivors exhibit a dose-dependent increase of resistance to a second TRAIL treatment, which disappears after 3 to 5 days. This is surprising since our model does not include induced regulation mediated by survival pathways. Moreover, the presence of reversible resistance is a robust property of the model as it is also obtained when assuming standard promoter switching rates for Mcl1 and Flip (“non-fitted” model, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s006">Fig. S6</xref>).

<title>Molecular determinants of fractional killing and reversible resistance</title>
<p>What are the mechanisms behind cell escape to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, either on the short-term (fractional killing) or the long-term (reversible resistance)? Using the fact that <italic>in-silico</italic>, all protein, mRNA levels and gene activity states can be monitored in single cells, we investigated those questions at the molecular level. To study the influence of pre-existing differences on cell fate, we compared at the time of stimulation the sub-population of ‘future survivors’ with the whole population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g007">Fig. 7A–B</xref>). Future survivors strongly stood out by their Mcl1 protein level and gene activity state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Flip also appeared to play an important role in determining cell decision, and smaller but significant effect was also seen for Bid, Bax, Bcl2 and XIAP. Although it is a good predictor of cell fate, initial Mcl1 gene activity status does not completely determine survival: neither all Mcl1 “ON” cells survived nor all Mcl1 “OFF” cells died. Thus, pre-existing differences in protein levels and promoter activities are major determinant of cell fate but stochastic events in gene expression occurring during signal transduction also play a role. While timing of death for cells treated with TRAIL and CHX appeared to be multi-factorial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, our results suggest that cell survival is predominantly determined by Mcl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). This important role of Mcl1 is robustly predicted. Indeed, it also holds for the “non-fitted” model, which assume standard promoter switching rates for all proteins, including Mcl1 and Flip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s006">Fig. S6</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the determinants of reversible resistance, we tracked the temporal evolution of protein levels in surviving cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g007">Fig. 7 A&amp;C</xref>). The protein level composition of one day survivors contrasts with the protein content observed in future survivors: almost all protein levels differ importantly from the naïve population composition, while that was the case only for Mcl1 and Flip in future survivors. This is expected as all proteins are partly activated during signal transduction, leading to a higher degradation (active forms have a shorter half-life). Therefore, the distinction between the causes of cell survival and the consequences of partial apoptosis induction cannot be easily resolved by the sole observation of protein levels in survivors. When signaling stops, recovery of protein levels is expected to follow exponential kinetics governed by the turnover rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>, inset – see the death receptor (R), pro-caspase 8, Bar and Bid). Deviation from such kinetics indicates either the persistence of signaling reactions that continue to consume proteins (it is the case for Apaf, pro-caspase 9 and XIAP, as further analysis confirmed) or is a consequence of important selection. Indeed, while Mcl1 and Flip should recover normal levels in a few hours in absence of selection because of their high turnover rate, Mcl1 levels (but not Flip levels) are still strongly higher than in naive cells one day after TRAIL treatment, consistently with previous observations on the relative selection strength that operated on them. Together, those results indicate that recovery phenotypes in surviving cells result from a complex interplay of three distinct effects: selection during apoptosis, transcriptional noise and protein turnover as a driving force tending to reset protein levels to their initial, pre-stimulus distribution, and long-term residual signaling activity. This explains why it is difficult to understand the recovery process and justifies the use of modeling to disentangle the various contributions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Rehm et al. and Spencer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Rehm2">[20]</xref> made two insightful observations about TRAIL-induced apoptosis. First, recently born sister cells died almost synchronously when treated with TRAIL and a protein synthesis inhibitor, while in contrast, unrelated cells died after highly variable durations. This demonstrated that TRAIL signaling is mostly deterministic when protein synthesis is blocked and that the timing of death is determined by the cell internal state at the time of treatment. Second, they observed that such synchrony in sister cells death is gradually lost as the time between division and treatment increases. This showed that the cell 'TRAIL sensitivity state' (the part of cell internal state involved in death timing determination) naturally fluctuates over a dozen of hours. In addition, the modeling results in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref> highly suggested that such state is mainly composed by the various levels of the proteins acting in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. In parallel, important progress on the characterization of the stochasticity in gene expression has been made: the two-state transcriptional bursting model was shown to permit high accuracy and several approaches to infer its parameters were proposed, enabling the quantitative modeling of protein fluctuations in single cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Singh1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Munsky1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Modeling protein fluctuations in TRAIL-induced apoptosis</title>
<p>In this study, we merged those two approaches by integrating such stochastic models of gene expression within an existing kinetic model of TRAIL-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Albeck1">[5]</xref> in a systematic and principled manner. Doing so provides advantages compared to previous approaches to account for cell-to-cell variability in protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Gaudet1">[25]</xref>. First, variability is not considered as an “input” parameter but arises naturally from stochastic fluctuations. The dynamics of this variability is thus intrinsically represented within the system, allowing investigating the effects of transient memory in protein levels. Second, the influence of protein synthesis noise during TRAIL-induced apoptosis could also be investigated. Importantly, we followed a parsimonious parameterization strategy, motivated by the fact that fluctuations of long-lived proteins are rather insensitive to the precise kinetics of transcriptional bursting, enabling us to equip most proteins (long-lived proteins) with reasonably accurate fluctuation models even in absence of gene expression data for each and every promoter. The sister cells experiment for which cells were treated with TRAIL and CHX provided ideal data to validate our modeling approach: in that case, behavior is mostly deterministic as soon as treatment starts and only fluctuations occurring before treatment are responsible for death time variability and de-correlation between sister cells. Moreover, gene regulation via survival pathways induction is ineffective as protein synthesis is blocked. Because our model was able to quantitatively reproduce the MOMP time distribution and then accurately predicted sister cells correlation, our modeling approach appears as a promising tool to investigate the effect of protein fluctuations on signal transduction, despite the limitations inherent to its simplicity (for example, stochastic gene expression events were assumed to be independent between proteins, neglecting the fact that levels of different proteins can be partially correlated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Gaudet1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Sigal1">[26]</xref>, possibly because of common transcription factors or coordinated chromatin-state transitions). Of note, good agreement was readily obtained when assuming for Flip and Mcl1 standard promoter switching rates, but short protein and mRNA half-lives - in agreement with available knowledge (“non-fitted” model, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Finally, the transposition of fluctuation timescales from individual proteins into ‘TRAIL sensitivity states’ is not trivial: while in our model, stable proteins levels are mixed in about 40 hours, cells were switching between 'fast dying' and 'slow dying' phenotypes more rapidly (about 10–15 hours). As combinatorial effects are at play, mechanistic models of protein-proteins reactions are needed to link protein-level timescales with more high-level phenotypic transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Gupta1">[45]</xref>.</p>

<title>Questioning the role of survival pathways</title>
<p>Several studies reported that TRAIL can induce survival pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Chaudhary1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Sun1">[19]</xref>. How such induced changes affect signal transduction and eventually stop apoptotic signaling remains unclear. On the other hand, the contribution of constitutive protein synthesis noise, which is responsible for pre-existing differences between cells, has not been evaluated. Although it does not exclude the existence of other mechanisms, an important result of our study is that fractional killing can be obtained without assuming any TRAIL-induced regulation. Alternatively, we find that because of its fast turnover, constitutive expression of the Mcl1 protein has the potential to rescue cells from TRAIL apoptotic signaling. In this context, solely accounting for protein fluctuations within the TRAIL apoptosis pathway predicts the fractional killing property (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g003">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s006">S6</xref>). While our results challenge current opinion on the role of survival pathways in TRAIL-induced apoptosis, they are consistent with observations made on wild type HeLa cells that neither blocking NF-κB response nor inhibiting the Akt pathway do significantly change the surviving cell fraction after TRAIL treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Braeuer1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Lalaoui1">[47]</xref>. The pivotal role for Mcl1 in TRAIL-induced apoptosis predicted by our model is consistent with the recent finding that Mcl1 silencing by shRNA in HeLa cells completely sensitize cells to TRAIL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Lemke1">[48]</xref>. While moderate fluctuations of Mcl1 levels were sufficient to obtain fractional killing, a quantitative agreement with the Spencer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref> single-cell data (MOMP time distribution and surviving fraction) required large and rare Mcl1 fluctuations, caused by rare switches between long periods of gene activity or inactivity. Interestingly, in that case, the observed rapid loss of MOMP time correlation between sister cells quantitatively emerged from model simulations. Flip is often mentioned as a key factor in cell resistance to TRAIL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Shirley1">[49]</xref>, but in our model Flip has less impact on cell survival than Mcl1. Consistently, Lemke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Lemke1">[48]</xref> silencing experiments demonstrated a dominant role for Mcl1 and a synergy with Flip. However, our model might under-estimate the role of Flip: the representation of DISC-related events in EARM is simple and thus does not account for recent biological findings, including the stoichiometry between its components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Dickens1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Schleich1">[51]</xref>. Improving how DISC assembly is modeled might thus be needed to elucidate the precise role of Flip in fractional killing and reversible resistance, especially for cell lines that express higher Flip amounts than HeLa.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Origins of reversible resistance: joint effect of selection and stochastic protein turnover</title>
<p>A second significant result reported here is that our model predicts the phenomenon of reversible resistance, showing that constitutively noisy protein synthesis, protein-protein interactions and protein degradation are by themselves sufficient to explain a dose-dependent, significant increase of resistance in recent survivors and its gradual loss within 3–5 days. This result is consistent with the observation that Nf-κB blockade does not change resistance acquisition after TRAIL treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Flusberg1">[14]</xref> (in MCF10A cells; HeLa cells have not been tested). <italic>In-silico</italic> analysis at the molecular level revealed that reversible resistance as predicted by the model was shaped by a complex interplay between 1) selection based on protein levels and transcriptional activity, 2) protein turnover and 3) residual signaling activity. As opposed to the death process, which involves a sharp and complete activation of effector caspases, our results suggest that recovery in cells that did not commit to death is a slow and complex process. While one should not conclude from our results that parallel activation of survival pathways by TRAIL plays no role in reversible resistance, our results show that the sole contribution of protein level fluctuations occurring within the extrinsic apoptosis pathway can partly lead to reversible resistance. Thus, protein fluctuations should be accounted for to gain quantitative insights into reversible resistance.</p>

<title>Accounting for gene expression noise appears necessary to investigate signal transduction</title>
<p>While here we focused on TRAIL-induced apoptosis, our modeling approach is generic and can be applied to other signal transduction pathways. Our results showed that even in absence of induced gene regulation, gene expression noise interacts with signaling dynamics on a non-trivial manner. Thus, even in contexts where the influence of induced gene-regulation is indisputable, its sound quantification probably requires to investigate first the role of constitutive gene expression noise. Only then models could be enriched parsimoniously with well-characterized regulatory links until all observations are successfully explained. Significant advances to allow such detailed characterization of gene regulation occurred recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Tay1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Molina1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Neuert1">[53]</xref>.

While the obtained equations cannot be solved analytically, it can be used to derive moments of the underlying distribution by applying generating functions techniques, as was done by Paszek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Paszek1">[39]</xref>. We next give the analytical expressions of several moments of interest:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003893.e011"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003893.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1003893.e012"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003893.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1003893.e013"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003893.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1003893.e014"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003893.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

<title>Modeling TRAIL-induced apoptosis and protein fluctuations</title>
<p>We used the EARM model described in Spencer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref> to represent protein-protein reactions. No kinetic rates were changed, except the rate of pC6 cleavage by C3, set to zero to remove the feedback loop. Degradation rates of non-native forms were modified according to biological knowledge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s015">Table S3</xref>). The effect of those changes is discussed in SI Appendix. Rates of the standard stochastic protein turnover models and rates of Flip&amp;Mcl1 models were determined following an algorithm constructed to incorporate constraints based on biological knowledge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Their values are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s013">Table S1</xref>-2. Notably, for comparability and consistency with the findings of Spencer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, we kept their mean protein values, even if for a few proteins new data were available, as for Mcl1 for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Lindner1">[54]</xref>, provided that the order of magnitude is the same.</p>

<title>In-silico “sister cells” and “repeated TRAIL” experiments</title>
<p>The simulation procedure is detailed in SI Appendix. Briefly, mother cell states (promoter activity, mRNA and protein levels) were chosen by Monte-Carlo sampling and the two sister cells were constructed by duplication of the mother cell state. Promoter activity and mRNA fluctuations were simulated using an implementation of the Gillespie algorithm. For the ODEs governing evolution of all protein levels, the Semi-Implicit Extrapolation method was used. MOMP was considered to have occurred when half of mitochondrial Smac has been released. For all simulations, at least 10<sup>4</sup> pairs of sister cells were simulated. Quantitative comparison of simulation results with related experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) was achieved by computing a measure of model-data agreement described in Supplementary Methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003893.s016">Text S1</xref>). For repeated TRAIL simulations, a naïve population of 10<sup>4</sup> cells was obtained as in the sister cells experiment. Cells divided after a gaussian cell cycle duration (mean 27 hours, standard deviation 3 hours). Death was detected via cPARP levels as in Gaudet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003893-Gaudet1">[25]</xref>.</p>

<p><bold>Numerical simulation and analytical characterization of stochastic protein turnover models.</bold> A stochastic protein turnover model is defined by six rates: the promoter activity switching rates, the mRNA production and degradation rates, the protein per mRNA synthesis rate and the protein degradation rate. Numerical simulations can be used to simulate temporal fluctuations in single cells. When a population of cells is simulated, the cell-to-cell variability can be studied. After some time, cell-to-cell variability reaches a steady state. Analytical calculations on the stochastic protein turnover model provide expressions characterizing the steady-state variability (moments of the steady-state distributions), but also fluctuations (autocorrelation functions).

We reproduce here for this model all the results presented in the main text for the “fitted” model.

Because mRNA and protein half-lives are short, protein level fluctuates more rapidly and the steady-state distribution is changed (it is wider and the mode is in 0) compared to the standard stochastic protein turnover model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003893-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).
