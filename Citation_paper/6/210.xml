<abstract>
<p>Epigenetic gene silencing by histone modifications and DNA methylation is essential for cancer development. The molecular mechanism that promotes selective epigenetic changes during tumorigenesis is not understood. We report here that the PIAS1 SUMO ligase is involved in the progression of breast tumorigenesis. Elevated PIAS1 expression was observed in breast tumor samples. PIAS1 knockdown in breast cancer cells reduced the subpopulation of tumor-initiating cells, and inhibited breast tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. PIAS1 acts by delineating histone modifications and DNA methylation to silence the expression of a subset of clinically relevant genes, including breast cancer DNA methylation signature genes such as cyclin D2 and estrogen receptor, and breast tumor suppressor WNT5A. Our studies identify a novel epigenetic mechanism that regulates breast tumorigenesis through selective gene silencing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Both genetic and epigenetic alterations contribute to cancer development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Jovanovic1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Jones1">[3]</xref>. Tumor suppressors and epigenetic gatekeeper genes are frequently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms during tumor initiation and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Jones1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Huang1">[5]</xref>. Extensive studies have been performed in the identification and characterization of altered DNA methylation in breast cancer development and progression. More than 100 genes have been reported to be aberrantly hypermethylated in breast tumors or breast cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Jovanovic1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Szyf1">[6]</xref>. Many of these genes play important roles in the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis and tumor initiation. It has been proposed that breast cancer-specific DNA methylation signatures can extend our ability to classify breast cancer and predict outcome beyond what is currently possible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Szyf1">[6]</xref>. Epigenetic therapy holds a promising potential for the successful treatment of cancer since epigenetic changes are reversible as opposed to mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Connolly1">[7]</xref>. The approval of DNA methylation and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors for cancer treatment offers new promise for epigenetic therapy. However, these drugs are rather nonspecific, and the development of more effective strategies for epigenetic therapy requires a thorough understanding of the molecular specificity involved in epigenetic gene silencing.</p>
<p>Most tumors are composed of a mixture of cancer cells, and the heterogeneity of tumors is the major obstacle to effective cancer therapy. It has been demonstrated that a sub-population of cancer cells, referred to as tumor-initiating cells (TICs) or cancer stem cells, is tumorigenic when transplanted into immunosuppressed nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Bonnet1">[8]</xref>. TICs display some key properties of stem cells including self-renewal and multilineage differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Molofsky1">[9]</xref>. In addition, TICs are found to be resistant to radiation and conventional chemotherapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Phillips1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Woodward1">[13]</xref>. Therefore, TICs may largely contribute to tumor cellular heterogeneity, tumor progression and tumor recurrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Dalerba1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Mimeault1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>PIAS1 is a member of the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) transcriptional regulator family that possesses SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) E3 ligase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Shuai1">[18]</xref>. Biochemical and genetic studies indicate that PIAS1 is a physiologically important transcriptional repressor of STAT1 and NF-kappaB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Tahk1">[21]</xref>. PIAS1 is rapidly activated by phosphorylation on Ser90 residue in response to a variety of stimuli, including pro-inflammatory signals, TCR activation and growth factors. Activated PIAS1 is then recruited to gene promoters to repress transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu3">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu4">[23]</xref>. Recent studies indicate that PIAS1 mediates a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism to control natural regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. PIAS1 binds to the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter to maintain a repressive chromatin state through the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and HP1-gamma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu5">[24]</xref>. These findings indicate that this newly identified PIAS1 epigenetic mechanism plays an important role in T cell differentiation.</p>
<p>In this paper, we report that PIAS1 is important for breast tumorigenesis. Elevated PIAS1 expression was observed in breast cancer patient samples. PIAS1 knockdown in breast cancer cells inhibited tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Most interestingly, mechanistic studies indicate that PIAS1 suppresses a number of- genes clinically relevant to breast tumorigenesis through epigenetic mechanisms. These studies suggest that targeting the PIAS1 epigenetic signaling pathway may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.</p>

<title>Elevated PIAS1 expression in primary human breast cancer tissues</title>
<p>To test whether PIAS1 is involved in breast cancer progression, immunohistochemistry (IHC) tissue arrays were performed to examine the expression of PIAS1 protein in a panel of primary human breast tumor samples.

<title>PIAS1 is important for breast tumorigenesis</title>
<p>To directly test whether PIAS1 plays a functional role in breast tumorigenesis, RNA interference approach was used to knockdown the expression of PIAS1 protein in MDA-MB231 cells. Stable cell lines expressing a scramble short hairpin RNA (control shRNA) or two independent PIAS1 shRNAs (shRNA1 and shRNA2) were obtained. Western blot analysis showed that PIAS1 expression was significantly suppressed by both PIAS1 shRNAs, although a more efficient inhibition by PIAS1 shRNA2 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). PIAS1 knockdown did not affect the growth of MDA-MB231 cells under the conventional serum-containing conditions (DMEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g001">Fig. 1c, left panel</xref>). In contrast, when these cells were cultured under serum-free growth factor-enriched conditions (Stem Cell Media; SCM), which favor normal stem cells and more closely resemble primary tumors than the DMEM condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Lee1">[26]</xref>, PIAS1 knockdown significantly inhibited the survival of MDA-MB231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g001">Fig. 1c, right panel</xref>). To directly test the effect of PIAS1 knockdown on tumor growth in vivo, xenograft experiments were performed in SCID mice. PIAS1 knockdown significantly inhibited the tumor formation of MDA-MB231 cells in both the subcutaneous and the fat pad models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g001">Fig. 1d</xref>), suggesting an important role of PIAS1 in the regulation of breast tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>PIAS1 regulates the self-renewal of breast tumor initiating cells (TICs)</title>
<p>The finding that PIAS1 knockdown affects breast cancer cell survival specifically under the conditions that favor stem cell growth suggests a possibility that PIAS1 may play a role in the regulation of breast cancer stem cells/tumor-initiating cells (TICs). Previous studies suggest that the ALDH<sup>+</sup> subpopulation of breast cancer cells is highly enriched in breast TICs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Ginestier1">[27]</xref>. ALDEFLUOR assays revealed that PIAS1 knockdown almost completely eliminated the ALDH<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that PIAS1 knockdown inhibits breast TICs. To further test whether PIAS1 regulates breast TICs, the control and PIAS1 knockdown MDA-MB231 cells were subjected to mammosphere assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Dalerba1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Dontu1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Dontu2">[29]</xref>. PIAS1 knockdown significantly inhibited the formation of mammospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>), suggesting that PIAS1 regulates the self-renewal of breast TICs.</p>

<title>PIAS1 Ser90 phosphorylation and SUMO ligase activity are required for PIAS1-mediated regulation of breast TICs</title>
<p>Previous studies indicate that PIAS1 is activated by Ser90 phosphorylation to bind to chromatin and repress transcription of target genes in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu3">[22]</xref>, a process that is dependent on the SUMO ligase activity of PIAS1. We explored whether PIAS1 can also be activated by growth factor signals. Western blot analysis revealed that PIAS1 became phosphorylated on Ser90 in response to EGF or Heregulin in various breast cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB231, BT-20, BT-474 and HCC-1954 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>). To test the importance of PIAS1 Ser90 phosphorylation and PIAS1 SUMO ligase activity in the regulation of breast TICs, PIAS1 shRNA1 knockdown MDA-MB231 cells were rescued with either an empty vector (Vec), wild type PIAS1 (WT), PIAS1 Ser90 mutant (S90A), or PIAS1 SUMO ligase defective mutant (W372A) through an shRNA escape approach, in which silent mutations were introduced into PIAS1 expression constructs to escape the inhibitory effect of PIAS1 shRNA. Western blot analysis indicated that the expression of WT or mutant PIAS1 proteins in the rescued cell lines was comparable to that of the MDA-MB231 control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>), the introduction of either WT or S90A and W372A PIAS1 mutants did not affect cell growth under the conventional DMEM conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g002">Fig. 2e, left panel</xref>). In contrast, when these cells were cultured under SCM conditions, only WT, but not the vector (Vec) or W372A mutant PIAS1 reconstituted cells, rescued cells from cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g002">Fig. 2e, right panel</xref>). PIAS1 S90A mutant showed minor increase in cell survival, although the increase is not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g002">Fig. 2e, right panel</xref>). In addition, mammosphere assays were performed to examine the ability of WT or PIAS1 mutants to support the self-renewal of TICs. The introduction of PIAS1 WT into PIAS1 knockdown cells promoted the formation of mammospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g002">Fig. 2f</xref>). The introduction of PIAS1 S90 or W372 mutant resulted in minor increases in mammospheres, although the increases are not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g002">Fig. 2f</xref>). Consistently, ALDEFLUOR assays indicated that PIAS1 WT, but not S90 or W372 mutant, restored the population of ALDH<sup>+</sup> TICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g002">Fig. 2g</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that the observed inhibition of TICs in PIAS1 knockdown cells is due to the reduction of PIAS1 expression, and that both PIAS1 Ser90 phosphorylation and SUMO ligase activity are required for the maintenance of the breast TICs.</p>

<title>PIAS1 selectively represses a subset of genes clinically relevant to breast cancer</title>
<p>We explored the molecular mechanism of PIAS1-mediated regulation of breast TICs. Gene profiling studies were performed to identify PIAS1 downstream genes involved in tumorigenesis. Total RNAs from the control and PIAS1 knockdown MDA-MB231 cells cultured under DMEM or SCM conditions were subjected to microarray analysis. Since PIAS1 is a transcriptional repressor and PIAS1 knockdown inhibited self-renewal of breast TICs under SCM conditions, we focused on the genes that were preferentially upregulated in PIAS1 knockdown cells under SCM conditions (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089464.s001">File S1</xref>). Interestingly, among the group of genes strongly induced by PIAS1 knockdown, several genes are known to be clinically relevant to breast cancer, including breast cancer DNA methylation signature genes Cyclin D2 (<italic>CCND2</italic>) and Estrogen receptor (<italic>ESR1</italic>), candidate tumor suppressor <italic>WNT5A</italic>, progestagen-associated endometrial protein (<italic>PAEP</italic>), as well as leucine zipper, downregulated in cancer 1 (<italic>LDOC1</italic>). WNT5A, which signals through a non-canonical WNT pathway, is a candidate tumor suppressor in breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Jonsson1">[30]</xref>.

<p>The induction of these genes identified by microarray was validated by quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis in two independent PIAS1 knockdown MDA-MB231 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g003">Fig. 3a</xref> and Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089464.s001">File S1</xref>).

<title>PIAS1 promotes epigenetic gene silencing in breast cancer cells</title>
<p>Our recent studies showed that PIAS1 restricts nTreg differentiation by recruiting DNMTs to the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter to promote DNA methylation and epigenetic silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu5">[24]</xref>. We explored whether the PIAS1 epigenetic pathway also operates in breast cancer cells. Our previous results showed that PIAS1 inhibits the expression of <italic>CCND2, ESR1</italic> and <italic>WNT5A</italic>; but not <italic>CCND1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

Therefore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to test whether PIAS1 was associated with the genomic loci with close proximity to the reported methylation regions of the <italic>CCND2, ESR1</italic> and <italic>WNT5A</italic> genes in MDA-MB231 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g005">Fig. 5a</xref>, PIAS1 bound to the <italic>CCND2, ESR1</italic> and <italic>WNT5A</italic> loci in the control shRNA cells, while the binding was reduced in PIAS1 shRNA2 cells. Furthermore, PIAS1 was not associated with the <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g005">Fig. 5a</xref>), consistent with the finding that PIAS1 does not affect the expression of <italic>CCND1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, PIAS1 knockdown resulted in a substantial increase of the active histone mark histone H3 acetylation (AcH3) on the <italic>WNT5A</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g005">Fig. 5b</xref>). In contrast, the repressive modifications, such as histone H3 K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone H3 K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), were considerably reduced in PIAS1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g005">Fig. 5b</xref>). Similar changes in AcH3 and H3K9me3 were observed in the <italic>CCND2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g005">Fig. 5c</xref>). As a control, H3K9me3 was readily detectable in the centromeric satellite repeat, <italic>Satellite 2</italic>, a heterochromatin region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Wang1">[43]</xref> in MDA-MB231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g005">Fig. 5d</xref>).

In addition, while H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 were not detectable in the <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter, the AcH3 level was not affected by PIAS1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g005">Fig. 5e</xref>), consistent with the finding that PIAS1 does not affect the <italic>CCND1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although extensive studies have been performed in the identification and characterization of altered DNA methylation and epigenetic modifications in breast cancer development and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Jovanovic1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Dedeurwaerder1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Szyf1">[6]</xref>, the molecular mechanism involved in this process has not been understood. Studies described in this manuscript have identified a novel epigenetic control mechanism in promoting selective epigenetic silencing in breast cancer. Our results suggest that the PIAS1 epigenetic pathway, which has been previously shown to function in regulatory T cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu5">[24]</xref>, is up-regulated in breast cancer and is involved in promoting DNA methylation and epigenetic silencing of breast cancer signature genes such as <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>CCND2</italic>, as well as the breast tumor suppressor <italic>WNT5A</italic>.</p>
<p>Microarray analysis of PIAS1 knockdown breast cancer cells has uncovered an essential role of PIAS1 in the suppression of a group of genes previously known to be clinically relevant to breast cancer, such as <italic>WNT5A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The WNT family of proteins can signal through the canonical beta-catenin-dependent or the non-canonical beta-catenin-independent pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Reya1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Malanchi1">[38]</xref>. WNT5A belongs to the nontransforming class of the WNT gene family that activates non-canonical signaling pathways. The biology of WNT5A is cell-type dependent, and it has been reported that WNT5A may signal through different WNT receptors to cause different cellular responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Mikels1">[44]</xref>. Gene targeting studies indicate that WNT5A is required for normal mammary gland development, and <italic>Wnt5a</italic>-null ammary tissue shows an accelerated developmental capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Roarty1">[45]</xref>. In addition, WNT5A overexpression inhibits tumorigenesis of uroepithelial cell carcinoma and suppresses mammary cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Olson1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Jonsson2">[47]</xref>. The loss of WNT5A is associated with early relapse in invasive ductal breast carcinomas and short recurrence-free survival, supporting WNT5A as a candidate breast tumor suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Jonsson1">[30]</xref>. The tumor suppressor function of WNT5A has also been suggested in other human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liang1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Blanc1">[49]</xref>. In this report, we showed that PIAS1-mediated regulation of the self-renewal of breast TICs is largely achieved through the transcriptional repression of WNT5A. The exogenous administration of recombinant WNT5A protein to MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells suppressed mammosphere. Consistently, WNT5A inhibition by shRNA rescued PIAS1 knockdown-mediated suppression of mammosphere and tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Our results suggest that the PIAS1-WNT5A pathway regulates the self-renewal of breast TICs.</p>
<p>PIAS1 is a nuclear SUMO E3 ligase that functions as a transcriptional repressor. PIAS1 is activated by Ser90 phosphorylation in response to proinflammatory stimuli. Activated PIAS1 is then recruited to gene promoters to repress transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu3">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu6">[50]</xref>. In this report, we showed that PIAS1 is also phosphorylated/activated in response to growth stimuli, and the ability of PIAS1 to regulate the self-renewal of breast TICs requires PIAS1 Ser90 phosphorylation as well as PIAS1 SUMO E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Our studies suggest that PIAS1 may act as a sensor protein in the nucleus that responds to growth and inflammatory stimuli in the tumor microenvironment to regulate the self-renewal of TICs through epigenetic gene regulation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, studies described in this paper suggest that PIAS1 plays an important role in promoting selective epigenetic silencing during breast tumorigenesis. It is possible that the PIAS1 epigenetic pathway may provide a link between inflammation and the development of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089464-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Targeting the PIAS1 epigenetic pathway may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.</p>

<title>A proposed model of the function of PIAS1 in breast cancer.</title>
<p>In response to growth factor and inflammatory signals, PIAS1 is activated via Ser90 phosphorylation (S90p), and recruited to the target gene promoters. PIAS1 represses the expression of epigenetic gatekeeper genes, such as <italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>WNT5A</italic> and <italic>CCND2</italic>, by promoting inhibitory histone H3 lysine 9 and lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K9/K27) and DNA methylation (Met), while inhibiting acetylated histone H3 (AcH3). Therefore, PIAS1 promotes tumorigenesis by selective epigenetic gene silencing.</p>

<p>Exponentially growing cells were trypsinized and resuspended in serum free-DMEM or RPMI, mixed with equal volume of Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and injected into the fat pad, or subcutaneously into the flank of 6–10 week old SCID beige mice (UCLA Department of Radiation Oncology) in a volume of 150 ul per site. Tumors were measured weekly with a caliper and tumor volume was calculated as width x length x height x 0.526.</p>

<title>Tissue microarray analysis</title>
<p>Tissue microarray slides were obtained from Imgenex and Full Moon Biosystems, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed using polyclonal anti-PIAS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu2">[20]</xref> as instructed by the manufacturers. “Normal duct” was defined as normal breast tissues from healthy individuals as well as histologically normal tissues adjacent to tumors. Semiquantitative assessment of PIAS1 staining was performed using a 0–2 scale (0 = negative; 1 = weak staining; 2 = strong staining) based on the average intensity per epithelial cell, and PIAS1 score was defined as the product of PIAS1 staining scale and the percentage of PIAS1 positive staining. A total of 3 independent tissue arrays containing 30–100 samples each were performed and the data were pooled. Statistic analysis was performed using non-parametric two-tailed Kruskal Wallis test with alpha level equals 0.05 for all tests, since both “Normal duct” and “IDC” populations are not normally distributed.</p>

<title>Microarray analysis</title>
<p>MDA-MB231 cells containing a control shRNA or PIAS1 shRNA2 were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS (DMEM) or SCM for 30 h. Total RNA was prepared and subjected to microarray analyses using the human genome U133A 2.0 array chip (Affymetrix) as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu1">[19]</xref>. The microarray data is presented in Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089464.s001">File S1</xref> and has been deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE44024).</p>

<title>Quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR)</title>
<p>Quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR) analyses were performed with breast cancer cells or tumor xenograft samples as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu1">[19]</xref>. Briefly, total RNA was prepared using RNA STAT60 (Tel-Test). First strand complementary DNA was produced by reverse transcription (RT) of 1 ug total RNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Q-PCR was carried out using the CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) in a final volume of 25 ul containing Taq polymerase, 1xTaq buffer, 125 uM dNTP, SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes) and gene-specific primers. Amplification conditions were: 95°C (3 min), 40 cycles of 95°C (10 s) and 61°C (30 s). Q-PCR data were analyzed by CFX Manager 2.0 software (Bio-Rad), and normalized by beta-Actin (<italic>ACTB</italic>). The results were presented as “Relative Expression” as compared to that in the control shRNA cells, which was set as “1”.

<title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay</title>
<p>ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP analysis kit as instructed (Upstate). Briefly, cells grown in DMEM plus 10% FBS were cross-linked and lysed. Chromatin was sheared by sonication (10 s at 30% of the maximum strength for a total of six times). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with indicated antibodies, or IgG as a negative control. The binding of these factors to various DNA regions was quantified by quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR) using the immunoprecipitates as templates and specific primers (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089464.s001">File S1</xref>). The results were presented as “percent of input”. The following antibodies were used in the ChIP assay: normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz), anti-PIAS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0089464-Liu7">[51]</xref>, anti-histone H3 trimethylated at Lys9 (H3K9me3) (17-625; Millipore); anti-histone H3 trimethylated at Lys27 (H3K27me3) (17-622; Millipore); anti-Acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) (17-615; Millipore); anti-DNMT1 (Ab13537; Abcam) and anti-DNMT3A (R0015-2; Abiocode).</p>
