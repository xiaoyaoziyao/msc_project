<abstract>
<p>Both β-catenin and NF-κB have been implicated in our laboratory as candidate factors in driving proliferation in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> (CR)-induced colonic crypt hyper-proliferation and hyperplasia. Herein, we test the hypothesis that β-catenin and not necessarily NF-κB regulates colonic crypt hyperplasia or tumorigenesis in response to CR infection. When C57Bl/6 wild type (WT) mice were infected with CR, sequential increases in proliferation at days 9 and 12 plateaued off at day 19 and paralleled increases in NF-κB signaling. In <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (KO) mice, a sequential but sustained proliferation which tapered off only marginally at day 19, was associated with TLR4-dependent and independent increases in NF-κB signaling. Similarly, increases in either activated or total β-catenin in the colonic crypts of WT mice as early as day 3 post-infection coincided with cyclinD1 and c-myc expression and associated crypt hyperplasia. In KO mice, a delayed kinetics associated predominantly with increases in non-phosphorylated (active) β-catenin coincided with increases in cyclinD1, c-myc and crypt hyperplasia. Interestingly, PKCζ-catalyzed Ser-9 phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3β and not loss of wild type APC protein accounted for β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation in either strain. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with Wnt2b and Wnt5a further validated the interplay between the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB pathways, respectively. When WT or KO mice were treated with nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNA to β-catenin (si- β-Cat), almost complete loss of nuclear β-catenin coincided with concomitant decreases in CD44 and crypt hyperplasia without defects in NF-κB signaling. si-β-Cat treatment to <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> mice attenuated CR-induced increases in β-catenin and CD44 that halted the growth of mutated crypts without affecting NF-κB signaling. The predominant β-catenin-induced crypt proliferation was further validated in a Castaneus strain (B6.CAST.11M) that exhibited significant crypt hyperplasia despite an attenuated NF-κB signaling. Thus, β-catenin and not necessarily NF-κB regulates crypt hyperplasia in response to bacterial infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Both β-catenin and NF-κB proteins are important regulators of gene expression and cellular proliferation. β-catenin is a ubiquitously expressed protein that acts as an adhesion molecule by mediating the association of E-cadherin with the cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Kemler1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-BenZeev1">[2]</xref> and is also a critical downstream component of the Wnt pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Peifer1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Funayama1">[5]</xref>. The Wnt family of secretory glycoproteins plays an important role in embryonic development, in the induction of cell polarity, and in the determination of cell fate. Most mammalian genomes including human, harbor 19 Wnt genes, falling into 12 conserved Wnt subfamilies. Wnt proteins are ∼40 kDa in size and contain many conserved cysteines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Tanaka1">[6]</xref>. Wnt ligands produce their effects through activation of one of a dozen different signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Logan1">[7]</xref>. These pathways are broadly categorized as canonical if they require signaling via β-catenin while non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways are β-catenin independent. Interestingly, multiple studies have demonstrated a regulatory cross-talk between canonical and non-canonical pathways wherein, Wnt5a has been shown to induce a non-canonical pathway that inhibits canonical Wnt signaling. This observation has been made both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, including hematopoietic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Torres1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Topol1">[9]</xref>. The outcome however, depends on the receptor context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Mikels1">[10]</xref>. Wnt5a inhibits β-catenin-dependent activity when its signal is mediated by the orphan tyrosine kinase receptor Ror2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Mikels2">[11]</xref>. However, it activates β-catenin-dependent signaling when it signals through the co-receptors Fzd4 and LRP5.</p>
<p>NF-κB comprises a family of transcription factors which are critical in activating the expression of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory response and in the regulation of cellular apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Baldwin1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Ghosh1">[13]</xref>. Typically, NF-κB is activated by inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-1β, via activation of IκB kinases (IKKs), which carry out the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of IκB inhibitors upon inflammatory stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-DiDonato1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Zandi1">[18]</xref>. Constitutively active NF-κB plays an important role in cancer progression and metastasis and has been reported to physically interact with β-catenin, resulting in a reduction in NF-κB nucleus translocation, DNA binding and target gene expression. Recently, GSK-3β is shown to be required for NF-κB activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Hoeflich1">[19]</xref>. As β-catenin is a major substrate of GSK-3β, it raises an interesting possibility that β-catenin may mediate the cross-regulation between the two pathways. Interestingly, β-catenin-independent Wnt signaling is also involved in various biological functions, such as vertebral development, cell motility and adhesion, and cancer invasiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Veeman1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Kurayoshi1">[23]</xref>. Indeed, Wnt5a has been recently implicated in certain inflammatory diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Sen1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-George1">[25]</xref>. Wnt5a expression is dependent on NF-κB signaling via Toll-like receptor (TLR) in human antigen-presenting cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-George1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Blumenthal1">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, IL-6 family members activate the gp130-JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling cascade to up-regulate Wnt5a transcription in chronic persistent inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Sen2">[27]</xref>. However, little is known about the expression and modulation of non-canonical Wnt signaling in the intestine in response to bacterial infection.</p>
<p>It has been shown previously that development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in preterm infants, requires activation of TLR4 on enterocytes and that TLR4 activation by bacterial endotoxin LPS (lipopolysaccharide) inhibits enterocyte proliferation and leads to disease progression due to impaired β-catenin signaling after activation of the Akt-GSK3β signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Sodhi1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Cetin1">[30]</xref>. These effects were however, restricted to the small intestine of newborn mice, suggesting relevance in the development of NEC. Whether TLR4-mediated inhibition of β-catenin signaling in response to infection by Gram negative bacteria is a global phenomenon is not known.</p>
<p><italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> (CR) naturally infects mice using a mechanism similar to those employed by attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens EPEC and EHEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Mundy1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Borenshtein1">[32]</xref>. CR is an A/E pathogen which causes increased proliferation in the distal colon of adult outbred mice without associated injury or significant histological inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Barthold1">[33]</xref>. In genetically susceptible strains, clinical signs such as retarded growth, diarrhea, dehydration, coat ruffling, hunched pasture and high mortality have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Barthold1">[33]</xref>. Utilizing the CR-infection model, we showed for the first time that colonic crypt hyperplasia was associated with NF-κB activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Wang1">[34]</xref> and alterations in Casein Kinase-Iε that influenced β-catenin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Umar1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Sellin1">[36]</xref>. Ongoing studies from our laboratory have further demonstrated that functional cross-talk between Wnt/β-catenin and Notch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Ahmed1">[37]</xref> and Notch and NF-κB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Ahmed2">[38]</xref> pathways regulate crypt hyperplasia and/or tumorigenesis in response to CR infection in outbred mice while inflammation and/or colitis in the inbred mice, driven by the expression of distinct cytokines/chemokines, is regulated by activation of the MEK/ERK/NF-κB pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Chandrakesan1">[39]</xref>. It was shown previously that TLR4 signaling contributes to inflammation induced by CR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Khan1">[40]</xref>. Based on the recent findings that TLR4 antagonizes β-catenin-induced cell proliferation in the small intestine but not in the colon, we hypothesized that β-catenin and not necessarily NF-κB will dictate the colonic crypt hyperplastic response following CR infection in mice deficient for <italic>Tlr4</italic>. This hypothesis was tested in the current study.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Infection of C57Bl/6 wild type mice with <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> (CR) elicited a predictable response in the distal colon: gross thickening accompanied by hyperplasia and significant increase in crypt length between days 7 to 12 post-infection. The crypt length however, plateaued between days 12 to 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). To determine if changes in epithelial cell proliferation contributed towards differences in crypt lengths, we next stained colonic sections for Ki-67 as a marker for proliferation. Representative sections from the distal colons of uninfected normal (N) mice and from days 3 to 19 post-infected mice are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>. In normally proliferating crypts, only cells at the base exhibited nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>). Between days 3–7 post-infection, a gradual increase in Ki-67 staining was recorded which peaked by day 9 before tapering off between days 12–19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>Infection of <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice with CR elicited a much more profound response both in terms of gross morphology and crypt epithelial cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C, D</bold></xref>). Interestingly, neither the crypt length nor the cell proliferation in response to CR infection decreased between days 7–19. On the contrary, Ki-67 staining even at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g001"><bold>Fig. 1D</bold></xref>) was significantly higher than the wild type counterpart (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>) suggesting a more aggressive response to infection in the absence of functional TLR4.</p>
<p>We have recently shown that NF-κB activation in response to CR infection involves signaling via TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Chandrakesan2">[41]</xref>. To determine if CR infection affected changes in TLR4 levels and to definitively characterize TLR4’s role in NF-κB activation during TMCH, we began by examining sequential changes in TLR4 in the colonic crypts of C57Bl/6J mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>, TLR4 levels started to increase by day 3 and peaked between days 5–12 compared to uninfected control before declining at day 19. During measurement of NF-κB activity in the crypt nuclear extracts, a sequential increase was recorded between days 3–12 before activity declined at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>). We next investigated the phosphorylation status of p65-NF-κB to determine whether post-translational modification of this subunit contributed towards sustained activation of NF-κB following CR infection. When we utilized antibodies specific for Serines-276 (p65<sup>276</sup>) and −536 (p65<sup>536</sup>) phosphorylation of p65 subunit, relative levels of both crypt cellular and nuclear p65<sup>276</sup> and p65<sup>536</sup> along with total p65 increased significantly between days 3–12 compared with uninfected control while relative levels of both moieties declined at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>) and correlated with NF-κB activity and expression of its downstream target CXCL-1/KC at these time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref>). The bar graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref> represents the ratio of CXCL-1 normalized to actin from three independent experiments. These studies corroborate well with other murine models of IBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Fukata1">[42]</xref> suggesting that increases in TLR4 may be critical in regulating NF-κB activity during CR-induced crypt hyperplasia.</p>

<p>When <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were infected with CR for 3–19 days, there was no detectable TLR4 in the crypts of these mice as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2E</bold></xref>). During measurement of NF-κB activity in the crypt nuclear extracts, we did not observe any change at day 3 post-infection suggesting that absence of TLR4 apparently affected early activation of NF-κB in response to CR infection. At days 5 and 12 however, a bi-phasic activation of NF-κB was recorded followed by a declining trend at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2F</bold></xref>). Western blots with antibodies to p65<sup>276</sup> and p65<sup>536</sup> at days 5 and 12 dramatically correlated with NF-κB activation kinetics while changes in relative cellular and nuclear levels at other time points were less significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2G</bold></xref>). Total p65 on the other hand, exhibited a sequential increases between days 5–12 before declining at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2G</bold></xref>). The changes in NF-κB activity at days 5, 12 and 19 correlated well with CXCL-1/KC kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2H</bold></xref>). The bar graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2H</bold></xref> represents the ratio of CXCL-1 normalized to actin from three independent experiments. These studies clearly suggest that while early NF-κB activation in response to CR infection of <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice requires signaling via TLR4, later time points exhibit a TLR4-independent mechanism of NF-κB activation in response to CR infection. Given that TLR4 plays an important role in protective immunity wherein, it limits bacterial dissemination to mesenteric lymph nodes and peripheral organs such as liver and spleen, we next measured bacterial counts in the distal colons of uninfected and CR-infected <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2I</bold></xref>, we did not measure any appreciable increase in bacterial counts at day 9 post-infection. At day 12, however, significant increase in bacterial counts compared to control, were recorded followed by a decline at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2I</bold></xref>). Whether the increase in bacterial counts at day 12 also represents bacterial translocation to subepithelial compartments is currently being investigated. Next, we examined the extent of crypt labeling for p65<sup>276</sup> and tried to correlate with changes in NF-κB activity and crypt hyperplasia utilizing tissue sections prepared from uninfected and days 5, 12 and 19 post-CR infected mouse distal colons from wild type C57Bl/6 and <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2J</bold></xref>, p65<sup>276</sup> labeling in sections from uninfected mouse distal was restricted to the base of the crypt. At days 5 and 12, p65<sup>276</sup> labeling in the crypts of C57Bl/6 mice increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2J</bold></xref>) and correlated with changes in NF-κB activity recorded at these time points (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>) while p65<sup>276</sup> labeling decreased significantly at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2J</bold></xref>). Interestingly, p65<sup>276</sup> labeling at day 5 and particularly at days 12 and even 19 in <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice was significantly higher than the wild type counterpart and correlated with NF-κB activity at these time points (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2F</bold></xref>) and crypt hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079432.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold> further shows evidence of significant p65<sup>276</sup> labeling at days 9, 12 and 19 compared to uninfected control which correlates with gross changes in the colonic mucosa. Thus, TLR4 requirement is not absolute for NF-κB activation in response to CR infection.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the contribution of β-catenin towards crypt hyperplasia in response to CR infection in the wild type and <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, respectively. We began by measuring moiety-specific phosphorylation of β-catenin using specific antibodies. In the C57Bl/6 wild type mice, cellular and nuclear levels of Ser<sup>45</sup>-phosphorylated β-catenin (β-Cat<sup>45</sup>) increased between days 5–12 post-infection compared to uninfected control before declining at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>) and correlated with gross changes in hyperplasia. Increases in Ser<sup>45</sup>-phosphorylation when normalized to total β-catenin levels however exhibited only subtle enhancement in phosphorylation intensity suggesting that increases in β-Cat<sup>45</sup> may be due to a proportional increase in overall β-catenin abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>). Similarly, relative levels of β-cat<sup>552</sup> as well as de-phospho-β-catenin (dβ-Cat), both known to represent active β-catenin, increased significantly in both the cellular and nuclear extracts between days 5–12 compared to uninfected control before a rapid decline to basal levels at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>). As before, the increases in these species when compared to changes in total β-catenin were subtle. The alterations in various β-catenin species correlated with relative levels of downstream targets c-myc and cyclinD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>). In <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, increases in cellular and nuclear levels of β-Cat<sup>45</sup> and β-Cat<sup>552</sup> at days 5 and 12 compared to uninfected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>), were mirror images of changes recorded in phosphorylated p65 at these time points (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2G</bold></xref>) while changes at other time points were less significant. In contrast, while the cellular levels of dβ-Cat followed the β-Cat<sup>45</sup> and β-Cat<sup>552</sup> pattern, nuclear levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>) were similar to those recorded in the crypts of wild type C57Bl/6 mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>) except that the levels even at day 19 were significantly higher than uninfected control. The increases in these species were apparently a reflection of an overall increase in total β-catenin at these time points but unlike wild type crypts wherein, the total β-catenin returned to baseline at day 19, total β-catenin in <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> crypts remained elevated than uninfected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>). When we measured downstream targets, both c-myc and cyclinD1 exhibited kinetics similar to that recorded in wild type crypts except that the levels even at day 19 were still higher than uninfected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>). These changes correlated well with persistence of crypt hyperplasia at this time point (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g001"><bold>Fig. 1D</bold></xref>). The changes in cellular/nuclear β-catenin and cyclinD1 in <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were further validated via immunohistochemistry. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>, a significant increase in diffused cytosolic, nuclear and peri-nuclear staining for β-catenin was recorded at days 5 and 12 compared to uninfected control while nuclear staining declined at day 19. Similar staining pattern for cyclinD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3D</bold></xref>) coincided with Western blotting data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>).</p>

<p>Cytosolic levels of free β-catenin are regulated by APC protein. We have shown previously that increases in cellular/nuclear levels of β-catenin in response to CR infection were neither due to mutational activation of β-catenin or loss of functional APC protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Umar1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Ahmed1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Umar2">[43]</xref>. In the current study, relative increases in cellular levels of p312 were recorded at day 12 followed by a decline at day 19 in the colonic crypts of both the wild type and <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice suggesting that increases in β-catenin at day 12 were not due to loss of wild type APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3E</bold></xref>). At the same time and as shown by us previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Umar1">[35]</xref>, increases in β-catenin were probably due to GSK-3β’s phosphorylation at Ser-9 which results in its inactivation. These changes in phospho-GSK-3β were more pronounced in the colonic crypts of <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice compared to the wild type counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3E</bold></xref>). Finally, consistent with the earlier finding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Umar3">[44]</xref>, we observed significant increases in PKCζ, the kinase that phosphorylates Ser-9 of GSK3β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Umar1">[35]</xref>, at day 12 post-infection compared to uninfected control in the colonic crypts of <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice suggesting (but certainly not proving) PKCζ-mediated inactivation of GSK-3β at this time point while changes in wild type mice were less significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g003"><bold>Fig. 3F</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Differential Regulation of β-catenin and NF-κB Pathways <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>So far, we have seen that both increases in NF-κB and β-catenin signaling following CR infection coincide with colonic crypt hyperplasia in wild type as well as <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, respectively. To investigate if an interplay between the two pathways exists, we opted for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to focus on two proteins, Wnt2b and Wnt5a that activate Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB pathways, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Katoh1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Sen2">[27]</xref>. Semi-quantitative PCR revealed significant increases in both Wnt2b and Wnt5a expression in YAMC cells at 48 h post-CR infection compared to uninfected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>). During measurement of β-catenin/Tcf4-dependent TOP-flash reporter activity, CR infection induced a 2-fold increase in reporter activity at 48 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). In response to siRNA-mediated Wnt2b knockdown, reporter activity decreased significantly and was not rescued with CR infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). Wnt5a knockdown on the other hand, resulted in an increase in reporter activity which was further enhanced following CR infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). Next we examined the effect of adding purified Wnt2b and Wnt5a proteins on reporter activities. CR infection compared to uninfected control increased the reporter activity by ∼2-fold as described before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>). Si-RNA to Wnt2b almost completely attenuated the reporter activity while addition of purified Wnt5a did not rescue the inhibitory effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>). Si-RNA to Wnt5a had no effect on the CR-induced reporter activity which remained elevated while addition of Wnt2b further enhanced the reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>). To confirm if these changes were mediated by increases in β-catenin, we stained YAMC cells for β-catenin. Immunofluorescent studies revealed predominantly membranous staining for β-catenin in uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4D</bold></xref>). In contrast, significant nuclear labeling of β-catenin was observed in response to CR infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4D</bold></xref>). Interestingly, siRNA to Wnt2b almost completely blocked β-catenin nuclear translocation while siRNA to Wnt5a had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4D</bold></xref>). Similarly, during scratch-induced wound assay in the YAMC cells, knockdown of Wnt2b but not Wnt5a significantly blocked β-catenin-dependent wound healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4E</bold></xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Figure 4F</bold></xref> is a representative bar graph showing percent migration at 16 h. Thus, Wnt2b and not Wnt5a promotes Wnt signaling in response to CR infection. We next examined the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of Wnt2b and Wnt5a on NF-κB activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. During the DNA binding assay, NF-κB activity increased significantly in response to CR infection compared to uninfected control while siRNA to Wnt2b had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4G</bold></xref>). On the other hand, siRNA to Wnt5a almost completely attenuated CR-induced NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4G</bold></xref>). Thus, Wnt5a and not Wnt2b regulates NF-κB activity in response to CR infection.</p>

<p>A. Measurement of Wnt2b and Wnt5a expression in YAMC (Young Adult Mouse Colon) cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. YAMC cells (5×10<sup>5</sup>) were either uninfected (N) or infected with CR at 90∶1 MOI for 3 hr.

Total RNA was examined for the expression of Wnt2b and Wnt5a via RT-PCR. GAPDH was used as loading control. B. Effect of Wnt2b knockdown on reporter activity. YAMC cells were transiently transfected with TOPflash plasmid and with siRNA specific to Wnt2b and Wnt5a, respectively. After 24 h, cells were infected with CR at 90∶1 MOI for 3 h, washed to remove bacteria followed by measurement of reporter activity at 48 h using Renilla luciferase as internal control (<sup>★</sup>, p&lt;0.05 vs. N; <sup>★★</sup>, p&lt;0.05 vs. CR; *, p&lt;0.05 vs. CR; n = 3 independent experiments).

<p>As proof-of-principle, we further characterized the role(s) of purified Wnt2b and Wnt5a proteins in modulating the Wnt and NF-κB pathways <italic>in vitro</italic>. During immunostaining, β-catenin remained membrane bound in uninfected cells while a predominant nuclear staining was recorded in CR infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>), as described before (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4D</bold></xref>). Interestingly, purified Wnt2b was more potent than even CR infection in facilitating β-catenin’s nuclear import while a combination of Wnt2b+CR did not necessarily yield an additive response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). Addition of purified Wnt5a on the other hand, did not affect either β-catenin levels or nuclear translocation while a combination of Wnt5a+CR restored β-catenin’s nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). During a time course with purified proteins, addition of Wnt2b led to significant increases in relative levels of nuclear β-catenin at 24 hr and the levels persisted until 72 hr post-addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5B</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>). These increases were either at par or even higher than those recorded with CR infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5B</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>). Interestingly, we did not observe any detectable levels of either p65 phosphorylated at Ser-536 (p65<sup>536</sup>) or β-catenin’s downstream targets Slug and Snail following addition of purified Wnt2b while CR infection alone promoted increases in these proteins at indicated times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5B</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>). Wnt5a addition on the other hand, led to significant increases in relative levels of nuclear p65<sup>536</sup> at 24 hr which persisted until 48 hr before declining at 72 hr similar to those recorded with CR infection alone while Wnt5a only had nominal effect on β-catenin levels at these time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5B</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>). Similar to Wnt2b, Wnt5a did not affect Slug and Snail expression at either time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5B</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>). Next, during measurement of NF-κB activity, CR infection compared to uninfected control, caused a reproducible increase in NF-κB activity at 24 hr which persisted until 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>). Following addition of Wnt5a, a significant increase in NF-κB activity was recorded at 24 hr which persisted until 72 hr while addition of Wnt2b had subtle effect on NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>). Finally, based on our previous report regarding activation of MEK/ERK pathway following CR infection in the colonic crypts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Chandrakesan2">[41]</xref>, we performed scratch-induced wound assay in YAMC cells in the presence or absence of MEK inhibitor PD98059 (MEKi) to understand if MAPK signaling may be contributing towards CR+Wnt2b-induced wound healing. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>, CR infection compared to uninfected cells, caused almost complete wound closure between 12–16 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>). Treatment of uninfected cells with MEKi only caused a subtle failure in cell migration while CR infection of MEKi-treated cells neutralized the inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>). Si-RNA to Wnt2b significantly blocked CR-induced cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>) as described earlier (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g004"><bold>Fig. 4E</bold></xref>). Interestingly, a combination of siRNA-Wnt2b+MEKi almost completely abrogated CR-induced cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>) suggesting that Wnt2b/MEK cross-talk may be required for CR-induced cell migration. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079432.s002">Figure S2A</xref></bold> is a representative bar graph showing percent migration at 16 h. Taken together, these studies clearly implicate both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways in the differential regulation of β-catenin and NF-κB in response to CR infection.</p>

<title>Blocking β-catenin <italic>in vivo</italic> Abrogates Crypt Hyperplasia and Reduces Tumorigenesis</title>
<p>Our next aim was to understand the interplay between the β-catenin and NF-κB pathways <italic>in vivo</italic> in response to CR infection in the wild type (WT) mice and mice deficient for TLR4. In response to either CR infection or CR infection+vehicle treatment of either strain, significant increases in both active and total β-catenin was observed in the crypt cellular and nuclear extracts along with increases in its downstream target cyclinD1, compared to uninfected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g006"><bold>Fig. 6A, B</bold></xref>). When WT or <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were treated with nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNA to β-catenin (si-β-Cat), we observed almost complete loss of nuclear β-catenin with concomitant decreases in cyclinD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g006"><bold>Fig. 6A, B</bold></xref>). As expected, si-β-Cat treatment had no effect on active (p65<sup>276</sup>, p65<sup>536</sup>) or total NF-κB-p65 which remained elevated in CR infected crypt cellular and nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g006"><bold>Fig. 6A, B</bold></xref>). Interestingly, si-β-Cat treatment significantly blocked β-Cat<sup>552</sup> nuclear staining concomitant with decreases in cell proliferation as was determined by reduced Ki-67 staining in treated samples without grossly affecting the mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g006"><bold>Fig. 6C, D</bold></xref>). To see if downstream targets of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and putative markers of stem cells were affected, we next examined the effect of si-β-Cat treatment on CD44 and Dclk1 staining in the two sets of mice. In response to either CR infection or CR infection+vehicle treatment, staining for both CD44 and Dclk1 increased in the colonic crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g006"><bold>Fig. 6E, F</bold></xref>).

<title>Evidence of β-catenin and not NF-κB-induced Crypt Hyperplasia in CAST.11M Mice</title>
<p>Castaneus mice contain a CAST/Ei region on chromosome 11 (CAST.11M) on an otherwise C57BL/6 genetic background. Genetic variation within an 8.3 Mb region on mouse chromosome 11 controls host response to anthrax lethal toxin and resistance to infection by the Sterne strain of <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Moayeri1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Terra1">[47]</xref>. We compared these mice with wild type C57Bl/6 to determine if differences exist in the extent of β-catenin and NF-κB activation and associated crypt hyperplasia in these mice in response to CR infection. Following CR infection, C57Bl/6 mice exhibited significant crypt hyperplasia as revealed by Ki-67 staining at day 9 which peaked by day 12 and plateaued by day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8A</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>). In CAST.11M mice however, Ki-67 staining and crypt lengths at day 12 and particularly at day 19 compared to uninfected controls were 1.5–2 fold higher than those recorded in C57Bl/6 mice at the same time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8A</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>). Transmission electron microscopy revealed no difference in bacterial binding at the luminal surface in either strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8B</bold></xref>); yet, C57Bl/6 mice had significant disruption of the tight junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8B</bold></xref>), an elevated serum FITC-Dextran levels (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079432.s002">Fig. S2B</xref></bold>) and recruitment of CD3+ T-cells and F4/80+ macrophages to the sub-epithelial regions compared to CAST.11M mice (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079432.s003">Fig. S3</xref></bold>). Mechanistically, in C57Bl/6 mice, Ki-67 kinetics coincided with increases in nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and its downstream target cyclinD1 at days 9 and 12 compared to uninfected control while the levels declined at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8C</bold></xref><bold>i, Cii</bold>). In addition, p65<sup>276</sup>/p65<sup>536</sup> subunit expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8D</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>) and NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8D</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>) increased significantly at days 9 and 12 with declining trend at day 19 that correlated with downstream target CXCL-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8E</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>). In CAST.11M mice on the other hand, we observed a delayed response wherein, nuclear β-catenin levels did not go up until day 12 with sustained expression at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8C</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>) which coincided with cyclinD1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8C</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>) and Ki-67 kinetics at these time points. Interestingly, CAST.11M mice did not exhibit any significant increase in phosphorylated/total p65 subunit expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8D</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>), NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8D</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>), CXCL-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8E</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>) or serum FITC-Dextran levels (<bold>Suppl.</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>) at these time points despite adequate bacterial binding to the colonic mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g008"><bold>Fig. 8B</bold></xref>). Thus, β-catenin can regulate crypt hyperplasia in response to CR infection in the absence of NF-κB signaling.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB are independent pathways involved in the regulation of physiological and pathological effects related to the development, immune function, inflammation, tumorigenesis and frank malignancy. The recent discovery of functional cross-regulation between the two pathways has established complex roles for Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling in the pathogenesis of various diseases including cancer. Indeed, the mechanisms and biological effects of the cross-regulation of the two pathways remains an area of intense investigation. It is now evident that strategies targeting the cross-regulation between these pathways may be a promising direction for future cancer therapeutics.</p>
<p>Recognition of Gram negative bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by toll like receptor-4 (TLR4) and subsequent activation of NF-κB not only activates host defense against pathogenic bacteria, but can also provide mucosal protection. In pathological situations however, TLR4 is upregulated in both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, two components of human IBD, leading to pro-inflammatory signaling via NF-κB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Fukata1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Kawai1">[48]</xref>. We recently showed that NF-κB activation in response to CR infection was dependent upon signaling via TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Chandrakesan2">[41]</xref>. In this study, we observed significant increases in cellular levels of TLR4 in the colonic crypts of CR infected mice suggesting critical role(s) for TLR4 in transducing signals in response to CR infection. To definitively implicate TLR4 in CR-induced NF-κB activation, we utilized <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in the B6 background wherein, initial kinetics of NF-κB activation at day 3 highlighted the need for the presence of TLR4; NF-κB activation at day 5 however, may represent a homeostatic response to counter bacterial infection while NF-κB activation at day 12 which correlated with peak hyperplasia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>) may represent an intrinsic pathway activation independent of TLR4. This is in contrast to decreased epithelial proliferation and significant epithelial injury recorded during DSS-induced colitis in <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Fukata1">[42]</xref>. These differences may be attributable to the nature of the colitis-inducing agent: CR infection may represent more physiological approach while DSS-induced damage of the epithelial cells may lead to more severe outcome. Whatever the case may be, the issue remains regarding NF-κB activation in the absence of signaling via TLR4. Since cell types such as macrophages and lymphocytes in addition to epithelial cells, express TLR4, it is probable that NF-κB activation at day 12 in these mice may be a result of stromal-epithelial cross-talk wherein, bacterial translocation to the cells of the stroma (e.g., MΦs, lymphocytes etc.) may eventually facilitate NF-κB activation in the crypts via a paracrine pathway. Indeed, we observed a 1.5-fold increase in bacterial counts at day 12 compared to day 9 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079432-g002"><bold>Fig. 2I</bold></xref>) which may correlate with NF-κB activation at this time point. Whether these increases in bacterial counts also reflect bacterial translocation is currently being investigated. Nevertheless, this is consistent with TLR4’s role in limiting bacterial translocation in a murine model of colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Fukata1">[42]</xref>. Taken together, a combination of TLR4-dependent and independent mechanism may operate in tandem to regulate NF-κB activity in the colonic crypts of <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice following CR infection.</p>
<p>In addition to TLR4’s contribution towards NF-κB activation in response to Gram negative bacteria or LPS, TLR4 has also been involved in modulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the intestine, and that over-expression of TLR4 has been found sufficient for priming the intestinal mucosa towards neoplasia. Indeed, Santaolalla R. et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Santaolalla1">[49]</xref> have recently shown that TLR4 over-expression induces β-catenin phosphorylation in the colon and in cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>. The same group previously showed that TLR4 signaling in the colon induces epithelial proliferation and protection against apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Fukata2">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Fukata3">[51]</xref>. Consistent with these findings, we also find significant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway wherein, changes in various species of β-catenin in response to CR infection in C57Bl/6 mice directly correlated with increases in TLR4 levels, downstream targets such as cyclinD1, a number of stem cell-specific marker proteins such as CD44 and Dclk1 and crypt hyperplasia. However, contrary to the above findings, we found even more dramatic changes in β-catenin cellular abundance and downstream target expression in <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and these changes directly correlated with increases in crypt hyperplasia in infected mice. A definitive role for β-catenin in CR-induced crypt hyperplasia in <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice was established by blocking increases in β-catenin <italic>in vivo</italic> which resulted in attenuation of the hyperplastic response. These results clearly contradict the notion that TLR4 is somehow required for activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Infact, a recent study by Sodhi CP et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Sodhi1">[28]</xref> suggested that TLR4 actually inhibits β-catenin and impairs enterocyte proliferation in the small intestine of neonatal mice with experimental necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This effect however, was not seen in the colon of the same neonatal mice nor was it found anywhere in the intestine of adult mice. Thus, even though our findings particularly in <italic>Tlr4</italic>-deficient mice corroborate with those described during NEC, the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling via TLR4 seems more complex than what was initially envisioned.</p>
<p>Continuing with our theme of interplay between the Wnt/β-catenin and the NF-κB pathways, an elegant study recently reported that constitutive IKKβ/NF-κB activation strongly synergized with Wnt signaling to promote intestinal tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Vlantis1">[52]</xref>. We showed previously that functional cross-talk between β-catenin and NF-κB was integral to the hyperproliferative effects of progastrin on proximal colonic crypts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Umar4">[53]</xref>. In the current study however, we have discovered that despite significant activation of the NF-κB pathway in the distal colons of wild type or <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice or in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> mice, knockdown of β-catenin significantly impacted both hyperplasia and tumorigenesis in response to CR infection. Since a combination of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling regulates the interplay between the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Du1">[54]</xref>, we have further elucidated the roles of two Wnt ligands, Wnt2b and Wnt5a in the differential regulation of these pathways <italic>in vitro</italic>. Based on functional assays with purified proteins, we conclude that Wnt2b but not Wnt5a regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway while Wnt5a and not Wnt2b is involved in the activation of the NF-κB pathway, respectively. In previous studies, Wnt2b is shown to be transiently expressed in the primitive streak during gastrulation and has been suggested to primarily play a supportive role in gastrulation and organogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Katoh2">[55]</xref>. It is upregulated in liver and biliary epithelial cells of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Tanaka2">[56]</xref>, and in colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-You1">[57]</xref>. Wnt2b is also shown to be expressed in several types of human cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, head/neck squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer and leukemia. More recently, canonical Wnt2/2b signaling is shown to be required for specification of the lung endoderm progenitors in the developing foregut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Goss1">[58]</xref>. Similarly, Wnt5a activates both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways and is implicated in a variety of cellular processes during development and carcinogenesis. Importantly, the expression of Wnt5a protein is controlled by the NF-κB signaling pathway, which may be implicated as an essential mediator not only for infection, but also for cancer development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Du1">[54]</xref>. While we present evidence of differential β-catenin and NF-κB regulation by the two Wnt ligands in primary colonocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, studies in new mouse models allowing specific deletion of genes encoding these proteins in the epithelial cells of the colon will be required to address the potential role(s) of these ligands in either crypt hyperplasia or tumorigenesis in response to CR infection.</p>
<p>The dominance of β-catenin-induced crypt proliferation in response to CR infection was further validated in a Castaneus strain (CAST.11M) that exhibits high susceptibility to Anthrax’s lethal toxin (LT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Terra1">[47]</xref> due to a region at chromosome 11 that encodes the LT-responsive CAST/Ei allele of Nlrp1b inflammasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Terra1">[47]</xref>. Interestingly, LT-mediated lethality in mice was found to be independent of TLR4 function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Moayeri1">[46]</xref>. Thus, while it is intriguing to observe a muted NF-κB response in the distal colons of these mice, it is not known whether modifier genes at chromosome 11 are necessarily interfering with NF-κB activation in response to CR infection. Whatever the case may be, the fact that we still observed significant increases in β-catenin in these mice that correlated with crypt hyperplasia further proves our hypothesis that β-catenin and not necessarily NF-κB regulates crypt hyperplasia in response to CR infection. Given that deregulation of the components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in a wide spectrum of diseases including cancer, our studies further provide a rationale for targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to treat diseases with infectious etiology.</p>

Twenty four hour post-transfection, cells were either uninfected (medium only) or infected with CR (<email xlink:type="simple">@1</email>∶90 MOI) or incubated with purified Wnt2b and Wnt5a (<email xlink:type="simple">@250</email> ng/ml) at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 3 hr followed by washing to remove bacteria. At indicated times, cells were processed for measurement of luciferase activity with a luminometer and the values were normalized to the internal control. All transfection experiments were repeated at least three times.</p>

The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA or 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mM Tris-HCl and 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature (21°C). Immunoantigenicity was detected by incubating the membranes overnight with the appropriate primary antibodies (0.5–1.0 µg/ml in 5% BSA or 5% nonfat dried milk). After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat, anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies and developed using the ECL detection system (GE) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>Histology, Immunofluorescence (IMF) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title>
<p>For histology, tissues were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin or in Carnoy’s fixative (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, and 10% acetic acid) prior to paraffin embedding. Paraffin-embedded sections (5 µm) were stained with H&amp;E for gross morphology and the pictures were obtained with an Eclipse E1000 microscope (Nikon). IMF to detect β-catenin in YAMC cells treated as described above or IHCs to detect Ki-67, p65<sup>276</sup>, β-catenin, cyclinD1, CD44, CD133 and Dclk1 were performed on 5-µm-thick paraffin embedded sections prepared from the distal colons of uninfected normal, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12 and 19 days CR-infected or CR-infected and siβ-Cat-NPs treated mice utilizing the HRP labeled polymer conjugated to secondary antibody using Envision+System-HRP (DAB; DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) with microwave accentuation as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Wang1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Sellin1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Chandrakesan1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Umar4">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Chandrakesan3">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079432-Umar8">[67]</xref>. Antibody controls included either omission of the primary antibody or detection of endogenous IgG staining with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA).

The fixed tissues were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanols and embedded in epon-araldite resin and maintained for 48 hours at 60°C to polymerize. Ultra-thin (100 nm) sections cut on a Leica UC-6 ultramicrotome were put on glow discharged 300 mesh copper grids and stained with Uranyl Acetate and Sato’s Lead to enhance contrast. Ultra-thin sections were examined with a Hitachi H-7600 electron microscope.</p>
