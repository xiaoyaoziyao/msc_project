<title>Background</title>
<p>In low hepatitis B virus (HBV)-prevalent countries, most HBV-infected persons are unaware of their status. We aimed to evaluate whether (i) previous HBV-testing, (ii) physicians decision to screen, and (iii) CDC's recommendations identified infected individuals and which risk-factor groups needing testing.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>During a mass, multi-center HBV-screening study from September 2010-August 2011, 3929 participants were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HBs and anti-Hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBcAb). Questions on HBV risk-factors and testing practices were asked to participants, while participants' eligibility for HBV-testing was asked to study medical professionals.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>85 (2.2%) participants were HBsAg-positive, while 659 (16.8%) had either resolved HBV infection or isolated anti-HBcAb. When comparing practices, HBV-testing was more likely to occur in HBV-infected participants if Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations were used (Sensitivity = 100%, 95%CI: 95.8–100) than physicians' discretion (Sensitivity = 87.1%, 95%CI: 78.0–93.4) or previous HBV-test (Sensitivity = 36.5%, 95%CI: 26.3–47.6) (p&lt;0.0001). Nevertheless, many non-infected individuals would still have been screened using CDC-recommendations (Specificity = 31.1%, 95%CI: 29.6–32.6). Using multivariable logistic regression, HBsAg-positive status was significantly associated with the following: males, originating from high HBV-endemic region, contact with HBV-infected individual, without national healthcare, and intravenous-drug user (IDU). Of these risk-factors, physician's discretion for testing HBV was not significantly associated with participants' geographical origin or IDU.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Missed opportunities of HBV-screening are largely due to underestimating country of origin as a risk-factor. Applying CDC-recommendations could improve HBV-screening, but with the disadvantage of many tests. Further development of HBV-testing strategies is necessary, especially before severe disease occurs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects more than 350 million people worldwide, of whom 600,000 die each year of liver-related diseases associated with long-term infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Goldstein1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-WHO1">[2]</xref>. In Western countries, despite a relatively low prevalence and widely available access to vaccination, HBV remains one of the most frequent chronic infectious diseases, with a prevalence reaching 14 million in the European region compared to 9 million with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 1.5 million with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Hatzakis1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Despite this high disease burden, few HBV infected patients are aware of their chronic infection. For instance, data have shown that 77% of HBV-infected persons in the European region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-ELPA1">[4]</xref>, 65% in the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-IOM1">[5]</xref> and up to 55% in France <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Meffre1">[6]</xref> are unaware of their status. These persons constitute a reservoir able to transmit HBV to other at-risk individuals and seek care at later stages of disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Weinbaum1">[7]</xref>. The high level of infection status unawareness can be explained by both the lack of knowledge in the general population or those at-risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-ELPA1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Crutzen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Xiong1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Tosini1">[10]</xref> and the lightness given by health care providers and policymakers with respect to its public health impact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Hatzakis1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-IOM1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>As shown for HIV, identifying HBV-infected individuals through increased testing could be a necessary step towards decreasing the incidence of HBV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Coates1">[11]</xref>. However, testing recommendations are contentious across Europe. In France, there are no national guidelines, despite recent publication of the “National Plan for Hepatitis B and C” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-DGS1">[12]</xref>, and testing practices continue to be highly variable. The United States Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) do have official recommendations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Weinbaum1">[7]</xref>, in which individuals presenting with at least one of a large set of HBV risk-factors should be tested. To the best of our knowledge, the justification of such a strategy has never been evaluated in a diverse population, outside of specific risk-factor groups, such as clinics for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Spenatto1">[13]</xref>, racial/ethnic minorities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Hu1">[14]</xref>, immigrants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Perumalswami1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Wong1">[16]</xref> etc. In order to assess these issues and suggest opportunities for improvement, we conducted a large, HBV-screening study among persons having different HBV transmission risk-factors in a wide range of healthcare settings where screening, prevention, and/or vaccination services are provided.</p>
<p>The general aim of the study herein was to determine the ability of various testing practices to identify infected and non-infected individuals. To this end, we first investigated if previous testing strategies reached HBsAg-positive persons and if these persons would have been tested by a physician. We then intended to evaluate whether identification of HBsAg-positive individuals was any different when applying CDC testing recommendations. Finally, we set out to compare what types of risk-factors distinguish persons with prior HBV-testing or testing via physician's discretion to those infected with HBV.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>The OPTISCREEN-B program and study design</title>
<p>The OPTISCREEN-B program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.optiscreenb.fr" xlink:type="simple">www.optiscreenb.fr</ext-link>) was a multicenter, cross-sectional study in the Paris metropolitan region. Initially, we conducted an evaluation of several rapid tests that could be used to identify the presence of serological markers typically used in screening for chronic HBV infection. In the sub-study herein, we aimed to perform a comprehensive evaluation of screening practices among participants included in the program.</p>
<p>Ten centers, including a total of 75 study physicians, participated in the study. Healthcare centers were selected to represent those whose objectives included screening, prevention, and/or vaccination of diverse populations. More specifically, these centers provided one of the following services: free and anonymous sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing [Consultation de dépistage anonyme et gratuite (CDAG) Belleville, CDAG Figuier, CDAG St Antoine]; testing for the general population [Centre d'examens de santé de la Caisse Primaire d'Assurance Maladie (CPAM), Consultation Voyage St Antoine], immigrants and persons with low socioeconomic status (Centre de Santé rue au Maire, Médecins du Monde, Policlinique St Antoine, Croix-Rouge Moulin Joly), or incarcerated individuals [Unité de consultations et de soins ambulatoires (UCSA)]. All centers were required to be in the Paris metropolitan region so that HBV-infected patients could be referred to a single hospital (Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris) for subsequent care.</p>
<p>The target screening population was persons potentially eligible for HBV-testing in healthcare centers, regardless of any HBV-testing recommendations. From September 2010 to August 2011, volunteers were asked to participate during their regular consultation if ≥18 years old and could be available for further contact. Since one major factor steering the decision to test in practice is complete certainty of prior HBV-infection or vaccination status, participants with a confirmed HBsAg-positive, anti-HBsAg antibody-positive, or anti-HBcAg antibody-positive test (requiring proof of result) were not included. This means that participants were still eligible if they declared having a previous test or vaccination but were unable to provide proof. Participants whose result was negative for all three HBV serological markers &gt;6 months prior were also eligible. Importantly, no participant was excluded based on nationality, legal situation or access to government-provided healthcare. All participants provided written informed consent in their native language and the protocol was approved by the Hôtel-Dieu Hospital Ethics Committee (Paris, France) in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>HBV risk-factor questionnaire</title>
<p>A questionnaire was administered by a trained clinical research assistant during a face-to-face interview with the participant. Questions were asked in lay terms on a variety of socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, country of origin, parent's country of origin, education, employment status) and healthcare coverage. A section on risk-factors of HBV transmission was modeled from CDC testing recommendations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Weinbaum1">[7]</xref> and a previous questionnaire developed by the Institut de Veille Sanitaire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Meffre1">[6]</xref>, as well as other potential risk-factors. HBV-endemicity of birth country was established according to WHO classification (prevalence of HBsAg-positive individuals): high (&gt;8%), intermediate (2–8%), and low (&lt;2%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-WHO2">[17]</xref>. Participants were also asked whether they had been vaccinated against HBV (verification of vaccination card was not performed).</p>

<title>Assessing HBV-screening in practice</title>
<p>Three major facets of HBV-testing were evaluated. First, patients were asked whether they had a previous HBV-test. Second, participating physicians were asked via separate questionnaire if they would have tested the participant regardless of inclusion in the OPTISCREEN-B study. Physicians were encouraged not to change their habitual HBV screening practices. Of note, no center-specific, regional, or national recommendations for HBV-screening were available. In addition, they were not given study questionnaires filled out by participants nor a checklist of CDC testing recommendations. Finally, we applied the CDC's HBV screening recommendations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092266-g002">Figure 2</xref>), determining that a given participant would be tested if they stated yes for any one of the listed risk-factors in their questionnaire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Weinbaum1">[7]</xref>.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We determined the predictive capacity of (1) a previous HBV-test, (2) physicians' discretion, and (3) CDC recommendations in testing HBsAg-positive individuals. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV, respectively) were estimated for each testing condition. Area under the receiving operator characteristic (AUROC) was used to estimate (Se+Sp)/2 and were compared between testing strategies using a test of equality of ROC areas from an algorithm developed by DeLong et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-DeLong1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate risk-factors for a (1) a previous HBV-test, (2) physicians' discretion, and (3) HBsAg-positive status, we used random-effects logistic regression to determine the univariate association between risk-factors and each outcome (previous HBV-test, physicians' discretion for HBV test, and HBsAg-positive status) while accounting for within-center correlation. With a solely predictive objective in mind, a multivariable logistic model was then constructed in a forward-stepwise fashion, selecting risk-factors with a p-value &lt;0.05 and testing their significance when added to the model using a likelihood ratio test. After developing the full model, covariates with p-values&gt;0.05 were then removed one-by-one to obtain the final model. Specification error was tested by a link test for single-equation models without accounting for within-center correlation. Since many of the covariables were expected to be highly associated, tolerance (for any one variable, defined as 1-R<sup>2</sup> determined when all other variables are regressed on that variable) and variance inflation factor (VIF, 1/tolerance) were used to determine the extent of collinearity. If all variables in the model are uncorrelated, both statistics are expected to be 1.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using STATA (v12.1, College Station, TX, USA) statistical software and significance was determined using a <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;0.05.</p>

<title>Previous HBV-testing</title>
<p>Overall, 1199 (30.5%) participants claimed that they had been previously tested for HBV. Unsurprisingly, previous testing practices did not reach the majority of HBV-infected participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092266-t003">Table 3</xref>), indicated by a poor Se (36.5%) and PPV (2.6%). This translates into 54/85 HBsAg-positive patients who would have benefited from HBV-testing and conversely 1168 persons who had a previous test without HBsAg. With an AUROC at 0.53 (95%CI: 0.48-0.58), previous testing did not appropriately identify HBsAg-positive participants.</p>

<title>Differentiating HBV-screening practices within HBV-infection groups</title>
<p>Since HBsAg-positive, resolved HBV-infection, and isolated anti-HBc Ab participants all had exposure to HBV, it would be extremely difficult to clinically differentiate the need for HBV testing between them. We conducted sensitivity analysis in which these three groups were compared to vaccinated or non-immunized patients. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092266-t004">Table 4</xref>, there were no substantial differences in Se and Sp between the three categories, regardless of the HBV-screening practice considered. Among those not exposed to HBV; 975 (30.6%) had a previous test, 2074 (65.1%) were recommended screening by the physician, and 2015 (63.3%) would have been tested when applying CDC recommendations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study is one of the largest and more recent examining HBV screening in a population with diverse HBV risk-factors performed in European country. We observed that individuals coming from intermediate and high HBV-endemic regions are in most need of HBV-testing and, while these individuals were more likely to be previously tested for HBV, they were not likely to be screened by the physician. More concerning was that individuals without national health insurance were at significant risk of having HBsAg-positive serology, yet were not likely to have had a previous HBV-test. The fact that physicians identified the need to test this specific population suggests that targeted campaigns are feasible. This study has particular interest in France, which hosts a large number of immigrants from intermediate to high HBV-endemic regions and is increasing funds for larger health coverage among them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-IGF1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Certain caution should be given to the generalizability of our results. We observed a 2.2% prevalence of chronically HBV-infected individuals and 18.9% with past HBV-infection, corresponding to the prevalence criteria for moderate HBV-endemic countries. These estimates are almost two times higher than those observed in population-based studies in French metropolitan regions (HBsAg-positive: 0.8 and past HBV-infection: 10.8% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Meffre1">[6]</xref>). These differences can be explained by a number of factors. First, we included a higher proportion of marginalized populations, such as immigrants, persons from lower socioeconomic status, and those without healthcare or needing healthcare assistance. Accordingly, there were roughly four-times more individuals born in high-HBV endemic countries in our study population (23.3%) than estimates from the Ile-de-France region (5.4%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Insee1">[22]</xref>. It should be stated that these populations are usually underrepresented or ignored in prevalence estimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Meffre1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Hu1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-ECDC1">[23]</xref>. Second, our study population was mainly seeking care at free and anonymous STD testing centers and was also slightly younger than the general population (median age: 33 versus 39, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Insee2">[24]</xref>. Third, we excluded any patient with a confirmed, positive test for HBsAg, anti-HBsAg Ab and/or anti-HBcAb. The reasons for this exclusion criterion were driven by our clinical experience. Taken together, our intent was not to represent the general population in what might be considered a “universal” screening campaign, rather those individuals who could be potentially eligible for HBV testing specifically in healthcare settings with screening, prevention, and/or vaccination services.</p>
<p>Judging from previous HBV-testing, it would appear that screening practices had been based on a wide-range of at-risk populations, but a proportionally higher amount of testing was performed among IDU, MSM, and persons with more than one sexual partner. When comparing these results to HBsAg-positive individuals, IDU and those without health insurance were certainly at need for screening, but previous testing practices would seem, as previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Spenatto1">[13]</xref>, to overemphasize sexual practice as a risk-factor.</p>
<p>We also clearly demonstrate that CDC recommendations allow for a more efficient testing strategy than via physicians' discretion or previous testing strategies. When looking at individual classification probabilities, it comes as no surprise that CDC criteria, with thirteen extremely diverse criteria, had perfect sensitivity in our study. In addition, a major advantage of the CDC recommendations is its capacity to practically eliminate missed opportunities of HBV-testing (i.e. patients needing testing who were not tested), contrary to physician's discretion where 12.9% of HBsAg-positive patients would not have been tested for HBV. However, screening recommendations such as these come with the disadvantage of many tests, the extent of which has not yet been formally evaluated. From our data, the specificity was remarkably poor, putting into question whether the current recommendations are too overreaching. Still, the specificity of physician's discretion for HBV-testing was very similar to CDC recommendations, implying that there could be some benefit to applying these recommendations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one important consideration when testing for HBV is the complexity of HBV infection itself. HBV-exposed individuals (i.e. HBsAg-positive, resolved infection, isolated HBcAb-positive) all share common transmission risk-factor patterns, yet not all are infected. We observed that the Se and Sp of these three infection groups did not change when compared to nonimmunized/vaccinated individuals, suggesting that all strategies share the common difficulty of distinguishing HBV-infected individuals. Our findings highlight that recommendations should address this particular issue.</p>
<p>Several other limitations need to be addressed in our study. First, CDC recommendations for HBV screening were discussed during investigator meetings and the on-site presence of OPTISCREEN-B study personnel was fairly obvious. Even though we explicitly asked physicians if they would have tested each individual for HBV despite participating in the study, we cannot rule out any potential observation bias that physicians were more inclined to test for HBV. Second, since this was a convenience sample from a previous validation study, we did not incorporate any specific sampling scheme in the study design and therefore our results were not corrected to represent the general population using weighted estimates. Furthermore, as an ancillary objective was to comprehensively evaluate the clinical status of all HBV-infected patients, we chose not to include an overly large catchment area so that all patients could be followed at a single center. Third, there were certain issues concerning the models. Many risk-factors were highly correlated, especially between parents from high endemic countries, no health insurance plan, and born in intermediate/high HBV-endemic regions. The collinearity of these variables had most likely a modest impact on the models, as determined by the variance inflation factors. Model overfitting could have also occurred when predicting risk-factors for HBsAg-positive status, in particular for IDU and born in intermediate/high HBV-endemic regions. However, due to their importance, we decided not to exclude them from the model. Finally, despite the majority of exclusions being due to prior confirmed tests and not for logistical reasons, there was a notable percentage of patients refusing participation in the study. However, it should be stated that participation rates in our study were similar, if not higher, than previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Spenatto1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-dAlmeida1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Scott1">[26]</xref> Notwithstanding these limitations, this study does have several important features, including diverse recruiting centers, large number of participating physicians, broad inclusion criteria, and complete HBV serology.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although our study population may not be fully representative of the general population, we demonstrate that more emphasis needs to be placed on testing individuals from intermediate to high HBV-endemic countries, IDUs, and limited access to health care; but not necessarily those with increased sexual activity. CDC recommendations may provide additional benefit when compared to physicians' discretion, yet both have the disadvantage of many tests. Future research should aim at increasing awareness of HBV-infection status with the use of rapid HBV testing, whose ease of use could meet the need for an immediate testing result. These testing strategies are reliable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092266-Bottero1">[18]</xref> and could increase linkage to care, thereby reducing lost to follow-up and possibly increasing cost-effectiveness. Although our study focused on more successful strategies to screen infected individuals and ignored the clinical implications of a negative test, it should be further evaluated whether testing can be used as a gateway for HBV vaccination among non-immunized individuals.</p>
