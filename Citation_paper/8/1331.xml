<abstract>
<p>Memory storage in the brain relies on mechanisms acting on time scales from minutes, for long-term synaptic potentiation, to days, for memory consolidation. During such processes, neural circuits distinguish synapses relevant for forming a long-term storage, which are consolidated, from synapses of short-term storage, which fade. How time scale integration and synaptic differentiation is simultaneously achieved remains unclear. Here we show that synaptic scaling – a slow process usually associated with the maintenance of activity homeostasis – combined with synaptic plasticity may simultaneously achieve both, thereby providing a natural separation of short- from long-term storage. The interaction between plasticity and scaling provides also an explanation for an established paradox where memory consolidation critically depends on the exact order of learning and recall. These results indicate that scaling may be fundamental for stabilizing memories, providing a dynamic link between early and late memory formation processes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The ability to form memories of the past is a main feature of the brain. Memories are formed by learning. However, the biological mechanisms for learning, which change the synaptic weights by synaptic plasticity, act on a different time scale (minutes) than those that lead to memory consolidation (days). Experimental results of the last 15 years show that there exists another mechanism, named synaptic scaling, which also influences synaptic weights but on an intermediate time scale (hours). In this study, we analyse whether this process could bridge the time gap and to what degree it can be used to link the processes of synaptic changes with the slow processes of memory formation (and forgetting). Furthermore, the combination of synaptic plasticity and scaling provides a possible explanation for the effect that memory recall can destabilize existing memories. Thus, our results suggest that synaptic scaling is a fundamental mechanism for the dynamic processes of memory.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Memory function consists of different, temporally overlapping stages, roughly divided into working memory, short-term and long-term memory, which are distinguishable by their increasing capacity and storage duration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Eichenbaum1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tetzlaff1">[2]</xref>. Especially long-term memory requires lasting changes which involve synaptic plasticity and, subsequently, other complex and slow physiological and anatomical network processes. Furthermore, the formation of long-term memories relies on memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Mller1">[3]</xref>, for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai1">[4]</xref>). Consolidation, in turn, seems to rely on the intrinsic activation of the network that happens during sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Stickgold1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Chauvette1">[7]</xref>. Commonly one distinguishes between two types of consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Frankland1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai2">[10]</xref>: (i) systems consolidation which transfers memories from one brain area to another (e.g., from hippocampus to neocortex) and (ii) synaptic consolidation which stabilizes memories within a brain area. However, even after consolidation, memories are not ‘frozen’, thus, new memories learnt can disrupt memories previously learnt and, furthermore, the recall of a memory can destabilize this memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Nader1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-McKenzie1">[13]</xref>. Memories have to be (re)consolidated several times to achieve permanence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is an intriguing problem how the nervous system is capable of distinguishing between memories of different storage duration within the same brain area. Given that memories are represented by synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Hebb1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Martin1">[15]</xref>, somehow candidate synapses for long storage duration (named in the following long-term storage LTS to not confuse this with long-term memory) must respond differently to those that are involved in short-term storage (STS) only. In particular, one would expect that LTS-candidate synapses should be susceptible to synaptic consolidation, while STS-candidates should not.</p>
<p>All this happens mainly in the cross-section of the hippocampal and cortical networks, a highly dynamic system continuously driven by inputs as well as by intrinsic activity patterns. In spite of this dynamic volatility, the network is capable of maintaining the synaptic integrity of LTS-candidates for a long enough time such that systems consolidation and other processes can set in.</p>
<p>Many computational and psychological memory models describe the dynamics of systems consolidation between hippocampus and neocortex by introducing different time scales for plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Alvarez1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Roxin1">[20]</xref>. By contrast, experimental evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Kirkwood1">[21]</xref> indicates that the time scales are about the same. For synaptic consolidation the underlying central difficulty, which makes it hard to design more realistic memory models, is that synaptic plasticity operates at time-scales of seconds to minutes while consolidation takes days. The first steps after memory formation are the processes of protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai1">[4]</xref> and tagging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Frey1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Barrett1">[24]</xref> distinguishing short- from long-term plasticity. They occur on a time scale of minutes to hours after learning. However, synaptic consolidation consists of several steps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai2">[10]</xref> and experimental evidences point out that NMDA- and AMPA-receptor reactivations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Shimizu1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Pastalkova1">[27]</xref> and sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Diekelmann1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Maquet1">[28]</xref> are needed even days later to (synaptically) consolidate a new learnt memory. Thus, there is a time-gap between neuronal physiology (synaptic plasticity; minutes) and consolidation (days). A physiologically plausible, fully dynamic memory model that bridges such time-spans (from learning to consolidation) such that LTS-candidate synapses properly respond to synaptic consolidation, while STS-candidates do not, is still missing.</p>
<p>Here we work towards bridging this gap by considering one additional, well-established physiological component which naturally operates at a longer time scale: synaptic scaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Turrigiano1">[29]</xref>. Synaptic scaling has primarily been associated with the homeostatic regulation of activity in a network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Turrigiano2">[30]</xref>. Overly active networks will – on a time scale of hours up to days – down-scale their activity and vice versa, which is a result of synaptic scaling, where synaptic weights are regulated by the deviation from a homeostatic level of activity.</p>
<p>In the following, we show that neural circuits, which combine synaptic scaling with conventional plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tetzlaff2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tetzlaff3">[32]</xref> such as long-term potentiation (LTP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Bliss1">[33]</xref>), long-term depression (LTD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Lynch1">[34]</xref>), or spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Levy1">[35]</xref>), naturally exhibit a transition from short- to long-term storage, where LTS-candidate synapses are consolidated and maintain their integrity through unspecific, “sleep-like” activation, while STS-candidates fade. This bi-modal characteristic is due to an intrinsically arising nonlinearity that induces – without any addition assumption – a natural bifurcation in the dynamics of the system. Intriguingly, this bifurcation can also explain experimental results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Walker1">[36]</xref> on the apparently paradoxical effect of memory destabilization during reconsolidation protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Nader1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tronson1">[37]</xref>, where the recall of a previously learnt aspect actually disrupts its memory. Our model does not attempt to implement any of the complex and still little understood mechanisms for systems consolidation or other long-term processes, which would lead to true long-term memories. Instead, the goal of this study is to present a generic mechanism for dynamically maintaining synaptic integrity of LTS-candidates in the network by synaptic (re)consolidation. Thus, this study suggests a solution to the long standing problem of synaptic stability in a fully dynamic network by proposing a bifurcation scenario resulting from combined plasticity and scaling.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Substantial evidence exists that strong synapses can maintain their integrity better than weak ones, which are, for example, more easily pruned during developmental processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Matsuzaki1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Holtmaat1">[39]</xref>. Here we show that this might not just be due to the quantitative difference in synaptic strength. Instead such synapses may follow qualitatively different dynamics in networks with long-term plasticity and synaptic scaling.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Two different time scales of memory</title>
<p>Consider, for instance, a model neural circuit (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) of locally connected rate-coded units. Each unit <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is described by a leaky membrane potential <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and a firing rate or activity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which depends in a non-linear way (here sigmoidal) on the unit's actual membrane potential (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). This formulation allows for a general interpretation of each unit as either a rate-coded neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dayan1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Gerstner1">[41]</xref> or a population of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Amari1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Deco1">[44]</xref>. Thus, the here presented results are independent of the spatial scale of the neural circuit. In the following, we will use the terms ‘unit’ and ‘neuron’ synonymously.</p>
<p>In the basic state every neuron receives a small noisy background input of about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For a certain period of time (here about two hours), only a local patch of neurons receives an external input of stronger intensity (see green striped area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 A</xref> and green pulse ‘L = Learning’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 B,C</xref>; all inputs are noisy) while others do not and serve as control. This input mimics localized rate-coded signals from the environment or other brain areas delivered to the circuit. In the circuit plastic excitatory synapses to the nearest neighbor neurons exist (see, for instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 A</xref> the purple area regarding the blue unit), as well as, short- and long-range lateral inhibition with unchanging synaptic strengths (purple and bluish gray area). For simplicity, we assume that each unit provides excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The dynamics of the excitatory synapses <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is governed by the combination of synaptic plasticity and scaling defined as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tetzlaff2">[31]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003307.e009"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e009" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the activity, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> a time constant of synaptic changes, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the ratio of plasticity and scaling time constants, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the desired homeostatic level of activity. As shown in previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tetzlaff2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tetzlaff3">[32]</xref>, the quadratic weight-dependency of the synaptic scaling term guarantees convergent synaptic weights without the need of additional constraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Rochester1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Gerstner2">[49]</xref>. The synaptic plasticity part consists only of a correlation-based LTP-term. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate (see below and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref>) that a synaptic plasticity rule consisting of a combination of LTP and LTD does not alter the general dynamics, we will discuss in the following.</p>

<title>Increasing the input frequency yields synapses that recover their weight by global, consolidation-like stimulation.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) The network consists of a square grid of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> units with periodic boundary conditions in both directions. Each unit connects excitatorily with its nearest neighbours (see purple area regarding blue neuron) and inhibitorily with the nearest and next-nearest neighbours (purple and bluish gray area). Each unit receives an external projection (only a subset is shown). Two different input types are delivered: (i) a local learning stimulus (‘L’, green area) and (ii) a global input to all neurons (‘C’, yellow). (<bold>B,C</bold>) Different input intensities induce different activities (middle row) and weights (bottom row) of the input-target neurons (red). Pulses for local learning L are 5–10 times longer than for global consolidation C stimuli (see panels D–F for accurate stimulation-response details). Before learning short activation of all neurons (‘contr’) has no significant effect on the weights. (<bold>B</bold>) Learning signal L with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Synaptic weights of the red neurons grow but not the control weights (gray). After learning all activities relax back to background (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and weights decay. Subsequent consolidation stimuli (C1,C2; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) change weights minimally. (<bold>C</bold>) Stronger learning signal L (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) induces stronger weight growth (red curve) than in B. Now consolidation pulses (C1,C2; as before) yield weight recovery. This happens for all stimuli that drive weights across the bifurcation level of weight decay versus recovery (dashed horizontal line). (<bold>D</bold>) Stimulation protocol during learning.

<p>Depending on the intensity of the external input, differently strong synaptic weights between the stimulated units are induced by the combined rule of plasticity and scaling (bottom panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 B,C</xref>). Thus, the units of the stimulated patch form a local cell assembly similar to those found in recent experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Bathellier1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Haider1">[52]</xref> and represent a memorized version of the local external input. Small differences in input intensity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> vs. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) induce large differences in weights (bottom panels, red curves). The gray curves represent the controls from neurons that do not receive the strong external input. As we show below, these strong weights differences (red curves) arise from a generic nonlinear property of the network, where weight-formation follows a saddle-node bifurcation. This nonlinearity exhibits an intriguing phenomenon: When <underline>all</underline> units in the circuit (within and outside the cell assembly) receive a strong (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) but brief input (here about 15 minutes; yellow needles, ‘C1,C2 = consolidation’, in panels B,C) only the strong synapses will recover (panels C), while the weak ones continue to decay (panels B). Here this brief and global input takes the role of the coherent, but unspecific neural activation during slow-wave-sleep, which is commonly considered as a potential basis of synaptic consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Stickgold1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Chauvette1">[7]</xref>. This observation is the first indication that the combination of plasticity and scaling in a simple dynamic model allows differentiating between synapses for short-term storage, which decay, from those for long-term storage, which can be recovered (or rather consolidated).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we note that the network has only increased activity during external stimulation. Such a stimulation yields an imbalance in neuronal circuit activity depending on the recurrent synaptic weights. Thus, the learnt cell assemblies are stronger activated than controls and the memory contents stored in the network are read-out (see below). As soon as the external input is not present any more and only background input remains, all activities relax back to background firing rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) although recurrent weights are still high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 B,C</xref>). This is an important difference to attractor memory models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Gerstner3">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Barbieri1">[55]</xref>, which will continue to be active after stimulus withdrawal for (theoretically) infinitely long time. This persistent activity is important for explaining the dynamics of working memory (seconds) but contradicts the idea of long-term memories which are not permanently active. Here, the memory content is transferred from the input to the synaptic weights <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Hebb1">[14]</xref>. The activities can relax back to background state.</p>
<p>We remark that the emergence of the here shown phenomena does not rely on saturation effects and fine tuned topology (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref>). A detailed quantification is provided below. First, we show the impact of a memory recall on the spatial structure of the LTS-synapses.</p>

<title>Learning and recall</title>
<p>During recall the spatial distribution of weights and activities reveals an interesting competitive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g002">Figure 2</xref>), that is important for the formation of <italic>different</italic> memory cell assemblies and also leads to the paradox of memory loss during recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Walker1">[36]</xref>, see below). Initially, during learning only the a local patch of units is stimulated and the synapses of their target neurons all grow (purple square in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g002">Figure 2 A</xref>; L-phase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 C</xref>), where we have used a strong and local stimulus to drive all synapses into the LTS-regime. Consolidation stimulates the complete network and all synapses within the assembly recover or exceed their initial strengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g002">Figure 2 B</xref>; C1,C2-phase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 C</xref>). The process of remembering (recalling) a memory is often understood as partial stimulation of an assembly and potentially of some other neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Anderson1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Vogels1">[58]</xref>. By ways of its learnt connections the assembly produces a filling-in and generates a spatially quite complete excitation pattern including most of its members (so-called pattern completion). According to the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Eichenbaum1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Hebb1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Anderson1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Liu1">[60]</xref> this represent the behaviorally relevant recall activity. Therefore, only a randomly selected subset of assembly-neurons receives a stimulation (we used here about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with some outliers). The resulting network activity clearly shows a filled-in spatial assembly structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g002">Figure 2 C</xref>; Please note that due to the partial stimulus all units of the assembly are stronger active than the control ones. Thus we can assume that the assembly is completed.), where, however, sometimes strongly active neurons are neighbors of weakly active ones. For such constellations the different activities induce a dissimilar weight dynamic. Consider a pair of mutually connected neurons (see hatching in panel C). The weakly active neuron (but still more active than controls) induces a small synaptic plasticity term and synaptic scaling is weak, too. By contrast, the synaptic scaling term for the strongly active neuron is large and, thus, dominates the dynamics. As a consequence, the corresponding weight shrinks substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g002">Figure 2 C</xref>, inset, yellow bars; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref> for equations).</p>

<p>We remark that such network structures with generic lateral inhibition admit separation of different assemblies from each other if learning stimuli do not overlap too much. On the other hand - as soon as overlap exists - activation imbalances, as described above, may lead to interference and competition between different memories.

<title>Analyzing STS- and LTS-domains</title>
<p>The difference between STS- and LTS-synapses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1</xref> is a non-linear phenomenon, which is due to a saddle-node bifurcation and as such robust against changes in the stimulation patterns, representing different learning protocols. We tested a range of different input strengths and pulse protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 D</xref>). Generally, for small external inputs the resulting synaptic weights depend roughly linear on the intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 E</xref>) with a sudden jump to high values above a certain input intensity. The critical value, where this transition takes place, is insensitive to details in the pulse protocol (indicated by the strong weight differences shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 F1,F2</xref>).</p>
<p>The mechanism inducing this phenomenon is readily understood by investigating the dynamics of this system in more detail. We first analytically calculated the characteristic Weight-Input curve of this system.</p>
<p>In the following we will show in an abbreviated form the analytical calculations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref> for more details). We assume that the long-range inhibition separates the circuit into two (or more) subnetworks: (i) the externally stimulated local patch(es) and (ii) the unaffected control units. This enables us to average <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003307.e009">Equation 1</xref> over all units within such a subnetwork. To calculate the fixed point of the resulting mean field differential equation we set it equal to zero and solve it. As result we receive the weight-nullcline of the system (The weight-nullcline is a set of states where weights do not change under the given dynamics.):<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003307.e031"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e031" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as averaged value of variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003307.e031">Equation 2</xref> describes the resulting strength of the synaptic weights within a subnetwork given the dynamic of plasticity and scaling and a mean neuronal activation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<title>Combination of plasticity with synaptic scaling generates two distinct weight domains representing short-term and long-term storage.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Both domains (STS and LTS) arise from a bifurcation (see main text and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref>) between two stable fixed point domains (continuous lines). Depending on the input, weights either continuously grow (control and STS-domain) or suddenly jump to a high value (LTS-domain). Between both domains there is a transition range (dashed line). Blue dots show results from numerical simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which match the analytical curve. (<bold>B</bold>) Fixed points are defined by the intersection between activity- (green) and weight- (blue) nullclines.

<p>The average activity within a subnetwork induces certain synaptic strengths (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003307.e031">Equation 2</xref>). In turn, the mean external input <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (multiplied by the input weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the average recurrent synaptic weights themselves adapt the average activity. The resulting fixed point of this dynamic is calculated by the mean field differential equation of the membrane potential <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003307.e093">Eq. 4</xref>). This yields the activity-nullcline (In analogy to the weight-nullcline, the activity-nullcline is a set of states where activities do not change.):<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003307.e044"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e044" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>with membrane resistance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and average excitatory (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and inhibitory (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) number of connections per unit within the subnetwork. As <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the only topology-related parameters in this equation (and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003307.e031">Eq. 2</xref>), the described dynamics are independent of the detailed topology (see Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref>). The activity-nullcline follows roughly the sigmoidal shape of the activation function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003307.e104">Eq. 5</xref>). Furthermore, it shows that external inputs of different intensity delivered to the circuit change the neuronal activation (see green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g003">Figure 3 B</xref> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> compared to the red line in panel C for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and, therefore, (via <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003307.e031">Eq. 2</xref>) the synaptic weights. The direct influence of the external input on the synaptic weights within a subnetwork can be assessed by calculating the intersections between both nullclines. These intersections are the fixed points of the whole subnetwork (activity as well as weights). The resulting fixed point equation has no closed-form solution and, therefore, has to be solved numerically. Direct simulations of the whole circuit (Euler-method) match our theoretical predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g003">Figure 3 A</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, we find a saddle node bifurcation where different fixed points are reached for low as compared to high input intensities. For the particular setting displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g003">Figure 3</xref>, a continuous regime of fixed points for the weights exists for firing rates below approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (Short-Term Storage, STS; green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g003">Figure 3 A</xref>), while above this frequency, the system jumps to a fixed point regime with substantially larger weights (Long-Term Storage, LTS; red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g003">Figure 3 A</xref>). The gray area below STS represents the range of weights found for the randomly stimulated control neurons (targets of the yellow neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 A</xref>). Note, to obtain this curve we assumed that the circuit consists of several roughly independent subnetworks. This means that in one circuit different fixed points are reached at different spatial locations. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 C</xref> after local stimulation the (local) patch is in the LTS-regime (about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g003">Figure 3 A</xref>) while the control units are weakly stimulated and, therefore, they are in the gray control regime (about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) with small synaptic weights. The bifurcation is essential for the dynamics discussed here. Using different parameter values for the system does not change the fixed point curve significantly (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g004">Figure 4 B</xref> and Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref> compared to the used setting shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g004">Figure 4 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 B,C</xref>). However, if one parameter is changed dramatically an adequate adaption of the other parameters can still guarantee the desired circuit dynamics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g004">Figure 4 C,D</xref>). Thereby, the range of parameters remains in a physiological regime.</p>

As weights gradually start to grow from low values, the system gets trapped in the lower stable fixed point in the STS-domain. For high input frequencies only one stable fixed point exists which is in the LTS-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g003">Figure 3 C</xref>). As soon as the strong external input ends, only the lower fixed point exists and the weights start to decay and, without further inputs, reach control values after maximally ten days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g003">Figure 3 D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref>).

<title>Consolidation of memory</title>
<p>Bifurcation analysis also helps to understand why synapses with values in the upper fixed point regime (LTS-synapses) respond to global and unspecific consolidation inputs while others do not. Weight changes strongly differ for differently strong initial weights when presenting a single consolidation stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g005">Figure 5 A</xref> and Figure S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref>). Weights above the bifurcation threshold (dashed line) are increased substantially, while those under the threshold are almost unaffected (close beneath threshold they rather decrease due to the lateral inhibition, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 A</xref>, top). This phenomenon is robust against the duration of the consolidation stimulus (Figure S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref>). As a consequence, while all weights decay after learning, consolidation will recover those above bifurcation threshold. Hence, consolidation must not come too late, or also those weights might have dropped beneath threshold from which they cannot be recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g005">Figure 5 B</xref>). Note, this phenomenon is not “history dependent”, which means it does not matter whether learning or consolidation had driven the weights into the LTS-regime before decay has set in (Figure S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<p>We remark that our model solely captures dynamic network effects and that we do not attempt to model systems consolidation, which relies on complex and little-understood physiological processes. It appears, however, important that the here observed dynamic properties of such a network allow synapses to maintain (and regain) their stability such that systems consolidation or other processes may find a stable substrate to operate on. The wide parameter range within which this happens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g005">Figure 5 C</xref>) supports this argument, because recovery is robust and stable. Only if the consolidation input is too short or too late, forgetting sets in.</p>
<p>As consolidation is a sleep-induced effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Stickgold1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Diekelmann1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai2">[10]</xref>, little is known about the actual activity characteristics of the consolidation process. Input intensities required for consolidation are similar to those for initiation (similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 E</xref>), but emphasis lies on the fact that for consolidation the whole network is stimulated in an unspecific way and that the consolidation stimuli can be shorter (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1 B,C</xref> about 15 minutes of total duration). Additionally, similar to during sleep induced activations (e.g., spindles or ripples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Diekelmann1">[6]</xref>), the memory-related cell assembly is reconstructed (“replayed”; see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-ONeill1">[62]</xref> for review) during the consolidation input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g002">Figure 2 B</xref>).</p>

<title>Stimulus-dependent destabilization of memory</title>
<p>The recall of a previously well-learnt memory item may lead to the paradoxical phenomenon that this memory will be less well remembered than a newly learnt one. In the literature, this phenomenon is widely interpreted as memory destabilization or rather disruption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Nader1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-McKenzie1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tronson1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai3">[63]</xref> and has been found in some studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Nader1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Misanin1">[64]</xref>, but not in others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dawson1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Cammarota1">[66]</xref>. Thus, the question arises what the dynamical processes are that underlie it and especially also why memory destabilization/disruption depends on details of experimental protocols. In one specific experimental paradigm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Walker1">[36]</xref> destabilizing happens due to the interference of a new memory item with the previously learnt first memory, but only if the first memory was recalled before the second was learnt. In this protocol the first memory is impaired, while the new one is now susceptible to consolidation. In the following, we show that combined plasticity and scaling also naturally accounts for this paradox. We compare the experimental paradigm with the collective dynamics of our model system and highlight reasons for the ambivalence about the emergence of this phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Nader1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Misanin1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Cammarota1">[66]</xref>.</p>
<p>In a series of elegant experiments, Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Walker1">[36]</xref> have shown that destabilization of memory happens during a motor learning task. In a control experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6</xref>, Protocol 1) human subjects were first trained only on one motor sequence (learning, L1, blue, day one) and then tested once on day two (recall, R2) and day three (recall, R3). Significant improvement in accuracy was observed at day two, but not at day three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6 A</xref>). In the second control experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6</xref>, Protocol 2) subjects had been trained on the first sequence on day one (L1, blue) and on a different, second sequence on day two (L2, red), hence 24 h later. Testing was done on day three (R3, blue and red) and performance had improved for both sequences equally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6 B</xref>, blue and red bars). Both observations (panels A and B) were explained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Walker1">[36]</xref> by the overnight consolidation (C1, C2) of the memory. In the third experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6</xref>, Protocol 3) subjects learnt the first sequence on day one and were – as above – tested on day two (R2, blue) showing the same clear improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6 C</xref>, left blue bar). Immediately after testing they had to learn sequence two (L2, red). When re-tested on the third day (R3, blue and red) performance had significantly improved for sequence two but dramatically dropped for sequence one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6 C</xref>, right blue and red bars). This indicates that the second memory interferes with the first but only when the first is activated before the second was learnt.</p>

<p>In our model setting, we performed an identical set of experiments, i.e., with the same learning and testing sequences as used for the human subjects. The model was set up with two cell assemblies, partially overlapping at a corner. Assembly one (blue) was trained on one input sequence and assembly two (red) on another sequence. For recall – as explained above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g002">Figure 2</xref>) – we stimulate only a randomly selected subset of 30% of the original neurons. Connectivity and all other parameters were the same as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Training of either sequence leads to increased synaptic weights which are in the LTS-domain, hence, large enough to allow for consolidation. Consolidation stimuli, C1 and C2, were applied “at night”, where we briefly (three times 15 min) stimulated the whole network (similar to the procedures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1</xref>), as indicated by the dashed arrows in panels G–I. In these panels one can also see the development of the synaptic weights for the first (blue) and the second (red) cell assembly for all three experiments. Performance indices of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6 D–F</xref>) are similar to those for the human experiments and we find that data points for the two control experiments match (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6 A,D and B,E</xref>). Moreover, also the non-trivial effect on memory disruption is robustly reproduced by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6 C,F</xref>). The weight growth normally happening at consolidation C2 is only visible in the control protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6 G,H</xref>). By contrast, the readout that happens for protocol 3 at R2 effectively prevents the first memory from consolidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g006">Figure 6 I</xref>).</p>
<p>This phenomenon based on the intrinsic competitive effect arising from activation imbalances already discussed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g002">Figure 2</xref> (see inset in panel C) above. This can be seen in panel G here (see box with magnification), as the recalls R2 and R3 yield a reduction of the average weight curve, without inducing transitions from the LTS- to STS-regime. Learning the second memory acts for the first assembly “like a recall”, due to the partial overlap between assemblies. This is visible in panel H (box). Thus, learning a second memory can reduce the average weights of the first one. In panel H all weights are far above threshold and both assemblies can be consolidated. This is different for the last experiment (panel I). Recall R2 together with learning the other sequence L2 pushes the blue curve down more strongly (see box) than in panels G and H such that it has dropped under the bifurcation threshold when consolidation C2 happens. Close beneath threshold we remember that consolidation acts disruptive (see negative parts of the curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g005">Figure 5 A</xref>), which leads to a further weight decrease at time point C2. Panels J–L show the time courses of the fraction of synapses of each cell assembly that are in the LTS-domain, which corresponds to the above discussed effects. We remark that we have set all parameters in this simulation purposefully so that we can in panel I exactly depict the critical bifurcation point, where at C2 the red weights are just above threshold while the blue ones are just below and the first memory is disrupted. This is meant to emphasize that the transition from the LTS- to the STS-regime, which is a qualitative change, is sensitive to the experimental parameters. This might underly the fact that destabilization, which leads to an actual memory disruption, is not always found in real experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dawson1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Cammarota1">[66]</xref>. While recall and learning of other memories can robustly destabilize a memory, it is the relation of the weight-values relative to the bifurcation threshold, which can give rise to memory disruption (or not). A detailed parameter analysis of the destabilization phenomenon, confirming its robustness, is provided in the supplemental information (Figure S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref>). This analysis shows that only, if weights are too big or stimulation for recall is too broad and not competitive enough, transitions from the LTS- to the STS-domain do not happen as the system will not travel through the bifurcation. We remark that several recalls briefly after each other affect the same subset of synapses and, therefore, a destabilized memory can not be destabilized further by applying more recalls.</p>
<p>More specifically, we observe that the overlap between the cell assemblies, related to the fraction of reactivated neurons during recall, is the most critical factor which determines whether one assembly can be destabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Zero overlap - trivially so - leads to no disturbance (not shown), small overlap represents the situation which is most strongly susceptible to the disruption of a long term memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g007">Figure 7</xref>, left rows), where more synapses move from the LTS- to the STS-domain than vice versa. By contrast, for a large overlap both assemblies drive each other up into the LTS-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g007">Figure 7</xref>, right rows). Intuitively this makes sense. Large overlap means that both memories are very similar, hence they might as well begin to couple themselves in an associative (hebbian) way. For small overlap the (dis-)similarity of the memories might rather be “confusing” and an agent (animal/human) might benefit from forgetting one of them not being able to decide whether they are the same or different. It would be interesting to investigate this from a psychophysical point of view. We expect that memory similarity is the crucial factor which determines the capabilities of the system for memory maintenance versus destabilization.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous theoretical studies have shown that synaptic scaling could play a key role in neural network dynamics. For instance, synaptic scaling assures competition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Miller1">[67]</xref> between synapses at the same dendrite and, therefore, can help to distinguish different inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Liu2">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Keck1">[69]</xref>. Furthermore, scaling can outbalance neuronal heterogeneities in a way that the performance at working memory tasks is improved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Renart1">[70]</xref>. In this study we have shown that synaptic scaling appears a viable candidate mechanism to bridge the large temporal gap between synaptic plasticity (minutes) and synaptic consolidation (days), where we have investigated simulated 24 h sleep-waking cycles. Scaling operates on time scales of hours to days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Turrigiano1">[29]</xref> and synaptic plasticity on seconds to minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Bliss1">[33]</xref>. Processes on other time scales, for example short-term plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Markram1">[61]</xref>, long-term depression (LTD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Lynch1">[34]</xref>), or synaptic tagging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Frey1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Clopath1">[23]</xref>, can influence synapses without great impact on the dynamics of our model, because these mechanisms are “temporally close” to the synaptic plasticity part of the learning rule used here (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003307.e031">Eq. 2</xref>). Our analytical and numerical results indicate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tetzlaff2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tetzlaff3">[32]</xref>) that a different formulation of the synaptic plasticity part will not interfere with the final dynamics as long as the weight-nullcline obeys <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which holds for many generic plasticity rules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tetzlaff2">[31]</xref>. This constraint also holds for the more complex dynamics of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Levy1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Bi1">[71]</xref>) as strong neuronal activations lead to long-term potentiation (LTP) independent of the exact timing of spiking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Sjstrm1">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Graupner1">[74]</xref>. In an intermediate activity regime we would expect that STDP together with scaling could yield the emergence of even more complex cell assembly structures which could store spatial-temporal patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Hahnloser1">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dockendorf1">[79]</xref>. Over longer time scales (on average) the dynamic of STDP can be simplified by the BCM-rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Bienenstock1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Izhikevich2">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Pfister1">[81]</xref>. This rule consists of an LTP- and an LTD-term and, therefore, the phenomena revealed in this study are maintained (compare also Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref>). As an important consequence, the bifurcation is preserved under these conditions. Thus, our model with such additional faster synaptic modification mechanisms would exhibit only changed time-courses of the transient synaptic dynamics, for example the learning- or decay times, or more complex structures of cell assemblies, but this would not modify the bifurcation scenario qualitatively and, therefore, the consolidation paradigm presented here. However, not only different plasticity mechanisms can be used, but also the homeostatic term (here, synaptic scaling) could be another (slow) mechanism adapting synaptic weighs. Note, not every homeostatic term (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-vonderMalsburg1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Oja1">[48]</xref>) fulfils the above stated weight-constraint.</p>
<p>We considered a class of models of general form (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Together with the analytical results this indicates that the phenomenon of synaptic consolidation and differentiation between two storage durations within one network is nearly independent of the underlying network topology (see Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003307.s001">Text S1</xref>), plasticity rule considered (see above), details of neuronal and network properties, and type of stimuli. The main requirements, which have to be fulfilled, are: (i) a learning rule which guarantees stable synaptic weights depending on the neuronal activity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003307.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) as assured by the combination of LTP and scaling, (ii) leaky, non-linear units (single neurons or ensembles of neurons), (iii) an excitatory recurrent network with, on average, long-range inhibition, and (iv) ‘local’ external stimuli with increased firing rate. Therefore, the bifurcation and consolidation mechanisms described here are not restricted to a certain brain area. Instead, they can occur in every brain area fulfilling the above requirements. Commonly on assumes for memory the neocortex and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Amari1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Haider1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-vanStrien1">[82]</xref>. Furthermore, the area has to have global activations during sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Diekelmann1">[6]</xref> which could then serve as the consolidation stimulus. Furthermore, the learning stimulus in this model depends on the input frequency. This means that the cell assembly or memory in this model can correspond to a wide variety of long-term memories represented by Hebbian cell assemblies in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Hebb1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Martin1">[15]</xref>. This includes declarative as well as non-declarative memory types.</p>
<p>Often (computational) memory models are currently based on attractor neural networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Gerstner3">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Wittenberg1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Hopfield1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Willshaw1">[83]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Amit1">[85]</xref>. In these networks, after the withdrawal of the external input, the activity of a reactivated memory persists for a longer duration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Barbieri1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Lansner1">[86]</xref>. This feature allows for the use of attractor models to reproduce the (relatively) short neuronal dynamics during working memory tasks (up to ten seconds). However, without additional external stimuli these networks are even longer persistently active than the working memory time scale. This means that a reactivated memory in an attractor network will stay active for several minutes or days. Therefore, other mechanisms, as, for instance, inhibitory plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Vogels1">[58]</xref>, are considered to deactivate the recalled memory. All this seems physiologically problematic. By contrast, in our model activity drops back to the background state after a short period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g001">Figure 1</xref>) as the memory is not an attractor of the activity dynamics. This is another important property of our system, which combines dynamic behavior with the possibility for synaptic recovery by consolidation. To enable working memory dynamics within this circuit, our model could be extended by the mechanisms of short-term plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Markram1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Mongillo1">[87]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Szatmry1">[88]</xref>. However, the drop in activity results in a decay of weights which, due to further mechanisms, could be probabilistic as already proposed by Fusi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Fusi1">[89]</xref>.</p>
<p>The decay of synaptic weights can be avoided by repeatedly delivering brief and global consolidation signals to the network. Here, we assume that such signals can arise during sleep, especially by spindles and ripples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Diekelmann1">[6]</xref>. Experimental findings show that, for instance, the disruption of ripples impairs memory consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Girardeau1">[90]</xref> and, furthermore, that synaptic weights are, as in the model, increased after slow-wave sleep or rather spindles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Chauvette1">[7]</xref>. Although we did not include the rich dynamics induced by sleep, our model suggests a potential basis for synaptic consolidation happening during sleep. Furthermore, other experimental studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Shimizu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Cui1">[26]</xref> show that, even six months after learning, memory needs repetitive inductions of plasticity (reconsolidation). The biological mechanisms of this phenomenon are slightly different to initial synaptic consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Lee1">[91]</xref>. However, as in this model, the functional properties of these two events are assumed to be similar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-McKenzie1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai3">[63]</xref>.</p>
<p>The dynamics presented here also yield the fact that the model – similar to the real system – remains susceptible to perturbations and we explicitly reproduced the elusive effect of memory disruption by recall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Walker1">[36]</xref>. Similar, drug-induced effects had also been reported in a few studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Nader1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Tronson1">[37]</xref> but others failed to obtain it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dawson1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Cammarota1">[66]</xref>. Furthermore, learning something new shortly before or after recall seems to increase the chance of perturbing the old memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Alberini1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-McKenzie1">[13]</xref>. This ambivalence is hard to account for with other existing memory models but finds a possible explanation in the bifurcation scenario found here. The bifurcation scenario also predicts that relearning of the disturbed memory should be much faster than before as weights are still larger than without learning. Furthermore, memory similarity (here “assembly overlap”) has a non-trivial effect on consolidation versus destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003307-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This is a novel and intriguing prediction which may well be tested in psychophysical experiments.</p>
<p>In general, it seems that memory has to be repeatedly consolidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Shimizu1">[25]</xref>, which could happen during sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Stickgold1">[5]</xref>, until it is increasingly stabilized. To achieve the latter, systems consolidation, which also begins during sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Diekelmann1">[6]</xref>, performs a transition from a dynamic to a more static memory representation. By this, the stored information is transferred to the neocortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Dudai1">[4]</xref>. The process suggested here is capable of repeatedly recovering LTS-candidate synapses, while STS-candidates fade. This may, thus, essentially contribute to providing a stable substrate for systems consolidation and other processes.</p>

<title>Learning and recall protocol for reconsolidation experiment</title>
<p>In Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003307-Walker1">[36]</xref> training and recall of memory items differ in the number of blocks each consisting of 30 seconds task followed by 30 seconds rest.
