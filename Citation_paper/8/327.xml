<title>Background</title>
<p>Chronic pain is common, often widespread and has a substantial impact on health and quality of life. The relationship between chronic pain and mortality is unclear. This systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate evidence for a relationship between chronic pain and mortality.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A search of ten electronic databases including EMBASE and MEDLINE was conducted in March 2012, and updated until March 2014. Observational studies investigating the association between chronic or widespread pain (including fibromyalgia) and mortality were included. Risk of bias was assessed and a meta-analysis was undertaken to quantify heterogeneity and pool results. A narrative review was undertaken to explore similarities and differences between the included studies.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Ten studies were included in the review. Three reported significant associations between chronic or widespread pain and mortality in unadjusted results. In adjusted analyses, four studies reported a significant association. The remaining studies reported no statistically significant association. A meta-analysis showed statistically significant heterogeneity of results from studies using comparable outcome measures (n = 7)(I<sup>2</sup> = 78.8%) and a modest but non-significant pooled estimate (MRR1.14,95%CI 0.95–1.37) for the relationship between chronic pain and all-cause mortality. This association was stronger when analysis was restricted to studies of widespread pain (n = 5,I<sup>2</sup> = 82.3%) MRR1.22(95%CI 0.93–1.60). The same pattern was observed with deaths from cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Heterogeneity is likely to be due to differences in study populations, follow-up time, pain phenotype, methods of analysis and use of confounding factors.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This review showed a mildly increased risk of death in people with chronic pain, particularly from cancer. However, the small number of studies and methodological differences prevented clear conclusions from being drawn. Consistently applied definitions of chronic pain and further investigation of the role of health, lifestyle, social and psychological factors in future studies will improve understanding of the relationship between chronic pain and mortality.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Musculoskeletal pain is one of the most common complaints in adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Woolf1">[1]</xref>. It has a major impact on physical and mental health, daily activities and is a frequent reason for health care consultation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-McBeth1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Bergman1">[4]</xref>. Musculoskeletal pain may be associated with increased mortality although the relationship is unclear. Studies of single site pain (e.g. back pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Penttinen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Helivaara1">[6]</xref>), hip and shoulder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Kreholt1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Jordan1">[8]</xref>) and simple counts of the number of pain sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-McBeth2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Smith1">[10]</xref> have produced conflicting results. A lack of consistency in case definitions of pain makes it difficult to compare studies and may explain some of the variation in findings.</p>
<p>Chronic pain may be a more useful starting point to examine the relationship between pain and mortality. There is potential for greater uniformity in case definition with use of recognised criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Merskey1">[11]</xref>. Chronic pain, that is pain that lasts for three months or longer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Merskey1">[11]</xref>, is experienced by up to 30% of adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Breivik1">[12]</xref> and commonly occurs in multiple body sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Carnes1">[13]</xref>. Widespread pain, a sub-group of chronic pain and the cardinal symptom of fibromyalgia is linked with a greater impact than that of pain that is not widespread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Kamaleri1">[3]</xref>. This review focusses on chronic pain, but additionally examined the relationship between chronic widespread pain and mortality. Chronic widespread pain is a phenotype that captures people with more severe pain that has a greater impact on outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Croft1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Hunt1">[15]</xref>. We hypothesised that if chronic pain was associated with mortality that relationship would be strongest in those with chronic widespread pain.</p>
<p>To determine if chronic pain was associated with mortality, a systematic review was undertaken. The aims of the review were to identify and evaluate evidence to determine the strength of association between chronic pain and mortality, and in particular in the subgroup of studies investigating chronic widespread pain.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A protocol for the conduct of this systematic review and meta-analysis was developed with reference to Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Systematic1">[16]</xref> and consisted of four phases:</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Phase 1: Search strategy and identification of studies</title>
<p>A comprehensive search strategy was conducted by a single observer (DS). Broad search terms were used to maximise the identification of all observational studies that have examined the link between mortality and chronic and/or widespread pain. The search strategy used subject headings (e.g. MeSH where possible) and text words for death (e.g. mortality, death, survival), pain (e.g. musculoskeletal pain, fibromyalgia, joint pain) and study type (e.g. cohort studies, longitudinal studies and cross-sectional studies) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0099048.s001">Appendix S1</xref> for full search strategy). The following databases were searched in March 2012: Ageline, AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) using ISI Web of Science. The Cochrane databases (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Reviews) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (Other Reviews) (DARE) were searched for relevant reviews. Citation searches and reference list searches were undertaken to identify other possible relevant studies. A search of the Open Grey database for grey literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-OpenGrey1">[17]</xref> was undertaken in April 2012 to identify any relevant papers. Searches in AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PSYCHINFO were updated until March 2014.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Phase 2: Study Selection</title>
<p>Identified studies were initially filtered with a title search by a single observer (DS) based on the following inclusion criteria:</p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item>
<p>Study type - observational studies</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>Participants – community dwelling adults</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>Exposure – chronic (&gt;3months) or widespread pain including fibromyalgia</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>Outcome - mortality</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>Papers published in English</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>A review of abstracts and keywords was then undertaken by two reviewers (DS) (RW) before the retrieval of full text articles for further screening. Disagreements were discussed during a consensus meeting with a third reviewer (JM) for final selection of studies to be included in the review.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Phase 3: Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</title>
<p>From each included study, data on study population, follow-up period, pain phenotype, outcome, cause of death and potential confounding factors, were extracted by one reviewer (DS) and checked by two others (RW) (JM) for omissions and accuracy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099048-t001">Table 1</xref>). Two reviewers (DS, RW) then used the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool (QUIPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Hayden1">[18]</xref> to assess for selection, non-response and information bias and confounding in studies. A third reviewer (JJ) reviewed selected studies to ensure consistency and consensus on judgements. Agreement between the two reviewers was also assessed by actual agreement and by agreement beyond chance (unweighted Kappa) and these were interpreted as; ≤0 = poor agreement, 0.01–0.20 = slight agreement, 0.21–0.40 = fair agreement, 0.41–0.60 = moderate agreement, 0.61–0.80 = substantial agreement, and 0.81–1.00 = almost perfect agreement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Landis1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099048-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Phase 4: Data Synthesis and Analysis</title>
<p>A meta-analysis was conducted to quantify heterogeneity using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic and considered low if less than 25%, moderate if between 25% and 75% and high if over 75% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Higgins1">[20]</xref>. To allow for expected heterogeneity between studies a random effects model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-DerSimonian1">[21]</xref> was used which applies less weight to large studies than fixed effects models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Ryan1">[22]</xref>. Variation in the definition of chronic pain (pain phenotype) was expected to be a main source of heterogeneity and was therefore explored in a sensitivity analysis, only including studies using the stricter definition of widespread pain. A narrative review was undertaken to explore differences and similarities between included studies for age and gender, follow-up time, pain phenotype, population characteristics, methods of analysis and potential confounding factors included. Sources of heterogeneity are presented and linked to the study findings descriptively and in tabular form (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099048-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary of findings</title>
<p>The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that there is a modest relationship between chronic pain and increased mortality but this is not significant. The results also suggest this relationship may be explained by cancer mortality. Confidence in these findings is restricted due to the small number of included studies and heterogeneity between them.</p>
<p>Restricting the analysis to studies measuring widespread pain and mortality resulted in an increase in the size of the pooled estimates for all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality but these remained non-significant. Very few studies have examined the relationship between chronic pain and mortality. Only three studies reported crude results, all of which suggested there was an association between chronic or widespread pain and an increased rate of all-cause mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-McBeth2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Torrance1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Andersson2">[37]</xref>. However adjustment for confounders led to attenuation of the relationship. This suggests that adults with chronic or widespread pain have an increased mortality rate and this is explained by socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, however the low number of studies and high heterogeneity reduces the certainty of this. Significant associations between chronic or widespread pain and increased risk of death from cancer, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, suicide, accidents, influenza and pneumonia, septicaemia were reported in single studies.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>Differences between studies</title>
<p>The differences between the ten studies led to high levels of heterogeneity. The study populations differed on a number of characteristics which will have contributed to the variance in prevalence rates of widespread pain and mortality, and the relationship between them.</p>
<sec id="s4b1">
<title>Definition of chronic or widespread pain</title>
<p>Information regarding the location of pain was lacking in three of the included studies so the presence of widespread pain could not be confirmed although chronic pain often occurs in multiple sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Carnes1">[13]</xref>. Similarly, details regarding the chronicity of pain were not available in all studies measuring widespread pain but in 80–90% of persons reporting widespread pain, the pain has been present for more than three months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Macfarlane1">[38]</xref>. Although this means a small proportion of participants may have been misclassified it would also lead to an underestimation of the true effect. More rigorous definitions of widespread pain were more strongly associated with mortality. In additional analysis, Wolfe et al. (2011) reported that within those with fibromyalgia, those satisfying the more stringent ACR 2010 criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Wolfe3">[42]</xref> had an increased risk of mortality than those who did not meet the new criteria but met the 1990 criteria (HR1.62, 95%CI 1.19–2.21) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Wolfe1">[24]</xref>. The ACR 2010 criteria extend the scope of defining widespread pain beyond the location of pain by including an assessment of the severity of accompanying symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Wolfe4">[43]</xref>. Increasing severity and duration of pain, in addition to extent, increases the risk of mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Torrance1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Tang1">[44]</xref>. The revised ACR 2010 criteria, which can be measured using self-report tools in epidemiological and clinical studies, offers the potential to harmonise definitions of widespread pain in future studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Wolfe4">[43]</xref>.</p>

<title>Methods of analysis</title>
<p>There were differences in the referent group between studies which prevented clear comparisons. Eight studies used participants with no pain as the referent group and two used standardised populations, one in Denmark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Dreyer1">[23]</xref> and one in the US <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Wolfe1">[24]</xref> which include people both with and without pain. In an additional analysis, Wolfe and colleagues (2011) compared mortality rates between fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis patients and reported no significant difference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Wolfe1">[24]</xref>. Mortality risk is increased in those with osteoarthritis compared to the general population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Hochberg1">[45]</xref> therefore this finding is not comparable to the mortality rate ratios used in other studies. The comparison group (osteoarthritis patients) cannot be considered analogous to a no pain group.</p>
<p>Different methods of analysis were used to calculate the outcome measures (SMR, MRR and AOR) due to variations in referent groups. Sufficient data were not available to enable conversion to comparable outcome measures for all studies. The effects of these different analysis techniques is demonstrated by McBeth et al (2009), who reported a 30% increased risk of mortality for people with widespread pain compared to a no pain group but when compared to the mortality rate for North West England mortality risk was lower and not significant (SMR = 1.14 95%CI 0.99–1.30) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-McBeth2">[9]</xref>. The more similar the referent group, the less likely a relationship will be observed. Use of general population cohorts in which a clear no-pain group can be identified will allow a purer examination of the link of increased mortality for those with widespread pain as it would enable comparison between a group most at risk (those with widespread pain) with those least at risk (those with no pain).</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b3">
<title>Follow-up time</title>
<p>Variations in follow-up time between studies may influence mortality rates although this was not clear from this review. The mortality rate in those with pain has been shown to be higher in the earlier periods of follow-up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Jordan1">[8]</xref>. Jordan et al., (2013) have also demonstrated the strength of associations between pain in different musculoskeletal sites and cancer diminished with time indicating pain may be a marker of rather than a cause of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Jordan2">[46]</xref>. However, McBeth et al., (2009) reported no change in the relationship between widespread pain and both cancer and cardiovascular death after excluding participants who had died in the first year of follow up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-McBeth2">[9]</xref>. Standard periods of follow-up, allowing both short and long term assessment of risk would enable comparisons between studies and allow a more accurate picture of the relationship to be determined.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b4">
<title>Mechanisms</title>
<p>Differences in study setting may contribute to variations in factors associated with the presence of pain and mortality. Pain experienced by those in rural settings may be more likely to be related to physical labour than those in urban settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-McBeth2">[9]</xref>, although this may mean they are more physically active. Physical activity is known to reduce the risk of chronic diseases and premature death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Warburton1">[47]</xref>. Clinical and population cohorts will also have different characteristics of pain, health and socio-demographic factors. Depending on how healthcare is accessed, the clinical cohorts may have more severe symptoms and comorbidities compared to general population samples, which will impact on mechanisms to and rates of mortality. Wolfe and colleagues (2011) report that the fibromyalgia patients in their study may have higher socioeconomic status than the general population as the majority had medical insurance and received care from specialists rather than general physicians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Wolfe1">[24]</xref>. Higher socioeconomic status and access to care are associated with survival and may explain why no relationship between fibromyalgia and mortality was found in these studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Alter1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>The studies included in this review treated covariates as confounders and adjusted for them in their analyses. Information regarding the relative contribution of individual confounders to the models was not available. However, it may be that these factors are instead moderating or mediating the relationship between pain and mortality. Simply adjusting for such factors may lead to spurious associations between predictor and outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Greenland1">[49]</xref>. Adjustment for confounders in the ten studies, such as age, gender and socio-demographic status, indicated that they had a role in the relationship between widespread pain and mortality. Comparing similarly adjusted results will control for some of the variance in the associations between studies due to different population characteristics (e.g. differences in age and gender distributions). However differences in how these factors were measured and classified will have contributed to the heterogeneity. For example, one study used the Townsend score of deprivation as a measure of socioeconomic status; this is an area-level measure which is derived from variables representing unemployment, overcrowding within households, non-home ownership and lack of car ownership <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-McBeth2">[9]</xref>. In contrast the other studies included individual level measures of socio-economic status, such as educational attainment and owning medical insurance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Wolfe1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>There were substantial differences in the number of additional factors measured and adjusted for between studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099048-t003">Table 3</xref>). Notably the significant relationship reported in the crude analysis by Andersson and colleagues (2009) attenuated and was no longer significant when adjusted for living alone, contact with friends, club membership, comorbidity, smoking, physical activity, BMI, perception of stress and insomnia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Andersson2">[37]</xref> indicating possible pathways between pain and mortality. Pain is associated with depression, obesity, a reduction in physical activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Ray1">[50]</xref> and smoking motivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Ditre1">[51]</xref>. Wolfe et al., (2011) found BMI and smoking to be significant predictors of mortality in a sub-section of participants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Wolfe1">[24]</xref>. Many of the diseases where increased mortality was observed have links to lifestyle factors. For example, cancer and cardiovascular disease are associated with reduced physical activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Warburton1">[47]</xref> and cancer with smoking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Fagerstrm1">[52]</xref>. A follow up to the Macfarlane et al., (2001) study using the same cohort reported the association they observed was with both cancer incidence and survival; specifically with breast and prostate cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-McBeth3">[34]</xref>, both of which have been shown to be associated with physical inactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Monninkhof1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Liu1">[54]</xref>.</p>
<p>Consideration of potential mechanisms between pain and mortality with the appropriate designation of mediators and moderators rather than simple adjustment for confounders would further the understanding of whether a relationship between pain and mortality exists and why. Such analysis would enable potentially modifiable characteristics to be determined that could be targeted to reduce any identified risk of mortality. There are a number of potential confounders and mediators that were not considered in the identified studies in this review which are associated with both pain and mortality, such as anxiety and depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Bair1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Mykletun1">[56]</xref> social participation and social isolation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-House1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Moulin1">[58]</xref> and fatigue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Fishbain1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Hardy1">[60]</xref>.</p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>There were a number of strengths in this current study. A systematic approach was undertaken to maximise the chances of identifying all relevant studies of chronic pain and mortality. The quality of the identified studies was assessed using an established appraisal tool designed to focus on potential bias within studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Hayden1">[18]</xref>. Agreement between reviewers of the risk of bias was high (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099048-t002">Table 2</xref>). Study weaknesses include: this review only included papers that were published in English and it is possible some relevant findings may have been missed. However a recent search of CINAHL, Medline and EMBASE did not find any relevant non-English studies.</p>
<p>The small number of studies (k&lt;20) means that I<sup>2</sup> values should be interpreted with caution as there is little power to detect true heterogeneity and as such any pooled calculation of effect may be misleading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-HuedoMedina1">[61]</xref>. A more complex meta-analysis could have been undertaken to include the studies with multiple follow-ups and account for the correlation between them. However, even with a greater number of studies, there is general concern regarding the appropriateness of the use of meta-analyses in reviews of observational studies due to the likelihood for high heterogeneity as a result of difficulties in overcoming selection and confounding biases common to this type of study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Dickersin1">[62]</xref>. The estimates of pooled effects calculated in meta-analyses of observational studies are likely to be flawed and it is therefore more useful to have an assessment of the potential sources of heterogeneity as the focus of such systematic reviews (which has been included here) rather than a statistical combination of the data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Egger1">[63]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4d">
<title>Implications for research</title>
<p>This review indicated a modest association between chronic or widespread pain and increased mortality, particularly cancer mortality but further research is needed to confirm this. As stated in a commentary by Crombie (2001) even a small increased risk of cancer mortality is serious when it applies to a large proportion of the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-Crombie1">[64]</xref>. The findings of this systematic review indicate lifestyle factors may have an important role and these may be specific to particular conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099048-McBeth3">[34]</xref>. Future research should also investigate potential mechanisms for a relationship between widespread pain and mortality directly in large population studies where specific mediators and moderators can be assessed using appropriate statistical methods. Attention should also be given to previously unmeasured social, physiological and psychological factors. The identification of pathways between pain and mortality would facilitate the identification of individuals at risk.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4e">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Following this systematic review, a modest but non-significant relationship between chronic pain and mortality is suggested, particularly cancer mortality. Harmonised data collection, consistent pain phenotypes, sample populations and methods of analyses are required to robustly determine whether chronic pain increases the risk of mortality, and if so to identify the pathways by which this occurs. This combined with an investigation of the role of health, lifestyle, social and psychological factors could provide a clearer picture of the relationship between chronic pain and mortality.</p>
