<abstract>
<p>Infants recovering from anesthesia are at risk of life threatening Postoperative Apnea (POA). POA events are rare, and so the study of POA requires the analysis of long cardiorespiratory records. Manual scoring is the preferred method of analysis for these data, but it is limited by low intra- and inter-scorer repeatability. Furthermore, recommended scoring rules do not provide a comprehensive description of the respiratory patterns. This work describes a set of manual scoring tools that address these limitations. These tools include: (i) a set of definitions and scoring rules for 6 mutually exclusive, unique patterns that fully characterize infant respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) signals; (ii) RIPScore, a graphical, manual scoring software to apply these rules to infant data; (iii) a library of data segments representing each of the 6 patterns; (iv) a fully automated, interactive formal training protocol to standardize the analysis and establish intra- and inter-scorer repeatability; and (v) a quality control method to monitor scorer ongoing performance over time. To evaluate these tools, three scorers from varied backgrounds were recruited and trained to reach a performance level similar to that of an expert. These scorers used RIPScore to analyze data from infants at risk of POA in two separate, independent instances. Scorers performed with high accuracy and consistency, analyzed data efficiently, had very good intra- and inter-scorer repeatability, and exhibited only minor confusion between patterns. These results indicate that our tools represent an excellent method for the analysis of respiratory patterns in long data records. Although the tools were developed for the study of POA, their use extends to any study of respiratory patterns using RIP (e.g., sleep apnea, extubation readiness). Moreover, by establishing and monitoring scorer repeatability, our tools enable the analysis of large data sets by multiple scorers, which is essential for longitudinal and multicenter studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Anesthesia enhances the susceptibility to apnea in infants [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], leading to Postoperative Apnea (POA) events that may be life threatening, so infants require continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. POA events are rare with most occurring in the initial postoperative hours, but a delayed onset, as late as 12 hours after surgery, has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, any comprehensive study of POA requires the analysis of long data records.</p>
<p>Measuring infant respiration for extended periods of time requires a sensor that is well tolerated during both sleep and wakefulness. The initial studies of POA monitored respiration with thoracic impedance [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the sensor of respiration most commonly used clinically in Postanesthesia Care Units (PACU). However, this sensor has important limitations leading to missed apneas, as both obstructive apnea and cardiogenic oscillations may often be misinterpreted as breathing [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consequently, thoracic impedance is not recommended for research applications. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends the use of an airflow sensor (e.g., oronasal thermistor, or nasal pressure) to measure respiration and detect apnea [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, airflow measurements require that sensors be attached to the face. These sensors are poorly tolerated by infants during recovery from surgery as they interfere with both sleep and feeding.</p>
<p>The AASM guidelines also designate the respiratory inductive plethysmograph (RIP) as an alternative sensor for apnea detection [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. RIP uses two elastic bands that encircle the torso to measure ribcage (RCG) and abdominal (ABD) respiratory movements. These bands are well tolerated by infants and do not interfere with clinical care or the infant’s behavioral state. RIP is the standard sensor for respiratory effort [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in polysomnography and cardiorespiratory studies. It is also used to study respiration in other research applications including: prediction of extubation success in mechanically ventilated infants [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], study of sudden infant death syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and investigations of asthma [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We have developed a data acquisition system that incorporates RIP sensors to monitor respiration, and a digital pulse oximeter to measure blood oxygen saturation (SAT) and photoplethysmography (PPG) [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], for the study of respiratory behavior of infants at risk of POA.</p>
<p>The investigation of POA using these data requires a consistent, reliable analysis method that fully characterizes the respiratory behavior of infants. The AASM endorses manual scoring as the “gold standard” for the study of apnea, and has published a set of rules to standardize the manual detection of apneas using RIP signals [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However these rules have 4 important limitations. First, they assume that the RIP signals are calibrated; that is, the RCG and ABD signals are scaled so that their sum is proportional to tidal volume. This process is valid for a fixed spinal angle and constant posture [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but becomes inaccurate when the measurement conditions and/or breathing patterns change [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Consequently, the RIP calibration is likely to change throughout a long recording session invalidating the accuracy of the calibrated sum, making its use questionable. Second, the AASM rules only define clinically relevant apnea events, but do not define other respiratory patterns such as short respiratory pauses, thoraco-abdominal asynchrony, sighs, and normal breathing. Yet, these other patterns are relevant to the comprehensive study of respiratory behavior, since there is evidence that POAs are associated with abnormal respiratory patterns [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Indeed, we have found that an increased frequency of respiratory pauses, longer than 2 s, was associated with POA [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Third, the AASM rules must be applied by certified sleep laboratory technicians. As a result the analysis is costly and not widely available, since many sleep laboratories have long waiting times [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This severely constrains the amount of data that can be analyzed. Fourth, even when the AASM rules are applied by certified sleep laboratory technicians, the results have low intra- and inter-operator repeatability [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This adversely affects studies where multiple scorers are needed (e.g., large datasets, longitudinal, multicenter), because the repeatability of the analysis decreases with the number of scorers.</p>
<p>Advancement of the study of POA requires that these limitations be addressed. To do so we believe it is necessary to: (i) adapt the manual scoring rules to analyze uncalibrated RIP data; (ii) define a comprehensive set of RIP patterns; (iii) provide a computer-aided, scoring tool to improve accuracy and consistency, and reduce the time required for manual analysis; and (iv) develop a training and evaluation strategy to standardize the analysis and improve intra- and inter-operator repeatability. This paper describes a comprehensive set of tools developed to address these needs. These tools comprise 5 components: (i) a clear, comprehensive set of definitions and scoring rules for 6 mutually exclusive RIP patterns, (ii) a computer aided tool for efficient manual scoring, (iii) a library of data segments representing each of the 6 RIP patterns, (iv) a formal training protocol for scorers to standardize performance, and (v) a method to monitor the ongoing performance of scorers.</p>
<p>This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the 5 manual scoring tools introduced above. Section III describes the methods used to evaluate these tools. Section IV reports the results obtained by applying the tools to representative data from infants recovering from anesthesia. These results demonstrate that use of our tools produces efficient and accurate scoring with high intra- and inter-scorer repeatability regardless of operator expertise. Section V discusses the findings, and Section VI provides concluding remarks.</p>

<title>Pattern Definitions and Scoring Rules</title>
<p>Our objective was to define a comprehensive set of respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) patterns that would provide a complete description of the respiratory behavior on a continuous, sample-by-sample basis. To this end, we carried out an extensive literature review related to the scoring rules for infant RIP data. Key sources included: (i) the Infant Sleep Apnea section of the revised International Classification of Sleep Disorders: Diagnostic and Coding Manual from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; (ii) the updated AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events: Rules, Terminology and Technical Specifications [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; (iii) a series of articles on manual scoring published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; (iv) publications on POA in infants [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; and (v) publications on thoraco-abdominal synchrony in infants [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This led us to define 6, mutually exclusive, unique patterns that would comprehensively characterize RIP signals. These patterns are: synchronous-breathing (SYB), asynchronous-breathing (ASB), sigh (SIH), respiratory pause (PAU), movement artifact (MVT), and unknown (UNK). <xref rid="pone.0134182.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> describes each pattern in detail, and provides the scoring rules for the unambiguous assignment of each data sample to one of the 6 patterns.</p>

<title>Operating Modes</title>
<p>RIPScore has 4 operating modes: Visualization/Review, Scoring, Training, and Evaluation. These modes support different aspects of the scoring process.</p>
<p><underline>Visualization/Review Mode</underline> supports viewing the signals and reviewing the RIP patterns and annotations assigned throughout the record. In this mode, the “Previous” and “Next” buttons scroll the data in 20 s increments. Entering a value in “Epoch Start Time” moves the epoch display to that value. The <italic>RIP Pattern Scoring</italic> buttons move the data to the next segment assigned to that pattern.</p>
<p>Clicking a segment on the <italic>RIP Pattern</italic> bar selects the segment, highlights the segment in <italic>Signals</italic>, plots the corresponding <italic>Lissajous Figure</italic>, and updates the segment start and end time text boxes. The “Comment” command can be used to assign a comment to the segment, while the “Delete” command removes the RIP pattern assigned to it.</p>
<p><underline>Scoring Mode</underline> supports manual scoring. When activated, the cursor changes to crosshairs, the display moves to the first unscored segment, the segment start is set to the first unscored sample, and RIPScore prompts the user to select the end of the segment. The selected <italic>Signals</italic> segment is highlighted in red, and RCG and ABD are plotted in the <italic>Lissajous Figure</italic>. The scorer then assigns a RIP pattern to the segment using a <italic>RIP Pattern Scoring</italic> button or its hot-key; the segment’s assigned pattern, start and end time, and a timestamp are stored. The <italic>RIP Pattern</italic> bar is updated; and the display moves to the start of the next, unscored segment. This procedure continues until the scorer stops (by selecting the“(S)top Scoring” button) or all data have been scored. RIPScore then returns to Visualization/Review mode.</p>
<p><underline>Training Mode</underline> supports the training of scorers by having users analyze simulated data with known RIP patterns. The interface is similar to that in Scoring Mode with the addition of an <italic>Actual Pattern</italic> bar for scored segments. If the trainee assigns an incorrect pattern to a segment, RIPScore displays an error message and provides the trainee with the opportunity to review the scored segment and reassign the pattern. Conversely, if the trainee assigns the correct pattern, RIPScore updates the <italic>Actual Pattern</italic> bar and allows the trainee to continue. A Training Mode session ends once the trainee has either: (i) scored the complete record, or (ii) correctly scored 5 patterns of each type consecutively.</p>
<p>The simulated infant RIP records used in Training Mode are generated by concatenating, i.e., linking together, signal segments with known RIP patterns to yield continuous signals. <xref rid="pone.0134182.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> illustrates the concatenation method, which consisted of the following 4 steps:
<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>two input signal segments were selected to be concatenated;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the 2 signal segments were aligned with an overlap (transition window <italic>T</italic>) of <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> samples; that is, the last <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> samples of the first segment overlapped the first <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> samples of the second segment;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the samples of the first segment in the transition window were gradually attenuated by multiplying them by a decaying sigmoid factor that varied from 1 to 0 over the length of the window; samples of the second segment were gradually amplified by multiplication with a sigmoid factor that increased from 0 to 1 over the window length; the modified signals in the transition window were then added to yield a smooth transition; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the output signal consisted on the first segment up to the start of <italic>T</italic>, followed by the transition, and then by the second segment starting after <italic>T</italic>.</p></list-item>

</fig>
<p>The concatenation method overlapped the input segments to produce a smooth transition. This was done to avoid transition artifacts, which could generate sharp transients that do not resemble natural RIP patterns.</p>
<p>RIPScore uses two types of simulated data, and investigators are required to configure which type to use before scoring sessions start. Type I “simulated-pattern” data was based on signals generated using a breath-by-breath time-series model of infant breathing; other RIP patterns were simulated by manipulating these signals as described in [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Type II “true-pattern” data comprised segments of real data whose RIP pattern was determined during a reference analysis (REF) performed by one of the authors (KAB) as described below. Type II data were more complex and realistic than Type I because they incorporated the inherent variability of real infant breathing.</p>
<p>A new, 1 hr long, Training Mode data record is generated for each training session as follows:
<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>segments of each RIP pattern category are simulated and stored in a list, until the total length of data is &gt; 1.5 hr;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the list of simulated segments is re-ordered randomly;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the list is examined to ensure that contiguous segments have different RIP patterns, if two contiguous segments have the same pattern, the second segment is pushed to the end of the list;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the list is truncated to the first <italic>N</italic> segments whose total length is 1 hr; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the segments on the list are concatenated as described in <xref rid="pone.0134182.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p><underline>Evaluation Mode</underline> is used to evaluate a scorer’s accuracy and consistency. In this mode, the user analyzes a simulated data record with an interface similar to Training Mode, but with no feedback. Upon completion, RIPScore: (i) estimates the accuracy and consistency of the scorer; (ii) stores the accuracy and consistency values, the simulated data record, and the assigned RIP patterns; (iii) displays the accuracy and consistency to the scorer; and (iv) reveals the <italic>Actual Pattern</italic> bar in Review Mode so that the scorer can compare their assigned patterns to the actual, simulated patterns.</p>
<p>Data for Evaluation Mode are generated as follows:
<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>the first 30 min of data segments are simulated and stored in a list as for the Training data;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the list is duplicated;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the duplicate list is re-ordered randomly, and contiguous segments with equal RIP patterns pushed to the end;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the two lists are joined, and the segments concatenated.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Thus, in the evaluation data record each simulated segment appears in both the first and second half but in a different, random order.</p>
<p>Performance is assessed in terms of the accuracy and consistency of the assigned RIP patterns. Accuracy is measured as the agreement between patterns assigned by the trainee and the actual pattern. Consistency is measured as the agreement between the patterns assigned to the same segments in the first and second half of the evaluation record. Agreement is quantified using the Fleiss’ kappa (<italic>κ</italic>) statistic [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] computed on a sample-by-sample basis as in [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This kappa implementation generalizes the traditional Cohen’s <italic>κ</italic> statistic [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] to evaluate agreement between multiple scorers when classifying observations into two or more categories.</p>

<title>Library of Segments with Known Patterns</title>
<p>A library containing “true-pattern” data segments representative of each of the 6 RIP patterns was created for use in RIPScore Training and Evaluation Modes.</p>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Infant Data</title>
<p>The library was built using data acquired from 24 infants (19 male, birth age 31 ± 4 weeks, postmenstrual age 43 ± 2 weeks, weight 3.7 ± 1.0 kg) recruited for a prospective POA study. Inclusion criteria were: (i) postmenstrual age &lt; 60 weeks at the time of surgery in preterm infants, and &lt; 48 weeks in term infants, (ii) elective surgery for inguinal herniorrhaphy, and (iii) American Society of Anesthesiology physical status 1 or 2. Exclusion Criteria were: (i) post-operative admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit or Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, (ii) emergency surgery, and (iii) spinal anesthesia. The anesthetic technique was not standardized.</p>
<p>Data were acquired in the Postanesthesia Care Unit (PACU) of the Montreal Children’s Hospital using a custom-built monitoring system [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Upon admission to the PACU, infant respibands (Inductobands, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY, USA) were placed around the ribcage (at the nipple line) and abdomen (at the umbilicus) and interfaced with a Respiratory Inductive Plethysmograph (Battery Operated Inductotrace, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY, USA). An infant oximeter probe (Nonin 8600 Portable Digital Pulse Oximeter, Nonin Medical Inc., Plymouth, MN, USA) was taped to a digit. The outputs were low-pass filtered (cut-off frequency 10 Hz) with an 8-pole, anti-aliasing, Bessel filter (Kemo, Jacksonville, FL, USA), sampled at 50 Hz, and stored. Subsequent, off-line analysis was performed using MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). No attempt was made to calibrate the RIP signals. Recordings were 9.0 ± 2.2 hr long. Subsets of these data have been used in previous work [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
<p>Recording sessions were continuously attended, and a paper record of the infant’s behavioral state, i.e., sleeping, feeding, diaper change, etc., was kept, referenced to the clock time and recording time. These handwritten entries were transcribed to an electronic text file and displayed as acquisition <italic>Notes</italic> in RIPScore. Demographic data and relevant clinical variables, including anesthetic and analgesic drug regimen, were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Ethics Statement</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the McGill University Health Centre / Montreal Children’s Hospital (approval numbers PED-07-30, and 12-308-PED). Written, informed parental consent was obtained for each infant recruited to the study. Consent for publication of raw data was not requested specifically at the time the study was carried out. However, all materials have been thoroughly inspected, and all possible identifiers (as defined in [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]) were removed before the data were made available publicly. Thus, we believe that publication of these data poses negligible risk to the privacy of study participants.</p>

<sec id="sec010">
<title>Reference Manual Analysis</title>
<p>One of the authors (KAB) served as the reference scorer (REF). REF has extensive experience in the manual scoring of infant cardiorespiratory data, participated in the data acquisition, and contributed to the development of RIPScore.</p>
<p>REF used RIPScore to analyze the full records of 23 infants in two independent instances; the order in which the data records were analyzed was randomized between instances. One record was excluded because the infant was continuously handled by nurses and parents throughout the recording session. REF’s overall intra-scorer repeatability, measured with the Fleiss’ kappa statistic [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], was “substantial” (<italic>κ</italic> = 0.80) [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Samples where REF assigned the same RIP pattern in the two instances were considered to be correct and defined the “true-pattern” for these samples.</p>
<p>This reference scoring task was very labor intensive and required 8 months to complete. For this reason, data were partitioned into two subsets: (i) a validation subset used to evaluate the performance of scorers, and (ii) a library of “true-pattern” segments used to generate the Type II “true-pattern” simulated data. <xref rid="pone.0134182.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref> summarizes how the validation subset and the “true-pattern” segment library were created.</p>

<p>The validation subset comprised data from 21 infants, truncated to a maximum of 20,000 s per record, representing a 54% of the complete data set. Records from 2 infants that were analyzed by REF were excluded due to bad quality in the recordings. To ensure that the validation subset was representative, the proportion of “true-pattern” samples assigned to each RIP pattern was computed for both the complete and truncated data records. The Wilcoxon signed rank test [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] indicated that the proportions were not significantly different as <xref rid="pone.0134182.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows.</p>

<title>Training Protocol</title>
<p>All scorers underwent a common training protocol, using RIPScore Training and Evaluation Modes, to standardize the analysis and performance of scorers using our tools.</p>
<p><xref rid="pone.0134182.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref> shows a block diagram of the training protocol. Training had 2 levels, each having two stages: training and evaluation. Trainees started at Level 1, where they were familiarized with RIPScore, the 6 mutually exclusive RIP pattern definitions, and the scoring rules, by analyzing Type I “simulated-pattern” records (<xref rid="pone.0134182.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12A</xref>). Each level began with a training stage where trainees scored data in RIPScore Training Mode. Upon completing the training stage, their accuracy and consistency were evaluated using RIPScore Evaluation Mode. If their performance was adequate (see <xref rid="pone.0134182.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>) they advanced to Level 2 of training, if not, they repeated the Level 1 training stage.</p>

<title>Monitoring of Scorers for Quality Control</title>
<p>Scorer accuracy and consistency were evaluated on a record-by-record basis using a quality control method based on the pre-processing phase described next.</p>
<sec id="sec013">
<title>Pre-processing</title>
<p>The validation dataset was pre-processed by inserting Type II “true-pattern” segments into each data record (<xref rid="pone.0134182.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12C</xref>). Thus, for this pre-processing phase, a total of 152 segments (1,000 s worth of data) were selected from the “true-pattern” segment library, such that each RIP pattern was equally represented. The distribution of these 152 segments was: 25 SYB, 26 ASB, 27 SIH, 22 PAU, 27 MVT, and 25 UNK.</p>
<p>For each data record in the validation subset, the 152 segments were randomly ordered and inserted into the first 3 hrs of the record at randomly selected times. These “true-pattern” segments were then randomly re-ordered, and inserted into the last 3 hr of the record at random times. Segments were inserted by splitting the data record (see <xref rid="pone.0134182.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12C</xref>), and concatenating the segment as in <xref rid="pone.0134182.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. Thus each of the 21 pre-processed data records contained two copies of the 152 “true-pattern” segments.</p>
<p>These inserted “true-pattern” segments were then used to evaluate scorer accuracy and consistency using the same methods as in RIPScore’s Evaluation Mode.</p>

<title>Evaluation of the Manual Scoring Tools</title>
<p>The manual analysis tools were evaluated by examining the performance of three scorers in the analysis of the pre-processed validation data subset.</p>
<sec id="sec015">
<title>Scorer Recruitment and Training</title>
<p>The three scorers had quite different backgrounds and experience in the analysis of respiratory data. The first (SC1) was a pediatric anesthesiologist with expertise in infant respiratory physiology, who participated in data acquisition and is a co-author (GB). The second (SC2) was a senior respiratory pediatric sleep laboratory technician with extensive experience in manual scoring of pediatric cardiorespiratory data. The third (SC3) was a computer network analyst with a master’s degree in telecommunications but no clinical expertise. All three scorers were trained using the protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec016">
<title>Validation of the Manual Analysis Tools</title>
<p>The three scorers analyzed the entire, pre-processed, validation data subset in two independent, blinded instances; the order of the data records was randomized between instances and between scorers. Scorer performance was evaluated in terms of the following parameters.</p>
<sec id="sec017">
<title>Accuracy and Consistency</title>
<p>The two copies of the 152 “true-pattern” segments inserted in each data record were analyzed to evaluate the scorers’ ongoing accuracy and consistency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec018">
<title>Scoring Rate</title>
<p>The time required to score a data record was estimated by summing the difference between the timestamps of consecutive scores. Differences greater than 2 min were excluded because they likely resulted from interruptions in the analysis. The overall scoring rate was estimated as the ratio of the length of a data record (in data hours) to the hours required to score it. Pattern-specific scoring rates were estimated as the ratio of the total length of segments assigned to a RIP pattern to the time required to score those segments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec019">
<title>Intra and Inter-Scorer Repeatability</title>
<p>Intra- and inter-scorer repeatability of the RIP patterns assigned to the validation data were assessed using the Fleiss’ kappa (<italic>κ</italic>) statistic [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] on a sample-by-sample basis.</p>

<title>Confusion Analysis</title>
<p>Confusion in the scoring of the 6 RIP patterns Θ = {<italic>SYB</italic>, <italic>ASB</italic>, <italic>SIH</italic>, <italic>PAU</italic>, <italic>MVT</italic>, <italic>UNK</italic>} was assessed by computing the confusion matrix <bold>P</bold> whose elements <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> gave the conditional probability that a sample with consensus pattern <italic>i</italic> would be scored as pattern <italic>j</italic>. A sample <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> was assigned a consensus RIP pattern <italic>Cn</italic>(<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) ∈ Θ if it was assigned that pattern in the absolute majority (4 or more) of the 6 scoring iterations. Samples without consensus pattern were excluded from the confusion analysis. Thus, to estimate <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> for each scorer, the <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> samples with consensus pattern <italic>i</italic> were identified. Then, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>, the number of times the <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> samples had been assigned to pattern <italic>j</italic>, was determined. Finally, the conditional probability was estimated as <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> = <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> / <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. Confusion matrices were computed for each scorer separately, and also as a group.</p>
<p>To assess the effects of segment length, confusion matrices were also computed after excluding scored segments shorter than a threshold (varied from 0 s to 20 s).</p>

There was a consensus for 90% of the samples; with the most common pattern being SYB (65%), and the least frequent being SIH (1%). For completeness, we computed the pattern proportions for the remaining 10% of samples with no consensus even though these data were not used in the confusion analysis. We found that the majority (60%) of the non-consensus samples were scored as either UNK or MVT, and the rest were: SYB 22%, ASB 8%, SIH 3%, and PAU 7%.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This paper describes a novel set of tools for the manual analysis of infant respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) data. The tool set includes 5 components:
<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>A set of clear, concise definitions of RIP patterns, and scoring rules based on uncalibrated RIP data. These definitions and rules make it possible to fully characterize an infant’s respiratory behavior across extended periods of time, thus enabling the analysis of long data records required for the study of Postoperative Apnea (POA).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An interactive, computer application (RIPScore) that supports the application of the scoring rules to infant data in an efficient manner. RIPScore incorporates the capability to track the rate at which scorers analyze data; providing the objective measurement of the time required to analyze a dataset.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A library of “true-pattern” segments representing each of the 6 RIP patterns, used for training, assessment of scorer performance, and development of evaluation methods.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A formal training protocol based on the interactive, completely automated RIPScore Training and Evaluation Modes. This protocol allows scorers from varied backgrounds to become proficient with RIPScore and the scoring protocol, and reach a standardized performance level similar to that of an expert. This training protocol obviates the requirement of certified sleep laboratory technicians, helping to reduce analysis costs, while increasing the feasibility of recruiting new scorers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A method to monitor the ongoing performance of scorers over time. This quality control measure allows the monitoring of scorers throughout the study to ensure they maintain a standardized performance. An advantage of this method is the early identification of underperforming scorers, which might allow for corrective action to assure the analysis quality.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The validation experiment demonstrates that analysis with these tools is accurate, efficient, and has high intra- and inter- scorer repeatability. These characteristics make our tools appropriate for studying respiratory conditions where large datasets (e.g., POA), and multiple scorers (e.g., longitudinal, multicenter trials) are a necessity.</p>
<sec id="sec029">
<title>Comparison to Existing Manual Scoring Tools</title>
<p>Commercially available scoring software is designed to analyze data based on the AASM scoring rules [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Using this software, scorers analyze data records and detect clinically relevant respiratory events such as central, obstructive, and mixed apnea. This analysis does not provide a comprehensive description of respiratory behavior as a function of time, because it focuses only on detecting and scoring isolated segments of data. As a result, the AASM analysis ignores potentially informative data segments. For example short respiratory pauses are not considered, even though they are more frequent in infants with POA than in controls [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, the AASM rules require scorers to scroll throughout long records and visually detect candidate events. This strategy is prone to fatigue, leading to missed detections and increased variability.</p>
<p>In contrast, analysis with RIPScore requires that signals are analyzed continuously, on a sample-by-sample basis. An advantage of this continuous analysis is that the complete data record is classified. As a result, the instantaneous respiratory pattern is fully characterized as a function of time, enabling a comprehensive signals and systems analysis approach to the study of disorders of respiration such as POA. Additionally, the focus of scorers is changed from visual detection of events to classification of data segments. This design requires scorers to analyze all data segments and so it is not possible to miss events. Moreover, contrary to the AASM rules, our tools impose no arbitrary segment length definitions that may exclude short but relevant segments [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec030">
<title>Training of Scorers</title>
<p>RIPScore provides an interactive Training Mode that familiarizes trainees with the interface, provides practice in scoring with immediate feedback using simulated data, and evaluates their performance. Three scorers with very varied backgrounds were trained in this way. All trainees reached the desired performance after four 2-hour training/evaluation sessions. Thus, by the end of training, all 3 scorers regardless of their clinical expertise, reached a standardized performance similar to that of the experienced reference scorer (REF). This implies that for large projects requiring multiple scorers, it should be possible to efficiently train a cadre of naive scorers to have performance similar to that of an expert.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec031">
<title>Accuracy and Consistency</title>
<p>The scorers used our tools to carry out a comprehensive manual analysis of the pre-processed validation dataset, comprising 21 infant data records that incorporated quality control segments with known “true-patterns”; a total of 125 hours of data were manually analyzed twice per scorer. The ongoing accuracy and consistency of each scorer was assessed by analyzing the RIP patterns assigned to the quality control “true-pattern” segments. All scorers maintained a high, relatively constant overall accuracy throughout the analysis of the 42 data records. The consistency of the two scorers with clinical expertise (SC1 and SC2) was nearly constant throughout, while the consistency of the third, non-clinical scorer (SC3) quickly rose to a level similar to that of the other two scorers after 10 data records. The high, nearly constant values of overall accuracy and consistency are evidence that the training protocol was effective, since scorers were able to achieve and maintain the desired performance level throughout.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that for the PAU pattern, SC3 had lower accuracy and consistency for most of the data records, suggesting that a minimum clinical expertise with infant respiratory patterns may be necessary to maintain the desired performance. <xref rid="pone.0134182.g014" ref-type="fig">Fig 14A and 14B</xref> suggest that even though the PAU-specific performance of SC3 was lower than expected, the initial 3 values of accuracy and consistency were likely influenced by training since they matched the values of SC1 and SC2. It was until after the third record that the performance of SC3 dropped. It is possible that an intervention at this point might have mitigated deterioration in PAU-specific performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec032">
<title>Scoring Rate</title>
<p>We measured the rate at which scorers analyzed infant data throughout the study. Scoring was efficient, occurring at a rate of at least 1 hr of data analyzed in 1 hr. Scorers with no previous scoring experience gradually increased their rate, with no loss of either accuracy or consistency. In contrast, the sleep laboratory technician (SC2) maintained a constant rate. We believe that the design of the RIPScore Scoring Mode interface, which only required a single cursor selection and one key stroke to score a segment, facilitated this efficient analysis rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec033">
<title>Repeatability of the Manual Analysis</title>
<p>The repeatability analysis showed that the two scorers with clinical background had very good intra-scorer repeatability, similar to that of REF. The scorer with no clinical expertise had a slightly lower intra-repeatability but it was still substantial.</p>
<p>The inter-scorer repeatability was very good in most categories. Indeed, the overall inter-scorer repeatability was much higher (<italic>κ</italic> = 0.65) than that reported between expert scorers from sleep laboratories using conventional scoring tools (<italic>κ</italic> = 0.31) [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For the particular pattern of PAU, intra- (0.74 ≤ <italic>κ</italic> ≤ 0.79) and inter-scorer (<italic>κ</italic> = 0.65) repeatability were substantial, which is relevant for the study of apnea. UNK was the pattern with lowest repeatability. Intra- and inter-scorer repeatability were also low for SIH, the only pattern requiring a breath-by-breath manual analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec034">
<title>Confusion of Patterns</title>
<p>Analysis of the confusion among RIP patterns found that SYB, ASB, SIH, and PAU were not often confused with other patterns. MVT and UNK were frequently confused with each other. This was the main reason for the low repeatability of UNK. This was expected since UNK grouped ambiguous patterns and segments of low signal quality. Even though this was a misclassification, both MVT and UNK correspond to corrupted data segments meant to be excluded from further analyses.</p>
<p>Additionally, we evaluated the influence of segment length on confusion, and found that segment length was a factor for only one scorer (SC1), who confused PAU segments longer than 15 s with UNK. A possible explanation is that SC1 might have interpreted long periods without respiratory movements as missing data resulting from technical problems, rather than as long PAU segments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec035">
<title>Implementation and Availability</title>
<p>RIPScore was implemented in MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), compiled as a standalone application, and installed on the scorers’ personal computers for the validation study. RIPScore and the pre-processing algorithm have been made available as open source, free of charge software; the manual (<xref rid="pone.0134182.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Document</xref>) and complete function repository (<xref rid="pone.0134182.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Source</xref> Code) are in GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.github.com/McCRIBS" xlink:type="simple">www.github.com/McCRIBS</ext-link>). The standalone application is available from the authors upon request.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec036">
<title>Future Work</title>
<p>A difference between the manual scoring tools presented in this work and the AASM methodology is that respiratory behavior is classified in terms of 6 mutually exclusive patterns, instead of the occurrence respiratory events such as apnea. At present, no direct link has been established between the 6 patterns and respiratory events. However, the patterns could be post-processed to identify respiratory events. For instance, a PAU with duration longer than a threshold (e.g., 15 s) would define a central apnea. Similarly, a combination of PAU with ASB would define a mixed obstructive apnea. Future work is necessary to evaluate the utility of a secondary set of rules based on pattern post-processing for the identification of clinically relevant respiratory events.</p>
<p>A direct application of the tools presented in this paper is the study of POA, and its relation to postoperative respiratory patterns. There is a variety of evidence suggesting that infants who experience POA have abnormal postoperative respiratory patterns [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134182.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Based on this, one could hypothesize that postoperative respiratory patterns may have information that is predictive of POA. The manual scoring tools from this paper could be used to investigate this hypothesis because they provide the means needed to comprehensively describe the respiratory patterns. Thus, for example, it would be straightforward to extract features from the manual scoring results related to information of the respiratory patterns such as the frequency of pauses, the proportion of time spent in each pattern, the relative proportion of synchronous- versus asynchronous-breathing, or the temporal sequence of patterns. Future work will investigate these and other features extracted from the respiratory patterns, and their ability to predict POA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec037">
<title>Significance</title>
<p>The tools for manual scoring introduced in this paper provide a comprehensive framework for the analysis of infant RIP data. These tools offer a significant advance in the study of respiratory behavior by providing: a comprehensive analysis method for large data sets, a means for the training and standardization of scorers, a method for the ongoing monitoring of scorer consistency and accuracy, and open source access to software and data sets.</p>
<sec id="sec038">
<title>Comprehensive Analysis</title>
<p>The tools provide a clear, concise definition of RIP patterns, and a software application (RIPScore) to locate these patterns along data records. The analyzed data record represents a sample-by-sample characterization of respiratory behavior as a continuous time series of patterns. All data points are classified and thereby significant segments are not missed. This approach facilitates the study of respiratory behavior from a signals and systems perspective by enabling the study of the temporal correlation between POA and the varied respiratory patterns (e.g., the relation between pause frequency and POA). The development of models that predict POA occurrence becomes possible, and preemptive interventions to enable preventive actions may follow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec039">
<title>Training &amp; Standardization</title>
<p>The tools can be used to train any person to be a scorer, regardless of background, to achieve a standardized performance level similar to that of an expert. The ability to quickly train new scorers recruited from varied backgrounds increases the availability of potential scorers, thus helping to reduce the analysis cost by obviating the need for certified sleep laboratory technicians.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec040">
<title>Monitoring of Scorer Performance</title>
<p>Another major contribution of this work is that the manual scoring tools make possible multicenter and longitudinal studies requiring multiple scorers. Conventional scoring tools have heretofore limited these types of study because of a low intra- and inter- scorer repeatability [<xref rid="pone.0134182.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Intra-scorer repeatability is important to ensure that scorers maintain consistency throughout the period of data analysis. Inter-scorer repeatability is necessary to maintain the consistency of results among multiple scorers. The quality control method introduced in this work evaluates the ongoing scorer performance on a record-by-record basis. This quality control tool can identify underperforming scorers at any time throughout the duration of the study. This timely identification enables investigators to take corrective actions (e.g., additional training, scorer replacement) to maintain the desired performance. This ability will in turn help to reduce intra- and inter-scorer variability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec041">
<title>Open Source Access</title>
<p>Importantly, all the tools presented in this work are openly available to researchers interested in the analysis of respiratory patterns using RIP, and the study of POA. In addition to the RIP pattern definitions, scoring rules, representative examples, and training protocol described in this manuscript; the software, including RIPScore and the pre-processing method for quality control, are freely available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.github.com/McCRIBS" xlink:type="simple">www.github.com/McCRIBS</ext-link>). Finally, the library of “true-pattern” data segments, the complete dataset from infants at risk of POA, the training sessions, and analysis results from the 4 scorers are available from the Dryad Digital Repository (doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.72dk5" xlink:type="simple">10.5061/dryad.72dk5</ext-link>).</p>
