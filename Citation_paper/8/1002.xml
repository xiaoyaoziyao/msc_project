<title>Background</title>
<p>The small RNA (sRNA) MicA has been shown to post-transcriptionally regulate translation of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. It uses an antisense mechanism to down-regulate OmpA protein synthesis and induce mRNA degradation. MicA is genomically localized between the coding regions of the <italic>gshA</italic> and <italic>luxS</italic> genes and is divergently transcribed from its neighbours. Transcription of the <italic>luxS</italic> gene which originates within or upstream of the MicA sequence would thus be complementary to the sRNA. LuxS regulation is as yet unclear.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>In this report, I show that the <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA exists as three long (major) transcripts of sizes that suggest just such interaction. The sRNA MicA's expression affects the abundance of each of these <italic>luxS</italic> transcripts. The involvement of the ribonuclease, RNase III in the accumulation of the shortest transcript is demonstrated. When MicA accumulates during growth, or is induced to be over-expressed, the cleaved mRNA species is observed to increase in intensity. Using primer extension and 5′-RACE experiments in combination with sRNA overexpression plasmids, I identify the exact origin of two of the three <italic>luxS</italic> transcripts, one of which is seen to result from a previously unidentified σ<sup>S</sup> dependent promoter.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>The presented data provides strong evidence that MicA functions <italic>in cis</italic> and <italic>in trans</italic>, targeting both <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA as well as the previously established <italic>ompA</italic> and <italic>phoP</italic> regulation. The proposed <italic>luxS</italic> regulation by MicA would be in tandem with another sRNA CyaR, shown recently to be involved in inhibiting translation of the <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA. Regulation of <italic>luxS</italic> expression is additionally shown to occur on a transcriptional level via σ<sup>S</sup> with variable transcript levels in different growth phases unlike what was previously assumed. This is the first known case of an sRNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> which targets both <italic>in cis</italic> (<italic>luxS</italic> mRNA) and <italic>in trans</italic> (<italic>ompA</italic> and <italic>phoP</italic> mRNAs).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Small RNAs (sRNAs) are believed to afford the bacterium an energetically cheaper, as well as a more rapid mode of affecting changes in protein production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Mitarai1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Mitarai2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-MontzkaWassarman1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Vogel1">[4]</xref>. The sRNAs thus far characterized in gram negative bacteria are overwhelmingly antisense RNAs which bind to their mRNA targets, either stimulating (rarely) or stifling (more commonly) target gene expression (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Gottesman1">[5]</xref>). Bacterial antisense sRNAs can furthermore be categorized as either <italic>cis</italic>-, or <italic>trans</italic>-encoded, depending on the genomic localization of their targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Wagner1">[6]</xref>. <italic>Trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs are encoded from genes separate from the target encoding gene and thus complementarity between the two interacting RNAs is seldom contiguous or perfect. The RNA chaperone Hfq has been shown to be involved in accelerating the binding of some of these imperfectly binding sRNA:target pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Chen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Rasmussen1">[8]</xref>. Following binding in a subset of these transactions is often target degradation facilitated by the endoribonuclease, RNase E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Kawamoto1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Morita1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Morita2">[11]</xref>. On the other hand, the <italic>cis-</italic>encoded sRNAs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Brantl1">[12]</xref>), often found in associated genetic elements such as plasmids, phages and transposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Wagner2">[13]</xref> are encoded on the opposite DNA strand from their targets. They are thus perfectly complementary to their targets and are believed to be degraded in concert with their targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Masse1">[14]</xref>. RNase III, a ribonuclease that recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is known to be involved in the degradation or processing of such interacting RNAs and cuts in both antisense and target RNAs are a hallmark of such DNA duplex-dependent cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Blomberg1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Krinke1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Pertzev1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> small RNA, MicA, is genomically localized in the intergenic region between the protein-encoding genes <italic>ygaG</italic> (<italic>luxS</italic>) and <italic>gshA</italic> and its function has been thoroughly elucidated in several systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Rasmussen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Udekwu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Coornaert1">[19]</xref>. In its best defined role, this sRNA acts as a <italic>trans</italic>-encoded translational inhibitor of OmpA protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Rasmussen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Udekwu1">[18]</xref>. The <italic>luxS</italic> transcription start was until recently unidentified but believed to lie near the start of the <italic>luxS</italic> open reading frame <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Schauder1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Beeston1">[21]</xref>. Due to this, antisense-mediated post-transcriptional regulation by MicA although postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-DeKeersmaecker1">[22]</xref> was yet to be shown.</p>
<p>This report confounds the assumption of a singular <italic>luxS</italic> promoter, identifying three different species of the <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA, two of which are apparently primary transcription products. An alluded-to transcriptional start site (within the intergenic region which ‘harbours’ MicA) is shown to also depend on the ds RNA specific endonuclease RNase III as well as the sRNA MicA; the transcript's levels increasing with MicA overexpression and decreasing with MicA depletion. I identify <italic>in silico</italic> as well as in vivo a stationary phase responsive (<italic>rpoS</italic>) promoter that drives transcription of the longest of the <italic>luxS</italic> species. Despite changes in relative levels of these RNAs within the system there appeared to be no effect on LuxS protein levels suggestive of an additional regulatory component. This additional component was recently identified when <italic>luxS</italic> translation was shown to be directly regulated by another sRNA, CyaR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-DeLay1">[23]</xref>. Combining the results of this study with those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-DeLay1">[23]</xref>, I hypothesize that MicA-mediated processing of the <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA modulates access of the downstream-acting CyaR to the translation initiation region (TIR). Thus CyaR would require MicA-dependent processing for it to access its target region in the <italic>luxS</italic> 5′-end located translation initiation (TIR) region. Interestingly, this only adds to an already emergent theme of tandem regulation found in sRNA-mediated gene regulation, albeit with a slight twist. It is the first example of a sRNA that carries out <underline>both</underline> <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> antisense regulation. This also further clarifies earlier suspicion of crosstalk between the outer membrane biogenesis (<italic>ompA, phoP</italic>) and LuxS.</p>

<title>Northern blot analysis of <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA in wild-type and RNase III mutant strains</title>
<p>Previous studies carried out on <italic>luxS</italic> did not shed light on this gene's transcriptional regulation and with a dearth of strong transcription signals in the region immediately proximal to the <italic>luxS</italic> coding sequence I opted to probe for this mRNA on a northern blot. I inferred transcription through the intergenic region due to the unmapped status of <italic>luxS</italic> transcription. For this reason, plasmid-containing wildtype and RNase III minus <italic>E. coli</italic> (constitutively overexpressing MicA or AntiMicA) were examined. Total RNA was separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane and probed for <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA with a riboprobe spanning the entire coding region. Multiple species (three distinct bands) of <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA were detected in both backgrounds. The detected transcripts were denoted P1, P2, and R3 as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g002">Figure 2</xref>. An additional (weak) band was also observable and this was strongly enhanced in the RNase III minus background with AntiMicA overexpression [‘**’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g002">Fig. 2</xref>]. Steady-state levels of the <italic>luxS</italic> P1 transcript when in stationary phase (OD<sub>600</sub>  = 2.5) are higher than P2 in a wildtype setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, lanes 2 &amp; 4). Upon MicA overexpression, the R3 transcript is seen to accumulate as a reciprocal decrease in P1 and P2 RNA is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, lane 8). To add to this, R3 was not observed under any conditions in the RNase III-deficient strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, lanes 3, 5, 7 and 9)and the P1 and P2 band intensities were both elevated compared to wildtype in this background (cv <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, lane 3 vs 2; lane 5 vs 4). Taken together, this strongly suggests that R3 is processed from P1 and P2 in an RNase III-, and MicA – dependent manner. To support this, when AntiMicA RNA is overexpressed in a wildtype background, R3 accumulation is &gt;70% reduced compared to control (cv <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g002">Fig. 2</xref> lane 6 vs lane 4) although Anti-MicA overexpression is only about 80% efficient in titrating out MicA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Udekwu1">[18]</xref>.</p>

<title>Primer extension analysis</title>
<p>To broach the question of the multiple <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA bands, primer extension analysis was used to identify 5′-end heterogeneity. Extending a primer (K12), complementary to the 5′-end of the <italic>luxS</italic> coding region for primer extension analysis, the different ends of the <italic>luxS</italic> transcripts were identified. This was carried out on RNA extracted from stationary phase (OD<sub>600</sub> ∼3) cultures of the same <italic>E. coli</italic> strains in the preceding experiment. To accurately identify the longer P1 transcript, another primer (K22) complementary to the 3′-tail of the <italic>gshA</italic> mRNA was used (gel not shown). All the mapped 5′-ends evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g004">Figure 4</xref> are indicated in the schematics of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g001">Figure 1</xref>. In summary of those results, the P1 and P2 (a,b) bands disappear specifically under MicA overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, lane 4 vs lanes 1 and 2). This corroborates the MicA dependence of processed band R3 observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Also in line with the Northern blot data, AntiMicA overexpression in a wild-type background leads to a strongly reduced band intensity of R3, which is absent in the RNase III (-) strain (lanes 5 to 8). This happens probably due to the presence of AntiMicA which would act as a decoy target for MicA. These data taken together strongly suggest that; (a) the heterogeneity of <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA length is as a result of variation in the 5′-ends of the RNA, (b) <italic>luxS</italic> is transcribed from at least one promoter, found &gt;300 bp upstream of its coding sequence, and (c), that one of the three identified <italic>luxS</italic> specific RNA species (R3) is MicA- and RNase III-dependent.</p>

<title>5′-RACE analysis</title>
<p>To further characterize the observed transcripts as primary or processed such, 5′-RACE analysis was carried out on untreated or tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP)-treated <italic>E. coli</italic> total RNA. TAP-treatment being specific for triphosphorylated 5′-ends serves to enhance signal from primary transcription products. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows a 2.0% agarose gel analysis of 5′RACE products generated by primers K22 or K31, and E6 (<italic>luxS</italic> - leader specific and adapter-specific, respectively). These products upon sequencing (7 of 10 clones) identified a TAP-enhanced end as a ‘G’ residue at position −332 relative to the <italic>luxS</italic> AUG (translation) start which gave rise to band P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, Lane 3). The remaining three clones were found to be around 30 bases shorter (−298, −291, −284) although no promoter-like sequences are evident in the vicinity of these cloned ends. The R3 band (Lane 6) is somewhat perplexingly also enhanced by TAP, implying that it too is a primary transcript in line with observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-DeLay1">[23]</xref>.

<title>Transcriptional fusions confirm promoter functionality</title>
<p>To test for activity of the putative promoter P1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, I introduced the candidate P1 sequence (of different sizes) upstream of a promoterless luciferase gene carried on a plasmid. Compared to the promoterless (p33_35luc) plasmid (control for background luciferase activity), high transcription activity was observed from the P1 promoter. This activity was seen to increase upon entry into stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The results showed that 130 bp of sequence upstream of P1 drove the transcription of luciferase efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, white bars). Even a truncated construct containing the 38 bp directly upstream of P1 displayed this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, black bars).

This was based on the transcriptional activity of a fusion constructed on the assumption of a <italic>luxS</italic> transcription start that was not experimentally supported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Beeston1">[21]</xref>. In my hands, at least the transcription of the <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA but not the protein is under growth phase regulation, most likely involving σ<sup>S</sup>.</p>
<p>This study describes RNase III- and MicA dependence of <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA abundance(s) while identifying a new <italic>luxS</italic> promoter. The complex transcriptional architecture of the <italic>luxS</italic>-MicA-<italic>gshA</italic> region of <italic>E. coli</italic> is described with potential translational relevance of the interaction between MicA and <italic>luxS</italic> mRNAs. When studies commenced on MicA, two functions of this sRNA were considered: 1) MicA could act as a regulator of <italic>trans-</italic>encoded mRNAs, or 2) MicA could represent a <italic>cis-</italic>encoded antisense RNA, provided that either the 3′ UTR of <italic>gshA</italic>, or the 5′UTR of <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA overlap the sRNA gene sequence (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Naively, at the time a single target was assumed. Although <italic>gshA</italic> and <italic>luxS</italic> are transcribed in the same orientation relative to each other, there is no evidence of a polycistronic message containing both reading frames in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Schauder1">[20]</xref>. Bacterial gene regulation in the 5′-regions of mRNAs is substantially more widespread and as long 3′-UTR's are unusual in bacteria, the differentially sized <italic>luxS</italic> riboprobe-specific mRNAs were suspected to vary on the 5′-end. Transcription of <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA was reported to be from a singular promoter which was not directly identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Surette1">[33]</xref>. The recent identification of a TAP-dependent singular transcript corresponding to our R3 transcript unfortunately did not identify a promoter sequence however <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-DeLay1">[23]</xref>. It was also widely accepted, though without convincing evidence, that <italic>luxS</italic> is not differentially regulated on the transcriptional level in gram (-) bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Beeston1">[21]</xref>. This had struck me as unusual as the gene product has been shown to be essential for the stationary phase abundant AI-2 synthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Surette1">[33]</xref>. However, inconsistent with this, <italic>luxS</italic> is known to be differentially regulated, and even transcriptionally so in <italic>Edwardsiella tarda</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Zhang1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Importantly, three major <italic>luxS</italic> - specific bands were observed in a Northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). At least two of three bands were of a size corresponding to transcripts originating from beyond MicA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Argaman1">[35]</xref>. One band in particular was of a size that suggested a 5′- end at least 300 nt upstream of the <italic>luxS</italic> start codon. It became obvious, based on band-length, that the region used previously in <italic>luxS</italic> - <italic>lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Beeston1">[21]</xref> could not account for the most slowly migrating band (P1). Simultaneously, 5′- end heterogeneity would imply transcription overlapping the intergenically located MicA RNA for both mRNA species (Bands P1 and P2). Both of these longer transcripts could theoretically interact with the full-length MicA RNA although the third band would only overlap by about one helical turn (14nts in this study, 15 nts in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-DeLay1">[23]</xref>) precluding RNase III processing; RNA duplexes formed are targets for RNase III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Pertzev1">[17]</xref> which specifically recognizes and cleaves double-stranded RNA of at least two helical turns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Robertson1">[36]</xref>. There is more than sufficient transcription overlap (<italic>luxS</italic> transcription proceeds through the MicA encoding region) to justify probing for <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA in an RNase III deficient mutant (<italic>rnc</italic> <sup>-</sup>). Notably also, the consensus-observed RNase III cleavage sequences are quite similar to the expected region of interaction between the MicA 5′-end and its complimentary <italic>luxS</italic> upstream region (data not shown). Primer extension specifically identified the P1 product in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g004">Figure 4</xref> although its exact end was deduced by RACE analysis using a more ORF-distal primer, K22. The cloning of primarily (7/10) fragments identifying the same G residue (−332) as the transcription start in 5′-RACE, was consistent with primer extension data. The P2 products were evident only when K31 was used as K22 binds downstream of the primer extension predicted ends (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Despite not describing the P2 band as extensively as P1, the primer extension derived 5′- ends which were TAP-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) implied its promoter (if a primary transcript) would be located in the most distal 3′- end of the <italic>gshA</italic> message. However, the nature of the region where these transcript 5′- ends are found, combined with their poor representation among the clones in my RACE analysis is reminiscent more of endonuclease processed RNAs. All this and the band intensity reduction of P1 and P2 transcripts is still consistent with RNase III processing should interaction occur with MicA and as its steady state levels increase during growth (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In fact, the R3 product follows an accumulation profile during growth that is quite reminiscent of that of MicA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Udekwu1">[18]</xref>; K.U., data not shown).</p>
<p>Further evidence of MicA involvement in R3 accumulation stems from the increased presence of the processed R3 band and the concomitant decrease in <underline>both</underline> P1 and P2 levels during growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, OD<sub>600</sub> 0.2 to 1.5), and upon overexpression of MicA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, lane 8 vs lane 2 &amp; 4). This is not the case in a Δ <italic>rnc</italic> strain where the R3 species is completely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, lanes 3, 5, 7 &amp; 9). Another band denoted ‘X’ (mapping to position +4 of MicA as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) is seen in the primer extension experiment to increase in intensity when MicA is overexpressed in both strains but it remains unclear what the nature of that particular band is. After identifying the 5′-end of the P1 RNA, it was established that transcription occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> from the relevant sequence upstream of the P1 start. Transcriptional fusions of this region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) displayed high activity which increased (∼10 fold) upon entry into stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013449-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, the P1 transcript would correspond to the slowest migrating band observed in the Northern blot analysis of <italic>luxS</italic> expression.</p>
<p>There is somewhat of an impasse with regards to the ‘true’ function of the LuxS protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> and its close relatives. Briefly, some researchers are of the opinion that AI-2 is primarily a metabolic bi-product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Vendeville1">[37]</xref> while others focus on a role as a universal signaling molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Bassler1">[38]</xref>. Inadvertently with LuxS regulation in focus, this study has been on the above described transcription of the <italic>luxS</italic> gene and its processing by MicA. Although Wang et al (2005) observed a negative regulation of <italic>luxS</italic> expression by cAMP and CRP, an alternative explanation is MicA involvement as it is up-regulated in a <italic>cya</italic>-deficient background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Udekwu2">[25]</xref>. All our data suggest strongly that in <italic>E. coli</italic> and perhaps close relatives of it, <italic>luxS</italic> is not only translationally but also transcriptionally (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Wang1">[39]</xref>) and post-transcriptionally (this work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Coornaert1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-DeLay1">[23]</xref>) regulated during growth. The data presented is also supported by a recent publication, where variable <italic>luxS</italic> gene expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> was documented albeit on a protein level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Lelong1">[40]</xref>. In this proteomics-based mapping of the newly - elucidated Crl/σ<sup>S</sup> regulon, the authors reported ∼5 fold lower LuxS protein levels in an <italic>rpoS</italic> mutant strain compared to wildtype. They additionally show a 20 fold lower expression level in an <italic>rpoS</italic>, <italic>crl</italic> double mutant. This observation is entirely in line with the results presented here; <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA is upregulated in stationary phase and the P1 transcript displays characteristics of being σ<sup>S</sup>-specific. Lelong <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Lelong1">[40]</xref> show the existence of ‘stationary phase regulatable’ protein levels at the very least. Although uncertain whether or not the changes that they see are as a result of increased transcription, the effect of MicA-mediated processing is currently being addressed. The identification of the <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA as an additional target for MicA RNA is intriguing in any case. At this point of investigation, the MicA/RNAse III-dependent processing of the longer <italic>luxS</italic> transcripts to the R3 transcript is strongly suggestive of sRNA-mediated regulation. Arguably, any effect of MicA on transcript abundance (shown) or stability (also shown) is gene-regulatory in nature. However, the effect of overexpressing MicA on LuxS protein levels was not evident; immunoprecipitated, radiolabelled, pulse-chased LuxS protein did not differ significantly between induced and non-induced MicA samples (data not shown). If MicA were to affect the synthesis of the LuxS protein, then it could be suggested that this sRNA would act as an interface of sorts between quorum sensing and membrane sensing. De Lay and Gottesman described the small RNA (CyaR), showing strong evidence for LuxS translation regulation. However, unlike their data, we observed 3 isoforms of the <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA (primarily due to higher resolution of polyacrylamide gels). Although this study does not contradict their results regarding the regulation by CyaR, it does complicate the regulatory circuit somewhat. MicA is constitutively up-regulated in a cyclic AMP deficient strain (<italic>cyaA</italic><sup>-</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013449-Udekwu2">[25]</xref> and this would accordingly increase the abundance of the <italic>luxS</italic> P1 transcript. In combination with my data, it appears that the post-transcriptional regulation of LuxS protein levels could feasibly be dependent on the two sRNAs (MicA and CyaR) as well as two RNases (RNase III and RNase E respectively). It still remains to be tested however, whether or not MicA-dependent processing of the <italic>luxS</italic> mRNA is essential for CyaR-mediated regulation or if the process can be by-passed. Work is ongoing to clarify the putative tandem activity of these coordinate sRNAs.</p>
