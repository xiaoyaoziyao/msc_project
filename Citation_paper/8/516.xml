<abstract>
<p>Traveling waves in the developing brain are a prominent source of highly correlated spiking activity that may instruct the refinement of neural circuits. A candidate mechanism for mediating such refinement is spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), which translates correlated activity patterns into changes in synaptic strength. To assess the potential of these phenomena to build useful structure in developing neural circuits, we examined the interaction of wave activity with STDP rules in simple, biologically plausible models of spiking neurons. We derive an expression for the synaptic strength dynamics showing that, by mapping the time dependence of STDP into spatial interactions, traveling waves can build periodic synaptic connectivity patterns into feedforward circuits with a broad class of experimentally observed STDP rules. The spatial scale of the connectivity patterns increases with wave speed and STDP time constants. We verify these results with simulations and demonstrate their robustness to likely sources of noise. We show how this pattern formation ability, which is analogous to solutions of reaction-diffusion systems that have been widely applied to biological pattern formation, can be harnessed to instruct the refinement of postsynaptic receptive fields. Our results hold for rich, complex wave patterns in two dimensions and over several orders of magnitude in wave speeds and STDP time constants, and they provide predictions that can be tested under existing experimental paradigms. Our model generalizes across brain areas and STDP rules, allowing broad application to the ubiquitous occurrence of traveling waves and to wave-like activity patterns induced by moving stimuli.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In several areas of the developing brain, waves of electrical activity trace out distinct patterns across the nervous tissue. These waves are intricately involved in developmental processes that set up the structural connections of the adult brain, but it is unclear what role the wave patterns play. Here, we examine how the strength of connections in these brain areas may change by a process called spike-timing dependent plasticity, which is sensitive to the precise times at which individual neurons become electrically active. We use mathematical models and simulations to show that interactions between waves and plasticity build highly structured patterns into the connections. The results of our model are analogous to many cases of biological pattern formation seen, for example, in zebra stripes, leopard spots and seashells. An important connectivity pattern we consider is the receptive field, which determines to a large extent the specific function of a neuron. We demonstrate how pattern formation can refine the shape of a receptive field and therefore the specificity of a neuron, and explore several ways in which pattern formation may be disrupted, providing clues regarding pathologies in receptive field development. Our theory makes several predictions that may be tested using existing experimental paradigms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>After an initial stage of activity-independent construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref001">1</xref>], the developing nervous system undergoes a period of refinement that is strongly influenced by spontaneous and evoked patterns of neural activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref003">3</xref>]. Traveling wavefronts are a striking feature of these activity patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref009">9</xref>]. Within short temporal windows, wavefronts induce strong interneuronal correlations that can act through Hebbian mechanisms of synaptic plasticity to build structure into the connectivity of neural circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref011">11</xref>]. This has prompted the hypothesis that correlated activity plays an instructive role for circuit refinement in the developing brain (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref002">2</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref003">3</xref>]). One Hebbian mechanism that is well suited to this role and is widely reported in the brain is spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), for which synaptic connections are strengthened or weakened depending on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes that arrive at the synapse, typically within tens of milliseconds of each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref014">14</xref>]. In this article, we undertake a mathematical analysis of the interaction between traveling wave activity patterns and STDP, and explore the types of connectivity patterns that emerge as a result of this interaction.</p>
<p>Past studies have demonstrated that STDP could translate correlated input patterns into structured neural circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref021">21</xref>], and could mediate the construction of realistic receptive fields (RFs) with properties that resemble those found in the visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref023">23</xref>]. These models primarily focussed on spatial and temporal correlations as separable features when considering their interaction with STDP. However, the spatiotemporal correlations induced by traveling waves are space-time inseparable, providing additional information that may be utilized during circuit building. Space-time inseparable activity patterns map the temporal profile of the STDP rule into a spatial profile of synaptic strength changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref024">24</xref>], which can be used to build circuits that mimic neuronal sensitivity to visual motion during repeated exposure to moving visual stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref028">28</xref>]. But despite the demonstrated applicability of STDP to specific cases of neural circuit development, a more general, formal analysis of the interaction of STDP and wave-like activity patterns is still lacking.</p>
<p>Here, we derive a mathematical expression that accounts for the interaction of a variety of traveling wave activity patterns and STDP rules, and we examine the analytical predictions in a simple yet biologically plausible model of spiking neurons. We show that, for a broad class of experimentally observed STDP rules, such interactions build highly structured and periodic connectivity patterns into feedforward circuits, analogous to a Turing instability in reaction diffusion systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref029">29</xref>], which has been applied to diverse cases of biological pattern formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref031">31</xref>]. We then demonstrate the robustness of this pattern formation process and how it can be utilized to construct and refine the size and shape of RFs. Our results offer theoretical insights that may advance the understanding of the role played by traveling wave phenomena in different areas of the brain. We highlight particular insights into visual system development and outline a number of predictions that may be tested experimentally.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our results are organized as follows. First, we describe how traveling waves can interact with STDP to influence synaptic strengths, derive a mathematical expression for this effect and verify analytical solutions to the derived equations using a simulation of spiking neurons. Second, we use further simulations to explore the robustness of our analytical results. Third, we demonstrate the properties of waves and STDP rules that allow for different types of refinement in downstream receptive fields (RFs).</p>

<title>Illustration of network dynamics</title>
<p>To understand how correlated activity caused by traveling waves could influence synaptic strengths via a STDP mechanism, we consider a reduced model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) consisting of a one-dimensional (1D) layer of presynaptic input cells, all of which connect via excitatory synapses, <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub>, onto a single, postsynaptic output cell. In later sections, we extend the input layer to two dimensions. When a wave traverses the input population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), each input neuron is recruited by the wavefront (red colored unit with rightward arrow) and discharges a burst of spikes, which drives spiking in the output neuron. Temporal differences between the spike times of a given input neuron and the output neuron, Δ<italic>t</italic> = <italic>t</italic><sub>in</sub>−<italic>t</italic><sub>out</sub>, determine how the respective synapse is modified in strength according to a STDP rule, <italic>K</italic>(Δ<italic>t</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Methods</xref>, Eqs <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e085">21</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e086">22</xref>). The set of spikes for all input neurons leads to a simple diagonal band structure in space and time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Model framework and dynamics.</title>
<p><bold>A</bold>. The model consists of a layer of input neurons, along which wavefronts of spiking activity propagate. Input neurons undergo a burst of spikes, generated stochastically, when the wavefront passes (red unit). Input spikes elicit excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the output neuron (blue unit) that are scaled by the synaptic strength, <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>. The output neuron generates spikes stochastically with a firing rate linearly proportional to its summed EPSP. <bold>B</bold>. Example spike raster from the simulation, showing one wave traveling past input neurons 1–10. <bold>C</bold>. Synaptic strengths are modified by either an asymmetric (top) or symmetric (bottom) STDP rule. <bold>D</bold>. Schematic for the influence of the wavefront on modifications at surrounding synapses. An input neuron (red) is recruited by a wave, which travels from left to right, and increases the firing rate of the output neuron (blue). When an asymmetric STDP rule is at play, output spikes at the current time point will cause synapses behind the wavefront to increase in strength (‘+’ symbol) because they were active at an earlier time. Similarly, synapses in front of the wave will decrease (‘−’ symbol), because they will become active at a later time. Thus, traveling waves map the STDP rule onto space. <bold>E.</bold> Schematic for the influence of surrounding inputs (colored light red), on synaptic modifications at the wavefront (dark red). <bold>F</bold>. Same as <bold>E</bold>, except that inputs to the right of the wavefront induce even greater synaptic strengthening as their respective synapses are stronger. <bold>G</bold>. Same as <bold>E</bold>, except for a symmetric STDP rule. Here, the greater strength of synapses either side of the wavefront induce more synaptic weakening.</p>

</fig>
<p>To illustrate how this input spike pattern leads to spatially structured changes in synaptic strength, we consider a STDP rule that is asymmetric in Δ<italic>t</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, top). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, we show a snapshot of the traveling wave and its influence on the surrounding synaptic strengths. Here, an input neuron (colored dark red) is recruited by the wavefront and fires a burst of spikes, which in turn elicits excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that drive the output neuron to spike. For waves traveling left to right, spikes generated by input neurons to the left of the wavefront always precede output spikes. Consequently, their respective synapses are strengthened, because the STDP rule specifies strengthening for negative Δ<italic>t</italic>. Likewise, synapses connecting input neurons to the right of the wavefront will be weakened. In fact, due to the wave motion, the dependence of the STDP rule on relative spike times, Δ<italic>t</italic>, is mapped onto the spatial axis of the input layer, Δ<italic>x</italic>, and thus the relative spike locations, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g001">Fig 1D and 1G</xref>. Consequently, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, all input neurons (colored light red) that surround a synapse will influence the net change in strength at that synapse. One might predict this change to be proportional to the integral of the STDP rule, <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004422.e001"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004422.e001g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004422.e001"/><mml:math id="M1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∫</mml:mo> <mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo> <mml:mo>∞</mml:mo></mml:mrow> <mml:mo>∞</mml:mo></mml:msubsup> <mml:mi>d</mml:mi> <mml:mo>Δ</mml:mo> <mml:mi>t</mml:mi> <mml:mspace width="0.167em"/><mml:mi>K</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo> <mml:mo>Δ</mml:mo> <mml:mi>t</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>. However, the extent to which an input influences surrounding synapses depends on its influence over the output firing rate, and thus its own synaptic strength. For example, with an asymmetric STDP rule and waves traveling left to right, a synapse will strengthen relative to <italic>K</italic><sub>0</sub> if the surrounding synapses are stronger to the right than to the left, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g001">Fig 1F</xref>. On the other hand, a synapse will be relatively weakened if the surrounding synapses are stronger to the left than to the right. By the same argument, a synapse will be relatively weakened by a temporally symmetric STDP rule if the surrounding synapses are stronger on both sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), and relatively strengthened if the surrounding synapses are weaker. In this way, strong synapses increasingly dictate changes to local synaptic strengths as more waves pass. Eventually, the connectivity pattern begins to form islands of strong synapses that are flanked by regions of weak synapses.</p>
<p>In the following analytical derivation and simulations, we show how this process of wave-induced STDP results in a distinct type of pattern formation in the network for a broad class of STDP rules.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Deriving synaptic strength dynamics</title>
<p>Here, we derive a description for the dynamics of synaptic strengths that are driven by pairs of input and output spikes acting through a STDP rule and resulting from traveling wave activity patterns traversing the input layer. Within our framework, input and output spike trains are generated by a stochastic process with a time-dependent firing rate. The stochastic arrival of spikes results in stochastic changes to the synaptic strengths, thus posing a challenge when seeking a description for the spatial structure of synaptic strengths that evolves slowly over long periods of time, during which many traveling waves occur. It is therefore useful to separate the slow dynamics from the fast, stochastic dynamics under the assumption that, during a limited period of time, Δ<italic>T</italic>, individual changes in synaptic strengths are negligible, but accumulate slowly over multiple periods of Δ<italic>T</italic> as a result of the time-averaged input and output activity. By approximating synaptic strengths as being constant during the period Δ<italic>T</italic>, Kempter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref016">16</xref>] showed that changes in synaptic strength over this period could be described by the inner product of the STDP rule, <italic>K</italic>(Δ<italic>t</italic>), and the cross-correlation function, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>(Δ<italic>t</italic>,<italic>t</italic>), between the spike trains of input neuron <italic>i</italic> and output neuron <italic>j</italic>:

where <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>(<italic>j</italic>)</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) are ensemble averages, for example over multiple waves, of the input (output) spike trains and can thus be identified with the input (output) firing rates.

As such, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e002">Eq 1</xref> implements the approximation by averaging over the small stochastic fluctuations, thus providing only the mean drift in <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>).

Thus, our derivation predicts that, for STDP rules like those reported experimentally, the synaptic strengths will develop a connectivity pattern that is periodic in space with a period of 1/<italic>k</italic>*, under the influence of traveling waves.</p>
<p>A similar model of pattern formation describes the development of ocular dominance columns in primary visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref035">35</xref>], in which it is proposed that short range excitatory and long range inhibitory lateral interactions give rise to the spatially periodic dominance of eye specific afferents across primary visual cortex. In our model, it is the mapping of the STDP rule onto space that provides the lateral interactions necessary for pattern formation. More generally, the solution derived above is analogous to pattern forming solutions that result from Turing instabilities in reaction-diffusion systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref029">29</xref>], whereby the initially homogeneous distribution of synaptic strengths becomes unstable, allowing the fastest growing eigenmode to dominate the resulting pattern. In systems composed of a diffusible activator and an inhibitor, Turing instabilities frequently occur when the inhibitor diffuses over greater distances than does the activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref030">30</xref>]. Here, the decay constants of the positive and negative STDP lobes bear similarities to the length scales of diffusion in reaction-diffusion systems. Thus, STDP rules with narrow windows for strengthening and wide windows for weakening are good candidates for pattern formation in neural circuits that support traveling wave activity patterns.</p>

<title>Stability of the connectivity pattern</title>
<p>If the synapses are unbounded, the STDP rules used here will always yield a sinusoidal connectivity pattern when driven by traveling waves, given sufficient time, and the mean synaptic strength will always be zero (the mean of a sine wave). This is far from a physiologically plausible scenario: without bounds, the synaptic strengths would tend towards ±∞. When bounds are imposed, however, care is needed to formulate the STDP rule, so that the synaptic strengths do not reach the upper or lower bound before the dominant eigenmode at <italic>k</italic> = <italic>k</italic>* takes hold.

<title>Spatial pattern formation in a spiking neuron simulation</title>
<p>To test the predictions of the analytical derivation above, we examined whether a periodic connectivity pattern would develop as a result of traveling waves and STDP in a simulated network of linear Poisson, spiking neurons. The simulation captures the architecture and function of the network illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, consisting of a 1D layer of input neurons that all synapse onto a single output neuron. During simulations, synaptic strengths were modified by one of two distinct forms of STDP rule (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Methods</xref>) that have been reported in the literature, one that is asymmetric (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e085">Eq 21</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref036">36</xref>] and the other symmetric (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e086">Eq 22</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref038">38</xref>] in Δ<italic>t</italic>. Spiking activity is generated by a traveling wavefront that moves back and forth along the input layer, eliciting EPSPs and spikes in the output neuron. We varied two parameters in the simulation: <italic>i</italic>) the temporal window of <italic>K</italic>(Δ<italic>t</italic>), which we control with the decay time constant for synaptic strengthening, <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub>, and <italic>ii</italic>) the wave speed, <italic>v</italic>. These parameters modulate the shape of <italic>κ</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) and, therefore, the spatial frequency of the predicted periodic connectivity pattern.</p>
<p>As predicted by our derivation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e017">Eq 9</xref>), the synaptic strengths in the simulation indeed developed a periodic connectivity pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) in the presence of traveling waves for both the asymmetric and symmetric rules. The periodic pattern was robust over a range of STDP time constants (<italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> = 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 ms), keeping the wave speed constant (<italic>v</italic> = 3 mm/s), and for a range of wave speeds (<italic>v</italic> = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm/s), keeping <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> constant (<italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> = 20 ms). As predicted, increasing <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> or <italic>v</italic> caused the period of the connectivity pattern to increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). To test the accuracy with which <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e017">Eq 9</xref> predicts the resulting spatial frequency over this range of parameters, we computed the power spectrum of the steady state synaptic strengths (mean subtracted) to which a Gaussian curve was fit.

<p>To investigate whether nonlinearities in the postsynaptic response influence the outcome of the connectivity patterns, we replaced the linear output neuron with a leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neuron (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Methods</xref>) that modeled absolute and relative refractory periods of 2 ms and 5 ms, respectively. These simulations yielded a similar relationship between the spatial frequency of the connectivity pattern, wave speed and STDP time scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g002">Fig 2F and 2G</xref>). This similarity might be expected, as the wave correlations extend over relatively long time scales and thus smooth out any ripples in the correlation function, <italic>C</italic>(<italic>x</italic>,Δ<italic>t</italic>), that would be introduced on the short time scales of the refractory period or EPSP rise time. More noticeable differences may, however, be observed if wavefronts elicited very short bursts or only single spikes.</p>
<p>The development of periodic patterns in synaptic connectivity could have wide applications throughout the nervous system of many species, particularly because of the ubiquity of both traveling waves and STDP. However, it is first necessary to determine the extent to which pattern formation is influenced 1) over the range of space and time scales observed in biology, 2) in the presence of noise, and 3) by 2D waves. We explore these issues in the following sections.</p>

<title>Pattern formation over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales</title>
<p>In the previous section, we found that the wave speed and STDP time scale are key parameters that determine the spatial frequency of periodic connectivity patterns. Traveling waves in different areas of the brain are characterized by wave speeds that span at least two of orders of magnitude, from slow retinal waves with speeds on the order of 0.1 mm/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref039">39</xref>] to fast cortical waves with speeds reaching 17 mm/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref009">9</xref>]. On the other hand, time scales for STDP are typically 10–100 ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref040">40</xref>], but time scales on the order of seconds are predicted to be relevant to retinal waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref041">41</xref>]. We consider in the Discussion how the theoretical results above might apply to these different biological circuits. To do this, we first obtain a more complete picture of the spatial scales of pattern formation predicted by the theory over a wide range of wave speeds and STDP time scales.</p>

The <italic>k</italic>* landscapes for both the asymmetric and symmetric STDP rules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, respectively) reveal a remarkably similar dependence of the predicted spatial frequency on <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> and <italic>v</italic>, which is perhaps not surprising given the simple exponential functions underlying the STDP rules (Eqs <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e085">21</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e086">22</xref>). In particular, for a large region of parameter space, scaling either <italic>v</italic> or <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> by a factor, <italic>f</italic>, simply scales <italic>k</italic>* by 1/<italic>f</italic>. We illustrate this scaling feature using triangles with two equal sides aligned to the axes, as multiplication in linear space is equivalent to addition in logarithmic space. Starting at one iso-frequency contour (1 cycle/mm, bottom left vertex of white triangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), a constant step along the <italic>v</italic>-axis moves <italic>k</italic>* to the same iso-frequency contour (0.04 cycles/mm) as does an equal step along the <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub>-axis. Because the input burst acts as a low pass filter on the STDP rule, this relationship does not continue (green triangle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) when <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> becomes shorter than the burst duration (here 0.1 s) of the input neurons.

<title>Impact of burst duration on pattern formation</title>
<p>The warping of the spatial frequency landscapes above shows that the burst duration also plays a role in pattern formation. Furthermore, when correlated activity patterns comprise long burst durations, STDP rules with short time scales struggle to extract information from the correlations that might be relevant for circuit development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref044">44</xref>]. Here, we further examine the influence of burst duration on pattern formation in our model by carrying out simulations over the range of burst durations that are observed for different types of traveling wave.</p>
<p>Waves in this set of simulations traveled with a fixed speed of 3 mm/s, and we used the asymmetric STDP rule with a fixed decay time of <italic>t</italic><sub>+</sub> = 20 ms. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, we show examples of the evolving connectivity pattern for different burst durations. For bursts lasting 0.03 s, the connectivity pattern had only a very weak periodic structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, left panel). The power spectrum of connectivity patterns when the burst duration was 0.03 s, averaged over repeated trials, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4B</xref> (blue). By normalizing the spectrum to the power at its peak, it is clear to see that power is spread over a broad range of spatial frequencies. Burst durations on the order of a few hundred milliseconds produced more distinct periodic connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, middle panels), with power concentrated around the peak in the power spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, orange). However, in simulations with burst durations of 1 s or longer, the connectivity pattern became disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, right panel), with some power concentrated at the lowest spatial frequencies and otherwise spread evenly across higher frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, black).</p>

<p>To summarize the robustness with which a periodic connectivity pattern is produced under different conditions, we define <italic>robustness</italic> to be the ratio of the power spectrum amplitude at its peak to the total power in the discretized power spectrum (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Methods</xref>). All robustness measures are plotted in comparison to a reference value, which we take to be the mean robustness when parameters yielded a clear periodic connectivity pattern. Here, simulations with a 0.1 s burst duration were used as the reference. The robustness is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4C</xref> for simulations using burst durations from 0.03 s to 5 s (black circles). In agreement with the shapes of the power spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, the robustness is relatively high for burst durations in the range 0.1–0.5 s, and relatively low outside of this range.

<p>Additional contributions to wave-related correlations can arise from the noisy mechanisms of wave and spike generation during early development, which may deliver waves in quick succession as well as generate non-wave related input spikes.

<title>Sensitivity of the connectivity pattern to noise</title>
<p>Thus far, we have tested theoretical predictions using idealized wavefronts. In reality, spontaneous and sensory driven waves exist among continuous background activity and travel with variable wave speeds. Here, we use simulations to establish the sensitivity of pattern formation to these sources of noise. To examine the effect of variable wave speed, we conducted a set of simulations in which a new speed was assigned to each wave from a lognormal distribution, with a mean of 4 mm/s and standard deviation (SD) <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub>. We imposed a minimum speed of 0.05 mm/s so that waves would not take too long to traverse the input layer. Examples of the evolving connectivity pattern in these simulations are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, we plot the mean power spectra of the final connectivity patterns for <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub> = 0.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mm/s. An unexpected feature of the resulting connectivity patterns was a decrease in the spatial frequency with increasing <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub> (orange: <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub> = 0.0 Hz, cyan: <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub> = 2.0 Hz, black: <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub> = 4.0 Hz). In these simulations, the developing connectivity pattern may experience a greater influence from the faster waves that recruit more input neurons per unit time and thus drive higher output firing rates. This would correspond to our earlier results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g002">Fig 2</xref>, for which we showed that lower spatial frequencies are associated with higher wave speeds. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g005">Fig 5E</xref>, we plot the robustness of the connectivity pattern to variation in wave speed, where we have referenced robustness to the case when <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub> = 0. Despite the variation in wave speed, which corresponds to there being a spectrum of spatial frequencies impressed on the network, the connectivity retains a reasonably robust periodic structure.</p>

<p>We next tested the robustness of periodic connectivity patterning to the presence of background spiking noise, which diminishes the relative contribution of wave-activity to <italic>C</italic>(<italic>x</italic>,Δ<italic>t</italic>) in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e005">Eq 3</xref>. To implement background noise in the simulation, input neurons that were not participating in a wave fired spontaneous spikes with a firing rate of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>, which was varied between simulations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Methods</xref>). Examples of the evolving connectivity patterns are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g005">Fig 5B</xref> (top row) for different background firing rates. Mean power spectra of the final connectivity patterns when <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.0 (cyan), 1.0 (orange) and 2.0 Hz (black) are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, and show little variation in the dominant spatial frequency when <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> &lt; 2.0 Hz. However, the robustness degraded substantially when <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> ≥ 2.0 Hz (black circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, reference case <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0 Hz). In these simulations, a new wave traversed the input layer every 10 s, but the burst duration was only 0.1 s. Therefore, the ratio of wave-related spikes to background spikes, rather than the background rate, might better parameterize when the connectivity pattern will be robust. In this case, periodic patterns lacked robustness when the ratio went below approximately 1:4. Accordingly, the robustness could be significantly enhanced for almost all background rates by increasing the firing rate during a wave burst to 100 Hz. In this case, the robustness degraded substantially when <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> ≥ 4 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, bottom row; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, grey circles). During early, spontaneous waves, low background firing rates are typical, and there is good reason to believe that background firing rates are low in early stages of sensory processing as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref045">45</xref>]. We review more evidence for this in the Discussion.</p>
<p>Spike-spike correlations induced by the wavefront, rather than time averaged firing rates, are the driving force behind periodic patterning in our model. Additional sources of spike-spike correlations may therefore disrupt periodic patterning. We conducted a set of simulations in which inputs experienced instantaneous correlations with their neighbors (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Methods</xref>) while also varying the background firing rate. With non-zero background rates, increasing the correlation strength does indeed degrade the robustness of the periodic connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, orange circles), referenced to simulations with no local correlations and <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.0 Hz. In the absence of background spiking, however, the additional local correlations act to enhance the robustness. Typically, correlations are not instantaneous but decay over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref049">49</xref>] and thus would have a reduced impact on plasticity due to the decaying amplitude of the STDP rules around Δ<italic>t</italic> = 0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref018">18</xref>].</p>

<title>Sensitivity of the connectivity pattern to multiple, non-isolated waves</title>
<p>The intervals between consecutive spontaneous waves can be very variable, and inter-wave intervals (IWIs) cover a broad range, from approximately 100 ms in the cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref008">8</xref>] to tens of seconds in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref050">50</xref>]. IWIs during sensory driven waves may also be highly variable, and are likely to match the temporal pattern of naturally occurring stimulus features to which a population of input neurons are tuned. During vision, for example, multiple luminance contours can be cast across the retina in quick succession when tracking a moving object. In the following, we investigate how the presence of multiple waves, which simultaneously drive spiking in the output neuron, impact the development of the connectivity pattern. In so doing, we test our assumption in the above derivation that waves be sufficiently isolated in time.</p>
<p>We ran a set of simulations in which waves were generated with an approximately lognormal distribution of IWIs and varied the mean IWI, <italic>μ</italic><sub>IWI</sub>, between simulations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Methods</xref>). At a speed of 4 mm/s, waves took 2.5 s to traverse the input layer. Thus, to ensure that multiple waves were present for the majority of the simulation, we set <italic>μ</italic><sub>IWI</sub> ≤ 2.0 s across the set of simulations.</p>
<p>Despite multiple waves driving the output cell, periodic connectivity patterns emerged in the simulations, examples of which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g006">Fig 6A</xref> (left and center panels). Power spectra of the connectivity patterns had distinct peaks near the predicted spatial frequency (0.91 cycles/mm) for <italic>μ</italic><sub>IWI</sub> as short as 0.5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The connectivity pattern began to degrade for <italic>μ</italic><sub>IWI</sub> &lt; 0.5 s, and had little structure when <italic>μ</italic><sub>IWI</sub> ≤ 0.2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, right panel), with power spread broadly across the spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The loss of robustness with decreasing <italic>μ</italic><sub>IWI</sub> is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g006">Fig 6E</xref> (black circles), where robustness is referenced to simulations in which a constant IWI of 5 s was used, thus ensuring that only one wave was present at a time.</p>

<p>The loss of robustness with decreasing <italic>μ</italic><sub>IWI</sub> may be related to our requirement in the above derivation that waves be sufficiently isolated in time, with Δ<italic>T</italic> &gt; 2𝓚, where Δ<italic>T</italic> can be interpreted as the IWI and 𝓚 as half the temporal width of the STPD rule. Although 𝓚 is not precisely defined, values in the range 0.1–0.3 s would be reasonable for the STDP rule used here, for which the decay time of the longer, negative lobe was <italic>τ</italic><sub>−</sub> = 0.04 s. An alternative explanation might be that successive waves with very short IWIs are not very different from single waves with long burst durations, as far as the timing precision of the STDP rule is concerned. Because the burst duration also influences robustness, these two possible factors would be difficult to disentangle, and efforts to do so go beyond the scope of this study. The important qualitative result is that, above a lower limit to the mean IWI of only a few tenths of a second, the succession of randomly occurring waves does not greatly degrade the robustness of periodic connectivity patterns.</p>
<p>We next asked whether a constant IWI between waves, which would contribute a strong frequency component to <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004422.e055"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004422.e055g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004422.e055"/><mml:math id="M55" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi> <mml:mo accent="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo> <mml:mi>k</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, would lead to a similar degradation in robustness with decreasing IWI. Because wavefronts of activity in the retina readily track moving luminance edges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref007">7</xref>], regular waves could correspond to stimulation of the retina by luminance gratings, as used in experiments studying the development of orientation and direction selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref051">51</xref>]. We ran simulations in which waves traversed the inputs in a periodic fashion, with a constant IWI, but otherwise used the same parameters as for the simulations with irregular waves. Examples of the periodic patterns that developed for different IWIs are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, and their power spectra are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g006">Fig 6D</xref>. It is clear that regular waves built robust periodic patterns, even with the shortest IWIs. Our robustness measure confirmed that this was the case across all of the IWIs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, grey circles). In addition to the enhanced robustness, a distinct feature of the connectivity patterns with constant IWIs is the shift towards higher spatial frequencies for short IWIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, power spectra for IWIs of 0.2 s and 0.15 s).</p>
<p>The emergence of robust periodic connectivity patterns, with increased spatial frequencies for fixed IWIs ≤ 0.2 s, appears at odds with our theoretical predictions. However, these features can be easily accounted for by considering how <italic>κ</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is constructed in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e011">Eq 7</xref>.

<p>The strong dependence of the spatial frequency on the IWI for short IWIs only, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g006">Fig 6F and 6G</xref>, suggests a critical value for the IWI. We can relate the critical value to the time taken for a wave to travel a distance equal to one cycle of the periodic pattern: IWI<sub>crit</sub> = 1/<italic>vk</italic>* ≈ 0.27 s. That is to say, when IWI &lt; IWI<sub>crit</sub>, the spatial frequency with which waves are lined up along the input layer exceeds the dominant spatial frequency of <italic>κ</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) for a wave in isolation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s004">S2 Fig</xref>). This interpretation fits well with our assumption in the derivation that waves be sufficiently isolated in time (and therefore isolated in space). Moreover, the existence of a critical IWI provides a means for quantifying 𝓚, and thus provides a possible explanation for the degradation in robustness when <italic>μ</italic><sub>IWI</sub> ≤ 0.3 s in the simulations with irregular waves.</p>

<title>Traveling waves are instructive for shaping receptive fields via spike-timing dependent plasticity</title>
<p>The filtering properties of a RF result from feedforward and recurrent synaptic inputs to the neuron, as well as its intrinsic cell properties. In this section, we used simulations of spiking neurons to examine whether the interaction of traveling waves and STDP rules, which can impose spatially periodic connectivity patterns on a uniform field of synaptic strengths (shown above), might be a plausible mechanism for shaping the feedforward component of RFs. As such, a RF in our model refers to the spatial pattern of synaptic strengths impinging on the output neuron from a small region of the input layer. During development, coarse RFs are thought to be set up by molecular cues before activity dependent refinement takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref052">52</xref>]. Therefore, at the beginning of each simulation, we set synapses from the center of the input layer to maximum strength and the remaining synapses to zero, thus endowing the output neuron with an initial RF having a diameter, <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub>. Despite this restricted initial arrangement of synaptic strengths, we found that a periodic pattern would nevertheless emerge across the entire input array (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s005">S3 Fig</xref>). This outcome is not typical of the brain, as topographic maps and the limited size of axonal arbors and dendritic trees restrict the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs to a neuron. We therefore applied an arbor function (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Methods</xref>) that was centered in the middle of the input layer and spanned a region greater than <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub>. Synapses that were outside the arbor were disconnected from the output neuron and prevented from strengthening. A schematic of this new network architecture is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7A</xref>. In the majority of the following simulations, we set <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.8 mm, which approximates an area of retina that corresponds to RF sizes in developing areas of the visual system, including the cat primary visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref054">54</xref>], the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in ferrets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref056">56</xref>], and the superior colliculus (SC) in adult mice that have had disrupted retinal waves. The conversion between RF size and retinal distance is described in the Methods. Furthermore, in the remaining sections, we increase the bias for synaptic weakening in the asymmetric STDP rule from <italic>A</italic><sub>−</sub> = 0.51 to <italic>A</italic><sub>−</sub> = 0.55, which is useful for RF refinement. Later, we examine the influence of this bias in greater detail.</p>

<p>By interpreting the output neuron RF as a single cycle in the type of periodic connectivity patterns obtained above, we are able to examine how properties such as the wave speed and the STDP time scale may shape RF development by controlling the characteristic wavelength, 1/<italic>k</italic>*, of the connectivity pattern. Depending on the size of 1/<italic>k</italic>* with respect to <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub>, one of three modes of RF modification were observed. In one set of simulations, the RF became larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, left), smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, middle) or split into subfields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, right) with progressively slower wave speeds and thus shorter characteristic wavelengths. The same modes of RF modification were achieved by decreasing the STDP time scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) and holding the wave speed constant. If instead of changing <italic>k</italic>* we increased <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub>, keeping the wave speed and STDP rule fixed, the RFs were similarly modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Thus, characteristic wavelengths that are long relative to <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub> caused the RF to grow, shorter wavelengths caused the RF to shrink, and even shorter wavelengths enabled multiple cycles of the periodic pattern to form within the arbor.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that 1/<italic>k</italic>* in fact determines the size of the final RF, or each subfield. To verify this, we varied <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub> from 0.2 mm to 3.2 mm between simulations, with the wave speed and STDP rule fixed, and looked for the convergence of RF sizes, which we measured as the number of synapses with strengths &gt; 0.5. To accommodate <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub>, the width of the arbor function was set to the larger of 0.8 mm or <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub>+0.4 mm. RF sizes converged to one of three sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7E</xref>), depending on whether the RF maintained a single field (purple), or split into two (yellow) or three (blue) subfields. The larger <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub>, the more subfields that emerged. Regardless of <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub>, the mean final size of each subfield was approximately the same. Integer multiples of the mean subfield size (measured from RFs with three subfields) are drawn on the right of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7E</xref> to illustrate this fact. Small biases were evident, however, whereby larger values of <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub> tended to give rise to larger RFs or subfields. This considered, the final number of strong synapses were easily distinguishable between cases in which one, two or three subfields developed. Thus, the size and shape of the final RF tightly corresponds with the wave, STDP and initial RF properties.</p>

<p>We showed above, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>, that different wave and STDP parameter combinations could yield the same mode of RF modification, including RF expansion, contraction, or splitting.

<p>In the refinement phase space, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, there is a region (shaded blue) corresponding to <italic>v</italic> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> parameters that caused the RF to contract, with darker shades of blue indicating greater contraction, measured as a percentage of <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub>. In the region labelled <italic>α</italic> (unshaded), at which <italic>κ</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) has higher characteristic spatial frequencies, RFs split into subfields. In the region labelled <italic>β</italic> (unshaded), at which spatial frequencies are lower, RFs expanded. Overlaid are the iso-frequency contours of the predicted spatial frequencies, <italic>k</italic>*, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g003">Fig 3</xref>. The boundaries between each mode of RF modification closely follow the iso-frequency contours, with greater RF contraction (darker shades) occurring at higher spatial frequencies. Because the outcome of the final RF depends on the initial RF size, we recomputed the refinement phase space, setting <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.44 mm, which just exceeded the smallest size of RFs after contracting in solutions when <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.8 mm. For <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.44 mm, the region of phase space in which RFs contracted (colored purple) corresponded to slower wave speeds and shorter STDP time constants, i.e. higher spatial frequencies in <italic>κ</italic>(<italic>x</italic>). Taken together, these results confirm that smaller initial RF sizes require higher spatial frequencies in <italic>κ</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) to achieve a particular mode of RF modification. The area of the blue and purple regions of phase space also show that, in order for RFs to be refined to a smaller size by the asymmetric STDP rule, the maximum possible wave speed can be just over a factor of two times greater than the minimum possible wave speed. At least the same range in <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> can also enable RF contraction. Thus, the mechanism of RF contraction described here allows for some variation in STDP properties between synapses, variation in wave speed, or even fluctuations in both of these phenomena over time.</p>
<p>An interesting corollary of these results is that changes in wave speed and STDP properties can follow changes in RF size, thus allowing continued contraction beyond that of a fixed <italic>v</italic> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> combination. To demonstrate this point, we ran a simulation using the same parameters as those used for the central panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7B and 7D</xref>. However, once the RF had refined to a smaller size, we decreased the wave speed from 4 mm/s to 2.5 mm/s. Note that, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, <italic>v</italic> = 2.5 mm/s and <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> = 20 ms would cause a RF with <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.8 mm to split into subfields, as this point in the phase space lies to the lower left of the blue shaded region. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, an initial period of contraction with <italic>v</italic> = 4 mm/s set up further contraction, after a decrease in wave speed to <italic>v</italic> = 2.5 mm/s, without splitting the RF into subfields. Increasing the wave speed back to 4 mm/s at a later time caused the RF to expand and return to its previous size. Analogously, changes in the time constants of STDP can achieve the same effect.</p>
<p>The phase diagram corresponds very well with the simulation results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7</xref>, confirming our hypothesis that <italic>κ</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) and <italic>RF</italic><sub>0</sub> jointly determine the final shape and size of the RF. This was not unique to the asymmetric STDP rule. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, we show a similar correspondence between refinement and the iso-frequency contours for a symmetric STDP rule.</p>
<p>Tuning the characteristic wavelength by itself was not sufficient to achieve RF contraction. In addition, both asymmetric and symmetric STDP rules required a bias towards synaptic weakening. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g008">Fig 8E</xref>, we plot the refinement phase space of a 0.8 mm RF for three asymmetric STDP rules that differed only in <italic>A</italic><sub>−</sub>, which scaled the amplitude of the negative lobe in the rule.

To test this, we generated wave stimuli in a 2D input layer consisting of 64×64 units arranged on a square lattice. Plane waves were generated in a similar fashion to the 1D scenario, moving with a constant speed in alternating directions, from one side of the input layer to the opposite side with a wave speed of 4 mm/s. The single output neuron was provided with an initial, circular RF 0.8 mm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, left panel), and synapses were modified by an asymmetric STDP rule (<italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> = 20 ms). When plane waves travelled along just one axis, the RF contracted along the same axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g009">Fig 9A</xref>; top panels: waves travel along the horizontal axis; bottom panels: waves travel along the vertical axis), corresponding with the 1D results above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). However, the RF grew along the orthogonal axis until it spanned the full extent of the arbor. This corresponds with an effectively infinite wave speed along the orthogonal axis, resulting in a periodic pattern with a spatial frequency of zero.</p>

<p>Exposing the network to a reduced set of wave directions in this way can be used to build RFs that exhibit periodic structure along the same directions. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s006">S4 Fig</xref>, we provide examples of RFs that developed when waves traveled in both directions along one, two and three axes.

<p>When waves travelled in 16 possible directions, equally spaced around the compass and in a random sequence, the final RF maintained an approximately circular shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, left). However, using the same wave and STDP properties as for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, the RF area increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, dark blue) because contraction along the axis parallel to the wave direction was outweighed by expansion along the orthogonal axis. RF expansion could be counteracted by changing parameters that enhance contraction, as explained in the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g008">Fig 8</xref>. Thus, increasing <italic>k</italic>* by decreasing the wave speed to 3 mm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, middle), or increasing the amplitude for synaptic weakening in the STDP rule from <italic>A</italic><sub>−</sub> = 0.55 to <italic>A</italic><sub>−</sub> = 0.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, right), caused RFs to contract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, light blue and purple, respectively). This shows that the principle of using STDP and traveling waves to refine a RF extends from 1D to 2D networks for simple, idealized waves. In the following section, we will examine how this process holds up when waves follow more irregular and complex trajectories.</p>

<title>Refinement of receptive fields by complex wave patterns</title>
<p>To test the robustness of refinement under conditions in which waves are far from idealized plane waves moving with a constant velocity, we used a wave model developed by Feller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref039">39</xref>] to generate complex wave patterns in the input layer. In the Feller et al. model, waves are generated spontaneously in random locations, and propagate along winding trajectories on a 2D input layer (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Methods</xref>). Due to the complexity of the model, it was not possible to set a precise wave speed. We therefore controlled the mean wave speed by temporally rescaling precomputed wave patterns, and measuring the speeds of waves that were isolated by a center of mass (COM) tracking algorithm (Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s009">S7 Fig</xref>). In this way, we generated slow, medium and fast waves with speeds of 1.29±0.01 mm/s, 2.58±0.02 mm/s and 3.87±0.03 mm/s (mean ± SEM), respectively. Examples of two isolated waves are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g010">Fig 10A</xref>, and a 90 s movie of isolated waves is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s001">S1 Movie</xref>.</p>

<p>Using these rescaled wave patterns as input to simulations of RF development, we found that, quite remarkably, complex waves could shape and refine RFs in much the same manner as simple plane waves. With an asymmetric STDP rule and holding <italic>t</italic><sub>+</sub> = 20 ms fixed, RFs could be made to expand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g010">Fig 10B</xref>, left), contract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g010">Fig 10B</xref>, center) or split into subfields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g010">Fig 10B</xref>, right) by the fast, medium and slow complex waves, respectively. Although slow waves did not always split the RF, the final RF area was always smaller with slow waves than with medium wave speeds. The evolution of the RF area during the simulation, averaged over repeated trials, is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g010">Fig 10C</xref> for the different wave speeds (solid: fast waves; dashed: medium waves; dotted: slow waves). Similarly, STDP rules with shorter STDP time scales produced RFs with smaller areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g010">Fig 10D and 10E</xref>), corresponding to a shorter characteristic wavelength in a periodic connectivity pattern. These results recapitulate the dependence of RF development on wave speed and STDP time scales, even when the input wave patterns followed complex and noisy trajectories.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we examined how spatiotemporal correlations in traveling waves, a prominent feature of activity in the developing nervous system, could in principle interact with Hebbian STDP to instruct neural circuit development. Building upon previous studies of the interaction of STDP with correlated activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref021">21</xref>], we have identified a novel process by which traveling waves are able to establish and refine highly structured connectivity patterns in neural circuits. Specifically, our analysis has led to the following major results: 1) common examples of experimentally observed STDP build periodic patterns into feedforward networks when driven by traveling waves; 2) the spatial frequency of the periodic pattern scales with the wave speed and characteristic time scale of the STDP rule; 3) robust periodic connectivity patterns are produced only when the duration of the wave-related burst falls within a range that depends on the time scale of the STDP rule; the longer the burst duration, the longer the time scale of STDP must be to yield robust periodic patterns; 4) periodic patterning is robust to variability in the wave speed and wave frequency, but is lost if the ratio of non-wave spikes to wave-spikes becomes too high; 5) the shape and size of a RF can be modified by the spatial frequency imposed upon it by the wave-STDP interaction. Below, we discuss in greater detail how our results build upon previous work, and reflect on their application to experimentally observed wave phenomena and circuit refinement. We point out predictions from our model that may be tested using existing experimental paradigms, and suggest how our results may be extended in future work.</p>
<sec id="sec016">
<title>Pattern formation in the brain and biology</title>
<p>Our theoretical results, expressed in Eqs <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e010">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004422.e017">9</xref>, are analogous to those derived by Swindale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref035">35</xref>], who modeled the development of ocular dominance columns in primary visual cortex. Swindale showed that short range excitatory and long range inhibitory lateral interactions could give rise to the spatially periodic dominance of eye specific afferents across primary visual cortex, a principle also used to model the development of orientation columns in visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref057">57</xref>]. In our model, the lateral interactions between synapses that are necessary for pattern formation result from the timing dependence of STDP, which is mapped onto space by the spatiotemporal correlations of traveling waves. Pattern formation of this kind is analogous to a Turing instability in reaction-diffusion systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref029">29</xref>], which has been applied to diverse cases of biological pattern formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref031">31</xref>]. A useful recipe for Turing-like pattern formation includes the presence of a diffusible activator and inhibitor, whereby the inhibitor diffuses over greater distances than the activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref030">30</xref>]. STDP rules emulate this feature if <italic>τ</italic><sub>−</sub> &gt; <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub>, i.e. the temporal window for synaptic weakening is longer than that for synaptic strengthening. Such STDP rules are widely reported throughout the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref058">58</xref>]. In the alternative scenario, when <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> &gt; <italic>τ</italic><sub>−</sub>, we found that STDP tends to weaken local regions of synapses that had strengthened by chance, preventing islands of strong synapses from forming. It is not impossible, however, for periodic patterns to form when <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> &gt; <italic>τ</italic><sub>−</sub>, so long as we carefully choose <italic>A</italic><sub>+</sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub>−</sub>, which control the overall bias for strengthening and weakening. However, we found that the stability of the pattern is very sensitive to small changes in <italic>A</italic><sub>+</sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub>−</sub> in this case.</p>

<title>Influence of input correlations and synaptic competition on refinement</title>
<p>Models of circuit development by Hebbian plasticity require constraints on the synapses so as to keep their strengths within biologically realistic bounds. A suitable choice of constraint, such as subtractive normalization, provides competition between synapses so that when a subset of synapses strengthen, all other synapses are suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref060">60</xref>]. Under this constraint, correlations between nearby inputs over short temporal windows encourage a localized group of synapses to strengthen, yielding a RF-like connectivity pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref011">11</xref>]. This is because synapses separated by larger distances are uncorrelated within short temporal windows, so are rarely strengthened but are often weakened together. STDP rules that are biased for synaptic weakening can achieve this type of competition between uncorrelated synapses, and are therefore capable of building RF-like connectivity patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref018">18</xref>]. However, this competitive process is fundamentally different to the mechanism by which STDP builds structured connectivity patterns in this paper. We recognize that a single wave can induce strong correlations between any two input neurons that it passes, irrespective of their separation. They will be correlated with a specific time lag, Δ<italic>t</italic>, which scales with the separation, Δ<italic>x</italic>, between the two inputs as Δ<italic>x</italic> = <italic>v</italic>Δ<italic>t</italic>. If Δ<italic>t</italic> corresponds to synaptic weakening in the STDP rule, the synapses of the two input neurons will compete as a result of their strong correlations. Note that waves cannot produce periodic connectivity patterns if synaptic weakening does not have a particular dependence on timing, for example when competition is provided by subtractive normalization, as this will not yield the bandpass filtering that we have demonstrated for experimentally observed STDP rules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This underlies why the wave speed, and the range of Δ<italic>t</italic> values for which the STDP rule specifies synaptic weakening or strengthening, determines the resulting spatial frequency of the connectivity pattern, and therefore influences the type of modification experienced by a RF.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g005">Fig 5</xref>, we showed how contributions to the correlation function that are not wave-related act to degrade the periodic connectivity pattern. The strength of wave-related correlations may be further suppressed by recurrent inputs arriving from other postsynaptic cells, which we have excluded from our model. Output spikes that are driven by recurrent activity are likely to be much less correlated with spikes in the input layer and will therefore contribute an approximately constant term to the correlation function, <italic>C</italic>(<italic>x</italic>,Δ<italic>t</italic>), the effect of which will be to emphasize any bias in the STDP rule towards synaptic weakening or strengthening. Moreover, excitatory recurrent connections are well known for encouraging similarities between postsynaptic RF properties, whereas inhibitory connections are known to decorrelate RFs, without drastically changing the basic RF properties of individual postsynaptic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref063">63</xref>].</p>
<p>Increasing the bias for synaptic weakening in our simulations enhanced the degree to which RFs could be refined to a smaller size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). A bias for weakening in STDP is frequently observed in experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref064">64</xref>], but is not the only possible source of synaptic competition, which can also be achieved by homeostatic regulation and intrinsic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref066">66</xref>]. As mentioned above, these additional sources of competition would not aid pattern formation if they do not have the appropriate spike timing dependence that yields bandpass filtering as do the STDP rules used in this study.</p>

<title>Previous STDP models with space-time inseparable inputs</title>
<p>Several studies have previously explored the interaction between space-time inseparable input patterns and STDP. They demonstrated how motion stimuli can act through asymmetric STDP rules to impart an asymmetry in the spatial profile of excitatory connection strengths. This can be utilized to endow a network with direction selectivity similar to that found in the visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref028">28</xref>]. Through our analytical results, we have shown that this phenomenon is one component of a richer set of dynamics with which the connectivity pattern can evolve under space-time inseparable inputs. Specifically, synaptic strengths are modified according to the convolution of the spatially mapped STDP rule, <italic>κ</italic>(<italic>x</italic>), with the synaptic strengths, <italic>w</italic>(<italic>x</italic>). Because of this convolution, the imaginary component of <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004422.e069"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004422.e069g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004422.e069"/><mml:math id="M69" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi> <mml:mo accent="true">~</mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo> <mml:mi>k</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> results in spatial shifts, whereas the real component results in the emergence of a periodic connectivity pattern. It is possible that periodic patterning was occluded in previous modeling studies due to the setup of those models for the specific application to the development of direction selectivity.</p>

<title>Patterning and refinement by retinal waves</title>
<p>Retinal waves have been reported in the developing retina of several species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref071">71</xref>], suggesting that they play an important developmental role that has been conserved over the course of evolution. In mice, for example, disrupting normal retinal wave propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref072">72</xref>] has a profound effect on the refinement of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) afferents to, and RFs in, superior colliculus (SC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref073">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref074">74</xref>]. One way in which retinal waves may drive this refinement is by imposing a wavelength onto the spatial structure of retinocollicular connections. To illustrate the relationship between RF sizes in SC, retinal wave speeds and STDP time scales, we computed the landscape of dominant spatial frequencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s007">S5 Fig</xref>) as a function of <italic>v</italic> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub>, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g003">Fig 3</xref>, but using a typical retinal wave burst duration of 2 s for <italic>α</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref043">43</xref>]. Retinal waves travel at relatively slow speeds of 0.1–0.2 mm/s, such that if the STDP rule at retinocollicular synapses is asymmetric with <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> = 20 ms, the characteristic wavelength would be 1/<italic>k</italic>* ≈ 0.09 mm (solid red rectangle in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s007">S5 Fig</xref>). By interpreting a RF as half a cycle in the periodic pattern, a wavelength of 0.09 mm corresponds to a RF size in mice of 1.8°, using the distance to visual angle conversion in Methods. This is much smaller than the reported RF sizes of ∼10° [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref074">74</xref>]. In order to obtain RFs ∼10° in diameter (equivalent to a wavelength of 0.51 mm) with slow retinal waves, the STDP time scale would have to be <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> = 0.15 s (dashed red rectangle in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s007">S5 Fig</xref>), almost an order of magnitude longer than time scales commonly reported in STDP studies. The long duration of retinal wave bursts imposes an additional constraint on the minimum STDP time scale. We showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4</xref> that, when <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> = 20 ms, periodic patterning degraded when the burst duration exceeded 0.5 s. However, as the STDP time scale increases, so too should the limiting burst duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Assuming that the limit imposed by the burst duration scales linearly with <italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> suggests that a STDP time constant exceeding 0.1 s should operate at retinocollicular synapses during retinal waves.</p>
<p>Our prediction of long STDP time scales at developing retinofugal synapses supports previous work by Butts and Rokhsar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref041">41</xref>], who showed that retinal waves convey the most information about the relative retinotopic positions of RGCs over time scales ranging 0.1–2 s. This was further supported by the observation of such a rule at developing retinogeniculate synapses in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref044">44</xref>]. Evidence for long STDP time scales was recently provided in the visual cortex of mice that had a greater than normal expression of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) with NR2B subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref075">75</xref>]. The STDP rule in these animals was temporally asymmetric, but was sensitive to remarkably long spike time differences greater than 0.1 s. NR2B expression is high during the stage of development when retinal waves are important for refinement, which in mice is the first postnatal week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref052">52</xref>]. Thereafter, the number of NR2B containing NMDARs reduces, being replaced by faster acting NR2A containing NMDARs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref076">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref077">77</xref>]. The change in NMDAR composition may explain why many STDP studies in mice, which are typically conducted in the second or third postnatal week of development, reveal STDP rules with time scales not much longer than 20 ms. We speculate that such developmental changes in NMDAR composition may provide a gradual reduction in STDP time scales that enables greater levels of refinement, as we demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g008">Fig 8B-8C</xref>. The effect of this developmental progression may be complemented by the observed reduction in wave speeds in mice during the same period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref043">43</xref>]. Our results describe a potentially important role for these phenomena in refinement, which can be examined experimentally.</p>
<p>The noisy mechanism of wave generation in the developing retina adds considerable variability to the size of retinal waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref039">39</xref>]. In our model, it is important that the total distance travelled by a wave exceeds the characteristic wavelength, 1/<italic>k</italic>*. This is the spatial analog of requiring the wave duration to exceed the time scales of STDP in our analytical derivation. Our calculation above therefore suggests that retinal waves should travel distances greater than 0.51 mm in order to produce RFs 10° in diameter in the mouse SC. By tracking the center of mass of experimentally recorded retinal waves, Maccione et al. showed that a substantial majority of retinal waves indeed exceeded this distance throughout the period of major retinocollicular refinement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>Taken together, experimentally recorded retinal waves exhibit many of the properties required for retinocollicular refinement by a periodic patterning process. However, whether the mode of synaptic plasticity at retinocollicular synapses is suitable for this process has yet to be determined.</p>

<title>Suitability of traveling waves for refinement in other brain areas</title>
<p>Traveling waves occur in many different parts of the brain, and each location will have particular constraints that limit the types of patterns that could form based on the interaction with STPD rules. As discussed above, one constraint is the characteristic wavelength, 1/<italic>k</italic>*, which sets a lower bound to the distance traveled by waves if periodic patterning is to be achieved. We computed the characteristic wavelengths associated with waves in brain areas other than the retina—including the cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus—and list them in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004422.t001">Table 1</xref>, under the assumption of an asymmetric STDP rule like that used in many of the results above (<italic>τ</italic><sub>+</sub> = 20 ms), and which is reported widely throughout the brain. The speeds of waves in these areas are 1–2 orders of magnitude faster than retinal waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref009">9</xref>], but yield characteristic wavelengths that are similar in scale to that required for RFs in SC because of the short STDP time scale (first four entries in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004422.t001">Table 1</xref>). Fast wave speeds and short STDP time scales place these waves in a region near the bottom right hand corner of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g003">Fig 3A</xref> (solid red rectangle), assuming a burst duration of 0.1 s. Also listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004422.t001">Table 1</xref> are the maximum distances over which the waves in different areas may propagate. Comparing these distances with the characteristic wavelengths reveals that periodic patterning in the efferents of the cerebellum, dorsal cortex and ventral cortex would not be expected, as the maximum possible propagation distance is close to or less than the lower bound set by 1/<italic>k</italic>*. However, wave properties in the hippocampus, as in the retina, do satisfy the minimum distance constraint for the type of STDP rule assumed. More detailed analyses of waves in the hippocampus and STDP at its efferent synapses is necessary to determine whether these phenomena could drive periodic patterning in a manner useful for development.</p>

<title>Development of cortical receptive fields</title>
<p>RFs of simple cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) exhibit weak selectivity for orientated features in the visual environment at the onset of vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref078">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref080">80</xref>] and become more selective with visual experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref079">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref081">81</xref>]. Yet when an animal is raised in an environment comprising a restricted range of oriented contours, RF selectivity matures for those same orientations but not others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref079">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref084">84</xref>]. A key feature of orientation tuned simple cell RFs is their composition of ON and OFF subfields, which are respectively sensitive to increments and decrements in luminosity, and are thought to reflect the visuotopic organization of ON and OFF inputs from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref085">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref086">86</xref>]. The orientation of these subfields is thought to confer the orientation preference of the simple cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref085">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref086">86</xref>]. However, it is not clear whether oriented features in the environment instruct the development of orientation selectivity, or whether they permit the maturation of RFs that are already selective for the same orientations. The spatial frequency tuning of simple cells may help to resolve this question, as it is well predicted by the periodic structure of ON and OFF subfields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref087">87</xref>]. One model of simple cell RF development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref057">57</xref>] posits that spatial frequency tuning is determined by the structure of spatial correlations between LGN cells. However, the necessary correlations were not observed in the developing LGN in later experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref088">88</xref>]. Other models inspired by sparse coding schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref089">89</xref>] posit that simple cell RFs result from learning the independent components of natural visual scenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref090">90</xref>], a consequence of which is that RFs would exhibit tuning for velocity and spatial frequency with an inversely proportional relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref091">91</xref>]. However, despite recent insights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref063">63</xref>], it is not yet well established how sparse coding is implemented in biological circuits.</p>
<p>Our results provide an alternative mechanism for simple cell RF development. We have shown how oriented wavefronts can build orientated RFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g009">Fig 9A</xref>), and how the same process can develop multiple, periodic subfields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g007">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s006">S4A Fig</xref>), akin to the ON and OFF subfields of simple cells, thus providing a means for spatial frequency tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Moreover, our prediction of an inverse relationship between the wave speed and spatial frequency of the connectivity pattern provides a novel test for the role of visual experience in shaping simple cell development, and bares striking similarity to the sparse coding schemes mentioned above. Using stimuli that consist of high contrast luminance contours to elicit wave-like activity in the retina and LGN may help to test our predictions, and experimental protocols using such stimuli with young animals are already well established (for example, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref092">92</xref>]).</p>
<p>We can use our model to predict a range of plausible STDP parameters that would build RFs with the spatial frequency tuning of simple cells. In adult cats, spatial frequency tuning ranges from ∼0.2–2 cycles/° within eccentricities of ±15° [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref093">93</xref>]. We further constrain the model by considering wave speeds that match the velocity tuning of cat simple cells (∼0.5–20°/s, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref094">94</xref>]). In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s008">S6 Fig</xref>, we illustrate the spatial frequencies that are obtained in selected parts of this large STDP parameter space. Assuming an asymmetric STDP rule in the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref095">95</xref>], realistic spatial frequencies can be obtained with STDP time scales ranging ∼1–100ms, and biases for synaptic weakening in the approximate range 0.3 ≲ <italic>A</italic><sub>-</sub>/<italic>A</italic><sub>+</sub> ≲ 0.7. Realistically, STDP need not operate over such a wide range of parameters, as variability in the speeds of natural stimuli should explain most of the variability in spatial frequency tuning.</p>
<p>The relationship between temporal correlations and the development of spatially structured connectivity patterns may be extended to other visual RF properties. For example, temporal delays between inputs with spatially offset RFs are the major components needed to build direction selective cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref096">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref097">97</xref>]. This kind of organization, and hence direction selectivity, can be learned with rate-dependent Hebbian plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref062">62</xref>], utilizing diverse response latencies in the LGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref098">98</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref100">100</xref>]. It is feasible that STDP should also yield spatial offsets between inputs with different response latencies, given its Hebbian nature. Combined with the capacity for periodic patterning, we speculate that the interaction of traveling waves with STDP could yield connectivity patterns that are direction selective, as well as orientation and spatial frequency tuned.</p>

<title>Tolerance to background spiking noise</title>
<p>We found that pattern formation in our simulations was sensitive to noise: patterns began to degrade when the ratio of the background spike rate to the wave-induced spike rate became too high. It is therefore essential to consider what is known about background firing rates reported in the literature. We concentrate on background noise in the developing visual system, for which good data are available. During retinal wave activity in mice, retinal ganglion cells rarely spike outside of a burst. However, bursts that occur outside of a wave event have approximately the same firing rate as wave related bursts (Table 1 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref042">42</xref>]). Nevertheless, wave related bursts comprise approximately 90% of all bursts in the developing retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref042">42</xref>], suggesting that background spiking noise would have little impact on wave-induced correlations at this stage of visual development. Retinal waves also drive bursts in the LGN at firing rates of 10 Hz with long intervening periods of quiescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref101">101</xref>]. In later stages of development, visually evoked responses in the LGN reach firing rates of 10 Hz, whereas 1 Hz firing rates are typical of spontaneous activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref102">102</xref>]. This highly skewed distribution of firing rates is recapitulated in the developing visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref103">103</xref>]. Thus, it is likely that, during early developmental periods when RF properties undergo refinement, spontaneous spikes contribute little to the overall activity in the visual system, and that patterned retinal waves and visual stimulation are propagated throughout the early visual system.</p>

<title>Modulation of STDP by other factors</title>
<p>The precise dependence of STDP on spike timing can be sensitive to many factors that can modify the shape of the STDP rule (reviewed extensively in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref014">14</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref058">58</xref>]). Whatever the mechanisms that underly these additional interactions, they must preserve a bandpass dependency on spike times in order for periodic patterns to form. Biophysical models of cellular activity that may underlie STDP have been proposed to account for some of these additional interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref105">105</xref>]. These models rely on the summed pre- and postsynaptic contributions to the intracellular calcium concentration, the amplitude of which at any given time determines whether synapses are strengthened or weakened. As such, the shape of the STDP rule changes for different spike trains and thus would not adhere to the spike-timing dependence that is necessary for bandpass filtering and pattern formation. If pattern formation as outlined in this paper does influence circuit development, then we predict that STDP must maintain a bandpass profile at synapses that mediate wave-like activity patterns. To test this, a typical STDP experimental protocol could be performed, in which paired spike bursts are stimulated in connected pre- and postsynaptic cells over a range of temporal offsets, and the resulting change in synaptic strength measured. A key requirement of such an experiment would be to extend the temporal offsets well beyond the burst durations, in contrast to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref106">106</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref107">107</xref>], so as to detect the full temporal profile of the plasticity rule and ensure that synaptic changes decay to zero with larger offsets. If the bandpass property of synaptic plasticity is present at these synapses, then it should be reflected in the resulting STDP curve. Retinocollicular or geniculocortical synapses would be ideal substrates for testing this.</p>

<title>Future directions</title>
<p>The robustness of our results to various types of noise suggests that pattern formation should also be achieved in more complex models that incorporate details specific to the circuit. The developing visual system provides a promising arena in which to test our theory of pattern formation for the reasons discussed above, and we outline here future work that will facilitate this investigation.</p>
<p>The dominant spatial frequency that characterizes a periodic pattern is strongly influenced by the stimulus response properties of the input neurons, as demonstrated by the effect of the burst duration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Incorporating accurate space- and time-dependent response properties of neurons in the visual pathway, as determined by their spatiotemporal RFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref108">108</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref111">111</xref>], is therefore essential to making accurate predictions about pattern formation in downstream visual targets such as the SC and V1. For theoretical analysis, these features can be easily incorporated by reformulating <italic>α</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) as <italic>α</italic>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>t</italic>) to take account presynaptic RF structures.</p>
<p>Application of our model to simple cell RF development will require modeling both ON and OFF response types in the input layer, which must become spatially segregated as a result of learning. Previous proposals for the mechanism of this segregation typically rely on correlations within each ON or OFF population exceeding those between the two populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref088">88</xref>]. The extent to which STDP will be sensitive to ON and OFF correlations, in addition to the strong spatiotemporal correlations induced by traveling waves, requires further investigation.</p>
<p>The linearity of our current model, though useful for theoretical analysis, prevents RFs from developing an orientation preference when waves travel in multiple directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g009">Fig 9B</xref>), as is the case for retinal waves and natural visual environments. Any bias towards one orientation is eventually averaged away by the influence of waves with other orientations. The addition of a nonlinearity, either in the sensitivity of STDP to the output firing rate, or in the transfer function for the output firing rate itself, should help to break the symmetry in wave directions and bias the RF towards any asymmetric shape that is built into it by chance. In this way, a population of output neurons might be able to acquire different orientation preferences when exposed to the same input pattern. In a similar fashion, a spectrum of spatial frequency preferences could be acquired throughout the population, rather than the uniform preference for a single spatial frequency, as we observed in simulations in which the wave speed was varied.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that traveling waves are just one incarnation of activity patterns that exhibit the space-time inseparable correlations necessary for periodic patterning. Our results may be generalized to any reliable temporal sequence of activity, some examples of which include navigation codes in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref112">112</xref>], pre-motor coding in songbirds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref113">113</xref>], and spontaneous ‘synfire chains’ in the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref114">114</xref>].</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>We model a reduced feedforward network consisting of a presynaptic layer of input neurons and a single postsynaptic output neuron. Traveling waves of activity traverse the input layer and recruit input neurons, which discharge bursts of spikes and provide excitatory synaptic inputs to the output neuron. Each feedforward synapse is modified according to the time delay between spikes from its corresponding input neuron and spikes from the output neuron. A schematic of the network is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004422.g001">Fig 1A</xref>.</p>

<title>Spiking neuron simulation</title>
<p>Our model is simulated using a time step of 1 ms. During each step, a number of processes are simulated. First, input neurons generate spikes from one of two wave models described below. Each input spike elicits in the output neuron an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which is weighted by the synaptic strength. EPSPs modulate the output membrane potential, which determines the generation of output spikes according to either a linear or nonlinear process, described below. Once all spikes have been generated for a given time step, synaptic strengths are modified by a STDP rule.</p>

<title>Traveling waves in the input layer</title>
<p><italic>1D and 2D plane waves</italic></p>
<p>The input layer comprised point neurons, arranged 20 <italic>μ</italic>m apart in a 1D chain or 2D square lattice. Plane waves were always initiated at one edge of the input layer and travelled the entire length to the opposite edge. For most simulations using plane waves, a blank period lasting at least 5 s was inserted between the end of one wave and the beginning of the next so as to allow the postsynaptic activation to decay to zero before the next wave traversed the inputs. The only simulations in which waves were not interleaved with a blank period were those in which the presence of multiple waves was tested.</p>
<p>In most 1D simulations, the wave direction was alternated between each wave. In simulations with multiple waves, the wave direction was alternated after every 100 waves. In the 2D plane wave simulations, the wave direction was selected randomly out of <italic>N</italic> possible directions that were equally spaced around the compass, where <italic>N</italic> was either 2, 4, 6 or 16.</p>
<p>When an input neuron is recruited by the wavefront, it undergoes a burst of spikes. The input firing rate during a burst, <italic>α</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), is modeled as a boxcar function: <italic>α</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>R</italic><sub>in</sub>[<italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)−<italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>−<italic>d</italic>)], where <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the Heaviside step function, <italic>R</italic><sub>in</sub> is the input firing rate, and <italic>d</italic> is the burst duration. During an input burst, spikes were generated in time steps of 1 ms using a Bernoulli process. Unless otherwise stated, <italic>R</italic><sub>in</sub> = 50 Hz.</p>
<p>In some simulations, input neurons were given background firing rates, <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004422.e070"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004422.e070g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004422.e070"/><mml:math id="M70" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">in</mml:mtext> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">bg</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, which are stated in the relevant results sections. In these simulations, the background rate was not added to the firing rate of inputs undergoing a wave-related burst. Otherwise, when an input neuron was not being recruited by a wave, it was silent.</p>
<p>In all cases, we repeated trials of plane wave simulations with the same model parameters 16 times, using different seeds for the random number generators, such that each trial would produce different spike trains. In simulations where a parameter that was normally fixed was instead a random variable, such as the wave speed, or wave direction in the case of 2D plane waves, the random number generator for that random variable was reseeded for repeated trials. Otherwise, the random number generator for spike generation was reseeded. In all cases, original spike sequences were always generated for each trial.</p>
<p><italic>Complex wave patterns</italic></p>
<p>To generate more complex wave patterns in 2D, we implemented a simulation based on a previously published model of spontaneous depolarizations that propagate across the developing mammalian retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref039">39</xref>]. In short, cells in the model that undergo spontaneous depolarizations provide excitatory input to nearby cells, triggering cascades of excitatory synaptic transmission that propagate throughout the network, while strong refractory currents quickly return active cells to the rest state. As such, wavefronts of activity propagate along winding trajectories between refractory domains of the network.</p>
<p>The model comprises a layer of starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and a layer of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Both layers are arranged on 64×64 square lattices with a cell spacing of 34 <italic>μ</italic>m. SACs receive excitatory synaptic input of equal strength from other SACs that are within a radial distance of 120 <italic>μ</italic>m. RGCs also receive excitatory input from SACs over the same distance but do not provide synaptic input to other RGCs or SACs. None of the synapses within the model retina undergo synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>Every cell in the retina model is characterized by a dynamic excitation variable, <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, which is analogous to its membrane potential, for <italic>i</italic> = 1…<italic>N</italic> where <italic>N</italic> is the number of SACs or RGCs.

<title>Analysis of complex wave patterns</title>
<p>To measure the speed and size of simulated complex wave patterns, we analyzed a 2000 s segment of RGC spiking activity from a simulation of the slow waves only, as these waves were less compressed in time and therefore lasted longer, enabling a more accurate measure of the wave properties. Spike times were first converted into a firing rate movie, <italic>M</italic>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>,<italic>t</italic>), with dimensions 64 × 64 × 20000, where the (<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>,<italic>k</italic>)<sup>th</sup> bin in <italic>M</italic> contained the number of spikes fired by a single RGC, at location (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>,<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>), during a 100 ms period, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>During the retinal wave simulation, multiple waves were occasionally present at the same time. Concurrent waves would occasionally collide into or split from each other, but they were mostly well separated in space. We sought to isolate concurrent waves to accurately measure their individual properties, such as speed and size, using a center of mass (COM) tracking algorithm, of which a schematic is drawn in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s009">S7 Fig</xref>.

After smoothing, pixel values below 10 were set to zero. Thus, a single time bin in <italic>M</italic><sub>s</sub> might have several domains of non-zero pixels. To track the COM of different waves, a boundary was drawn around each domain of activity in time bin <italic>k</italic> and the COM within the boundary calculated, where mass refers to the firing rates within the same boundary in <italic>M</italic>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>,<italic>t</italic> = <italic>k</italic>). Two domains, colored blue and orange, and their COMs (purple and green, respectively) are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s009">S7 Fig</xref>, and the firing rates given in greyscale. Each domain was assigned a wave identification number (ID) but, if the COMs at two domains were less than 680 <italic>μ</italic>m apart, they were given the same ID. If the COM of one domain was within a 680 <italic>μ</italic>m radius from the COM of another domain in the previous time bin (purple lines extending from the COM in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004422.s009">S7 Fig</xref>), it was given the same ID. In this way, wave COMs were tracked according to their ID. The COM trajectory of each wave was zero-padded and smoothed in time by a Gaussian filter with a SD of 0.1 s, and the first two and last two COM locations discarded. Thus, wave speeds and sizes were only computed for waves that lasted for more than 0.5 s. We used the path length of a COM trajectory as the distance travelled by a wave, and computed the wave speed from this by dividing it by the time taken to travel that trajectory.</p>
<p>RGCs near the edges of the model retina received fewer lateral inputs from SACs and were less active than those in the centre. Within the central 44 × 44 RGCs, the total level of spiking activity was comparably uniform. Accordingly, waves with a time-averaged centre of mass (COM) that resided in the outer 10 neurons were discarded from any further analysis. Occasionally, small segments of waves were isolated from larger waves. These were discarded from the analysis by removing waves that covered fewer than 1000 space-time bins.</p>
<p>The COM tracking algorithm performed well in separating waves that eventually merged with, or split from, other waves, and allowed us to perform analysis on almost every wave that had a unique ID by removing concurrent waves from that analysis. A total of 797 waves were isolated in the 2000 s segment, of which 779 lasted long enough to compute the wave speed and distance travelled.</p>
<p>All analysis was performed with Matlab R2012a using built-in and custom built functions.</p>

<title>Converting between visual angle and retinal distance</title>
<p>To set up simulations of RF refinement, we use data from experimental studies regarding receptive fields, or traveling wave speeds, for example, which require conversion between degrees of visual angle and units of distance along the retinal surface. The precise conversion relationship between visual angle and retinal distance depends on the geometry of the eye, which differs for different animals. We therefore use a general conversion factor to provide a useful estimate. We assume that the retina covers two thirds of the circumference of a horizontal section through the center of the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004422.ref116">116</xref>], and that this maps to 180° of visual angle.

The power is distributed across a broad range of high frequencies for a 0.01 s burst, and within a small band of the lowest frequencies for a 1.0 s burst, yielding the strong negative lobe in the black curve. The negative lobe in the black curve extends beyond the horizontal axis and has been cut for clarity. However, for 0.1 s bursts, the power is concentrated in between these two extremes, around the dominant spatial frequency, <italic>k</italic>*.</p>
