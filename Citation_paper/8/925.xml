        <p>Unveiling the origin and forms of cooperation in nature poses profound challenges in evolutionary ecology. The prisoner's dilemma game is an important metaphor for studying the evolution of cooperation. We here classified potential mechanisms for cooperation evolution into schemes of frequency- and density-dependent selection, and focused on the density-dependent selection in the ecological prisoner's dilemma games. We found that, although assortative encounter is still the necessary condition in ecological games for cooperation evolution, a harsh environment, indicated by a high mortality, can foster the invasion of cooperation. The Hamilton rule provides a fundamental condition for the evolution of cooperation by ensuring an enhanced relatedness between players in low-density populations. Incorporating ecological dynamics into evolutionary games opens up a much wider window for the evolution of cooperation, and exhibits a variety of complex behaviors of dynamics, such as limit and heteroclinic cycles. An alternative evolutionary, or rather succession, sequence was proposed that cooperation first appears in harsh environments, followed by the invasion of defection, which leads to a common catastrophe. The rise of cooperation (and altruism), thus, could be much easier in the density-dependent ecological games than in the classic frequency-dependent evolutionary games.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cooperation within and between species abounds in nature ranging from microbial interactions to the mutualistic behavior of animals and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Wilkinson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Sella1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Pierce1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hemelrijk1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Lombardo1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hauser1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-CluttonBrock1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hamilton1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Schino1">[9]</xref>. Cooperative individuals can benefit others at cost to themselves, and can be easily exploited by selfish individuals that only receive benefit without cost (or contribution). As such, cooperation seems incompatible with Darwinian natural selection. However, mutual cooperation can often produce higher benefit than costs for both actors. It is, thus, necessary to seek mechanisms underpinning such a social dilemma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Kollock1">[10]</xref> and the cooperation evolution.</p>
      <p>Multiple hypotheses have been proposed for cooperation to initialize and sustain in selfish populations, including kin selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hamilton2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hamilton3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hamilton4">[13]</xref>, group selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Wilson1">[14]</xref> and reciprocal altruism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Trivers1">[15]</xref>. The most fundamental requirement for the evolution of cooperation is to break the random interaction among individuals and to construct assortative encounters between cooperative individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Eshel1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Fletcher1">[17]</xref>. Assortative interactions can guarantee a close relatedness between the actor and recipient, and thus ensure the satisfaction of the Hamilton rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hamilton3">[12]</xref>, stating that cooperation can be favored by natural selection if the benefit to cooperate, after discounted by the relatedness between players, is still larger than the cost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hamilton3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Frank1">[18]</xref>. The Hamilton rule portrays the general condition for the evolution of cooperation and has been confirmed under different altruistic mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Fletcher1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Nowak1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Nowak2">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Cooperative behaviors in evolutionary games can be categorized into two groups: (i) those that benefit both the recipient and the actor and (ii) those that benefit only the recipient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Pepper1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-West1">[22]</xref>. The former is often formulated by the snowdrift game for pairwise interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Doebeli1">[23]</xref> and by the public good game for group interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Fehr1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hauert1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Semmann1">[26]</xref>, whilst the latter by the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Axelrod1">[27]</xref>. The analyses of these classic evolutionary games, for instance using replicator equations, often assume infinite or constant population size for simplicity, and reflect the frequency-dependent selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hofbauer1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Nowak3">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Langer1">[30]</xref>. This assumption inevitably ignores the population dynamics.</p>
      <p>However, mounting evidence indicates that ecological and evolutionary dynamics could be commensurate in time and interact in a feedback loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Schoener1">[31]</xref>. Specifically, the evolution of cooperation can be facilitated by ecological factors such as the demographic stochasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Doebeli2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Lehmann1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Lehmann2">[34]</xref>, empty sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Alizon1">[35]</xref>, greater frequency of catastrophes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Gardner1">[36]</xref>, moderate habitat destruction and fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hui1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Zhang1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Zhang2">[39]</xref> and intermediate disturbance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Brockhurst1">[40]</xref>. In return, this behavioral evolution can also affect the dynamics and persistence of populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hui1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Zhang1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Zhang2">[39]</xref>. These results suggest that the density-dependent selection, in contrast to the frequency-dependent selection, could promote the evolution of cooperation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-RossGillespie1">[41]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The exclusion of cooperation in the social dilemma can be ascribed to the exploitation of cooperators by defectors without compensation. By reducing the population density and, thus, the encounter probability, cooperators are able to mitigate the exploitation by defectors. Consequently, the population density will climb due to accumulated benefits from mutual cooperation, which in turn begets the revival of defection and, consequently, the decline of population density, forming an eco-evolutionary feedback cycle. Such interplay between ecological forces and evolutionary games can foster the coexistence of cooperators and defectors in a public goods game, in which cooperation benefits both the recipient and the actor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hauert2">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hauert3">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Wakano1">[44]</xref>. Here, we focus on the prisoner's dilemma games, in which cooperation only benefits the recipient, not the actor itself (i.e. an altruistic behavior).</p>
      <p>To reveal how and to what extent the population dynamics and the eco-evolutionary feedback loop can affect the evolution of cooperation, we here examine the dynamics of an ecological PDG using an extension of replicator equations. Our model distinguishes two life-history stages in the population (i.e. interaction and dispersion) and assumes that the interactions (or games) between individuals happen locally and natal dispersal globally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Paradis1">[45]</xref>. An enhanced relatedness between locally interacting individuals could rise from delayed natal dispersal (e.g. cooperative breeding) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Kokko1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Baglione1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Peer1">[48]</xref> or sibling-coalition dispersal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Sharp1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Dale1">[50]</xref>. Our model differs from those for viscous populations where distances of interaction and offspring movement are considered equal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-vanBaalen1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-LeGalliard1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Lion1">[53]</xref>. In this study, we focus on the invasion dynamics of cooperation and the alteration of invasion condition in ecological games, and emphasize that cooperation can be promoted by the enhanced relatedness between players rising from the ecological dynamics. Using the stability analysis and bifurcation on phase planes, we portray the entire landscape of the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation in ecological PDGs.</p>

Thus, in a population with a proportion of <italic>x</italic> cooperators and <italic>y</italic> defectors, the mean payoff for a cooperator is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and for a defector <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        <p>To incorporate population dynamics into an evolutionary PDG, we consider a habitat consisting of suitable sites; each site can be occupied by either a cooperator or a defector, or remain empty. An empty site can become occupied by a new individual, whereas the death of an individual leaves its dwelling site empty. An individual is assumed to only produce offspring with the same strategy, which go on to randomly seek empty sites via global natal dispersal for colonization. The population dynamics can be described by the following differential equations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hauert2">[42]</xref>,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e007" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the birth rate of cooperators and defectors, respectively; <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the death rate (i.e. mortality). The density-dependent selection is incorporated in this ecological PDG because each individual has a probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of failing to encounter other players.

Clearly, our model of ecological PDG not only represents the ecological dynamics of birth and death (i.e. the colonization and extinction in metapopulations), but also the dynamics of evolutionary games in animals. We, thus, explored the invasion condition of cooperation, as well as the complicated dynamics of the eco-evolutionary feedback, in this ecological PDG model.</p>

        <title>Invasion Condition</title>

        <p>Once the cooperators have established themselves in the empty habitat, the invasion of defectors, in turn, can become possible if<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e040" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>This inequality implies that a cooperative population with low density can prevent the invasion of defectors.

        <p>There were at most two boundary equilibriums (i.e. pure strategy) in the system (eqn 2): (i) two boundary equilibriums if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; one for pure defection and the other for pure cooperation; (ii) no boundary equilibrium for defectors and only one boundary equilibrium for cooperators if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; (iii) two boundary equilibrium for cooperators if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The system has at most one interior equilibrium; it depicts the coexistence of cooperators and defectors and appears when the following condition is met:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e048" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>No interior equilibrium exists if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The interior equilibrium changed from a stable node to a focus when the eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix changed from a negative real number to an imaginary number. Furthermore, the interior equilibrium can become unstable and lead to a limit cycle, determined by the Hopf bifurcation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027523.s002">Appendix S2</xref>). When there were two boundary equilibriums for cooperators, a heteroclinic bifurcation occurred once the limit circle had touched the unstable boundary equilibrium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027523.s002">Appendix S2</xref>), breaking the local stable structure on the phase plane and causing population extinction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027523.s005">Animation S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>These boundary and interior equilibriums, as well as the bifurcation conditions, divide the parameter space into at most 15 different parts with the decrease of assortment, <italic>m</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027523-g001">Figure 1</xref>); each part indicates a particular behavior of dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027523-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, the condition for cooperation invasion in frequency-dependent selection (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0027523.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) occupies only one part in the parameter space (left of the dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027523-g001">Figure 1</xref>). High death rate (mortality) and high cost to cooperate were shown to be important for generating damped oscillation (i.e. a focus; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027523-g002">Figure 2 iii, vii, xi</xref>) and periodic oscillation (i.e. a limit circle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027523-g002">Figure 2 viii, xii</xref>) in population dynamics. A spatial simulation showed that the dynamics behavior of periodic oscillation can generate complicated spatial patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027523-g003">Figure 3</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027523.s003">Appendix S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027523.s006">Animation S2</xref> for details).

      <title>Results and Discussion</title>
      <p>A social dilemma arises from the random interactions among individuals, and thus the key to unlocking this puzzle lies in creating nonrandom assortative interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Eshel1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Fletcher1">[17]</xref>. Because the relatedness between players can be depicted by the difference between the probability for a cooperator to have a game with another cooperator and the probability for a defector to have a game with a cooperator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027523.s001">Appendix S1</xref>), the existence of assortative interactions becomes essential for the relatedness being positive. Our analysis thus confirmed the importance of assortment in facilitating the invasion and persistence of cooperation in ecological evolutionary games.</p>
      <p>Moreover, low population density reduces the random encounter probability and exploitation from defectors; it further increases the relatedness being greater than the assortment (<italic>m</italic>) and thus favors the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game. This is consistent with Hauret et al.'s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hauert2">[42]</xref> results that cooperation can be promoted when there is a decrease of population density in the ecological public goods game. Evidence from Australian mountain possums indeed shows a significant negative relationship between the relatedness and the availability of local tree dens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Banks1">[59]</xref>. A low population density can reduce the exploitation by defectors and thus mitigate the tragedy of commons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Rankin1">[60]</xref>. Therefore, factors that can reduce population density, such as empty sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Alizon1">[35]</xref>, habitat saturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Lion1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Lion2">[61]</xref>, enhanced predation risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Krams1">[62]</xref>, habitat deterioration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hui1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Zhang1">[38]</xref> and fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Zhang2">[39]</xref>, provide potential solutions to the social dilemma.</p>
      <p>This model is distinct from those models for viscous populations (an alternative way to consider ecological dynamics) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-vanBaalen1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-LeGalliard1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Lion1">[53]</xref> in two aspects: (i) in our model natal dispersal distance of offspring when colonizing empty sites is much longer than the interacting range between gaming individuals as confirmed in many animals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Paradis1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Kokko1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Baglione1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Peer1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Sharp1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Dale1">[50]</xref>), whereas viscous population models consider a similar distance of natal dispersal to the interacting (or gaming) range; (ii) there is cost to an individual in the viscous populations even when surrounded only by empty sites, in contrast to no cost in our model. Evidently, the viscous populations could be certain bacterial strains that interact through the diffusion and absorption of biochemical products generated through metabolism, whereas our model is more suitable for depicting social animals (e.g. mate competition and coalition between male lions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Packer1">[63]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The Hamilton rule provides a fundamental condition for the evolution of cooperation: the cooperative behavior can be favored if the benefit to cooperate discounted by the relatedness between the actor and recipient is still higher than the cost to cooperate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hamilton3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Frank1">[18]</xref>. Variants of this rule have been illustrated under various evolutionary mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Fletcher1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Nowak1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-vanBaalen1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Lion1">[53]</xref>. Assortative interactions between individuals play an important role in leading to the relatedness between players and are thus essential for the Hamilton rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Eshel1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Fletcher1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Population density can also affect the Hamilton rule by mediating the relatedness between players and the benefit and cost to cooperate, as in the ecological games of viscous populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-vanBaalen1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-LeGalliard1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Lion1">[53]</xref>. However, in these models for viscous populations, the empty site is an implicit player: cooperators surrounded by empty sites only pay tribute yet without return and thus lose against empty sites. In our model, games only happen between individuals; there will be neither benefit nor cost for individuals surrounded only by empty sites. A comparison of these two kinds of models (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027523.s004">Appendix S4</xref>) suggests cooperation evolves easier in games only between individuals (our model) than games where cooperators compulsorily pay cooperative cost to the surrounding regardless of whether the surrounding is empty or not (as in the model for viscous populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-vanBaalen1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Lion1">[53]</xref>).</p>
      <p>When the baseline birth rate is less than the death rate, a defective population is incapable of surviving in the absence of cooperators. In contrast, a cooperative population can be sustained in such harsh environments by compensating the deficit in the population growth rate with the benefit gained from mutual cooperation. Parallel evidence is rich in ecology, showing that positive interactions between species (e.g. facilitation) prevail in stress environments, such as in desert and inter-tidal zones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Bertness1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Callaway1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Brooker1">[66]</xref>. This result further suggests an alternative evolutionary sequence, in contrast to the one in classic evolutionary games. Individuals are often thought to be selfish initially in classic evolutionary games, while mutualism evolves afterwards. Here, we suggest an alternative evolutionary sequence in harsh environment: cooperation (symbiosis or mutualism) first appears in harsh environment, followed by the invasion of defection, which then inevitably leads to a common tragedy, or the social dilemma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Hardin1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Doebeli3">[68]</xref>. The pioneer species that colonizes a barren habitat, as in the studies on community succession, are often symbiotic or social, followed by exploiters (competitive species) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Connell1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Verdu1">[70]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, for the evolution of cooperation, assortative interaction is crucial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Eshel1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027523-Rankin2">[71]</xref>, whereas harsh environments that causes a high death rate and low population density can also serve as an inducement for the cooperation evolution. Individuals in harsh environment are prone to be cooperative in order to combat the high death rate, with the cooperation benefits. Adding ecological dynamics into evolutionary games opens a much wider window for the evolution of cooperation, and thus exhibits a variety of dynamical behaviors.</p>
