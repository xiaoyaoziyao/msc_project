        <p>Stress, pervasive in society, contributes to over half of all work place accidents a year and over time can contribute to a variety of psychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Stress impairs higher cognitive processes, dependent on the prefrontal cortex (<bold>PFC</bold>) and that involve maintenance and integration of information over extended periods, including working memory and attention. Substantial evidence has demonstrated a relationship between patterns of PFC neuron spiking activity (action-potential discharge) and components of delayed-response tasks used to probe PFC-dependent cognitive function in rats and monkeys. During delay periods of these tasks, persistent spiking activity is posited to be essential for the maintenance of information for working memory and attention. However, the degree to which stress-induced impairment in PFC-dependent cognition involves changes in task-related spiking rates or the ability for PFC neurons to retain information over time remains unknown. In the current study, spiking activity was recorded from the medial PFC of rats performing a delayed-response task of working memory during acute noise stress (93 db). Spike history-predicted discharge (<bold>SHPD</bold>) for PFC neurons was quantified as a measure of the degree to which ongoing neuronal discharge can be predicted by past spiking activity and reflects the degree to which past information is retained by these neurons over time. We found that PFC neuron discharge is predicted by their past spiking patterns for nearly one second. Acute stress impaired SHPD, selectively during delay intervals of the task, and simultaneously impaired task performance. Despite the reduction in delay-related SHPD, stress increased delay-related spiking rates. These findings suggest that neural codes utilizing SHPD within PFC networks likely reflects an additional important neurophysiological mechanism for maintenance of past information over time. Stress-related impairment of this mechanism is posited to contribute to the cognition-impairing actions of stress.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>When faced with stressful situations, normal thought processes can be impaired including the ability to focus attention or make decisions requiring deep thought. These effects can result in accidents at the workplace and in combat, jeopardizing the lives of others. To date, the effect of stress on the way neurons communicate and represent cognitive functions is poorly understood. Differing theories have provided opposing predictions regarding the effects of stress-related chemical changes in the brain on neuronal activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study, we show that stress increases the discharge rate of PFC neurons during planning and assessment phases of a task requiring the PFC. Additionally, using a point process model of neuronal activity we show that stress, nonetheless, impairs the ability of PFC neurons to retain representations of past events over time. Together these findings suggest that stress-related impairment of cognitive function may involve deficits in the ability of PFC neurons to retain information about past events beyond changes in neuronal firing rates. We believe that this advancement provides new insight into the neural codes of higher cognitive function that may lead to the development of novel treatments for stress-related diseases and conditions involving PFC-dependent cognitive impairment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The prefrontal cortex (<bold>PFC</bold>) plays a central role in a diverse set of cognitive and behavioral processes, including sustained attention, working memory, and behavioral inhibition. In rat, the prelimbic region of the PFC (<bold><sub>pl</sub>PFC</bold>) is a crucial subregion for these cognitive processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Kolb1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Spencer1">[4]</xref>. Delayed-response tasks of working memory have been extensively used to study the neurobiological basis of PFC-dependent function, in which information is retained during short delay intervals and used to guide subsequent behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Passetti1">[11]</xref>. Seminal electrophysiological studies identified a subset of PFC neurons that display persistent spiking activity during delay periods of these tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Fuster1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Batuev1">[12]</xref>. Spiking rates during delay periods are correlated with both specific task-related cues and the number of cues required to be maintained during the delay period. Based on these observations, delay-related spiking activity is posited to reflect the maintenance of attentional processes, abstract rules, or past stimuli and events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-GoldmanRakic1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Miller1">[15]</xref>. Additional evidence indicates that firing rates of PFC neurons during the response and reward phase of these tasks may reflect decision-related or reward/response outcome evaluation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Batuev1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-GoldmanRakic1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Haber1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Watanabe1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Currently there are competing hypotheses in the literature regarding the potential effects of stress on PFC spiking activity. One view proposes that stress related increases in norepinephrine (<bold>NE</bold>) α<sub>1</sub>- and dopamine (<bold>DA</bold>) D<sub>1</sub>-receptor signaling within the PFC will act to inhibit persistent spiking rates during delay intervals of these tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten2">[18]</xref>. In contrast, it is also posited that stress-related increases in glucocorticoid-receptor signaling will enhance spiking rates by facilitating or increasing glutamatergic neurotransmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Jackson1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Yuen1">[22]</xref>. NE, DA, and glucocorticoids activate multiple receptor subtypes, each producing complex concentration- and receptor-dependent modulatory actions on spiking activity of target neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Yuen1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Zahrt1">[30]</xref>. Moreover, the combined actions of these neuromodulators on target neuron spiking rates during stress are difficult to predict. Indirect evidence also predicts that during stress, high levels of NE and DA may act to disconnect PFC neurons from excitatory recurrent feedback and suppress recursive, delay-related discharge of PFC neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten2">[18]</xref>. These actions are posited to involve the degradation of intrinsic neuronal mechanisms and excitatory recurrent neural connectivity that likely support the maintenance of information over time within PFC networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Romanides1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Amit1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Yuen2">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although there exists a large body of evidence demonstrating that stress impairs higher cognitive processes dependent on the PFC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten5">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Schwabe1">[40]</xref>, surprisingly, to date the actions of stress on PFC neuronal discharge in animals engaged in tasks of working memory remain unknown. To address this gap in our understanding, we examined the relationship between acute noise stress-related impairment of performance during a PFC-dependent T-maze based delayed-response task of spatial working memory and stress-related changes in <sub>pl</sub>PFC neuronal spiking rates during the delay-period and other components of this task. Additionally, we directly determined the degree to which PFC neurons retain representations of past events over time by quantifying spike history-predicted discharge (<bold>SHPD</bold>) using a conditional intensity-generalized linear model statistical framework (<bold>CI-GLM</bold>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Brown1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Eden1">[45]</xref>. With the CI-GLM framework, we addressed several questions related to the actions of stress on PFC neuron function. First, to what degree does past spiking activity of PFC neurons predict or modulate ongoing activity of these neurons? Second, does stress have an overall impact on the predictability of PFC neuron discharge given a cell's intrinsic spiking history? Third, do specific task components (i.e. delay-period vs. behavioral response) interact with or modulate SHPD during baseline and acute stress? Combined, these studies represent a first characterization of the predictability of neural discharge from intrinsic spiking history within PFC networks of animals engaged in a cognitive task under normal and acute stress conditions.</p>

        <title>Characterization of Neural Recordings during a Working Memory Task</title>
        <p>Five animals were tested in a T-maze based delayed-response task of spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref> <bold>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002681.s002">Fig. S2</xref></bold>). This task has been previously shown to be dependent on a functionally intact PFC and require PFC-dependent cognitive processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Spencer1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Birnbaum1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Zahrt1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten5">[38]</xref>. In this task, animals were required to enter the T-maze arm opposite from the one last visited, following a delay period to obtain food rewards (chocolate chips 1.6 gm) delivered by the experimenter's hand. Delay length was specific to each animal (range 10–40 sec) and chosen to maintain baseline performance near 90% correct. Animals were tested for two sessions a day separated by two hours during which the animal remained tethered to the recording equipment. Each session consisted of 41 trials; the 1<sup>st</sup> trial of each session was always rewarded and not analyzed. During the first session (baseline), low-level masking white noise (60 db) was presented continuously and animals performed well (average 93% accuracy) with 3–4 errors occurring sporadically throughout the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>). Intense white noise (93 db), presented throughout the second testing session, significantly impaired performance in this task, with animals performing at an average of 64.8% (−28%; p&lt;0.0005 pairwise t-test). Acute white noise is a well-characterized stressor that elicits the physiological responses of stress and impairs PFC-dependent cognitive function in both humans and animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Schwabe1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Devilbiss2">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten7">[51]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Effects of Stress on Delay- and Response-Related Discharge Rates in the plPFC</title>
        <p>Discharge rates of WS-type <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons were characterized for intervals of the T-maze task (e.g. delay, run, and reward) using a peri-event time histogram (<bold>PETH</bold>) approach. Under baseline conditions, the discharge rate of <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons fluctuated throughout the time-course of each trial. The pattern of spiking activity was neuron-specific, with neurons exhibiting selective increases in discharge rate during single or adjacent behavioral intervals. A significantly large number of <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons exhibited delay-related spiking activity during baseline conditions (48.7%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 21.4, p&lt;0.001). During delay periods, the discharge rates of these neurons averaged 0.55 Hz+/−0.047 SEM. The illustrative cases shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref> demonstrate task-related fluctuations in discharge rate corresponding to delay periods, components of the behavioral response, and reward intervals across the recorded population of <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons during baseline sessions.</p>

For these cases, stress increased delay-related activity 180% of baseline (0.018 to 0.033 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>), whereas response related activity was suppressed during the run phase (42% of baseline, 0.092 to 0.039 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>) with little effect during the choice phase (108% of baseline, 0.748 to 0.811 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g002"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref>). These opposing actions of stress on delay-related activity versus response-related activity were frequently observed across simultaneously recorded neurons within an animal. Within each component of the task, stress produced cell-specific modulatory actions on spiking rate of <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons, similar to prior reports on catecholamine neuromodulatory effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Devilbiss1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Vijayraghavan1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Devilbiss3">[52]</xref>. Nonetheless, across all recorded WS-type <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons, stress significantly affected task-related spiking rates of correct trials (rmANOVA(TaskComponent) F<sub>(5,3810)</sub> = 579.05, p&lt;0.0001). During delay-periods, stress significantly <italic>increased</italic> the average discharge rate of these neurons (127% of baseline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). In contrast, stress <italic>suppressed</italic> the average spiking activity during the run and branch components of the behavioral response (78% and 92% of baseline respectively). During choice intervals, stress produced a modest increase in the average discharge rate (115% of baseline) but this effect was not statistically significant. Lastly, similar to that seen during the delay period, PFC neuron discharge rates during the reward and pickup components of the task were also facilitated by stress (135% and 130% of baseline). No differences were observed between the effects of stress on right vs. left trials. As such, these data suggest that intense acute stress generally enhances delay-related activity across PFC neurons. Moreover, the combined actions of acute stress across task intervals support the hypothesis that stress could differentially affect PFC-dependent processes that occur during the delay versus response period of these tasks.</p>

From this model, the “spiking gain” of predicted discharge activity during baseline (<italic>α</italic>) and stress (<italic>η</italic>) conditions was calculated for each 250 ms bin back in time. Explicitly, the spiking gain is equivalent to the rate-ratio (exponentiated covariate weights i.e. <italic>α, η</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Dobson1">[54]</xref> and represents the fold-change in predicted discharge activity given all other spiking activity occurring during the T-maze task.</p>
        <p>Individual <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons exhibited unique patterns of SHPD for each point back in time. For the illustrative cases shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>, SHPD gains generally decayed with increasing time points in the past. Nonetheless, <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons frequently demonstrated non-monotonic changes in SHPD gains at specific time points. For example, the highlighted pattern of SHPD gains of a single <sub>pl</sub>PFC neuron illustrates both a decay in SHPD gains over time and a selective increase in SHPD gain at 1.75 seconds. Similar to these individual cases the pattern of SHPD gains, averaged across the recorded population of WS-type neurons, decayed exponentially with increasing points further back in time during baseline conditions (f<sub>(x)</sub> = 1.16+0.544<sup>(−x/0.25)+0.51</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). Furthermore, although SHPD gains decayed over time, gains remained significantly greater than 1.0, indicating that spike history positively predicted future discharge for at least 2.5 seconds. Interestingly, the overall pattern of SHPD gains observed from <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons differed from other areas of the cortex where SHPD does not significantly modulate ongoing spiking activity after 100 ms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Truccolo2">[55]</xref>. This difference may reflect unique intrinsic neuronal or circuit properties of the PFC. Although acute noise stress did not alter the pattern of SHPD gains over time (ANOVA(Stress*Time) F<sub>(9,3523)</sub> = 0.86, p = 0.560), stress did significantly reduce the magnitude of SHPD gains across all time intervals tested (ANOVA(Stress) F<sub>(1,3523)</sub> = 8.78, p = 0.0031; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref> <bold>inset</bold>).</p>

        <p>To confirm that task-related fluctuations in spiking rates were important to include in these models, Model 1a can be compared to the reduced model lacking T-maze behavior intervals covariates (i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002681.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). A comparison of these two models for each <sub>pl</sub>PFC neuron, demonstrated that the measure of deviance was significantly reduced for the majority of neurons (85.7%, 187 of 218 neurons; χ<sup>2</sup> test, FDR corrected p value &lt;0.0113) when CI-GLM's included the T-maze behavior intervals (Model 1<sub>a</sub>). When analyses were replicated with the reduced model, a similar stressor-induced significant suppression of SHPD was found across individual <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons (ANOVA(Stress) F<sub>(1,4448)</sub> = 19.71, p&lt;0.0001; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002681.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). Together these results support the general hypothesis that, in addition to task-related fluctuations in spiking rates, spike history plays an important role in shaping <sub>pl</sub>PFC neural discharge. Furthermore, the fact that stress suppressed SHPD in animals performing the PFC-dependent T-maze task likely suggests that SHPD may be an important mechanism supporting PFC-dependent cognitive functions. However, the degree to which these effects are specific to the T-maze task remains to be determined. Reverberations in recurrent cortical circuitry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>) or intrinsic neuronal mechanisms likely contribute to SHPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Amit1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Mongillo1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten6">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Durstewitz1">[56]</xref> and permit PFC neurons to maintain and preserve information within spiking patterns across large time intervals.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study characterized the actions of acute noise stress on discharge rate and SHPD of medial PFC neurons in rats engaged in a T-maze delayed-response task. This stressor impaired performance in this task and generally suppressed the ability for past spiking activity of PFC neurons to predict or modulate these neurons ongoing activity. We further demonstrate that the effects of stress on SHPD as well as discharge rate are dependent on specific phases of the task including the delay and response periods. During delay periods, stress suppressed SHPD of <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons and enhanced delay-related firing rates. Outside of the delay period, SHPD was increased during the response period associated with a suppression of spiking activity during these same conditions of stress. These observations begin to provide an important link between the well-documented effects of stress on PFC-dependent cognitive functions and the impact of stress on PFC neural codes during a delayed-response task used to probe PFC-dependent function. Combined, these studies identify broad effects of stress on PFC neuronal activity that likely represent key aspects of the neurophysiological bases of stress-related cognitive impairment.</p>

        <title>Technical Considerations</title>
        <p>The T-maze delayed alternation task embodies a number of important cognitive/behavioral processes and neurophysiological features associated with PFC function of human and non-human primates. This task is highly dependent on the PFC and sensitive to the effects of stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Zahrt1">[30]</xref>, similar to tasks used in humans to probe PFC function. Additionally, it is posited that the T-maze task requires PFC-dependent processes including working memory, attention, inhibition of proactive interference, and inhibition of distracter interference (generated by handling the animal between each trial), similar to tasks used to probe PFC-dependent function in primates and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Kolb1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-GoldmanRakic2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Kesner1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Mishkin1">[59]</xref>. In animals performing the T-maze task, we observed a significant number of PFC neurons exhibiting delay-related spiking activity, similar to that observed in primates performing delayed-response tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-GoldmanRakic2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Messinger1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Shafi1">[61]</xref>. More automated versions of these tasks, including the Figure-8 maze task, lack distracter interference and possibly other processes requiring significant engagement of the PFC. Such differences between the T-maze task and Figure-8 tasks may explain why automated delayed-response tasks have shown only few delay-related cells in rodent PFC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Jung1">[62]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Intense white noise is a well-characterized audiogenic stressor that impairs working memory, attention, and other PFC-dependent functions in rats, monkeys, and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten5">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Berridge1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten7">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Holmes1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten8">[63]</xref>. In the current study, continuous presentation of intense white noise (93 db) impaired performance of the T-maze based delayed-response task of spatial working memory and increased PFC neuron firing rates during the delay period. Similar impairment in T-maze performance is seen when animals are exposed to restraint stress <italic>immediately prior</italic> to testing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Hains1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Shansky1">[65]</xref>, but not after 4 hours of recovery from restraint stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Yuen1">[22]</xref>. Although previous studies have demonstrated that non-stressful white noise can activate PFC neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Romanski1">[66]</xref>, these cells are few in number (approximately 2% of PFC neurons). For these PFC neurons, responses to white noise are phasic, quickly adapting, and are linked to the onset of the stimuli. During presentation of noise stress in the current study, PFC neuron firing rates were increased during the delay period but, importantly, were suppressed during the behavioral response. Together, the above observations provide strong evidence that the effects of noise stress on PFC neuron spiking activity were not induced by a continued sensory response to intense white noise.</p>
        <p>In the present study, a CI-GLM framework was used to examine the degree to which past spiking activity of <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons contributes to ongoing neural discharge patterns. Although the CI-GLM approach has been used successfully to distinguish between intrinsic spiking-history related discharge and extrinsic activity in motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Stevenson1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Truccolo3">[68]</xref>, here we extend its use to examine SHPD in PFC networks. An advantage of this approach over peri-event time histogram analysis or other univariate analyses, including autocorrelegram analysis, is that the CI-GLM approach can disambiguate the relative contributions of spiking history from that of experimental and task-related variables to spiking activity. In the current study, task- and stress-related changes in overall firing rates were captured in the <italic>β/B</italic> terms of the model separately from the effects of the interaction terms (<italic>α</italic> or <italic>η</italic>). Thus, SHPD during baseline could be directly compared to SHPD during stress conditions in a manner that accounted for the effects of stress on the overall discharge rate and task-related fluctuations in spiking activity within each trial. A second consideration for the CI-GLM approach is the use of a Poisson distribution to fit the CI-GLM to neural data over other distributions, including Gaussian or Bernoulli. By doing so, this does not imply that a Poisson process generates <sub>pl</sub>PFC neuronal spiking activity. Instead, the Poisson distribution is the appropriate distribution for what is, in simplified terms, a spiking count-based multivariate regression and provides a computationally tractable solution to fit <sub>pl</sub>PFC neuronal spiking activity. A number of excellent reviews described these statistical modeling methods and the appropriate use of these models to characterize spike trains (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Eden1">[45]</xref>).</p>

        <title>The Role of Spike History in Cognitive Function</title>
        <p>The present findings demonstrate that under baseline conditions, past spiking activity of a <sub>pl</sub>PFC neuron positively predicts future neuronal discharge. The contribution of past spiking activity to ongoing discharge of <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons decayed exponentially with time during baseline and stress conditions; spiking-history at time points up to 1–1.5 seconds comprised most of the predictive power. With delay periods ranging from of 10–40 seconds and behavioral responses lasting several seconds, we posit that the time scale of SHPD is likely an important PFC neural process for the stable maintenance of information for short intervals during delay periods of working memory tasks while providing a mechanism that allows integration of new spiking activity patterns within PFC networks that permits flexible goal-directed behaviors. This time scale and pattern of decay is an order of magnitude longer to what has been observed in primary motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Stevenson1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Truccolo3">[68]</xref>. In the motor cortex, SHPD does not contribute to the ongoing activity of those neurons after 100 ms and reflects the refractory and recovery periods of those motor neurons. Thus, these differences likely reflect the excitatory recurrent network connectivity of PFC networks and the time scale on which these cortical networks must maintain information to perform their requisite neurocomputations. Furthermore, the current results suggest that neural codes involving SHPD are likely a complement to firing rate-based codes within the PFC. We found that CI-GLMs which account for modulation in firing rates across different task intervals were significantly better at modeling the spiking activity of the neurons. Moreover, SHPD gains were reduced by approximately 10% when the behavioral intervals are included as CI-GLM covariates, suggesting that both SHPD and components of the task account for the variance in spiking activity.</p>
        <p>The current study also extends the idea that excitatory recursive activity within the PFC may be critical to sustain spiking activity and may act as the neurobiological basis of working memory and/or other cognitive processes occurring during these tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Miller1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Compte1">[69]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Hazy1">[71]</xref>.

        <title>The Effects of Stress on PFC Neural Activity</title>
        <p>The current study found that acute noise stress increased medial PFC neuron discharge rates during delay periods of rats performing a T-maze task of spatial working memory. In contrast, a number of prior observations predicted that during stress, high levels of extracellular catecholamines were likely to result in a suppression delay related firing rates. During acute stress, NE and DA neurotransmission in the PFC is elevated, activating low-affinity noradrenergic α<sub>1</sub>- and β-receptors as well as the dopamine D<sub>1</sub>-receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten3">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Finlay1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Roth1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Zahrt1">[30]</xref>. Activation of α<sub>1</sub> receptors in the PFC has been shown to suppress delay-related sustained discharge to specific cued target directions during working memory tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Birnbaum1">[24]</xref>. Similarly, high levels of D<sub>1</sub> activation in the PFC suppresses delay-related activity to cued and non-cued target directions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Vijayraghavan1">[29]</xref>. Extensive evidence suggests that the discrepancy between this prior prediction and the current observations is most likely due to stress-related increases in glutamate/glucocorticoid signaling within the PFC during acute stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Jackson1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Yuen1">[22]</xref>. Nonetheless, stress increases signaling within the PFC of a number of neuromodulators that may also contribute to changes in PFC neural activity during stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Snyder1">[79]</xref>. Increased delay-related discharge rates could reflect that, during stress, competing patterns of activation are instantiated across PFC neural populations during delay-periods that contribute to a disruption of working memory and sustained attention. Such interpretation of these data is supported by recent findings that a stress-related peptide, corticotrophin releasing factor, and activation of α<sub>1</sub>- receptors likely facilitates behavioral flexibility and processes involving attentional shifting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Snyder1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Berridge2">[80]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Although delay-related neuronal discharge rates are an important measure of PFC function, neural codes involving SHPD are also likely important for computations driving cognitive/behavioral processes in a number of cortical regions, including the PFC. In the current study, we demonstrate that stress impairs SHPD, principally during delay periods. These observations are consistent with theories that stress likely impairs the ability of PFC neurons/networks to continually update and maintain information necessary for appropriate behavioral responses through the delay period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Fuster1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-GoldmanRakic1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten4">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Hebb1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Wang1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Durstewitz1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Hopfield1">[81]</xref>. For example, it has been hypothesized that stress-related increases in NE and DA neurotransmission within the PFC act to modulate intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel function thereby disconnecting PFC neurons from excitatory recurrent feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten2">[18]</xref>. Thus, regulation of recurrent excitatory activation within PFC recurrent circuitry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Amit1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten6">[39]</xref> or regulation of NMDA related intracellular mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Moghaddam1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Mongillo1">[35]</xref> may underlie the current findings that stress impairs SHPD and the ability of <sub>pl</sub>PFC neurons to retain representations of past events over time.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we found that during the response phase of the task, firing rates of PFC neurons were suppressed during noise stress. Such actions are likely important for the complex repertoire of effects of acute stress across a range of cognitive functions. Suppression of PFC activity during the behavioral response could suggest that during stress, the PFC fails to appropriately inhibit behaviors mediated by other brain regions such as the dorsomedial striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Gregoire1">[82]</xref>. Such a loss of behavioral inhibition is supported by observations that habit-based actions, requiring little working memory, are favored under conditions of acute stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Schwabe1">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, these data also support recent findings that rats prefer choices in decision-making tasks that require the least amount of work for reward following acute stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Shafiei1">[83]</xref>. During the response phase of the task, SHPD interaction gains were enhanced at short intervals and suppressed at long intervals during acute stress. Such enhancement of short interval gains may reflect PFC activity patterns generated in the absence of ongoing inputs that could result in uncertainty/ambiguity of goal selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Bogacz1">[84]</xref>. Additionally, it is possible that suppression of SHPD generated from spiking events in the distant past (i.e. &gt;1.5 seconds) by stress could reflect impairment of the maintenance of information from the delay period into the response interval. Brain regions outside the PFC, including the dorsomedial striatum, could use PFC neural codes involving SHPD to guide selection of appropriate behavioral responses towards a rewarded goal. Nonetheless, the current findings are highly consistent with studies demonstrating that acute stress impairs cognitive functions requiring the PFC, whereas functions not dependent on the PFC such as hippocampal- and amygdala-related processes may be facilitated with stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Arnsten2">[18]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Summary</title>

Initial training was complete when animals entered the T-maze arm opposite from the last one visited for food rewards (chocolate chips 1.6 gm) delivered by the experimenter's hand with 90% accuracy on 10 trials (0 seconds delay, 1 session/day). Animals were then surgically implanted with recording electrodes and returned to <italic>ad lib</italic> feeding for the duration of recovery (7–10 days). Following recovery, training continued until animals performed two sessions of 41 trials at criterion of 90–100% correct for 2 consecutive days. Sessions were separated by 2 hours to minimize reward satiation/decreased motivation and carbohydrate-induced changes in cognitive function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-McNay1">[86]</xref>. Importantly, no differences in performance existed between the first and second sessions. Although animals had learned the task, over time, performance in this task gradually improves at a given delay. To maintain baseline performance near 90% correct, the duration of the delay period was increased for each animal as necessary, ranging from 10–40 sec, and a new stable baseline was determined. Olfactory and visual cues were minimized by wiping the maze between each trial with 10% ethanol and lining the walls of the testing suite with black matt cloth. Masking white noise (60 db), measured at the intersection of the T (A-weighted; 2232, Brüel &amp; Kjær Nærum Denmark), was generated from a speaker 2 meters above the center of the maze. During training sessions, animals were tethered to a dummy wire harness of identical weight and flexibly as the harness used for electrophysiological recording on testing days. After acclimation to the tether, animals showed no differences in maze performance or overt behaviors from prior reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Zahrt1">[30]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Under halothane anesthesia (Halocarbon Laboratories, River Edge, New Jersey; 1%–4% in air), animals were implanted bilaterally with linear electrode arrays (n = 8 electrodes/array; 250 µm separation; SB103, NB Labs, Dennison, TX) targeting layer V of the prelimbic region of the PFC (<sub>pl</sub>PFC) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Devilbiss3">[52]</xref>.

          <p>After each day of recording, pre-established offline criteria were used to verify that waveforms assigned to each discriminated “unit” originated from a single neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g001"><bold>Fig. 1D</bold></xref>). These previously described criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Devilbiss2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Devilbiss3">[52]</xref> were based on unit waveform properties and spike train discharge patterns including: 1) variability of peak waveform voltage, 2) variability of waveform slope(s) from peak to peak, 3) separability of clustering of scattergram points from the waveform's first two principal components, and 4) refractory period evident in the spike train auto-correlegram. Neurons that met these criteria were further classified as “wide spike” (WS-type) or “narrow spike” (NS) to putatively identify large projection pyramidal neurons (WS-type) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Bartho1">[53]</xref>. Essentially, the peak-peak (P-P) duration of waveforms from verified neurons were calculated. Neurons with P-P intervals greater than 200 µs were classified as WS-type neurons. Other cells classified as NS neurons (P-P intervals between 100–200 µs) or neurons not meeting either category were eliminated from further analyses. Lastly, <sub>pl</sub>PFC neuron action potential shape, neuron discharge pattern (inter-spike interval) and response properties were further examined to verify that neurons were not recorded across multiple recording sessions. Although our unpublished data indicate neurons recorded from multiple session days (separated by a week) occurs infrequently, if identified, analyses of data was limited to the first recording session of that neuron.</p>
          <p>Behavioral events of the T-maze task were identified by visually scoring the time-stamped video recordings and manually entered into each neural recording data file. These events included 1) placement of the rat into the start box, 2) removal of the start gate, 3) rat reaching the branch point of the “T”, 4) the rat entering one of two goal arms (choice), 5) receipt of food reward, and 6) removal of the rat from the maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002681-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). The intervals between these events were used to generate PETH's or as predictor variables included in the CI-GLM and defined respectively as the 1) Delay interval, 2) Run interval - running down the main arm of the maze, 3) Branch interval - orienting to the left/right arm, 4) Choice interval - complete entry into one arm, 5) Reward interval - consumption of reward, 6) Pickup interval - experimenter returning animal to start box. Additionally, each trial was further classified as a correct or incorrect trial, by the chosen spatial goal (i.e. left vs. right arm), and whether it occurred during the baseline or noise stress recording session. For analyses involving interaction terms included in the CI-GLM, we extended the delay to include the pickup interval in this analysis since the pickup also likely represents a segment of the delay period and that the maximal amount of data was needed to calculate the large number of interaction terms included in the CI-GLM. Additionally for analyses involving interaction terms, we defined the behavioral response interval as the group of contiguous behavioral intervals that include the Run, Branch, and Choice. Together, these behavioral response intervals represent the response to navigate the T-maze in an attempt to acquire a reward.</p>

          <p>Spike train activity was characterized by either PETH analysis or by fitting conditional intensity functions to neural spike train data using generalized linear models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Brown1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Eden1">[45]</xref> to describe the effects of stress on SHPD (NeuroExplorer, Nex Technologies, NC and custom Matlab functions; Mathworks, Natick, MA). These analyses were limited to correct trials, given that few error trials occurred during baseline testing sessions and reliable estimates of neuronal spiking activity were difficult to obtain for error trials.</p>
          <p>T-maze task-related patterns of discharge for individual neurons were initially analyzed with trial-by-trial bin counts (5 ms bins) collected during baseline and noise stress conditions. For each recording session, trial bin counts corresponding to each behavioral interval within a trial were summarized as a temporally normalized PETH and quantified. Temporal normalization of PETH's was necessary because, across trials of a session each behavioral interval type (e.g. Run) was comprised of different durations of time. The mean discharge rate of a neuron, calculated for each behavioral interval during stress conditions, was then represented as percent of the baseline recording session discharge rate (first recording session of the day). For all recorded neurons, a one-way ANOVA analysis (TaskComponent – behavioral interval) was performed on these normalized PETH-generated data. False Discovery Rate (FDR)-corrected single sample T-tests were used to determine that discharge rates during each behavioral interval were significantly different from values of 100.</p>
          <p>A CI-GLM was also used to directly analyze the effects of noise stress on T-maze task interval-related patterns of discharge for each neuron.

Additionally, the effect of baseline vs. noise stress for a given behavioral interval of the T-maze task (extended Delay, Response interval) was also modeled (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002681.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002681.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the estimated weighting parameters.

Because the interaction models are not nested they could not be directly compared using the deviance test. However, a measure of “spiking gain”, equivalent to the rate-ratio (exponentiated covariate weights i.e. <italic>β, α, η</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002681-Dobson1">[54]</xref>, representing the fold-change in predicted discharge activity given all other spiking activity occurring during the T-maze task was used to determine the effects of stress on SHPD. Statistical differences between the baseline recording session and noise stress were determined with a two way repeated measures ANOVA analysis (rmANOVA; Experimental Condition*Spike History Time) performed on SHPD gains. LSD post-hoc tests were used to make comparisons between individual groups. False Discovery Rate (FDR)-corrected single sample T-tests were used to determine that spiking rates or gains were significantly different from values of 1.0.</p>
