<abstract>
<p>The fungus <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> is well known for its production of gibberellins causing the ‘bakanae’ disease of rice. Besides these plant hormones, it is able to produce other secondary metabolites (SMs), such as pigments and mycotoxins. Genome sequencing revealed altogether 45 potential SM gene clusters, most of which are cryptic and silent. In this study we characterize a new non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster that is responsible for the production of the cyclic tetrapeptide apicidin F (APF). This new SM has structural similarities to the known histone deacetylase inhibitor apicidin. To gain insight into the biosynthetic pathway, most of the 11 cluster genes were deleted, and the mutants were analyzed by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-HRMS for their ability to produce APF or new derivatives. Structure elucidation was carried out be HPLC-HRMS and NMR analysis. We identified two new derivatives of APF named apicidin J and K. Furthermore, we studied the regulation of APF biosynthesis and showed that the cluster genes are expressed under conditions of high nitrogen and acidic pH in a manner dependent on the nitrogen regulator AreB, and the pH regulator PacC. In addition, over-expression of the atypical pathway-specific transcription factor (TF)-encoding gene <italic>APF2</italic> led to elevated expression of the cluster genes under inducing and even repressing conditions and to significantly increased product yields. Bioinformatic analyses allowed the identification of a putative Apf2 DNA-binding (“Api-box”) motif in the promoters of the <italic>APF</italic> genes. Point mutations in this sequence motif caused a drastic decrease of APF production indicating that this motif is essential for activating the cluster genes. Finally, we provide a model of the APF biosynthetic pathway based on chemical identification of derivatives in the cultures of deletion mutants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fungi are well known for their ability to produce a great range of natural products, the so called secondary metabolites (SMs). These compounds are structurally diverse, low molecular mass molecules that are not essential for the growth and survival of the producing organism, but instead are thought to increase its fitness or to decrease the fitness of surrounding organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Brakhage1">[1]</xref>. The increasing number of sequenced fungal genomes has revealed an enormous potential of fungi to produce many more SMs than originally expected. Most of these new SMs are only predicted by bioinformatics analysis of putative SM gene clusters in sequenced genomes. Unfortunately, many of these potential SM gene clusters show little or no expression under typical laboratory conditions, and therefore the potential new SMs are either not produced, or are present at levels that are too low to be detected by standard methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Breitling1">[2]</xref>. In some cases, the production of such cryptic or silent SM-derived gene clusters has been successfully induced by genetic manipulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Brakhage1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>The genus <italic>Fusarium</italic> comprises broadly distributed, plant-pathogenic species that are able to infect economically important crops leading to huge losses. The rice pathogen <italic>Fusarium fujikuroi</italic> is one of the first described plant-pathogenic <italic>Fusarium</italic> species and is widespread in all rice-growing countries of the world. It causes the ‘bakanae’ (foolish seedling) disease due to its ability to produce and secrete gibberellins (GAs), a family of plant hormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Bmke1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Yabuta1">[4]</xref>. In addition, <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> produces some other well-known SMs, particularly pigments like bikaverin and fusarubins, and mycotoxins, such as fusarins and fusaric acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Balan1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Cross1">[8]</xref>. However, the recently sequenced genome of <italic>Fusarium fujikuroi</italic> revealed altogether 45 gene clusters, mostly with unknown function (cryptic), indicating an enormous genetic potential to produce new SMs. One of them is a novel non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster with NRPS31 as key enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref>. The product of this cluster has been recently elucidated in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> by NMR and MS analyses and was designated apicidin F (APF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref>. APF belongs to the group of cyclic tetrapeptides, the apicidins, which are built up of four amino acids. The founding member of the group, apicidin (APS), contains the amino acids <italic>N</italic>-methoxy-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan, <sc>l</sc>-isoleucine, <sc>d</sc>-pipecolic acid and <sc>l</sc>-2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid (Aoda) and was identified in <italic>Fusarium pallidoroseum</italic>, renamed <italic>F. semitectum</italic> and in <italic>Fusarium sambucinum</italic> (KCTC 16677) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Park1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Singh1">[13]</xref>. Meanwhile, seven additional APS derivatives have been identified either as synthetic analogs or naturally occurring compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Singh3">[16]</xref>. In contrast to APS, APF contains <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine instead of isoleucine and <sc>l</sc>-2-aminooctanedioic acid instead of Aoda, while the other two amino acids, <italic>N</italic>-methoxy-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan and <sc>d</sc>-pipecolic acid, are common in APS and APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref>. APS is known to be a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and a potential anticancer agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Kouraklis1">[17]</xref>. Due to its HDAC-inhibiting activities, APS has antiprotozoal effects against the murine malaria species <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-DarkinRattray1">[12]</xref>. Several structure-activity relationship studies revealed a large impact of the amino acid composition on the HDAC inhibitory activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Singh2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Singh3">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Olsen1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Colletti2">[20]</xref>. Because of its variation in the Aoda side chain and an additional amino acid substitution (<sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine instead of isoleucine), the new APS derivative APF was tested for antimalarial activity and showed <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> comparable to APS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref>.</p>

<p>Although the production of APS by <italic>F. semitectum</italic> was well known for more than ten years, the corresponding APS biosynthesis gene cluster has been identified only recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>. In the genome sequence of <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, we detected a similar gene cluster at the far end of chromosome I which is surprisingly absent from any other genome of the highly related <italic>Fusarium</italic> species of the <italic>Gibberella fujikuroi</italic> species complex, such as <italic>F. verticillioides</italic>, <italic>F. mangiferae</italic> and <italic>F. circinatum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref>. For better differentiation between the gene clusters in <italic>F. semitectum</italic> and <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, we renamed the <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> genes <italic>APF</italic> for <bold><underline>ap</underline></bold>icidin <bold><underline>F</underline></bold> biosynthetic genes.</p>
<p>In this work, we studied the function of most of the APF cluster genes by gene replacement and subsequent high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based identification of products accumulated in the cultures of single deletion mutants. We were able to elucidate the structures of two new derivatives, apicidin J and apicidin K. Gene expression studies and product measurements revealed that APF production in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> is induced under nitrogen-sufficient and acidic pH conditions by the global regulators AreB and PacC, respectively. In addition, the presence of the pathway-specific TF Apf2 is essential for <italic>APF</italic> gene expression. Over-expression of the Apf2-encoding gene resulted in elevated cluster gene expression and significantly increased product yields even under repressing nitrogen-limiting conditions. The binding motif for Apf2 that was indicated by bioinformatics has now been proved experimentally by promoter mutagenesis.</p>

About 10<sup>7</sup> protoplasts were transformed with the PCR product for generating deletion mutants and with 10 µg of the vector for gaining over-expression, point mutated and <italic>GFP</italic> mutants, as described before. After regeneration for 4–5 days at 28°C in the dark on a complete regeneration agar (0.05% yeast extract and 0.7 M sucrose) containing either 100 µg/mL hygromycin B (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) or 100 µg/mL nourseothricin (Werner-Bioagents, Jena, Germany), the transformants were controlled by diagnostic PCR and Southern blot. To verify homologous integration of gene replacement fragments by diagnostic PCR, the following primer pair was used: “gene”-5F-diag/pCSN44-hph-trpC-T and “gene”-3R-diag/pCSN44-hph-P2.

<title>Analysis of APF and its derivatives by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-HRMS analysis</title>
<p>APF was extracted from the harvested mycelium after incubation in ICI medium for 3–6 days. Therefore, 0.1 g of the lyophilized mycelium was extracted for 2 h with 1.5 mL ethylacetate/methanol (3∶2, v/v). 0.75 mL of the supernatant were evaporated and re-suspended in 1.5 mL 30% acetonitrile (ACN) (v/v). The amounts of APF were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) analysis at a wavelength of 280 nm. A Merck-Hitachi System (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was used with an autosampler (L-7200), a Diode Array Detector (L-245) and a gradient pump (L-7100). The samples were separated on a LiChrospher 100 RP-18 column (5 µm, 250 mm×4 mm, Merck KGaA). The following conditions were used: solvent A ACN with 1% formic acid (v/v), solvent B 1% formic acid (v/v). The gradient was from 30% A to 45% A in 10 min, then for 15 min up to 50% A and followed by column flushing for 5 min at 100% A. Equilibration at the starting condition of 30% A was carried out for 3 min. The injection volume was 80 µL and the flow rate 1 mL/min. EZChrom <italic>Elite</italic> Version 3.3.2 SP1 (Scientific Software, Inc.) was used for analyzing the data. The standard APF was used for compound identification. The concentration of the standard was 0.1 µg/µL dissolved in 30% ACN.</p>
<p>The HPLC-HRMS analysis on an LTQ Orbitrap XL-mass spectrometer uses a method previously described for the analysis of APF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref> with minor changes: capillary temperature 225°C, vaporizer temperature 275°C. Instead of the gradient described by Wiemann et al., 2013, the following shorter gradient was applied. Solvent A: methanol with 1% formic acid (v/v), solvent B: 1% formic acid (v/v). The gradient was from 10% A to 100% A in 20 min followed by column flushing at 100% A for 5 min and equilibration to the starting conditions for 5 min at 40°C. Additionally to the positive ionization mode used for HRMS analysis, the ion trap was used for detection of the deprotonated molecular ions in the negative ionization mode to determine the molecular mass of the biosynthetic analogs. Source voltage was −3.0 kV, capillary voltage −35 V and tube lens −110 V for the negative mode. 10 µL of the culture filtrate or the mycelium extract were injected. For semi-quantitative estimation of the produced amount of APF in the mutants P_Mut1 and P_Mut2, 10 µL of a 1 µg/mL APS stock solution was added as internal standard to 90 µL of the mycelium extract prepared for HPLC analysis. The peak area of APF was normalized to the internal standard. Therefore, the extracted ion chromatograms of [M+H]<sup>+</sup> of APF (646.3235±0.0032) and APS (624.3756±0.0032) were used.</p>

The culture filtrates were extracted on a Strata C18-E (55 µm, 70 Å) 10 g/60 mL SPE column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref>. In detail, the column was pretreated with 50 mL methanol and 50 mL water. Approximately 1 L of the culture filtrate was loaded onto the column. After application of about 500 mL culture filtrate, the column was washed with 50 mL water to prevent plugging of the column with salts and sugars. When the column was loaded completely, it was washed with 100 mL water followed by washing with 20% and 40% methanol/water (v/v). Apicidin J was eluted with 80% methanol/water (v/v), Apicidin K was eluted with 80% methanol/water (v/v) after washing with 60% methanol/water (v/v). All steps were performed under vacuum. The fractions were evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator at 40°C. Further purification was performed on a preparative HPLC-UV. The first preparative HPLC-UV run was the same as for APF isolation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref> except for another HPLC system used. The preparative HPLC-UV was carried out on a Jasco system (Jasco PU-2087 pump coupled to Jasco UV-2075-detector, Jasco, Groβ-Umstadt, Germany).</p>
<p>The dried fractions of the SPE clean-up were dissolved in a preferably small volume of the starting conditions, and about 1.8 mL were injected per run. Apicidin J elutes at about 14 min and apicidin K at about 21 min. After the preparative HPLC, the apicidin J fraction was further purified in a second run using the same 250×10.0 mm Varian Microsorb 100–5 C<sub>18</sub> column with a 10.0×10.0 mm Gemini C<sub>6</sub>-Phenyl-guard column. Solvent A was 5% THF in methanol (v/v), solvent B was water. The flow rate was 3.5 mL/min. The run was isocratic at 65% A. The UV-detector was set to 254 nm. The purity was determined with an Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (ELSD). The final yield of apicidin J was about 2 mg out of 1 L culture filtrate with a purity of ≥98% (HPLC-ELSD).</p>
<p>The apicidin K fraction was finally purified on a Shimadzu-DAD with DGU-20A<sub>3</sub> – degasser, SIL-20AF – autosampler, 2 LC-10ATvp pumps, SPD- M20A – DAD-detector, CBM-20A –controle module, CTO-10ASvp – column oven. The used column was a 250×4.6 mm Gemini C<sub>18</sub> 5 µm column with a 4.0×3.0 mm guard column of the same material. The flowrate was 1 mL/min and the wavelength was set to 254 nm. Injection volume was 50 µL. The sample was dissolved in a low amount of the starting conditions. The separation was isocratic at 70% A and 40°C. The purity was determined with an ELSD. The final yield of apicidin K was about 5.5 mg out of 1.5 L culture filtrate with a purity of ≥95% (HPLC-ELSD).</p>
<p>The system used for the determination of the purity was a Shimadzu-UV-ELSD (DGU-20A<sub>3</sub> – degasser, SIL-20A – autosampler, 2 LC-20AT pumps, SPD-20UV – UV-detector, CBM-20A – control module, ELSD-LT, software LCsolution). The column used was a 250×4.6 mm Gemini C<sub>18</sub> 5 µm column with a 4.0×3.0 mm guard column of the same material. The flowrate was 1 mL/min. The ELSD was set to 40°C and 250 kPa with compressed air. The UV detector was set to 275 nm. Solvent A was 1% formic acid in methanol (v/v), solvent B was 1% formic acid in water (v/v). The gradient was from 30% to 100% A in 30 min, 100% A for 5 min and equilibration to 30% A for 10 min. The purity of the isolated compounds was tested with an about 50 µg/mL solution in 10% methanol with an injection volume of 15 µL and compared to a 10% methanol blank solution.</p>

<title>Structure elucidation of apicidin J and apicidin K</title>
<p>The structure of apicidin J could not be elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-spectroscopy because the isolated quantity was insufficient for full NMR-data. Instead, a method was applied that combined hydrolysis, identification and derivatization of the amino acids, as well as a partial hydrolysis with a vaporizer temperature of 300°C and a capillary temperature of 250°C followed by sequencing of the resulting di- and tripeptides, as previously described for APF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref>.

Transcripts were detectable only with 60 mM glutamine, indicating that APF cluster genes were induced by saturated amounts of glutamine which confers acidic ambient pH conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). In addition, <italic>APF</italic> genes show a time-dependent expression pattern when grown under optimal production conditions for five days. The transcript levels (represented by <italic>APF6</italic> and <italic>APF9</italic>) reached a peak on the second and third day and were not detectable later on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Over-expression of the TF gene <italic>APF2</italic> is able to overcome the nitrogen regulation</title>
<p>Our studies provide evidence that APF production is controlled by a complex regulatory network including several global regulators such as AreB and PacC. In addition, we have previously shown that over-expression of the pathway-specific TF Apf2 led to strong elevation of product yields and allowed structure elucidation of the new compound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>To determine whether over-expression of <italic>APF2</italic> can overcome repression of <italic>APF</italic> genes under conditions of low nitrogen and at alkaline pH, the WT and the OE::<italic>APF2</italic> mutant were grown under four standard conditions (6 and 60 mM glutamine; 6 and 120 mM NaNO<sub>3</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref> for three days. APF was analyzed in both the supernatant and the lyophilized mycelium. As expected, the production of APF was significantly increased under optimal production conditions (60 mM glutamine) compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>; shown for mycelium extract). However, in contrast to the WT, APF was also produced in media with low amounts of glutamine, and even with high amounts of nitrate causing an alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). The expression of <italic>APF</italic> genes (shown for <italic>APF2</italic> and <italic>APF9</italic>) was increased under all four nitrogen/pH conditions compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). After seven days, production with high NaNO<sub>3</sub> was increased even further, while only low production was observed in the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).

<title>Identification and mutation of the putative DNA-binding motif</title>
<p>After demonstrating that Apf2 acts as transcriptional activator of <italic>APF</italic> gene expression and that it is localized in the nucleus, we wanted to identify its DNA-binding motif in the promoters of the <italic>APF</italic> cluster genes. Due to the high similarity between the APS and APF gene clusters, we assumed a conservation of regulatory elements in the promoters of orthologous genes. Sequence analysis of the promoters of <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and <italic>F. semitectum APF</italic>/<italic>APS</italic> genes using the Phylocon algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wang1">[41]</xref> revealed a putative binding motif with the consensus sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TGACGTGA-3′</named-content> which is significantly enriched in the promoters of <italic>APF</italic> and <italic>APS</italic> cluster genes compared to the genome-wide distribution of the motif in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> (P-Value &lt;0.01). This motif can be found in the promoters of all cluster genes except the <italic>APF2</italic> gene itself in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, while it is also not present in the promoter region of <italic>aps3</italic> and <italic>aps10</italic> in <italic>F. semitectum</italic>.

<p>In order to gain experimental proof that this motif is indeed a functional cluster-specific TF binding site, probably for Apf2, two different point mutations were introduced in the single motif upstream of <italic>APF1</italic> encoding the NRPS.

<title>Structural identification of the biosynthetic analogs produced by the Δ<italic>APF3</italic> and Δ<italic>APF9</italic> mutants</title>
<p>Further characterization of the two biosynthetic analogs in the Δ<italic>APF3</italic> and Δ<italic>APF9</italic> mutants via HPLC-HRMS revealed molecular formulas C<sub>34</sub>H<sub>41</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O<sub>7</sub> for the Δ<italic>APF3</italic>-product and C<sub>35</sub>H<sub>45</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O<sub>6</sub> for the Δ<italic>APF9</italic>-product, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>). The molecular formula of the Δ<italic>APF3</italic>-product fits a hypothetical APF-structure with proline incorporated instead of pipecolic acid. This derivative is comparable to apicidin B that was identified in the corresponding Δ<italic>aps3</italic> mutant in <italic>F. semitectum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>. This so far unknown Δ<italic>APF3</italic>-product was named apicidin J.</p>
<p>The molecular formula of the Δ<italic>APF9</italic>-product fits a hypothetical APF-structure with 2-amino-8-hydroxyoctanoic acid instead of 2-aminooctanedioic acid. This derivative is comparable to apicidin D<sub>2</sub> that was identified in the corresponding Δ<italic>aps9</italic> mutant in <italic>F. semitectum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>. The new APF derivative found in the Δ<italic>APF9</italic> mutant was designated as apicidin K.</p>
<p>To accumulate sufficient amounts of apicidins J and K for structure elucidation, <italic>APF2</italic> was over-expressed in the Δ<italic>APF3</italic> and Δ<italic>APF9</italic> mutant backgrounds generating Δ<italic>APF3</italic>/OE::<italic>APF2</italic> and Δ<italic>APF9</italic>/OE::<italic>APF2</italic> double mutants. This approach resulted in a ca. 10-fold enhanced production of the derivatives. The structures were elucidated using a method already applied for the structural elucidation of APF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref>. As the amounts of apicidin J were insufficient for NMR-spectra, a combination of hydrolysis, Marfey's derivatization and partial hydrolysis, followed by HPLC-HRMS/MS analysis, was used (Fig. S11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103336.s001">File S1</xref>, Fig. S12 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103336.s001">File S1</xref>). These methods confirmed the incorporation of proline instead of pipecolic acid by Apf1 in the Δ<italic>APF3</italic> mutant. The product apicidin J consists of <italic>N</italic>-methoxy-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan, <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine, <sc>d</sc>-proline and <sc>l</sc>-2-aminooctanedioic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>) and is comparable to apicidin B in <italic>F. semitectum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Based on 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments, the amino acid composition as well as their sequence could be determined for apicidin K, the product of the Δ<italic>APF9</italic> mutant. This analysis revealed a modified side chain containing a terminal hydroxyl group in the structure of apicidin K (Table S2, Fig. S13–16 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103336.s001">File S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To elucidate the stereochemistry of three of the four amino acids (<italic>N</italic>-methoxy-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan, <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine, <sc>d</sc>-pipecolic acid), hydrolysis and Marfey's derivatization were performed (Fig. S17 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103336.s001">File S1</xref>). The stereochemistry of the fourth amino acid, 2-amino-8-hydroxyoctanoic acid, could not be determined due to missing reference compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>). However, based on structural similarity of apicidin K with the corresponding analog apicidin D<sub>2</sub> in the <italic>F. semitectum</italic> Δ<italic>aps9</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>, it can be assumed that the stereochemistry is the same as for <sc>l</sc>-2-aminooctanedioic acid in APF. The only difference is that apicidin K is hydroxylated at C-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>). The stereochemistry of the amino acid should not be affected by this modification. Nevertheless, there is no complete proof for the stereochemistry.</p>
<p>In <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, both apicidin J and apicidin K were only produced in the corresponding deletion mutants, but not in the WT. In contrast, apicidin D<sub>2</sub> and B co-occurred with APS in the <italic>F. semitectum</italic> WT, though in comparatively low amounts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, to study the role of the two putative P450 monooxygenases, Apf7 and Apf8, an existing <bold><underline>c</underline></bold>ytochrome <bold><underline>P</underline></bold>450 <bold><underline>r</underline></bold>eductase deletion mutant (Δ<italic>CPR</italic>) was analyzed for APF production. P450 monooxygenases depend on the electron transfer from a reduction equivalent to the P450 monooxygenase catalyzed by the NADPH-dependent Cpr. Therefore, the activity of P450 monooxygenases, e.g. Apf7 and Apf8, is inhibited in the Δ<italic>CPR</italic> mutant due to the missing electron donor protein. Subsequently, the Δ<italic>CPR</italic> mutant is useful to study the general involvement of Apf7 and/or Apf8 in APF biosynthesis. The Δ<italic>CPR</italic> mutant was grown under optimal APF production conditions for three days, and the culture supernatant was analyzed via HPLC-HRMS. APF production was completely abolished in the Δ<italic>CPR</italic> mutant and no additional APF derivatives were detected, underlining the essential function of Apf7 and/or Apf8 in biosynthesis (data not shown).</p>

<title>Cytotoxic effects of APS and APF on Hep G2-cells</title>
<p>Due to the elevated product yields in the OE::<italic>APF2</italic> mutant strain, we were able to compare the biological activity of APS with that of APF.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent genome sequencing of the rice pathogen <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> provided new insight into the genetic capacity to produce a wide collection of natural compounds. However, transcriptome and HPLC-HRMS-based metabolome analyses indicated that most of the 45 putative gene clusters are cryptic and not expressed under standard laboratory conditions. Several approaches have been shown to activate dormant fungal gene clusters, e.g. by manipulating the activity of global and gene cluster-specific regulators, or by altering the chromatin landscape by either genetic or chemical manipulation of chromatin modifiers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Brakhage1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Lim1">[59]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present work, we focused on molecular characterization and regulation of the APF gene cluster in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> by use of a combination of genetic approaches (gene deletions, over-expression, promoter mutations) and chemical analyses of APF and APF-like derivatives produced by the WT and mutant strains.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>The phylogenetic origin of the APF gene cluster</title>
<p>Comparison of the <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> genome with those of the six other sequenced species in the genus revealed that only a small number of gene clusters are conserved among these species. Two out of the 45 identified gene clusters, one that includes a polyketide synthase gene (PKS19) and another that includes a NRPS gene (NRPS31), are unique to <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and not present in any other sequenced <italic>Fusarium</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref>. Phylogenetic analysis of all so far characterized fungal NRPSs revealed the highest similarity (66% identity) of NRPS31 with Aps1 of the distantly related species <italic>F. semitectum</italic> that was shown to be the key enzyme of APS biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>. Beside the sequence similarities between the two NRPSs, the adjacent genes are highly syntenic in both fungi, suggesting that <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> produces an apicidin-like SM.</p>
<p>There are only a few reports of the biosynthesis of cyclic tetrapeptides in fungi. The maize pathogen <italic>C. carbonum</italic> produces HC-toxin, a cyclic tetrapeptide with the structure <sc>d</sc>-Pro-<sc>l</sc>-Ala-<sc>d</sc>-Ala-<sc>l</sc>-Aeo, where Aeo stands for 2-amino-9,10-epoxi-8-oxodecanoic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Walton1">[60]</xref>. Recently, genome sequencing of <italic>Alternaria jesenskae</italic> revealed orthologs of each of the known seven <italic>TOX2</italic> genes from <italic>C. carbonum</italic>, and the production of HC-toxin was discovered in this fungus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wight1">[61]</xref>. APS and APF production by <italic>F. semitectum</italic> and <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, respectively, and production of trapoxin by the fungus <italic>Helicoma ambiens</italic> are three more examples for fungal cyclic tetrapeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-DarkinRattray1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Itazaki1">[62]</xref>. All of them show HDAC inhibitor activities and contain similar amino acids, such as Aeo or Aeo derivatives. Comparison of the gene clusters responsible for APS, APF and HC-toxin biosynthesis showed that the closest known homologs of many of the <italic>APS</italic>/<italic>APF</italic> genes are the genes of the HC-toxin cluster in <italic>C. carbonum</italic>. Another common feature of these gene clusters is the presence of a rather atypical bANK-type TF (ToxE and Aps2/Apf2) containing both a basic DNA-binding domain and four ankyrin repeats. ToxE/Aps2/Apf2-like TFs with reasonable amino acid identity and structure were recently also found in the genomes of <italic>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</italic>, <italic>Setosophaeria turcica</italic> and <italic>Glomerella cingulata</italic>, and in all cases the TF-encoding genes are adjacent to four-module NRPS genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wight1">[61]</xref>. The DNA binding motifs for ToxE in <italic>C. carbonum</italic> (5′-ATCTCNCGNA-3′; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Pedley1">[55]</xref>) and Apf2 in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TGACGTGA-3′</named-content>; this work) differ despite the high sequence similarity in the basic DNA binding and ankyrin domains of both TFs.</p>
<p>These gene clusters might have a common phylogenetic origin because of the similar cluster organization, the presence of an atypical bANK-type TF, and the fact that fungal species in distantly related genera contain similar gene clusters and produce structurally related cyclic tetrapeptides. Furthermore, the position of the gene cluster in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> at the far end of chromosome I may support our hypothesis that this cluster was acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from an unknown organism. Genomic regions close to chromosome ends are more prone to recombination than telomere-distal regions and genes or gene clusters acquired by HGT are often found in sub-telomeric positions in fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Walton2">[63]</xref>. Furthermore, none of the so far sequenced related <italic>Fusarium</italic> species from the <italic>Gibberella fujikuroi</italic> species complex, e.g. <italic>F. verticillioides</italic>, <italic>F. mangiferae</italic> or <italic>F. circinatum</italic>, contain this gene cluster, or parts of it, whereas most of the other SM gene clusters are present and highly syntenic in the genomes of these <italic>Fusarium</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref>. Another possibility would be that an ancestor of the genus <italic>Fusarium</italic> had a similar gene cluster in the genome which was lost during evolution in most of the <italic>Fusarium</italic> species except for <italic>F. semitectum</italic> and <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>. The sequence differences between the cluster genes in the latter two species, especially in the adenylation domains of both NRPSs, probably led to the differing substrate specificities of both key enzymes. As a consequence, two of the four incorporated amino acids vary between APF and APS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref>.</p>

<title>APF shows lower cytotoxicity on Hep G2 cells compared to APS</title>
<p>Our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of the antimalarial activity of APF against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> revealed a three-fold lower activity compared to apicidin (IC<sub>50</sub>-value of 0.67 µM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref>. In this study we demonstrated an even lower (100-fold) cytotoxic effect of APF on Hep G2 cells compared to apicidin. These data show that the exchange of amino acids in structurally related cyclic tetrapeptides leads to altered biological activities. Structure-activity relationship studies are an efficient tool to develop new effective drugs, also in the case of HDAC inhibitors. By using synthetically modified apicidins a strong impact of the amino acid composition on HDAC inhibitory activity has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Olsen1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Colletti2">[20]</xref>. For example, an exchange of Aoda for 2-aminooctanedioic acid (modified APS) led to a 200-fold decrease in activity against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and an about 15-fold decrease in inhibition of HDAC activity in human HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Colletti1">[19]</xref>. In contrast, the additional phenylalanine in APF instead of isoleucine probably overrides the decrease in activity against <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, but amplifies the lower effect on mammalian cells.</p>

<title>The APF biosynthetic pathway</title>
<p>To gain a better insight into the biosynthesis of APF, several cluster genes were deleted and the generated knock-out mutants were analyzed for their ability to produce APF or related compounds by HPLC-HRMS. The structure elucidation was carried out using HPLC-HRMS and/or NMR. and NMR.</p>
<p>Previously, we have shown that the <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> Apf1 incorporates four amino acids: <italic>N</italic>-methoxy-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan, <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine, <sc>d</sc>-pipecolic acid (<sc>d</sc>-pip) and <sc>l</sc>-2-amino-8-octanedioic acid (<sc>l</sc>-Aoc) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref> which have to be activated by the four adenylation domains of the NRPS. While the proteinogenic amino acid <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine can be directly activated, the non-proteinogenic amino acids have to be synthesized via product-specific enzymes, probably encoded by cluster genes. One of them is <sc>d</sc>-pip which occurs in many natural cyclic tetrapeptides. First, <sc>l</sc>-pip has to be built by the activity of Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C) reductase (Apf3) from Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-6-carboxylic acid (P6C) which might derive from <sc>l</sc>-lysine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-He1">[64]</xref>. For epimerization of <sc>l</sc>-pip to <sc>d</sc>-pip a racemase gene or an epimerase domain of the NRPS is needed. The HC-toxin cluster contains an alanine-racemase that is capable of converting <sc>l</sc>-alanine into <sc>d</sc>-alanine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Cheng1">[65]</xref>. However, the APF cluster does not contain any racemase-encoding gene. Another possibility is that the NRPS itself comprises an epimerization domain as shown for the NRPS HTS1 [(S/A)RTXGWFT(T/S)] which enables the conversion of <sc>l</sc>-proline to <sc>d</sc>-proline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Cheng1">[65]</xref>. A similar motif (SRTVGWFTT) was found in the sequence of Apf1 suggesting that Apf1 is able to epimerize <sc>l</sc>-pip to <sc>d</sc>-pip.</p>
<p>To experimentally determine the postulated function of Apf3 as P5C reductase that provides <sc>l</sc>-pip, we analyzed Δ<italic>APF3</italic> mutant for APF production. The main product of this mutant is apicidin J that contains <sc>d</sc>-proline instead of <sc>d</sc>-pip, confirming the involvement of Apf3 in <sc>l</sc>-pip formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). The same incorporation of <sc>d</sc>-proline was demonstrated for the <italic>aps3</italic> deletion mutant in <italic>F. semitectum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref> indicating a low substrate specificity of the corresponding amino acid activation domain of Aps1/Apf1. However, small amounts (about 100-fold less) of APF were still detectable in the mutant by HPLC-HRMS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g009">9A</xref>). This is not surprising because <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> has two additional putative P5C reductases (FFUJ_09318 and FFUJ_03207) having 28% and 23% identity to Apf3, respectively. P5C reductases are involved in the last step of <sc>l</sc>-proline biosynthesis in almost all organisms catalyzing the conversion from P5C to <sc>l</sc>-proline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Smith1">[66]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments with recombinant P5C reductase from <italic>E. coli</italic> showed that this enzyme also catalyzes the conversion of P6C to <sc>l</sc>-pip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Fujii1">[67]</xref>. We propose that these remaining reductases produce <sc>l</sc>-proline as usual and perhaps also small amounts of <sc>l</sc>-pip. Both precursors can be incorporated by the NRPS Apf1 to synthesize either apicidin J or APF, respectively.</p>
<p>The modification of <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan to <italic>N</italic>-methoxy-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan was proposed to be catalyzed only by one enzyme, the putative <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase Aps6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>. However, as the nitrogen atom in <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan has to be first oxidized before it can be methylated by an <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase, we suggest that there are probably two enzymes needed. There is only one example known in which the methoxylation of a nitrogen atom can be catalyzed by a single enzyme: the cercosporin biosynthesis in <italic>Cercospora nicotianae</italic>. However, in this case, the responsible enzyme contains both a putative <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase domain at the N-terminus and a putative FAD-dependent monooxygenase domain at the C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Dekkers1">[68]</xref>. Apf6, however, has only an <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase domain. Therefore, we suggest that the oxidation of the nitrogen to form <italic>N</italic>-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan could be catalyzed by one of the two P450 monooxygenases, Apf7 or Apf8. In <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> it has been shown that a P450 monooxygenase catalyzes the selective <italic>N</italic>-hydroxylation of 2-pyridone in the tenellin biosynthetic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Halo1">[69]</xref>. It is noteworthy that deletion of <italic>aps7</italic> in <italic>F. semitectum</italic> led to the production of apicidin E that lacks the keto group at the Aoda residue indicating that this P450 is responsible for the hydroxylation of the aliphatic chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>. Accordingly, we suggest that the other P450, Apf8, might be responsible for the oxidation of <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan.</p>
<p>In a second step, Apf6 is predicted to convert <italic>N</italic>-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan to <italic>N</italic>-methoxy-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan. As expected, the Δ<italic>APF6</italic> mutant is not able to produce APF, or any alternative product, suggesting that that Apf1 does not recognize <italic>N</italic>-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan or <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan as a substrate. Similarly, deletion of <italic>aps6</italic> in <italic>F. semitectum</italic> also resulted in the loss of apicidin production, and no derivatives were observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>The last precursor for APF biosynthesis is the short-chain fatty acid <sc>l</sc>-Aoc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref>. Most of the remaining cluster genes are potentially involved in formation of this compound. Like the HC-toxin cluster, the <italic>F. semitectum</italic> and <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> clusters contain a gene that encodes an α-subunit of a fatty acid synthase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Ahn2">[70]</xref>. This gene (<italic>APF5</italic>) is probably responsible for the condensation of the octanoic acid backbone by successive attachment of three malonyl-CoA units to a single primer molecule of acetyl-CoA. Then, one of the P450 oxidases, probably Apf7, may oxidize octanoic acid to 2-oxooctanoic acid, and finally the putative branched-chain amino acid transaminase Apf4 (homolog of ToxF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Cheng2">[71]</xref>) could catalyze the exchange of the keto group of 2-oxooctanoic acid with an amino group. Similar gene functions were predicted for the biosynthesis of Aoda in <italic>F. semitectum</italic>. Because the deletion of <italic>aps7</italic> in <italic>F. semitectum</italic> resulted in production of apicidin E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>, it is very likely that this P450 monooxygenase oxidizes 2-aminooctanoic acid also in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>. After this step, the putative FAD-dependent monooxygenase Apf9 is probably involved in conversion of 2-amino-8-hydroxyoctanoic acid into 2-aminooctanedioic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103336-g011">Fig. 11</xref>). Our analysis of the <italic>APF9</italic> deletion mutant revealed apicidin K, a derivative of APF biosynthesis that contains 2-amino-8-hydroxyoctanoic acid and corresponds to the product of Δ<italic>aps9</italic> in <italic>F. semitectum</italic>, apicidin D<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>. These data indicate that Apf1 recognizes both, 2-amino-8-hydroxyoctanoic acid as well as 2-aminooctanedioic acid as substrates.</p>

<title>Proposed biosynthetic pathway of apicidin F.</title>
<p>Based on our data, we postulated a biosynthetic pathway for apicidin F. Noteworthy, catalyzation steps which are marked with a “?” have not been confirmed experimentally. The NRPS as key enzyme incorporates four different amino acids to produce apicidin F. However, most of the amino acids are non-proteinogenic and therefore, have to be modified by other enzymes of the cluster. <sc>l</sc>-Phenylalanine is the only proteinogenic amino acid and directly used by Apf1. <sc>l</sc>-Pipecolic acid is the second precursor of Apf1 and is epimerized to D-pipecolic acid, probably by Apf1 activity, prior to incorporation. It is proposed that lysine is converted to Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C). A P5C reductase catalyzes the transformation to proline. This enzyme could also convert Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-6-carboxylate (P6C) to <sc>l</sc>-pip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>. In our studies, we could demonstrate that deletion of the P5C reductase-encoding gene <italic>APF3</italic> led to the incorporation of proline instead of pip resulting in the production of apicidin J. We claim, therefore, that this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of P6C into <sc>l</sc>-pip. The NRPS itself has an epimerization domain for the epimerization of <sc>l</sc>-pip into <sc>d</sc>-pip. Furthermore, Apf1 incorporates <italic>N</italic>-methoxy-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan. We suggest that one of the P450 oxidases (Apf7 or Apf8) <italic>N</italic>-oxidizes <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan and then the <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase Apf6 is able to catalyze the methylation of the hydroxy group. The fourth amino acid that is incorporated by Apf1 is <sc>l</sc>-2-aminooctanedioic acid. It is predicted that the fatty acid synthase-encoding gene <italic>APF5</italic> is involved in the synthesis of the octanoic acid backbone by fixing one acetyl-CoA unit and three malonyl-CoA units <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>. Then one of the P450 oxidases may oxidize this backbone to 2-oxooctanoic acid. The aminotransferase Apf4 is predicted to catalyze the exchange of the keto group with an amino group. The next step would be the oxidation of 2-aminooctanoic acid by one of the P450 oxidases (Apf7 or Apf8). For <italic>F. semitectum</italic>, it could be shown that deletion of <italic>aps7</italic> led to the production of apicidin E (lacks the keto group in comparison to apicidin) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref>. We suggest that the last step is the oxidation of 2-amino-8-hydroxyoctanoic acid to 2-aminooctanedioic acid by the FAD-dependent monooxygenase Apf9 because deletion of the corresponding gene led to the production of apicidin K (lacks the acid group and has a hydroxyl group instead).</p>

<p>To confirm the essential role of the two P450 oxidases Apf7 and Apf8 in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, we analyzed the deletion mutant of the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase gene (Δ<italic>CPR</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Malonek1">[26]</xref>. In this mutant, the activity of all P450 monooxygenases, e.g. those of the gibberellin pathway, is inhibited due to the loss of the CPR-catalyzed electron transfer from NADPH to the P450 monooxygenases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Malonek1">[26]</xref>. Our analysis revealed that APF production is abolished in this mutant (data not shown), demonstrating the essential role of the two P450s in the biosynthesis of APF.</p>
<p>All eleven genes of the cluster were shown to be co-regulated under high nitrogen conditions suggesting that they might be involved in APF biosynthesis. However, our previous studies on the fusarin C gene cluster revealed that only four of the nine co-regulated genes are necessary for the biosynthesis of fusarins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Niehaus1">[29]</xref>.

<title>The regulation of APF biosynthesis</title>
<p>The regulation of secondary metabolism occurs at pathway-specific and more general levels. Global regulation is achieved by TFs which are encoded by genes that do not belong to any cluster and which may regulate a number of genes that are not involved in secondary metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Brakhage1">[1]</xref>. In addition, SM gene clusters can be regulated by pathway-specific transcription factors, such as Apf2 (see below).</p>
<p>In this work, we studied the impact of global and pathway-specific regulators on APF biosynthesis in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>. Beside the role of the specific TF Aps2 in <italic>F. semitectum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Jin1">[14]</xref> and Apf2 in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref> nothing was known about environmental and genetic factors that can influence the production of APS and APF, respectively. We showed that APF gene expression is induced by high nitrogen concentrations as shown before for fusarin C and fusaric acid biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Niehaus1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Niehaus2">[48]</xref>. This strong dependency on nitrogen availability suggests the involvement of one or both GATA-type nitrogen regulators, AreA and AreB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Michielse1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann4">[49]</xref>. The gibberellins were the first SMs whose gene expression and biosynthesis were shown to be induced by nitrogen limitation in an AreA-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Mihlan1">[50]</xref>. Recently, we have shown that the second GATA TF AreB is also essential for expression of gibberellin biosynthetic genes in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Michielse1">[22]</xref>. While AreA was not responsible for regulating the expression of any known nitrogen-induced SM, AreB was shown to act as positive regulator of nitrogen-induced fusaric acid biosynthetic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Niehaus2">[48]</xref>. The APF gene cluster is the second example of a nitrogen-induced SM which is strongly regulated by AreB, but not by AreA. The AreB-dependent gene expression of both gene clusters could be confirmed by a recent microarray analysis comparing the expression profile of the WT with that of the <italic>AREB</italic> deletion mutant (A. Pfannmüller et al., unpublished). In accordance with this finding, there are several putative GATA sequence motifs in the promoters of the APF cluster genes. In addition to AreB, a functional GS protein is essential not only for gibberellin, bikaverin, and fusarin C biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Niehaus2">[48]</xref>, but also for the expression of <italic>APF</italic> genes and APF production. Insufficient metabolization by the Δ<italic>GLN1</italic> mutant of glucose and, as a consequence, the shortage of ATP, probably causes the down-regulation of secondary metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wagner1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition, <italic>APF</italic> gene expression depends on acidic ambient pH and the presence of the pH regulator PacC. A PacC-dependent regulation has been previously shown for the bikaverin biosynthetic genes whose expression is also induced under acidic conditions, and repressed under neutral or alkaline conditions. Deletion of <italic>PACC</italic> or mutation of the PacC DNA-binding motif in the <italic>BIK1</italic> promoter led to de-repression under repressing alkaline conditions and even higher expression under optimal acidic conditions, indicating that PacC acts as a repressor which seems to directly bind the promoters of <italic>BIK</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann3">[25]</xref>. In contrast, PacC acts as an activator of <italic>APF</italic> gene expression. As we could not identify any PacC binding site in the promoter regions of <italic>APF</italic> genes, PacC seems to act as an indirect activator of the APF gene cluster.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the fungal-specific <italic>velvet</italic> complex seems to play only a minor role for <italic>APF</italic> gene regulation. In contrast, we have previously shown that Vel1, Vel2 and the putative histone methyltransferase Lae1 significantly affect the expression of gibberellin, fusaric acid and fusarin C biosynthetic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Niehaus1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Niehaus2">[48]</xref>.</p>

<title>The atypical TF Apf2 is essential for biosynthesis of apicidin F</title>
<p>On the basis of available fungal genome sequences, about 60% of fungal SM gene clusters contain a putative regulatory gene. Most of the potential regulators in fungal PKS-encoding gene clusters belong to the Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub>-type fungal-specific TFs, whereas NRPS-regulating TFs seem to be more diverse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Brakhage1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>Over-expression of cluster-specific TFs using strong or inducible promoters was shown to be a sufficient approach to activate normally silent gene clusters and to identify new SMs, e.g. the polyketide asperfuranone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Chiang1">[74]</xref>, the hybrid PKS–NRPS aspyridone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Bergmann1">[75]</xref> and the diterpene compound <italic>ent</italic>-pimara-8(14),15-diene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Bromann1">[76]</xref> in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> as well as APF in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Wiemann1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-vonBargen1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Aps2 and Apf2 together with ToxE of the HC-toxin cluster in the plant pathogen <italic>C. carbonum</italic> belong to an atypical class of TFs which combine a basic DNA-binding domain at their N-terminus and four ankyrin repeats at their C-terminus, but do not contain discernible leucine zipper or helix-loop-helix motifs in contrast to typical bZIP TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Ahn1">[54]</xref>; this study). For ToxE it has been shown that both the basic region and the ankyrin repeats are involved in DNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Pedley1">[55]</xref>. Due to this unusual domain structure, these TFs were named <bold><underline>b</underline></bold>asic DNA-binding domain-type TF with <bold><underline>ank</underline></bold>yrin-like repeats (bANK proteins) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Bussink1">[53]</xref>. We showed that <italic>APF2</italic> localizes to the nucleus and that its over-expression positively affects expression of eight out of the eleven cluster genes. Bioinformatic analysis of the promoter sequences of the APF genes revealed an almost palindromic eight-base-pair-motif: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TGACGTGA-3′</named-content> which we called “Api-box” in analogy to the “Tox-box” in the HC-toxin cluster in <italic>C. carbonum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Pedley1">[55]</xref>. The “Api-box” is present in the promoters of all cluster genes, except Apf2 itself. This motif is conserved among the <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and <italic>F. semitectum</italic> APS/APF gene clusters. Mutation of this sequence motif led to a 100-fold decrease of APF production. Although this approach is not direct proof for the interaction of Apf2 with the “Api-box” sequence, it is a strong indication that this motif is essential for <italic>APF</italic> gene activation by binding the pathway-specific TF.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this sequence element is present only in one copy within the bidirectional promoters between <italic>APF1/APF11</italic>, <italic>APF4</italic>/<italic>APF5</italic> and <italic>APF7/APF8</italic>. For the “Tox-box” it has been shown that it is functional in yeast in both orientations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0103336-Pedley1">[55]</xref>. This finding is biologically significant because the “Tox-box” is present only once in the promoters of divergently transcribed genes similarly to the situation of divergently transcribed <italic>APF</italic> genes in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>. To confirm without any reservation that the “Api-box” is indeed the binding sequence of Apf2, we will perform yeast one-hybrid assays in the near future.</p>
<p>In this study, we report the identification and functional analysis of the gene cluster responsible for APF biosynthesis in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>. The cluster consists of eleven genes while only five of them were shown to be directly involved in APF biosynthesis. Targeted gene replacement of cluster genes and subsequent HPLC-HRMS and NMR analysis revealed two new APF derivatives, apicidin J and K. Based on our data, we provide a model for the APF biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, we show that the expression of <italic>APF</italic> cluster genes depends on global regulators, such as AreB and PacC, as well as the pathway-specific TF Apf2. Over-expression of this unusual TF gene resulted in a nearly 10-fold elevated product formation under optimal culture conditions. Point mutations in a conserved sequence motif in the promoter of the key gene <italic>APF1</italic> (NRPS) resulted in loss of APF production.</p>
