<title>Background</title>
<p>Excess sugar consumption, including sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), contributes to a variety of negative health outcomes, particularly for young people. The mass media play a powerful role in influencing public and policy-makers’ perceptions of public health issues and their solutions. We analysed how sugar and SSB policy debates were presented in UK newspapers at a time of heightened awareness and following the announcement of the UK Government’s soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to inform future public health advocacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods &amp; findings</title>
<p>We carried out quantitative content analysis of articles discussing the issues of sugar and SSB consumption published in 11 national newspapers from April 2015 to November 2016. 684 newspaper articles were analysed using a structured coding frame. Coverage peaked in line with evidence publication, campaigner activities and policy events. Articles predominantly supportive of SSB taxation (23.5%) outnumbered those that were predominantly oppositional (14.2%). However, oppositional articles outnumbered supportive ones in the month of the announcement of the SDIL. Sugar and SSB consumption were presented as health risks, particularly affecting young people, with the actions of industry often identified as the cause of the public health problem. Responsibility for addressing sugar overconsumption was primarily assigned to government intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our results suggest that the policy landscape favouring fiscal solutions to curb sugar and SSB consumption has benefited from media coverage characterising the issue as an industry-driven problem. Media coverage may drive greater public acceptance of the SDIL and any future taxation of products containing sugar. However, future advocacy efforts should note the surge in opposition coinciding with the announcement of the SDIL, which echoes similar patterns of opposition observed in tobacco control debates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Excess consumption of sugary foods and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), particularly among children and adolescents, is a major public health concern. Sugar contributes to obesity, which in turn increases the risk factors for type-2 diabetes and other non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and common cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref004">4</xref>]. Excess sugar consumption is also associated with poor dental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref006">6</xref>]. In 2015, approximately 27% of adults in England were obese and an additional 36% were overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref006">6</xref>]. Furthermore, 28% of children aged 2–15 years old were either overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref007">7</xref>]. The consequences of the negative health outcomes relating to obesity cost the NHS over £5 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>In 2015, the World Health Organisation (WHO) published guidelines recommending an intake of free sugars from sugary foods and drinks of no more than 10%, and ideally less than 5%, of total energy intake throughout the life course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref009">9</xref>]. This 5% figure was endorsed by the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref004">4</xref>] and Public Health England (PHE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref010">10</xref>]. However, free sugars currently account for 12–15% of total energy intake in the UK, approximately three times higher than the recommended limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Several actions have been proposed to reduce sugar consumption in the UK, particularly in young people, including a 10–20% tax or levy on SSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref010">10</xref>]. Analysis of the 10% sugar tax implemented in Mexico in January 2014 demonstrated the potential effectiveness of such policies to decrease sugar consumption, particularly in lower socio-economic households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref015">15</xref>]. An econometric modelling study similarly predicted that a 20% SSB tax in the UK would produce a 1.3% reduction in adult obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref016">16</xref>]. In March 2016, the UK government announced a soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to be implemented in April 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref020">20</xref>], and similar measures have now been announced or introduced in some 20 countries, including Ireland, South Africa, Portugal, Spain, Estonia and parts of the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Research suggests that the media could potentially play a powerful role in forming public perceptions, and thus potential acceptance, of public health policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref024">24</xref>]. Mass print media provides a wide platform for reaching the public, and has power in putting health issues on the public agenda and determining how those issues are framed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref026">26</xref>]. This framing process involves emphasising some aspects of a debate and downplaying others. Framing can thus include representations of the seriousness and causes of societal problems and the potential effectiveness of proposed solutions. Framing can therefore influence audiences’ perception and evaluation of different approaches to addressing public health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref024">24</xref>]. As such, media framing of the issues around sugar and SSB consumption could have influenced public acceptance of upstream solutions, such as taxation.</p>
<p>Previous research found the consequences of sugar consumption to be an increasingly prominent topic in the UK media throughout 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref027">27</xref>]. However, the soft drink industry generally managed to avoid negative press with few calls for policy change such as enforced reformulation, clearer labelling or taxation and an emphasis on individual responsibility. The purpose of our study was to analyse how sugar and SSB policy debates were represented in UK newspapers at a time of heightened awareness due to key publications, campaigner activities and policy announcements including the UK Government’s SDIL; and compare these findings with earlier studies to inform future public health advocacy.</p>

<sec id="sec005" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted quantitative newsprint content analysis using a method developed by Hilton and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref031">31</xref>] at the University of Glasgow’s Social and Public Health Sciences Unit to facilitate systematic recording of media content to understand framing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref026">26</xref>]. Typically, this research method involves: retrieving newspaper articles from a database; manually excluding insufficiently relevant results; constructing a coding frame designed to capture features of each article relevant to the research aims; systematically coding each article; and performing statistical analysis of the coded data. The research design of this study closely followed Elliott-Green and colleagues’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref027">27</xref>] prior content analysis of earlier media representations of SSBs to facilitate comparison of findings.</p>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Sample selection</title>
<p>We selected eight UK and three Scottish national newspapers, including each title’s Sunday counterpart. Newspapers with high circulation figures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref032">32</xref>] were purposively selected, to ensure a sample of coverage that represented the variety of the UK and Scottish national newspaper audiences, using a typology employed in previous content analyses of UK newspapers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref034">34</xref>]. This typology includes three newspaper ‘genres’: tabloid, middle-market and quality. Tabloid newspapers are politically diverse, with predominantly working-class readerships, and an informal tone. Middle-market newspapers are more serious in tone, have a predominantly older, middle-class readership, and are typically aligned with the political centre-right. ‘Quality’ newspapers are those formerly categorised as broadsheets, and are politically diverse, with predominantly middle-class readerships. The use of this typology ensured a sampling frame of newspapers diverse in terms of political alignment and the age and social class of their audiences.</p>
<p>A time period from 1<sup>st</sup> April 2015 to 31<sup>st</sup> November 2016 was chosen to capture the initial media debate prompted by the publication of WHO guidelines on sugar intake in March 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref009">9</xref>], the SACN report on carbohydrates in July 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref004">4</xref>], the PHE report calling for action on sugar consumption in October 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref010">10</xref>], and the Government consultation process on the SDIL which closed in October 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref035">35</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Database search and manual filtering</title>
<p>After identifying the sampling frame, we arrived at a final sample of relevant articles through a methodical process of: 1) searching for articles; 2) removing clearly irrelevant articles based on headlines; 3) extracting a random sub-sample of articles; and 4) assessing the full-text of articles for eligibility and excluding as appropriate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207576.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We searched the Nexis database for articles that contained both three of more mentions of <italic>“sugar*”</italic> and one or more mention of the following: <italic>“beverage* OR soft drink* OR fizz* OR soda OR tax* or levy”</italic>. The headline of each article was read, and clearly irrelevant articles were excluded, while all other articles were exported for further scrutiny. To generate a representative sample that could be coded within the researcher time available, half of the exported articles were selected randomly and removed. Each of the remaining articles was read, and articles were <bold>excluded</bold> if: 1) less than 50% of their content related to sugar or SSBs; 2) they were short lead-ins to main stories elsewhere within the same issue (which also appeared in the sample); and/or 3) they were printed in publications’ letters, advice, TV guide, sport, weather, obituaries or review pages. Through this manual exclusion process, we arrived at the final research sample for coding.</p>

<title>Coding and data analysis</title>
<p>A coding frame was developed to facilitate systematic quantitative recording of the relevant, explicitly stated content of each article (Supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207576.s001">S1 File</xref>). The coding frame closely followed that used by Elliott-Green and colleagues’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref027">27</xref>], covering: basic descriptive characteristics of articles; the topic(s) covered; articles’ slants towards sugar, SSBs and taxation; and different aspects of defining the problem of sugar, the problem’s drivers and the problem’s potential solutions. CHB tested and refined the coding frame based on a random 10% subsample of articles (n = 163), and a code descriptor document was developed to facilitate consistent interpretation of codes.</p>
<p>We used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to validate the coding frame. A process of double-coding and measurement of inter-rater reliability was employed to help identify any codes that were either interpreted incorrectly or applied inconsistently, and allow coding definitions to be refined. Working separately, CHB and LH double-coded a 10% sample (n = 163), and Cohen’s kappa coefficient was used to calculate inter-rater agreement for each code [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref036">36</xref>]. 66% of codes returned a kappa score &gt;0.4, which is typically interpreted as ‘moderate’ agreement or better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref037">37</xref>]. Where less than substantial agreement was identified (kappa &lt;0.61), code definitions were discussed within the research team and the coding frame and descriptor document were revised as required.</p>
<p>For final coding, the 50% random sample of the articles was used to allow the capture of a representative sample of media coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref039">39</xref>]. The coding process entailed carefully reading the full text of each article, and, for each thematic code, recording whether the article overtly contained content relevant to that code; for example, a <italic>Daily Mail (29</italic>.<italic>05</italic>.<italic>2015)</italic> article that stated <italic>“The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition last week called on the nation to halve the current recommended intake of sugar to seven teaspoons a day to tackle the growing obesity and diabetes crisis”</italic> was coded as both associating sugar with obesity and diabetes (either independently or through the mechanism of obesity). CHB completed final coding and coded data were entered into a spreadsheet and imported into SPSS Statistics 21 for analysis (Supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207576.s002">S2 File</xref>). Data are reported as counts and proportions throughout. Excerpts of text from articles are presented to illustrate quantitative data where appropriate.</p>

<p>The health impacts of sugar were primarily defined weight gain or obesity (n = 481, 70.3%), followed by diabetes (n = 224, 32.7%), tooth decay (n = 125, 18.3%) and other diseases such as heart disease (n = 192, 28.1%). For example, the <italic>Observer</italic> (<italic>26</italic>.<italic>06</italic>.<italic>2016</italic>) described sugar as “<italic>a major dietary villain […] associated with obesity and other chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease</italic>”, and identified tooth decay as “<italic>the most common reason for five- to nine-year-olds to be admitted to hospital</italic>”. Consequently, 149 (21.8%) articles described sugar consumption as a burden on the NHS; <italic>The Express</italic> (<italic>15</italic>.<italic>02</italic>.<italic>2016</italic>) characterised high prevalence of type 2 diabetes prevalence as <italic>“the time bomb facing NHS”</italic>, while <italic>The Times</italic> (<italic>5</italic>.<italic>01</italic>.<italic>2016</italic>) labelled the same phenomenon a <italic>“health crisis”</italic> and an <italic>“ever-growing cost to the NHS now estimated at £10 billion a year”</italic>.</p>
<p>Articles that focused on SSBs as a source of problems characterised SSBs as being people’s single biggest source of dietary sugar (n = 64, 9.4%), having no nutritional value (n = 45, 6.6%), and not satiating the appetite, and therefore not reducing calorie intake from food (n = 11, 1.6%). A minority of articles (n = 71, 10.4%) suggested that problems of sugar consumption have been exaggerated. Typifying this, an article in <italic>The Sun</italic> (<italic>21</italic>.<italic>05</italic>.<italic>2016</italic>) titled <italic>“Sham of sugar tax as sales plummet”</italic> reported that soft drink sales had fallen “<italic>without a sugar tax</italic>”.</p>

<p>The most frequently mentioned specific industrial drivers were: producing (and failing to reformulate) “unhealthy” products (n = 306, 44.7%); advertising and marketing (n = 165, 24.1%); pricing and promotions (n = 114, 16.7%); and inadequate self-regulation (n = 111, 16.2%). A <italic>Sunday Times</italic> editorial (<italic>7</italic>.<italic>02</italic>.<italic>2016</italic>) encapsulated many of these, reporting that unhealthy food manufacturers have <italic>“hidden behind sport to promote their products”</italic>, and voluntary plans to reformulate products <italic>“do not go far enough”</italic>, while <italic>“our kids are being directly targeted through the content they love”</italic>.

<title>Potential solutions</title>
<p>Most articles (n = 588, 86.0%) mentioned one or more potential solution to the problem of sugar consumption. Each specific solution was assigned to one of four categories: individual, voluntary industrial action, societal and governmental (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0207576.t004">Table 4</xref>). Most articles mentioned a governmental solution (n = 473, 69.2%), while 318 (46.5%) mentioned voluntary industrial solutions, 190 (27.8%) mentioned individual solutions and 161 (23.5%) mentioned societal solutions. Articles often mentioned drivers from more than one category, but some articles only mentioned solutions from one category; 135 (19.7%) articles exclusively mentioned governmental solutions, while fewer mentioned industrial (n = 60, 8.8%), individual (n = 20, 2.9%) or societal (n = 2, 0.3%) solutions.</p>

<p>Frequencies of mentions of specific solutions within the four categories are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0207576.t004">Table 4</xref>. The most frequently mentioned governmental solutions were: taxation of SSBs (n = 308, 45.0%); stronger industry regulation in general (n = 270, 39.5%); and general sugar taxation (n = 185, 27.0%). A <italic>Daily Mail</italic> article (<italic>26</italic>.<italic>01</italic>.<italic>2016</italic>) reported that the WHO described <italic>“a tax on sugary drinks as one of nine urgent actions that governments should take to fight childhood obesity”</italic>, while <italic>The Sun</italic> (<italic>11</italic>.<italic>01</italic>.<italic>2016</italic>) reported that <italic>“PHE’s proposed rate of SSB taxation should be increased to 50%”</italic> and an opinion piece in <italic>The Guardian</italic> (<italic>11</italic>.<italic>04</italic>.<italic>2016</italic>) suggested that <italic>“it makes sense as well to regulate what kind of extraneous sugars make it into packaged foods”</italic>. The most frequently mentioned industrial solution was continued or greater voluntary action (n = 298, 43.6%). A <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> article (<italic>26</italic>.<italic>05</italic>.<italic>2016</italic>) written by a Coca-Cola executive described the corporation’s voluntary product reformulation and marketing activities, with which they <italic>“seek to encourage more people […] to choose a no sugar drink”</italic>, while the <italic>Daily Mirror</italic> (<italic>23</italic>.<italic>01</italic>.<italic>2016</italic>) reported that <italic>“soft drink giants have vowed to help cut sugar by a fifth to tackle obesity”</italic>.</p>
<p>As well as mentioning a range of specific solutions, 66 (n = 9.6%) articles highlighted the necessity for a coordinated set of measures from multiple sectors; <italic>The Guardian</italic> (<italic>4</italic>.<italic>02</italic>.<italic>2016</italic>) reported that <italic>“the multi-faceted reasons behind obesity will not be dealt with by a blunt rise in cost”</italic>, arguing that <italic>“more complex proposals to help tackle the crisis include reformulation; reduced portion sizes; restriction on advertising and marketing to children of certain products high in fat</italic>, <italic>salt or sugar; promotions of healthier food ranges; and further voluntary proposals for cleared labelling</italic>”, as well as highlighting the importance of education.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Newspaper coverage of sugar and SSB consumption, and potential fiscal measures targeted at reducing consumption, has become increasingly high profile. Peaks in coverage coincided with three key policy events: PHE’s report on sugar reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref010">10</xref>], evidence of effectiveness of the Mexican sugar tax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref015">15</xref>], and the UK Government’s SDIL announcement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref019">19</xref>]. Articles were predominantly favourable towards taxation as a solution, particularly around the first two peaks, but there was evidence of a surge in opposition coinciding with the SDIL announcement. Most articles presented sugar as a health concern (76.6%), and the risks were often associated with children (39.9%). The problem of ‘excessive sugar’ consumption was characterised as being driven by the food and drink industry (n = 58.2%) (specifically their production (44.7%) and marketing (24.1%) of ‘unhealthy’, sugary products), and primarily characterised as having governmental solutions (69.2%), though industrial voluntary responsibility was also mentioned frequently (46.5%).</p>
<p>Our research represents a rigorous analysis of the framing of the problem of excessive sugar consumption within a representative sample of UK national newspaper articles. It offers insight into how the issue, its drivers and its potential solutions were presented to public audiences during a period of heightened public scrutiny of sugar and SSBs. These findings contribute to understandings of media representations of sugar and SSBs and the public policy landscape, and may inform future public health advocacy and media engagement related to unhealthy commodities and their potential policy solutions. This study cannot make claims about how audiences interpreted the content analysed, or how the policy process was affected by those interpretations. However, it builds upon literature establishing the powerful influence that media framing of health issues can have [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref042">42</xref>] and the importance of understanding how the corporations that manufacture and market unhealthy commodities are represented in the media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref044">44</xref>]. Furthermore, it also builds upon Elliott-Green and colleagues’ earlier analysis of UK newspaper representations of SSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Our findings can be compared directly with Elliott-Green and colleagues’ analysis of public health advocacy versus pro-industry messaging within UK newspaper coverage of SSBs in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref027">27</xref>]. In line with escalations in the policy debate, our analysis indicates coverage of sugar and SSBs continued to increase in 2015–16, illustrating the evolution of sugar from a relatively low-profile issue to frequent, often front-page, news. Furthermore, comparison of the two time-periods illustrates a change in narrative focus from defining the problem to discussing solutions. Articles in both periods shared a focus on obesity and health impacts, but differed somewhat in their representations of solutions. While articles about SSBs published in 2014 identified individual-level solutions more frequently than policy solutions, the articles in our sample gave more focus to governmental solutions, such as taxation and regulation of industry, and the ‘industry-friendly messaging’ identified in 2014 was less evident in our sample. Our findings thus complement research into debates about other unhealthy commodities. The stark rise in articles predominantly opposed to SSB taxation contemporaneous with the announcement of the SDIL echoes late ‘surges’ in opposition to tobacco control identified prior to elections and policy events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>This research illustrates a recent media debate that was largely favourable to sugar reduction policy specifically, and to evidence-based public health advocacy more generally. The peaks in coverage demonstrate how public health reports and evidence can stimulate media agenda setting, and public health advocates will welcome the overwhelming representation of sugar and SSBs as a society-wide health problem, primarily driven by the food and drink industries, and best addressed through policy measures. While many articles identified the need for individuals to make healthier choices, they were outnumbered by articles framing the problem as driven by industrial and environmental phenomena. Consistent with political science theory, this may raise public awareness of the commercial determinants of health, in turn influencing public attitudes to policy solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref047">47</xref>]. However, given that forms of voluntary industrial action were often cited as solutions, public health policy advocates’ task of promoting the appropriateness and necessity of governmental solutions is not finished. As such, ongoing media engagement may need to focus on the potential benefits of the ‘nanny state’. Acceptance of this may be a prerequisite for successfully addressing the problems of sugar and SSB consumption, for which ‘downstream’ interventions such as voluntary industry responsibility pledges have been found wanting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref049">49</xref>]. Furthermore, while the frames constructed by newspaper articles were predominantly favourable to public health advocacy, and supportive coverage outnumbered oppositional coverage, public health stakeholders should be aware of the predominance of oppositional articles around the announcement of the SDIL; a surge of opposition that a coordinated campaign of media advocacy might have mitigated.</p>
<p>This study’s findings are subject to a number of limitations. Firstly, while double-coding and inter-rater agreement were used to validate the coding instrument to foster consistency of interpretation and application, the final dataset was not double-coded, such that we can present no statistical measure of consistency of coding. However, the rigorous double-coding of a subsample of articles, and continued dialogue between both coders during that process, ensured that the final coding instrument was validated. Thus facilitating consistent interpretation and application of codes in final coding, within the limitations imposed by the inherently interpretive process of coding text content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref051">51</xref>]. Secondly, our findings reflect commentary exclusively presented in newsprint and cannot be generalised to broader media, particularly social media sources. Finally, the focus on manifest content analysis means that we may have over-looked subtleties in the debate, especially the nuanced way arguments representing multiple codes were constructed by stakeholders in supporting or opposing a point of view. These limitations notwithstanding, this is a comprehensive, robust study of newsprint representations of the policy debate around SSB taxation and the SDIL, which brings up to date earlier work in the area in both the UK and United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Development and support for public health policy in relation to food and drink has been portrayed as problematic, in a way that is not the case for other commodities associated with ill health such as alcohol and tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0207576.ref054">54</xref>]. Further research is needed to explore the complexities of food and nutrition policy formulation. For example by undertaking latent content analysis of stakeholder argumentation to identify direct lobbying of the public by both proponents and opponents of such policy measures. It would also be useful to extend the analysis of similarities and differences across so called “unhealthy commodity industries”, to understand why food policy is regarded differently and thus formulate strategies to promote policy support.</p>
<p>In conclusion research across different perspectives and contexts, (including the media), thus has a potentially important role. It can inform the public health policy debate process, and thus equip stakeholders to better advocate for future evidence-based public health policies.</p>
