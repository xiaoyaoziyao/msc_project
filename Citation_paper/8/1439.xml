<abstract>
<p>Quantifying in-house emissions of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) from liquid manure (slurry) is difficult due to high background emissions from enteric processes, yet of great importance for correct estimation of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from manure management and effects of treatment technologies such as anaerobic digestion. In this study CH<sub>4</sub> production rates were determined in 20 pig slurry and 11 cattle slurry samples collected beneath slatted floors on six representative farms; rates were determined within 24 h at temperatures close to the temperature in slurry pits at the time of collection. Methane production rates in pig and cattle slurry differed significantly at 0.030 and 0.011 kg CH<sub>4</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> VS (volatile solids). Current estimates of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from pig and cattle manure management correspond to 0.032 and 0.015 kg CH<sub>4</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, indicating that slurry pits under animal confinements are a significant source. Fractions of degradable volatile solids (VS<sub>d</sub>, kg kg<sup>-1</sup> VS) were estimated using an aerobic biodegradability assay and total organic C analyses. The VS<sub>d</sub> in pig and cattle slurry averaged 0.51 and 0.33 kg kg<sup>-1</sup> VS, and it was estimated that on average 43 and 28% of VS<sub>d</sub> in fresh excreta from pigs and cattle, respectively, had been lost at the time of sampling. An empirical model of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from slurry was reparameterised based on experimental results. A sensitivity analysis indicated that predicted CH<sub>4</sub> emissions were highly sensitive to uncertainties in the value of lnA of the Arrhenius equation, but much less sensitive to uncertainties in VS<sub>d</sub> or slurry temperature. A model application indicated that losses of carbon in VS as CO<sub>2</sub> may be much greater than losses as CH<sub>4</sub>. Implications of these results for the correct estimation of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from manure management, and for the mitigation potential of treatments such as anaerobic digestion, are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In North America and Western Europe around 40% of livestock manure is handled in liquid form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref001">1</xref>]. Liquid manure (slurry) represents a mainly anaerobic environment and is a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), which is the second-largest anthropogenic source of radiative forcing next to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref002">2</xref>]. Volumes of liquid manure increase in many parts of the world due to intensification of livestock production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref003">3</xref>], and thus it becomes increasingly important to determine effects of manure treatment and management on emissions of CH<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p>In Denmark anaerobic digestion of liquid manure together with energy-rich co-digestates is promoted for bioenergy production, with the ambition that 50% of the total slurry volume should be treated in farm-scale or centralised biogas digesters. The hydrolysis, fermentation and methanogenesis of degradable volatile solids (VS) during anaerobic digestion has the potential to reduce CH<sub>4</sub> emissions during storage. However, only post-digestion emissions are reduced, and the collection period in slurry pits on the farm is also a source of CH<sub>4</sub> due to VS degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref004">4</xref>]. This has implications for the evaluation of climate impacts of anaerobic digestion because CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from manure management could be underestimated, and the amount of VS available for bioenergy production overestimated, if the composition of VS excreted is used as proxy for the potential bioenergy production. Methods to document CH<sub>4</sub> emissions and VS loss from slurry pits are therefore urgently needed.</p>
<p>The guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref005">5</xref>] only contains a tentative and static method to estimate CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from slurry pits under animal confinements. It is represented by methane conversion factors (MCFs) that indicate the proportion of the biological CH<sub>4</sub> production potential emitted. For example, with &lt;30 d storage in slurry pits MCFs of 3 and 30% are recommended for regions with mean annual temperatures below and above 25°C, respectively. Considering the diversity of housing systems, management practices and temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref006">6</xref>], this approach is clearly inadequate for any detailed assessment of climate impacts.</p>
<p>Quantifying CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from slurry pits in representative housing systems may be a first step towards an improved methodology for estimating the source strength of slurry pits under animal confinements. Representativeness is defined not only by design parameters but also by manure management, since practices such as emptying routine and cleaning between production cycles can affect in-house emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref009">9</xref>]. Direct measurements of in-house CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from manure are complicated by the fact that these emissions are not readily separated from those derived from enteric processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref010">10</xref>]. Monteny et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref004">4</xref>] estimated the contribution from manure to total CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from housing facilities for dairy cattle and pigs (i.e., not including emissions from outside storage tanks or lagoons) at, respectively, 17–25 and 65–70%. Since direct emissions from livestock may vary also with time of day and stage of a production cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref012">12</xref>], estimation of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from manure with a mass balance approach is highly uncertain. An alternative strategy would be to collect manure samples for determination of CH<sub>4</sub> production rates under controlled conditions.</p>
<p>Attempts have been made to predict CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from slurry pits. Mechanistic modelling is difficult due to the requirement of data for model parameterisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref013">13</xref>]. A simpler, empirical approach was proposed by Sommer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>] who described algorithms to quantify daily CH<sub>4</sub> emissions during in-house (and outside) storage, with degradation of manure VS and storage temperature as the main drivers. This model allows for estimation of daily CH<sub>4</sub> emission and VS loss in slurry pits, and hence could also help estimate the loss of biogas potential. However, Sommer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>] used data from different storage experiments for parameterisation, and until now this empirical model has not been evaluated against experimental data.</p>
<p>The objectives of the study presented here were 1) to estimate CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from slurry pits on pig and cattle farms delivering slurry for centralised biogas production; and 2) to derive parameters for the model of Sommer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>] based on experimental results, in order to produce a generalised representation of the emissions applicable to further analysis. To meet these objectives a screening program was conducted in which slurry materials were collected and, within 24 h, incubated at near-ambient temperature to determine CH<sub>4</sub> production rates. The slurry materials were further characterised with respect to VS composition as a basis for model parameterisation, and model predictions were compared with current CH<sub>4</sub> emission estimates for these manure categories based on the IPCC methodology.</p>

<p>Liquid manure (slurry) from dairy and pig farms delivering slurry to a centralised biogas facility in Thorsø, Western Denmark was collected for this study. Based on statistical information about livestock production and housing types in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref015">15</xref>], representative pig and cattle farms were contacted, followed by on-site interviews and inspection. From this survey seven farms were selected for the monitoring program and farmers contacted to gain permission for sampling. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160968.t001">Table 1</xref> shows animal category, housing, and slurry system, as well as slurry collection frequency, for each farm. Also shown are the number of visits and individual samples collected per visit, which amounted to a total of 12 cattle slurry and 27 pig slurry samples; more samples could be obtained on pig farms which had several production lines in separate sections.</p>

<p>Slurry pits on pig farms were in most cases 40–60 cm deep and less than half full at sampling. In contrast, on dairy farms G1 and G2 the ring channel was always kept nearly full since a large liquid phase is needed for mobilisation and transport of manure organic matter when exported. On dairy farms G5 and G6 the pit was backflushed with slurry from a pre-tank. The number of samples which could be processed within this study was too limited to characterise individual production systems, and samples were therefore categorised as either cattle slurry or pig slurry.</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Sampling procedure</title>
<p>Sampling took place on several days between 18 November and 11 December 2014 to allow processing of all samples within 24 h. Separate manual bilge pumps were used on each farm to collect 3-liter samples in 5-liter buckets from below slatted floors, pooling several subsamples from different positions to give the final sample. Air and slurry temperatures were registered at or close to the positions where slurry was sampled using a SAF-T-LOG<sup>®</sup> HACCP ThermoMeter with a 1.4-meter probe and an accuracy of 0.4°C (ThermoWorks, Lindon, UT). Upon return to the laboratory slurry samples were stored outside until the following day (mean night temperatures between 0 and 7°C).</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Determination of CH<sub>4</sub> production rates</title>
<p>Slurry processing for determination of CH<sub>4</sub> production rates largely followed the procedure described by Elsgaard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref016">16</xref>]. Three-gram portions of each slurry material were transferred to eight 28 mL test tubes while flushing the headspace with N<sub>2</sub> following the Hungate approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref017">17</xref>]. Each test tube (subsample) was immediately closed with butyl rubber septum and crimp seal and placed on ice to temporarily arrest methanogenesis while completing sample preparation. Two subsamples were shaken vigorously for 1 min to release dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> and then sampled as described below for gas chromatographic analysis; this information was later used as background when calculating rates of CH<sub>4</sub> production during incubation. The other six subsamples were incubated at a temperature close to the temperatures recorded in slurry pits at the respective farm units.</p>
<p>The first batch of samples was incubated in a thermo-gradient incubator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref018">18</xref>]; due to technical problems subsequent incubations were done using water baths operated at temperatures of approximately 10 and 20°C, respectively. The exact average temperature of water baths was certified with data from immersed temperature loggers (Hobo Pendant Temperature Data logger; Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA). An incubation time of 17 h was used based on the results of Elsgaard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Around 0.5 h before end of incubation up to 3 mL N<sub>2</sub> was added to the headspace to ensure sufficient gas volume for sampling. By the end of incubation samples were shaken to release dissolved gases, and then a 10 mL glass syringe was used to determine headspace volume at atmospheric pressure. Then a 3 mL sample of the headspace gas was transferred to a 6 mL Exetainer (Labco Inc., Lampeter, UK) pre-equilibrated to atmospheric pressure with N<sub>2</sub> (i.e., the vials were pressurised for analysis). Methane concentrations were determined on an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph (GC) with CTC CombiPal autosampler (Agilent, Nærum, Denmark). For CH<sub>4</sub> analysis the GC had a 2 m backflushed pre-column with Hayesep P connected to a 2 m main column with Poropak Q. The main column was connected to a flame ionization detector (FID). The carrier gas was N<sub>2</sub> at a flow rate of 45 mL min<sup>−1</sup>. The FID was supplied with 45 mL min<sup>−1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>, 450 mL min<sup>−1</sup> air and 20 mL min<sup>−1</sup> N<sub>2</sub>. Temperatures of injection port, columns and FID were 80, 80 and 200°C, respectively. The method detection limit for CH<sub>4</sub> was 0.2 μL L<sup>-1</sup>. Observed concentrations ranged from 20 to 7000 μL L<sup>-1</sup>; the detector response was linear over this range (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.999) as determined by standards prepared from a reference gas with 47,500 μL L<sup>-1</sup> CH<sub>4</sub> (AGA; Copenhagen, Denmark).</p>
<p>The measured CH<sub>4</sub> production rates were corrected to the exact temperature of slurry pit or ring channel at the time of sampling using the equation:

<title>Slurry analyses</title>
<p>Slurry pH and electrical conductivity were measured using a pH/conductivity meter (CyberScan PC 300, EUTECH Instruments, Landsmeer, Netherlands). Slurry dry matter was determined by drying of approx. 10 g slurry fresh wt. subsamples at 105°C for 24 h. Slurry VS was determined by incineration of the dried material at 450°C for 5 h.</p>
<p>An estimate of degradable VS (VS<sub>d</sub>) in the slurry materials was needed for model calculations (see below). Samples collected in slurry pits are characterised by an unknown degree of degradation, and therefore data from the literature representing fresh excreta, such as those derived by Sommer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>], could not be used. Instead an aerobic assay was adopted in which VS<sub>d</sub> was estimated from the ratio between short-term CO<sub>2</sub>-C production during aerobic incubation and total organic carbon (TOC) in each slurry sample. Total organic carbon (g C kg<sup>-1</sup> fresh wt.) was analysed in triplicate by a cuvette test LCK 387 (DR 3900, HACH Lange; Düsseldorf, Germany) using a standard method (EN 1484). For determination of VS<sub>d</sub>, 5 g slurry samples were surface-applied to sandy loam soil packed in 100-cm<sup>3</sup> cylinders to a bulk density of 1.2 g cm<sup>-3</sup>, and with soil moisture adjusted to 40% water-filled pore space. Preliminary tests showed that aerobic degradation of slurry VS would predominate under these assay conditions. The samples were incubated in a Respicond VI respirometer (Nordgren Innovation AB, Bygdeå, Sweden) at 20°C for 14 d where potential CO<sub>2</sub> evolution was determined by hourly measurements of conductivity in alkaline traps. The CO<sub>2</sub> accumulated over time (<italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, g C kg<sup>-1</sup> fresh wt. slurry), corrected for background emissions from the soil, was used to estimate the asymptotic maximum (<italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub>) with an exponential model:

<p>The housing systems visited in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160968.t001">Table 1</xref>) represented 52% of all LU in Denmark where 78% of livestock manure is handled in liquid form. Ring channels and passively drained slurry pits are only partly emptied when slurry is exported, and therefore adapted methanogens will be present to inoculate fresh excreta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref004">4</xref>]. This is important because then physical and chemical characteristics of the slurry will mainly determine the CH<sub>4</sub> production potential.</p>
<p>Summary statistics for selected slurry properties are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160968.t003">Table 3</xref>; details about individual samples are included as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160968.s004">S1 Table</xref>. Slurry temperature in pig houses ranged from 14.8 to 22.3°C, and in cattle houses from 5.5 to 12.3°C (with one outlier at 16°C which was probably caused by inflow of water used for cleaning of an adjacent milking parlour). Cattle slurry was characterised by higher dry matter and volatile solids content compared to pig slurry. Total organic C, determined by a wet destruction method, was well correlated with slurry VS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160968.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) (r = 0.91, n = 38), and there was on average 0.42 and 0.44 kg C kg<sup>-1</sup> VS in cattle and pig slurry, respectively. According to Derikx et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref021">21</xref>] there is a potential for loss of volatile fatty acids during oven drying which could lead to underestimation of VS. Since TOC is unaffected by this source of error, loss of volatile fatty acids would result in TOC:VS ratios being overestimated. The average carbon contents of crude lipid, crude protein and carbohydrates are around 77, 53 and 40–44%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref022">22</xref>]. These values are higher than or similar to the TOC:VS ratios observed here, suggesting that losses of VS during oven drying were not a major source of error.</p>

<p>Histograms of the rate distributions for pig and cattle slurry are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160968.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Shapiro-Wilks tests for normality were accepted for both slurry types. Mean CH<sub>4</sub> production rates observed with cattle slurry were around five times lower than rates observed with pig slurry. This was partly explained by the lower storage temperature in cattle houses with passive ventilation, but degradability of VS in cattle excreta was probably also lower, as indicated by VS<sub>d</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160968.t003">Table 3</xref>). For pig slurry a negative relationship between time since the last emptying and CH<sub>4</sub> production rate was indicated, but it was not significant (<italic>p =</italic> 0.27, <italic>n</italic> = 18).</p>

<p>The laboratory-based CH<sub>4</sub> production rates observed in this study may be compared with rates derived from the national inventory of agricultural GHG emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref023">23</xref>]. Here daily excretion of VS by pigs and cattle, and the emission of CH<sub>4</sub> from manure management per head per year, is reported (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160968.t005">Table 5</xref>), and based on this information CH<sub>4</sub> emissions per kg VS of 0.032 and 0.015 kg CH<sub>4</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> VS from pig and cattle slurry, respectively, can be estimated. In the present study daily CH<sub>4</sub> emission rates per kg VS were determined. Assuming a retention time in slurry pits of 15 and 30 d for pig and cattle slurry, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>], total emissions from slurry pits of 0.030 and 0.011 kg CH<sub>4</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> VS were estimated which are only sligthly lower than the estimates of total CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from manure management derived from the national inventory. This agreement suggests that the estimates of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from manure management in the national inventory (including emissions from both confinements and storage facilities) are at a realistic level. The fact that CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from slurry pits observed here were only slightly lower than total estimated emissions from manure management is evidence that the proportion of CH<sub>4</sub> emitted from slurry pits is substantial, and that possibly total CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from pits and outside storage tanks are currently underestimated.</p>

<title>Model parameters: Degradable VS (VS<sub>d</sub>)</title>
<p>Sommer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>] estimated the degradability of VS in fresh excreta at 0.89 and 0.46 kg VS<sub>d</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> VS in pig and cattle slurry, respectively. These values can be related to the default values for <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> (i.e., the maximum CH<sub>4</sub> producing capacity of VS excreted; <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> is also referred to as biochemical methane potential, BMP) proposed in the IPCC methodology ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref005">5</xref>]; Annex 10A.2) which are 0.45 m<sup>3</sup> CH<sub>4</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> VS for pigs, and 0.24 m<sup>3</sup> CH<sub>4</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> VS for dairy cattle: At normal temperature and pressure (NTP), 1 m<sup>3</sup> CH<sub>4</sub> gas is equivalent to 0.503 kg CH<sub>4</sub>-C, and assuming a 60:40 molar ratio between produced CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> during <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref024">24</xref>], this would correspond to a loss of 0.838 kg C m<sup>-3</sup> CH<sub>4</sub>. Using the observed proportions of C in VS, i.e., 0.44 kg C kg<sup>-1</sup> in pig slurry and 0.42 kg C kg<sup>-1</sup> VS in cattle slurry, the <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> of 0.45 m<sup>3</sup> CH<sub>4</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> VS for pigs corresponds to a VS degradability of 0.86 kg kg<sup>-1</sup> VS, and the <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> of 0.24 m<sup>3</sup> CH<sub>4</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> VS for cattle corresponds to a VS degradability of 0.48 kg kg<sup>-1</sup> VS. Thus, pools of VS<sub>d</sub> in pig and cattle slurry defined by Sommer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>] are largely equivalent to <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> values as defined in the IPCC methodology.</p>
<p>The slurry collected in pits was partly degraded at the time of collection, and therefore characteristics of fresh excreta did not apply. Instead an estimate of VS<sub>d</sub> was obtained using a 14-day biodegradation assay to monitor CO<sub>2</sub>-C evolution; results and curve fits are shown in the online Annex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160968.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160968.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Maximum CO<sub>2</sub>-C (<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0160968.e002">Eq 2</xref>, Materials and Methods) was related to TOC as an estimate of VS<sub>d</sub> in individual slurry samples (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0160968.e003">Eq 3</xref>, Materials and Methods). The aerobic assay was preferred partly because of the shorter time required compared to anaerobic batch incubation for determination of <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>, and partly because of the complications associated with determination of <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref027">27</xref>]. It is well accepted that both aerobic degradation and anaerobic degradation of organic matter follow first-order degradation kinetics, but with different specific reaction constants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref028">28</xref>]. Lesteur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref026">26</xref>] reviewed several methods for estimating anaerobic biodegradability of an organic substrate and concluded that VS degradation during a 5 d aerobic incubation as determined by oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) uptake and/or CO<sub>2</sub> evolution was in good agreement with a 21 d anaerobic incubation. Ponsa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref029">29</xref>] also found a strong correlation between aerobic and anaerobic stability indices for municipal solid waste materials. On the other hand, the current manure materials differed widely in DM content and soil infiltration after surface application in the VS<sub>d</sub> assay, and further method development is probably needed to optimise the determination of VS<sub>d</sub>.</p>
<p>The results of VS<sub>d</sub> averaged 0.51 kg VS<sub>d</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> VS for pig slurry and 0.33 kg VS<sub>d</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> VS for cattle slurry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160968.t003">Table 3</xref>); this was, respectively, 43 and 28% lower than the VS<sub>d</sub> concentrations in fresh excreta as defined by Sommer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>] (cf. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160968.t002">Table 2</xref>). These results suggested that significant VS degradation had already occurred during the short-term storage in slurry pits.</p>

<title>Model parameters: Arrhenius parameters (E<sub>a</sub> and lnA)</title>
<p>An <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> value of 81 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> was adopted from Elsgaard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref016">16</xref>] which was much lower than the value of 112.7 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> derived by Sommer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>] from three different slurry storage experiments. The storage experiments used by Sommer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>] ranged in duration from a few days and up to one year, and hence factors other than temperature could have influenced the relationship. For example, Petersen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref030">30</xref>] calculated tentative <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> values of only 21–25 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> for CH<sub>4</sub> emissions across winter and summer storage experiments with pig slurry, and it was concluded that depletion of degradable VS during summer storage probably resulted in underestimation of the response to higher temperatures. Other models of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from manure, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref032">32</xref>], have used a value of 63 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> derived from a number of different studies covering a temperature range from 15 to 60°C. In contrast, the <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> value reported by Elsgaard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref016">16</xref>] was derived from complete temperature response profiles of individual manure materials and digestates, and representing a temperature range (5 to 35°C) relevant for manure storage, which indicates that this is currently the most robust estimate available for the temperature response of CH<sub>4</sub> production in livestock slurry during storage.</p>
<p>The lnA values used by Sommer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>] were also very different from those determined experimentally in this study. It should, however, be noted that Sommer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>], due to limited availability of data for parameterization, fitted lnA to produce the same annual emission as the IPCC methodology. The parameter lnA reflects a potential for CH<sub>4</sub> production that is influenced by chemical and biological characteristics of the manure material (livestock category, age, and adaptation of the methanogenic microbial community). In the present study lnA was derived for each slurry sample using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0160968.e005">Eq 5</xref> (cf. Materials and Methods), and the observed lnA averaged 31.3 and 31.2 g CH<sub>4</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> VS h<sup>-1</sup> for pig and cattle slurry, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160968.t002">Table 2</xref>). In comparison, the lnA values observed by Elsgaard et al.

The pig and cattle slurry analysed by Elsgaard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref016">16</xref>] had been collected during at least six months, and so the lower values of lnA compared to samples from slurry pits probably reflected the more advanced stage of decomposition.</p>

<title>Parameter sensitivity</title>
<p>The response of predicted CH<sub>4</sub> production rates to uncertainties in parameter estimates were evaluated by calculation of sensitivity ratios (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0160968.e006">Eq 6</xref>, Materials and Methods) for each of the parameters lnA, VS<sub>d</sub> and slurry temperature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160968.t006">Table 6</xref>). In each case the 95% confidence limits were selected as upper and lower boundaries of parameter uncertainty. Predicted CH<sub>4</sub> production rates were only moderately sensitive to uncertainties in the estimation of VS<sub>d</sub> or slurry temperature, but dramatically affected by uncertainty in the estimation of lnA. This confirms that lnA must be determined experimentally for slurry representing a given livestock category and production system, whereas the precision required is smaller for VS<sub>d</sub>. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160968.g002">Fig 2</xref> where the observed lnA or VS<sub>d</sub> for individual slurry samples were substituted by the average observed value for lnA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160968.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) or VS<sub>d</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160968.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Clearly, deviations between predicted and observed values were large when using average values of lnA for pig and cattle slurry, whereas the adoption of average VS<sub>d</sub> rather than individual values had little effect on the prediction. This suggests that adoption of a typical VS<sub>d</sub> estimate for a given livestock category and production system may be acceptable if combined with observed CH<sub>4</sub> production rates, which allows calculation of lnA for individual slurry samples. This further implies that, with a representative set of slurry samples from a given livestock category and production system, it is possible to derive a robust estimate of mean lnA with confidence limits which can be used in scenario analyses.</p>

<title>Implications for the estimation of CH<sub>4</sub> emission and VS loss</title>
<p>The current IPCC methodology for estimating CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from slurry pits under animal confinements relies on very basic emission factors. On-farm verification of this source is extremely difficult, and an estimation method linking CH<sub>4</sub> production rates to quantifiable slurry properties would be an attractive alternative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160968.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The approach adopted in this study, corresponding to a Tier 3 method in the IPCC terminology, may represent such an alternative for estimating current CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from slurry below animal confinements. Furthermore, the method could help compare the mitigation potential of contrasting management practices, and effects of manure treatment technologies such as anaerobic digestion.</p>
<p>Observed CH<sub>4</sub> production rates were well described using the empirical model with experimentally derived parameters for VS<sub>d</sub>, slurry temperature in the pit, an independent estimate of <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref016">16</xref>], and lnA values calculated for individual slurry samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160968.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This is not a prediction model for estimating CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from a wider range of slurry materials, but rather a generalisation of observed CH<sub>4</sub> production rates that will represent a given livestock production system, as defined by livestock category, feeding, housing design, and manure management. The information required for individual slurry samples include CH<sub>4</sub> production rate, temperature of slurry in the pit at sampling, and total and degradable VS. Our results indicate that from this information a robust estimate of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from a given source may be obtained. The number of slurry samples needed in each case will depend on the diversity of production systems and variability of slurry characteristics.</p>
<p>It was stated above that precise estimation of VS<sub>d</sub> is less critical for the parameterisation of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0160968.e004">Eq 4</xref> to characterise CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from slurry pits for a given livestock category. However, if model parameters are to be used for scenario analyses, the loss of VS and VS<sub>d</sub> over time is still important, since prediction of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions on a daily basis also requires an estimate of daily VS loss. Carbon in VS is lost as both CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, and the proportions of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> can vary depending on storage conditions. For example, significant aerobic degradation of carbon in VS to CO<sub>2</sub> may take place near the slurry-air interface, as demonstrated by Møller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref033">33</xref>]. Patni and Jui [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref034">34</xref>] also concluded that aerobic degradation was responsible for declining VS concentrations in the top layer during storage of cattle slurry. Significant degradation of carbon in VS to CO<sub>2</sub> may also be inferred from numerous slurry storage experiments reporting CH<sub>4</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> ratios of 0.1–0.3, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref038">38</xref>]. Factors such as design of slurry pits, ventilation and retention time will all influence the exposure of slurry to atmospheric oxygen and, presumably, the balance between CO<sub>2</sub>-C and CH<sub>4</sub>-C emitted from slurry pits.</p>
<p>There is further evidence that the CH<sub>4</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of gases emitted from stored slurry declines with decreasing temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref035">35</xref>]. This would be consistent with a recent report that temperature sensitivity of methanogenic communities is higher than that of ecosystem respiration, i.e., 0.93 and 0.65 eV, respectively, corresponding to <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> values of 89 and 63 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, which implies that CH<sub>4</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> ratios will decline with temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>An attempt was made to assess proportions of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emitted assuming VS<sub>d</sub> of 0.89 and 0.46 kg kg<sup>-1</sup> VS in fresh excreta from pigs and cattle, and retention times in the pit of 15 and 30 d for pig and cattle slurry, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160968.ref014">14</xref>]. Using the observed mean slurry temperatures in pig and cattle slurry with 95% confidence limits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160968.t003">Table 3</xref>), and the revised Arrhenius parameters from this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160968.t002">Table 2</xref>), the daily loss of total VS and VS<sub>d</sub> was calculated for different proportions of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. Specifically, CH<sub>4</sub>/(CH<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>) ratios of 0.05, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 were used, corresponding to 5, 10, 30 or 60% of carbon in VS being emitted as CH<sub>4</sub>, and the rest as CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Total residual VS calculated for each CH<sub>4</sub>/(CH<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>) ratio are shown in the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160968.g003">Fig 3</xref>, and in the bottom panel residual concentrations of VS<sub>d</sub>. Here, the gray hatched area represents the 95% confidence range of the experimentally determined residual VS<sub>d</sub>, while the black and red lines represent, respectively, the average and 95% confidence limits of modeled residual VS<sub>d</sub>. The overlapping confidence ranges then indicate the range of CH<sub>4</sub>/(CH<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>) ratios consistent with the observed residual VS<sub>d</sub> concentrations. According to these plots 5–15% of carbon from pig slurry VS was emitted as CH<sub>4</sub>, and 85–95% as CO<sub>2</sub>. For cattle slurry 5–35% of carbon in VS degraded was emitted as CH<sub>4</sub>, and 65–95% as CO<sub>2</sub>. These ranges seem to confirm the results from storage experiments cited above, and it must be concluded that loss of VS as CO<sub>2</sub> are substantial and must be taken into account when estimating the loss of degradable VS in slurry pits. In this example, VS and VS<sub>d</sub> in fresh excreta were not determined experimentally, and hence more work is needed to verify proportions of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> in VS degradation products, as influenced by livestock category and storage conditions.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study presented a new <italic>in-vitro</italic> method for quantifying CH<sub>4</sub> production rates in slurry stored in pits on livestock farms. Observed CH<sub>4</sub> production rates compared well with those currently implied in the national inventory, suggesting that CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from slurry pits can be estimated from slurry samples collected and analysed within 24 h at ambient temperature. An empirical model can be parameterised for individual livestock production systems based on CH<sub>4</sub> production rates and readily measured slurry characteristics, thus providing a generalised form applicable to estimation of methane conversion factors and scenario analysis. The need to account for VS degradation to both CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> was emphasised, since this has important implications for both CH<sub>4</sub> emission estimates, and for the estimation of biogas potentials of livestock slurry.</p>
