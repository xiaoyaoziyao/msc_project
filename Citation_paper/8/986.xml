<abstract>
<p>In this study, we investigated the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase in the dimorphic fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>. This protein (Trt1) contains 1371 amino acids and all of the characteristic TERT motifs. Mutants created by disrupting <italic>trt1</italic> had senescent traits, such as delayed growth, low replicative potential, and reduced survival, that were reminiscent of the traits observed in <italic>est2</italic> budding yeast mutants. Telomerase activity was observed in wild-type fungus sporidia but not those of the disruption mutant. The introduction of a self-replicating plasmid expressing Trt1 into the mutant strain restored growth proficiency and replicative potential. Analyses of <italic>trt1</italic> crosses <italic>in planta</italic> suggested that Trt1 is necessary for teliospore formation in homozygous disrupted diploids and that telomerase is haploinsufficient in heterozygous diploids. Additionally, terminal restriction fragment analysis in the progeny hinted at alternative survival mechanisms similar to those of budding yeast.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Telomerase is a specialized ribonucleic protein complex that synthesizes the repetitive G-rich-DNA motifs constituting telomeres in most eukaryotic cells. The central enzyme components are the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein subunit, which is a specialized reverse transcriptase, and the RNA template for telomere DNA synthesis (TR); both of these components are tightly regulated in normal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Cairney1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Podlevsky1">[2]</xref>. This enzyme plays an important role in telomere lengthening and has been intimately associated with cellular proliferation not only through its telomere-lengthening activity but also through its recently discovered non-telomeric roles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Martinez1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Ding1">[4]</xref>. The reverse transcriptase subunit and RNA template are required for telomere synthesis, but <italic>in vivo</italic>, the TERT subunit is the limiting factor for restored telomerase activity in telomerase-downregulated cells. Therefore, most studies on telomerase regulation have focused on the TERT subunit gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Cukusic1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Westin1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>TERT subunit expression and activity have been detected in unicellular eukaryotes and metazoans. <italic>TERT</italic> can be regulated by diverse mechanisms, including both transcriptional regulation and posttranscriptional alternative mRNA splicing, multimerization, phosphorylation of the telomerase catalytic subunit and ncRNA interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Gomez1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Redon1">[9]</xref>. <italic>TERT</italic> gene expression and telomerase activity have been detected in immortal cells, such as cancer cell lineages and in germinal and pluripotent cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Flores1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Ding2">[12]</xref>; however, in most somatic cells, the <italic>TERT</italic> gene is gradually downregulated as cellular development progresses in the metazoan life cycle, and telomerase activity eventually becomes undetectable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Armstrong1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Choudhary1">[13]</xref>. Because conventional polymerases fail to replicate chromosome ends, telomerase downregulation results in telomere shortening in each replication round until a critical length is reached <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Harley1">[14]</xref>. At this point, in telomerase-deficient cells, cellular proliferation ceases, senescence begins, and self-renewal capability decreases.</p>
<p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the <italic>EST2</italic> gene encodes the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase, and its expression is tightly regulated throughout the yeast cell cycle. When <italic>EST2</italic> is mutated, yeast show a senescent phenotype, and their life span is reduced, as evidenced by an increase in cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Lendvay1">[15]</xref>. Eventually, survivors do appear through homologous recombination pathways, which cause rearrangements in telomeric and subtelomeric sequences that ensure the maintenance of telomere function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Teng1">[16]</xref>. Based on their telomere pattern, yeast survivors are classified into two types: Type I survivors, which exhibit tandem amplification of the Y' element followed by small tracts of telomeric C<sub>1–3</sub>A/TG<sub>1–3</sub> DNA; and Type II survivors, which show very long and heterogeneous tracts of C<sub>1–3</sub>A/TG<sub>1–3</sub> DNA at chromosome termini. The growth and maintenance of the two types of telomere structures have specific genetic requirements, involving more than a dozen genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Hu1">[17]</xref>. In yeast cells, the programmed downregulation of <italic>EST2</italic> does not occur, and natural telomere attrition through successive rounds of DNA replication does not appear to be the main cause of replicative senescence. In this organism, replicative senescence has primarily been associated with the control of genetic pathways involving rDNA metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and proteasome function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Longo1">[18]</xref>. The participation of telomere dysfunction by means other than programmed <italic>EST2</italic> downregulation in natural replicative senescence is currently under investigation. Other lower eukaryotes that undergo developmental transitions in their life cycle could be useful model systems to analyze the evolutionary pathways used to promote telomere maintenance and control by comparing their features with those of vertebrates or yeast-like organisms.</p>
<p><italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, a smut fungus that triggers the formation of tumors in maize, is a well-established model organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Christensen1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Dean1">[22]</xref>. As a biotrophic pathogen, this fungus is an obligate parasite that depends on its host to complete its life cycle. Fungal infection is initiated with the recognition and mating of two compatible yeast-like cells, known as sporidia, on any of the aerial parts of the maize plant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Banuett1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Spellig1">[24]</xref>. Once plasmogamy occurs, the fungus enters into the plant tissue; tumor formation is then governed by a heterodimeric transcriptional regulator that triggers a dimorphic transition and pathogenic development and regulates mycelial growth and teliospore formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Gillissen1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Brefort1">[27]</xref>. Regulatory cascades are initiated for a plethora of genes encoding transcriptional regulators, protein effectors, and virulence factors that subdue plants' defense responses; these processes result in tumor gall development, teliospore formation, and life cycle completion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Vollmeister1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Schirawski1">[29]</xref>. In <italic>U. maydis</italic>, the TTAGGG motif composes the chromosomal end repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Guzman1">[30]</xref>. Analysis of the terminal restriction fragment (TRF) by Southern blotting has indicated that <italic>U. maydis</italic> telomeres are maintained by telomerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-SanchezAlonso1">[31]</xref>. In this study on telomere metabolism in this fungus, we report the identification and functional characterization of the <italic>U. maydis</italic> telomerase reverse transcriptase gene <italic>trt1</italic>.</p>

<title>Identification and disruption of the Trt1 gene in <italic>U. maydis</italic></title>
<p>Bioinformatics analysis of the annotated <italic>U. maydis</italic> genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/genre/proj/ustilago/" xlink:type="simple">http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/genre/proj/ustilago/</ext-link>) revealed that telomerase reverse transcriptase is encoded by a single, uninterrupted open reading frame (ORF). This ORF is predicted to yield a 1371-residue protein that contains all of the conserved domains found in the telomerase catalytic subunits of humans, plants, and fungi. These domains include the seven conserved RT motifs (1, 2, A, B′, C, D, and E) in the reverse transcriptase domain (shown in green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g001">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>) and the conserved motifs CP, QFP, and T from the RNA-binding domain, whose function is required for RNA subunit- binding (shown in red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g001">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>). In addition, the N-terminal region has the potential to house a GQ block (shown in blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g001">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm that <italic>trt1</italic> encodes the Trt1p subunit of <italic>U. maydis</italic> telomerase, we deleted this gene from the haploid 521 strain using standard one-step gene disruption methodology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Gene disruption was scrutinized by multiplex PCR using primers designed to detect the absence of the <italic>trt1</italic> coding region and its replacement with the hygromycin resistance gene, which was used as a selection marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, upper gel, lanes 3 and 4). Disruption was confirmed by the PCR amplification of a 1,942 bp fragment spanning the hygromycin resistance gene and regions outside the disruption cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, lower gel, lanes 3 and 4). Ectopic recombination events were identified by a double-band electrophoretic pattern that corresponded to wild type and disruption cassette sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, upper gel, lanes 5 and 6). The absence of <italic>trt1</italic> disruption was indicated by a lack of DNA bands in the DNA amplification pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, lower gel, lanes 5 and 6). Subsequently, a representative mutant clone, trt1-1, was streaked after 12, 60, 156, and 180 generations in subculture passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Poor growth and low replicative potential were observed, supporting the notion that replicative senescence occurs in the <italic>U. maydis</italic> trt1-1 mutant.</p>

<title>Telomere length analysis in <italic>trt1</italic>-disrupted mutants</title>
<p>To analyze the telomere length, trt1-1 mutant cell samples growing in continuous culture were acquired periodically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, lanes 1 to 8), and the DNA was isolated, quantified, and examined by Southern blotting. The 36-generation series initiated after approximately 76 doubling periods, when considerable telomere shortening had occurred compared with the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, compare lanes labeled control ‘521’ and 1). Progressive telomere shortening continued as the replication rounds increased, and the hybridization signals began to fade at generation 256, when the sequences surveyed with the telomere probe were too short to yield a strong TRF signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 3 to 6). These results are consistent with previously reported telomere lengths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-SanchezAlonso2">[32]</xref>. The survivors, comprising a small group of telomerase-negative cells that employed homologous recombination-based pathways as an alternative method for telomere maintenance and proliferated past senescence, were obtained after 256 generations. Slight rearrangements in the hybridization pattern, such as changes in the size of signal bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, arrows on the left), their intensity, and the appearance of light smears along the last two lanes, were observed with the telomere probe at 292 and 328 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 7 and 8).</p>

<p>(A) Samples of total DNA from the <italic>U. maydis</italic> 521 strain (150 ng) and trt1-1 mutant clone (500 ng) were digested with <italic>Pst</italic>I and quantified. The wild-type 521 strain was used as a control. A 36-generation series of samples was acquired from the trt1-1 mutant culture at the following population doubling times: 76 (lane 1), 112 (lane 2), 148 (lane 3), 184 (lane 4), 220 (lane 5), 256 (lane 6), 292 (lane 7), and 328 (lane 8).

<title>Telomerase activity in <italic>U. maydis</italic></title>
<p>The telomerase activity in extracts from wild type sporidia was measured with TRAP-ELISA (telomeric repeat amplification protocol-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), a widely used assay developed to measure telomerase activity in mammalian cells. This assay is based on a one-step PCR procedure coupled with the chromogenic detection of telomeric repeat products. Extracts prepared from <italic>U. maydis</italic> 521 sporidial cells contained telomerase with a specific activity (activity per equivalent mass of protein) of approximately half the level found in control human HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, first and fourth bars; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109981-t001">Table 1</xref>, first and second rows). Sample extracts from the HEK293 cell line and the <italic>U. maydis</italic> 521 strain heated at 85°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, second and fifth bars) or treated with RNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, third and sixth bars) had no activity compared with their corresponding non-treated positive controls (P&lt;0.05). To determine whether telomere shortening in the trt1-1 clone correlated with a lack of telomerase activity, further TRAP-ELISAs were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, seventh, ninth and tenth bars; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109981-t001">Table 1</xref>, third row). An additional independent <italic>trt1</italic> disrupted mutant (the trt1-2 clone) was also tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, eighth bar; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109981-t001">Table 1</xref>, fourth row). No significant differences (P&gt;0.05) in activity were observed between the <italic>trt1</italic>-disrupted, heated, RNase-treated and gall cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, twelfth bar), indicating that these samples contained no detectable telomerase activity, as no activity was detected in the maize leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, eleventh bar; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109981-t001">Table 1</xref>, fifth and sixth rows). Pairwise comparisons of the statistical means between the telomerase-positive and telomerase-negative samples using Mann-Whitney analysis revealed significant differences between the two groups of data (P&lt;0.01). With this result accompanying the previous findings, we conclude that <italic>U. maydis</italic> synthesizes its telomeres with <italic>trt1</italic> telomerase activity.</p>

Tumor cells derived from the 521×520 cross and a plant control were included to evaluate and detect telomerase activity. The medians of the telomerase-positive control cells (HEK293) and the 521 wild-type strain were significantly different from the median of the treated negative controls (P&lt;0.05); however, no significant differences were detected between the negative controls and the <italic>trt1</italic>-disrupted mutants.

<title>Insights into the telotype of the post-meiotic progeny</title>
<p>To investigate telomere length in the meiotic products of a heterozygous trt1-1 ×520 cross, we germinated the resulting teliospores on solid medium in the presence or absence of hygromycin. These progeny were designated as F1. Total DNA was extracted from selected F1 progeny, and PCR was used to search for the inherited <italic>trt1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g006">Fig. 6A and B</xref>, lower panels). Five telomerase-negative strains derived from the heterozygous trt1-1 cross, referred to as W202, W203, W204, W208, and W2010, and five telomerase-positive strains from the same cross, named W207, W212, W218, W224 and W225, were selected for PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, lanes 1 to 5 and B, see legends in upper panels). We also performed heterozygous crosses of wild type and <italic>trt1</italic>-disrupted clones with the 520trt1-1 strain. This strain is an <italic>a2b2</italic>, telomerase-positive transformant clone with limited proliferative potential, affected telomere length maintenance and a TRF pattern similar to that of trt1-2, (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109981-t003">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, lane 20).

<p>The terminal restriction fragment length was then analyzed in the F1 progeny mentioned above, the wild-type 521 and 520 strains, the disrupted derivatives trt1-1 and trt1-2, and the 520trt1-1 strain. This experiment used the UT1-a probe, a <italic>Sau</italic>3<italic>A</italic>I terminal restriction fragment that spans 240 bp from the telomeric repeated TTAGGG motif and 360 bp from a highly conserved sequence located adjacent to telomeric repeats and interspersed with telomere associated sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Guzman1">[30]</xref>.

<title>Time course of chromosome end degradation in <italic>U. maydis</italic></title>
<p>As the sequences on or near the chromosome termini shorten in telomerase-deficient cells, a time course assay of <italic>Bal</italic>31 digestion was performed. This assay compared the pattern of telomere loss by telomerase deficiency to the pattern of telomere loss by TRF exonuclease treatment in the 521 as well as in the trt1-1 survivor, derivative W204 and complemented T2 clones. For the 521 strain, long smears corresponding to the (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> hybridization pattern and extending from 0.3 to 3 kb were accompanied by six discrete bands in the resolution zone that ranged from 2 to 12 kb after UT4-a-probe hybridization in the autoradiogram at time 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109981.s002">S2A</xref>). The telomere smears gradually shortened (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109981.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>, 30 min) or faded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109981.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>, 60 and 90 min), whereas the UT4-a hybridization signals remained insensitive to <italic>Bal</italic>31 exonuclease treatment during the 90-min treatment period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109981.s002">Fig S2A</xref>, 0 to 90 min), with exception of a 2.5-kb band. The requirement of a longer digestion time to erode the UT4-a bands reflects the inner localization of these sequences within the chromosomes. After membrane stripping and rehybridization to ribosomal rDNA sequences, the hybridization signals did not change on the blots because the internally located genes had no sensitivity to <italic>Bal</italic>31 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109981.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>, 0 and 90 min).</p>
<p>In the telomerase-negative survivor trt1-1, W204 and T2 transformant, strong hybridization signals for telomeric DNA were distributed from 0.3 to 12 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109981.s002">Fig. S2C, S2D and S2E</xref>, respectively). Hybridization bands of approximately 0.6 kb in the <italic>trt1</italic>-disrupted mutant trt1-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109981.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>, 0 min) and 4 kb from complemented T2 strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109981.s002">Fig. S2E</xref>, 0 min) were partially sensitive to <italic>Bal</italic>31 action at short incubation times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109981.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>, 10 min, arrow and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109981.s002">Fig. S2E</xref>, 20 and 30 min, arrow), whereas the remaining hybridization signal was insensitive to exonuclease digestion at longer incubation times (90 min, data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we described the results of the disruption of the locus um11198 (MUMBD) in the <italic>U. maydis</italic> genome, which harbors the putative telomerase reverse transcriptase (<italic>trt1</italic>) gene. Alignment analysis indicated that it encodes a protein with all of the characteristic TERT domains (TEN, TRBD, RT, and CTE) in the same order and distances reported for other TERTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Kelleher1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Zvereva1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>After identifying telomerase activity in cell extracts of <italic>U. maydis</italic>, the <italic>trt1</italic> gene was disrupted to confirm the induction of telomere erosion by a lack of telomere maintenance; the replicative senescence and loss of telomere repeats found in the mutant trt1-1 clone agreed with the previously reported absence of telomerase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Lundblad1">[35]</xref>. The appearance of slight smears in the DNA hybridization pattern of trt1-1 with the UT4-a subtelomeric probe suggested the presence of chromosome termini alterations of the mutant after 292 replication rounds. Similar changes have been reported to occur in telomerase-negative yeasts through recombinational pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Lundblad1">[35]</xref>. The development of telomerase-negative survivors in the trt1-1 mutant was confirmed after several subsequent passages.</p>
<p>No telomerase activity was found in the trt1-1 and trt1-2 mutants compared with the 521 strain or a human positive control. The absence of telomerase activity, the presence of telomere shortening, and the senescent phenotype coupled with slow growth and poor replicative potential of the trt1-1 clone support our assertion that <italic>trt1</italic> is the reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit of the <italic>U. maydis</italic> telomerase.</p>
<p>In our TRF analysis, long heterogeneous tracts of telomeric sequences were observed in the trt1-2 mutant and in most progeny derived from heterozygous crosses of 520trt1-1 with 521 or the <italic>trt1</italic>-disrupted mutant. These TRF analyses resemble those characterized in the Type II survivor pattern of the <italic>S. cerevisiae est2</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Huang1">[36]</xref>. However, the excessively amplified tracts of telomere-associated sequences linked to short segments of telomeric sequence that occurred in trt1-1 and trt1-53 match the Type I survivor pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Huang1">[36]</xref>. Although it is tempting to propose that trt1-2 progeny are similar to Type II <italic>S. cerevisiae est2</italic> mutant survivors because of the excessive telomeric repeat sequence lengthening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Lundblad1">[35]</xref>, it is more difficult to match trt1-1 and its progeny with the Type I survivor pattern because the length and identity of the amplified TAS by homologous recombination requires further characterization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Lundblad1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>U. maydis</italic> and yeast survivors share similar characteristics: (a) the telomere structure and organization of mutant survivors prevail in the postmeiotic progeny from heterozygous diploids, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Makovets1">[37]</xref>, and (b) the inherited telomeric structure is preserved in haploid progeny for many generations, in <italic>trt<sup>+</sup></italic> or <italic>trt<sup>-</sup></italic>, regardless of the inheritance of the functional <italic>trt1</italic> allele in haploid cells, which occurs in yeast and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Teng1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Chiang1">[38]</xref>. These similarities were unanticipated because of the distant relationship between these two fungal species.</p>
<p>Gall development from homozygous crosses of <italic>trt<sup>−</sup></italic> mutants <italic>in planta</italic> suggests that the mechanisms for pathogenic development remained intact in these organisms. However, the lack of teliospore formation in these tumors indicates that Trt1 is indispensable for fungal life-cycle completion. This condition resembles the critical role of telomerase activity in the production and fertility of germinal cells in mammalian males and in the proliferation of human stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Flores1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Yang1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Kalmbach1">[40]</xref>. The delay in gall development may result from low mutant cell viability, the production of lower quantities of virulence factors, or a plant-cell/mutant growth ratio that influences the plant infection schedule, as the growth rate of the plant host is known to influence the pathogenic potential of <italic>U. maydis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Walbot1">[41]</xref>. The roles of Trt1 in mycelium differentiation should be explored to explain the defective fungal differentiation process in the telomerase-negative mutants.</p>
<p>Insufficient telomerase activity was also found to affect telomere maintenance in the <italic>trt<sup>−</sup></italic>/<italic>trt<sup>+</sup> U. maydis</italic> heterozygotes. The lack of telomere pattern restoration observed in the telomerase-positive progeny after passaging through meiosis suggests Trt1 haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), which has been reported for humans, mice, and yeasts that are heterozygous for TERT or TR subunit null mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Chiang1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Goldman1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Mozdy1">[43]</xref>. Trt1 haploinsufficiency may also be responsible for the teliospore-lacking tumors produced by the <italic>trt<sup>−</sup></italic>/<italic>trt<sup>+</sup></italic> heterozygous crosses.</p>
<p>Introduction of the plasmid pTrt1 but not pNEBUC-GE77+ into the W204 strain yielded transformants, reinforcing our affirmation of an effective complementation of W204 with the exogenous copy of <italic>trt1</italic> in pTrt1. The decrease in intensity of the hybridization signal emitted by similar quantities of DNA from both the complemented strains and the telomerase-positive progeny suggested that a progressive reduction of TAS copies occurred after 200 doubling periods, resulting in a gradual reversion to the wild-type telomeric pattern. However, the replicative potential and growth rate were not fully recovered in the transformants. In contrast, a complete restoration of the growth rates and replicative potential occurs after the reintroduction of <italic>EST2</italic> to telomerase-null yeast mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Chen1">[44]</xref>. The lack of complete restoration observed in <italic>U. maydis</italic> may be a consequence of limitations in <italic>trt1</italic> expression.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the telomere structure also provided insight into the telomere maintenance that occurs at chromosome ends. A time course of <italic>Bal</italic>31 digestion of the telomeric DNA from the 521 strain demonstrated not only that (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> and UT4-a sequences are located mainly on the chromosome ends but also that the 521 strain and trt1-1 share similar patterns of telomere attrition post-<italic>Bal</italic>31 digestion and after several passages in cell culture. The telomeric and subtelomeric DNA sequences of the W204 strain were more resistant to <italic>Bal</italic>31 digestion than those of its pTrt1 transformant derivative T2. The exogenous reintroduction of <italic>trt1</italic> seemed to attenuate DNA resistance to exonuclease action. Thus, we hypothesize that exogenous Trt1 contributes to the prevention of additional telomere enlargement via recombinational pathways; however, further studies should be conducted before comparing these findings with other models. Moreover, the survival mechanisms of the telomerase-negative <italic>U. maydis</italic> strains appear to rely on recombinational events, which also deserve further study and were recently proposed for telomerase-positive strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Yu1">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, we assume that the <italic>U. maydis</italic> telomerase reverse transcriptase gene has been structurally and functionally characterized at the complementation level, but further analysis regarding telomerase function in this lower eukaryote remains to be performed.</p>

<title><italic>U. maydis</italic> transformation and one-step <italic>trt1</italic> disruption</title>
<p>The transformation procedure was performed essentially as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Tsukuda1">[50]</xref>, using protoplasts and polyethylene glycol 3350. The regeneration plates were prepared with MM or CM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Holliday2">[48]</xref> supplemented with 1 M sorbitol and either 200 µg/ml hygromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) or 1 µg/ml carboxin (BioWorld) as selection agents. The transformed cells arose as hygromycin- or carboxin- resistant colonies after five days of incubation at 28°C. To analyze the senescence phenotype of the hygromycin-resistant transformants, single colonies from the transformation plates were streaked on agar or grown for up to 36 doubling periods in Holliday's MM under hygromycin (200 µg/ml) selection. The cultures were used for DNA extraction, and aliquots were stored in glycerol at −70°C.</p>
<p>For the one-step disruption of the putative <italic>trt1</italic> gene, a ∼4,230-bp linear <italic>Eco</italic>RV fragment was obtained from the pCM1007 plasmid, which contains a disruption cassette. The cassette was an assembly of the bacterial hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (<italic>hph</italic>) expressed under the control of the P<sub>hsp70</sub> <italic>U. maydis</italic> promoter. This marker gene was linked to two flanking fragments of the <italic>trt1</italic> gene, an 847-bp fragment (from -11 to 836 nt) and a 1,334-bp fragment (from 2,777 to 4,111 nt), as suitable sequences for homologous recombination. The oligonucleotide primer pairs used to amplify these <italic>trt1</italic> DNA fragments were EST2Afor (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GAAGAACTGAGATGCAGCC</named-content> 3′) with EST2Arev (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTGATTCGAGAAGTGACTCG</named-content> 3′) for the 847-bp DNA fragment and EST2Bfor (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CGAGATCATCTTCGGCTTGC</named-content> 3′) with EST2Brev (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTGACAAGGACTTCTGAGCG</named-content> 3′) for the 1,334-bp DNA fragment. Multiplex PCR amplification with three oligonucleotide primers (EST2 FDD1, EST2 RDD1, and HyRDD, provided by W.K. Holloman) distinguished between the wild-type and disrupted transformants. The EST2 FDD1 (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GGTACTTGCTTTGTGCAGC</named-content> 3′) and EST2 RDD1 (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTAACGACTCGACTTCAGC</named-content> 3′) primer pair amplified a 904-bp <italic>trt1</italic> fragment spanning from positions 595 to 1,498 nt. Additionally, the primer combination of HyRDD1 (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCAGGCTCTCGCTGAATTCC</named-content> 3′) and EST2 FDD1 amplified a fragment of approximately 1,286 bp that spanned part of the <italic>trt1</italic> gene and part of the <italic>hph</italic> gene. A third primer pair of HyRDD1 and EST2FDD2 (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTGCGCAACTTCCTACGAGACT</named-content> 3′, positioned from −62 nt to −40 of <italic>trt1</italic>) amplified a 1,942-bp DNA fragment that confirmed the <italic>trt1</italic> disruption in the mutants. Two independent clones derived from the <italic>U. maydis</italic> 521 strain (trt1-<italic>1</italic> and trt1-2) were obtained and used for subsequent analysis; one independent clone derived from the 520 strain (520trt1-1) was also used in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109981-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Cloning <italic>trt1</italic> under control of the <italic>HSP70</italic> promoter</title>
<p>The forward primer ExTelF00 (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ATGCAGCCACCCAAATCCAG</named-content> 3′) and the reverse primer ExTelRv1 (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GCAGCTGGCACGTTGACACA</named-content> 3′) were used to amplify entire ORF of the <italic>trt1</italic> gene (positions 1 to 4,116 plus 58 bp of the downstream sequence). Thirty PCR cycles were performed with Platinum <italic>Taq</italic> DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In each cycle, the sample was denatured at 94°C for 30 s, annealed at 61°C for 30 s, and extended at 72°C for 5 min. The pTrt1 vector is a pNEBUC GE77+ derivative that contains <italic>trt1</italic> under the control of P<sub>HSP70</sub> and T<sub>HSP70</sub>. This vector was constructed as detailed below. An amplified 4,171-bp fragment spanning the entire <italic>trt1</italic> ORF was inserted into the <italic>Eco</italic>RV site in pBluescript KS-. The resulting plasmid, pTelMI, was linearized with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and partially digested with <italic>Xho</italic>I to retrieve <italic>trt1</italic>, which was then inserted into the pTrcHis 2A (Invitrogen) plasmid to obtain the pTelMII plasmid. A 2.1-kb <italic>Hind</italic>III fragment from the pUBLEX1 vector carrying the P<sub>HSP70</sub> promoter and T<sub>HSP70</sub> terminator sequences separated by a <italic>Bgl</italic>II site was subcloned into the pBluescript KS- vector (Stratagene) to obtain pSVM1. A 4.2-kb <italic>Bam</italic>HI/<italic>Bgl</italic>II (partial digestion) fragment from the pTelMII plasmid carrying the <italic>trt1</italic> sequences was inserted into the <italic>Bgl</italic>II site of pSVM1 in the proper orientation to obtain pTelM70. The <italic>Bam</italic>HI/<italic>Kpn</italic>I fragment encoding Trt1 under the control of the HSP70 promoter and terminator was subcloned into the replicative pNEBUC GE77+ vector to obtain pTrt1.</p>
<p>After transforming <italic>U. maydis</italic> strains with the plasmid, total DNA was isolated from transformant clones, and the oligonucleotide pair CGFMD05 and HSPseqD (5 <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GCGTCTGTGCGGCGATGAG</named-content> 3′, located at position 605 to 623 nt of the 786-bp HSP70 promoter) was used to detect the chimeric gene by amplifying a 1813-bp DNA fragment spanning part of the P<sub>HSP70</sub> promoter and part of the <italic>trt1</italic> ORF gene.</p>

<p>This analysis was conducted as previously described by Sanchez-Alonso <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-SanchezAlonso1">[31]</xref>. DNA samples were digested to completion with <italic>Pst</italic>I (Invitrogen). DNA fragment size fractionation was performed via electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel, and the resolved products were transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Invitrogen) as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Sambrook1">[51]</xref>. Hybridization was performed at 65°C in Church's buffer at a probe activity of 17 kBq/ml <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Church1">[53]</xref>. One of the probes used in this study was UT1-a, which spans 240 bp of the telomeric repeat sequence (TTAGGG)<sub>39</sub> plus 329 bp from a highly conserved subtelomeric sequence composed of the TR-p + TR-d fragments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-SanchezAlonso1">[31]</xref>. UT1-a was digested to completion with <italic>Hinc</italic>II (Invitrogen) to separate the telomere repeat sequence (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> from the adjacent subtelomeric sequences to use as individual probes. The UT4-a probe, which is derived from the subtelomeric <italic>UTASa</italic> (Accession AF030885.1), was also used in the hybridization assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-SanchezAlonso2">[32]</xref>. Probes were labeled using the Random Primers DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen) and used as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-SanchezAlonso2">[32]</xref>. Washes were conducted at 25°C and included two washes with 5× SSPE and 0.2% SDS and one wash with 2× SSPE and 0.1% SDS, with gentle shaking for 15 s. When necessary, additional washes with 2× SSPE or 0.4× SSPE plus 0.1% SDS were performed. To reuse the membranes, the probes were removed by gently shaking the membrane in a boiling solution of 0.1% SDS and 0.1× SSPE for 1 min. The solution was then discarded, and this treatment was repeated at least twice (20× SSPE: 3 M NaCl, 0.2 M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>•H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.02 M EDTA, and pH = 7.4).</p>

<title>The telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) in <italic>U. maydis</italic></title>
<p>To measure the telomerase activity we used the TRAP, which has been described previously by Kim <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Kim1">[54]</xref>. To obtain protein extracts from different strains, 1000- ml cultures were grown to a D.O.<sub>600</sub> of 0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in PBS, and resuspended at approximately 10<sup>9</sup> cells/ml in lysis buffer containing the following: 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.5% Tween 20, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The protease inhibitor cocktail described by Masutomi <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Masutomi1">[55]</xref> was used, with slight modifications as follows: the inhibitors were used at one-tenth the prescribed concentration, the benzamidine HCl concentration was increased to 160 µg/ml (0.1 mM), the phenanthrorin was replaced with 5 µg/ml chymostatin (Sigma), and 50 U/ml of the RNase inhibitor SUPERase•In (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was added. The mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a powder, mixed with 200 µl of cold lysis buffer, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged for 45 min at 25,000×<italic>g</italic> at 4°C, and the supernatant was divided into aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C until use. Galls (from 12-day-old plants) and maize leaves or meristems (from 20-day-old plants) were frozen in liquid nitrogen or ground to powder following the same protocol. To determine telomerase activity, the sample protein concentrations were adjusted to 0.1 µg/µl with lysis buffer, and 0.1 µg of the protein extract was poured into a tube containing elongation buffer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-DallaTorre1">[56]</xref>, which was modified with 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) and 0.25 mg BSA. The reaction mixture was brought to a final volume of 20 µl and incubated for 30 min at 30°C. To amplify the elongated G-rich strand of telomere repeats, 10 µl of the prior mixture was used for PCR using FastStart Taq DNA polymerase (Roche), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min using a TS primer (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT</named-content> 3′) plus a CX (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAA</named-content> 3′) reverse primer. The supplied HEK293 cell line extracts were heat-inactivated at 85°C for 15 min and used as negative controls. Heat-inactivated extracts of <italic>U. maydis</italic> strains or RNase-treated samples were also used as telomerase-negative fungal controls. The <underline>T</underline>elo<italic>TAGGG</italic> Telomerase PCR ELISA kit (Roche) was used to determine telomerase activity accordingly to manufacturer's instructions. The average absorbance value (A) for each sample was calculated as recommended, A = A<sub>450</sub> (reading) - A<sub>690</sub> (blank). To calculate the difference in absorbance (ΔA), we subtracted the mean of the absorbance of the negative controls from the mean sample absorbance. The samples were identified as telomerase positive if the difference in absorbance (ΔA = A<sub>sample</sub> - A <sub>neg. control</sub>) was higher than 0.2 units. Further details of the manufacturer's protocol can be found in the <italic>T</italic>elo<italic>TAGGG</italic> Telomerase PCR ELISA manual (V8.0 p.15). Statistical analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney test, which was designed to compare differences between two independent groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109981-Mann1">[57]</xref>. The GraphPad Prism V.6.0b program (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used following the manufacturer's instructions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/5/user-guide/prism5help.html?stat_how_to_do_an_unpaired_t_test_w_3.html" xlink:type="simple">www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/5/user-guide/prism5help.html?stat_how_to_do_an_unpaired_t_test_w_3.html</ext-link>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109981-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109981.s001">S1D</xref> were created with GraphPad Prism V.6.0b using results of the Kruskal-Wallis test (one-way ANOVA data test), which is an extension of the Mann-Whitney U test used to compare two or more samples.</p>

<title>Exonuclease digestion of <italic>U. maydis</italic> DNA</title>
<p>The assay was performed with <italic>Bal</italic>31 exonuclease (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 µg of total DNA was adjusted to 250 µl with the 1× <italic>Bal</italic>31 nuclease buffer provided by the manufacturer. Samples (62 µl) were removed at regular intervals depending on the strain. The reactions were terminated by adding EGTA (Sigma) to a final concentration of 10 mM. The samples were ethanol precipitated, and the DNA was digested with <italic>Pst</italic>I (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels. The samples were then transferred to nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus, Hybridization Transfer Membrane, Perkin Elmer Inc., Alameda, CA, USA) and hybridized to (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub>, UT4-a, both, or rRNA gene sequences as a probe.</p>

Wild-type 521 (first row), non-transformed W204 (second row), and pNEBUC GE77+ transformed clone from the 521 strain (fourth row) were used to compare the drug resistance profile. Dilutions of strains were performed to obtain 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>1</sup> cells in poured drops, and MM was used as a control to avoid false negatives. (B) The DNA sequences in pTrt1, spanning part of the <italic>trt1</italic> ORF and part of the P<sub>HSP70</sub> promoter, were amplified by PCR to verify plasmid acquisition into the cells. The panel shows the amplification products of the 521 strain (lane 1), plasmid pTrt1 (lane 2), trt1-1 mutant (lane 3), the W204 strain (lane 4) and five of their transformant clones (T1 to T5). (C) The transcriptional activity from the chimeric <italic>tert1</italic> gene was measured by RT-PCR assays in three of the aforementioned transformant clones. Mock RT-PCR assays lacking reverse transcriptase (lane 1) or RNA from the tested 521 strain (lane 2) served as an example of the procedure used to reveal traces of contaminating DNA. Amplified cDNA from <italic>tert1</italic> transcripts from the 521 strain (lane 2), trt1-1 mutant (lane 4), the W204 strain (lane 5) and three of their transformant clones (T1 to T3) are shown.
