<abstract>
<p>Pollen provides an excellent system to study pattern formation at the single-cell level. Pollen surface is covered by the pollen wall exine, whose deposition is excluded from certain surface areas, the apertures, which vary between the species in their numbers, positions, and morphology. What determines aperture patterns is not understood. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> normally develops three apertures, equally spaced along the pollen equator. However, Arabidopsis mutants whose pollen has higher ploidy and larger volume develop four or more apertures. To explore possible mechanisms responsible for aperture patterning, we developed a mathematical model based on the Gierer-Meinhardt system of equations. This model was able to recapitulate aperture patterns observed in the wild-type and higher-ploidy pollen. We then used this model to further explore geometric and kinetic factors that may influence aperture patterns and found that pollen size, as well as certain kinetic parameters, like diffusion and decay of morphogens, could play a role in formation of aperture patterns. In conjunction with mathematical modeling, we also performed a forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis and discovered two mutants with aperture patterns that had not been previously observed in this species but were predicted by our model. The <italic>macaron</italic> mutant develops a single ring-like aperture, matching the unusual ring-like pattern produced by the model. The <italic>doughnut</italic> mutant forms two pore-like apertures at the poles of the pollen grain. Further tests on these novel mutants, motivated by the modeling results, suggested the existence of an area of inhibition around apertures that prevents formation of additional apertures in their vicinity. This work demonstrates the ability of the theoretical model to help focus experimental efforts and to provide fundamental insights into an important biological process.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Pollen is renowned for its ability to form beautiful and complex patterns on its surface. One of the most prominent patterns on the pollen surface is formed by apertures, the regions that lack deposition of the pollen wall exine and develop at precise locations which often vary between the species. How aperture patterns are created is an intriguing and poorly understood question. We developed a mathematical model that aims to explore the mechanisms responsible for the aperture patterning in the pollen of the model plant Arabidopsis. Our model showed that size of the pollen grain could be solely responsible for the increase in aperture number observed in the pollen of some Arabidopsis mutants. Additionally, kinetic parameters, such as diffusion and decay of aperture factors, could also influence aperture number. We coupled our mathematical modeling with a forward genetic screen of a mutagenized population of Arabidopsis. This screen discovered novel mutants with aperture patterns that had been predicted by our mathematical model. Further experiments on these mutants provided additional support to the modeling predictions. These results demonstrate that mathematical modeling could be a powerful tool for understanding the mechanisms responsible for patterning of pollen grains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The process of cell morphogenesis often depends on the ability of cells to form distinct domains of plasma membrane and precisely target deposition of extracellular materials. Pollen presents a powerful model to study the mechanisms that control formation of membrane domains and localization of extracellular structures. Pollen grains are surrounded by a complex extracellular structure, exine, that can assemble into thousands of elaborate, species-specific patterns, which make the pollen surface one of the most diverse structures found in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref003">3</xref>]. These patterns are formed by precisely depositing exine at certain areas of the pollen surface and by preventing or reducing its deposition at other sites.</p>
<p>In most plant species the restriction of exine deposition at particular locations leads to the development of some of the most obvious patterning elements on the pollen surface. These characteristic areas which either lack exine completely or have decreased amounts of exine are called apertures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref005">5</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Apertures are critical for pollen viability and function, as they often serve as portals through which pollen tubes exit during germination and as architectural details that help the pollen accommodate volume changes in response to changing hydration levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref009">9</xref>].</p>

<p>(A-A’) Haploid pollen of wild-type Arabidopsis (Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> ecotype) have three apertures (arrowheads). Front and back views of the auramine O-stained pollen grains are shown here and in other images as indicated. (B-B’) Diploid Landsberg pollen grains from tetraploid plants are larger than haploid pollen grains and have primarily four apertures (arrowheads). (C-D’) Diploid pollen grains from a diploid <italic>osd1</italic> mutant usually have either four (C-C’) or six (D-D’) apertures (arrowheads). (E-F’) Irregular aperture patterns, often adopting a ring-shaped morphology, are common among tetraploid pollen grains from the tetraploid <italic>osd1</italic> mutants. (G) A diagram of pollen development and aperture formation in the wild-type Arabidopsis and in several mutants with abnormal pollen ploidy. The ploidy of microspore mother cells (MMC), which divide meiotically to generate microspores, is the same as in the plants producing these MMCs. In the wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis, the 2n MMC undergoes two rounds of nuclear division (MI and MII), followed by cytokinesis (CK), and produces a tetrad of 1n microspores arranged in the tetrahedral conformation. The grey areas around the MMCs and the postmeiotic microspore arrangements represent the callose walls. First signs of apertures become apparent in postmeiotic microspores held together by the callose wall. After the callose wall dissolution, each microspore develops into a mature pollen grain, which, depending on its ploidy, exhibits a characteristic number of apertures. In the <italic>osd1</italic> mutant, the second nuclear division (MII) is skipped, resulting in the formation of a dyad of microspores whose ploidy is identical to that of their MMC precursor. Scale bars = 10 <italic>μ</italic>m.</p>

<p>The patterns produced by apertures on the pollen surface are one of the major taxonomic features used for classification of flowering plants. The two major clades of flowering plants, eudicots and monocots, are each characterized by a prototypical aperture pattern, defined by aperture number and position. Monocots tend to have a single, polarly localized aperture, whereas eudicots most commonly have three apertures, equidistantly distributed like three meridians around the pollen equator. Although these are the most prevalent patterns for these clades, individual species exhibit wide variations on these common themes, with dramatic differences in aperture number, position, and morphology. Among the observed patterns are pore-like single apertures in grasses, two hole-like apertures at the opposite poles in many species of bromeliads, three equatorial apertures in tomato, four equatorial apertures in some species of tobacco, six apertures in species of mint and passion flower, multiple hole-like apertures in hibiscus and phlox, and many other possible patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref005">5</xref>]. In the cases when pollen has more than one aperture, these apertures (or their centers) tend to be equally distributed on the pollen surface or around the pollen equator. Yet, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that restrict exine deposition at these specific sites and contribute to the formation of aperture patterns are not understood in any species.</p>
<p>In the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, like in many other eudicot species, pollen has three long and narrow apertures placed equidistantly around the equator of the pollen grains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g001">Fig 1A, 1A’ and 1G</xref>). This patterning is very precise: essentially all pollen grains in the wild-type Arabidopsis develop this pattern. Formation of Arabidopsis apertures begins after male meiosis, when four meiotic products—the pollen precursors known as the microspores—are held together in a tetrad arrangement, surrounded and separated from each other by a callose wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref012">12</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g001">Fig 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>Until recently, only a single molecular player, the product of the Arabidopsis <italic>INAPERTURATE POLLEN1</italic> (<italic>INP1</italic>) gene, was known to act as an aperture-promoting factor. During the tetrad stage INP1 protein specifically aggregates at the areas of the microspore plasma membrane that will become apertures, while in the absence of functional INP1 apertures do not form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>]. Although INP1 is likely a late-acting factor which does not by itself define the aperture pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref015">15</xref>], its specific localization to certain membrane sites suggests that the plasma membrane in microspores acquires polarity and forms distinct domains, which then become protected from exine deposition. Recently, we identified a second aperture factor in Arabidopsis, the protein kinase D6 PROTEIN KINASE-LIKE3 (D6PKL3), which appears to act upstream of INP1 and helps attract it to the aperture domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref016">16</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which these proteins select domains for aperture sites is not understood.</p>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that the mechanism of aperture formation is sensitive to pollen ploidy or to factors tightly linked to ploidy, such as pollen size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>]. Compared to the normal haploid (1n) pollen grains in Arabidopsis with three equatorial apertures, the larger diploid (2n) pollen grains generated by several mechanisms (e.g. through a tetrad or dyad stage) commonly develop either four equatorial apertures or six apertures distributed along the edges of a tetrahedron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g001">Fig 1B–1D’ and 1G</xref>), although some other patterns are also observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>]. In turn, pollen of even higher ploidy (3n or 4n) develops complex aperture patterns with the larger number of apertures that often coalesce into ring-shaped structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g001">Fig 1E–1G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>]. INP1 localization in higher-ploidy microspores recapitulates the changed number of apertures in the mature pollen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref014">14</xref>], suggesting that the number and placement of membrane aperture domains changes in these cells. However, it is not known what factors linked to ploidy (for example, biochemical—e.g. gene dosage and levels of gene expression, or mechanical—e.g. pollen size) are responsible for changes in membrane domains and aperture number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to pollen ploidy, factors connected to male meiosis and meiotic cytokinesis have been hypothesized to be involved in aperture formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref024">24</xref>]. In eudicot species which often have a tetrahedral arrangement of microspores in a tetrad and form three apertures on each microspore, these apertures tend to develop at the centers of the six centripetally growing division plates, close to the three points of last contact that each microspore has with its three sisters at the end of meiotic cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref024">24</xref>]. These observations led to the hypothesis that points of last contact may serve as patterning landmarks for aperture positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref024">24</xref>]. Although our recent results indicated that the points of last contact <italic>per se</italic> are unlikely to act as the determinants for aperture placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>], the strong correlation between their positions and positions of apertures suggest a possibility that meiotic cytokinesis may provide some prepatterning cues for aperture sites.</p>
<p>To explore biochemical and geometric parameters that may be responsible for the observed aperture patterns but cannot yet be approached experimentally, we turned to mathematical modeling. As with other studies where little is known about the underlying interaction network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref025">25</xref>], a pattern-forming model can be used to study broad properties of the biological system. The equally spaced distribution of the INP1-decorated membrane domains and apertures in Arabidopsis is reminiscent of patterns that can be generated with mathematical pattern-formation models. A simple reaction-diffusion system, first introduced by Alan Turing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref026">26</xref>] and later developed into the Gierer-Meinhardt (GM) system of equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref028">28</xref>], which simulates the interaction of two morphogens, a short-range activator and a long-range inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g002">Fig 2</xref>), was used as the basis for our model. The GM model was chosen because it had been previously used to successfully model a variety of patterns, including some similar to aperture patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref030">30</xref>]. Furthermore, a Turing-type model has been previously used to investigate pattern formation on the surface of a sphere, like pollen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref031">31</xref>], although the patterns matching pollen aperture number and placement have not been explored in previous studies.</p>

<p>Here we focused on the specification of aperture number and placement of aperture centers on a single pollen grain. A deterministic model with stochastic initial conditions was able to reliably produce the three-aperture pattern characteristic of the wild-type Arabidopsis pollen. After the model was parametrized, we tested different variables that may have an effect on the number and positions of apertures, such as domain size, morphogen kinetics, initial conditions, and possible pre-patterns.</p>
<p>We found that the domain size and morphogen kinetics have the largest impact on the aperture patterns produced by our simulations. In addition, in parallel with modeling, we performed a new forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis and have identified novel aperture mutants. These mutants develop phenotypes that have not been previously observed in this species but were predicted by our model. We have then used these mutants to further test the model predictions by increasing ploidy of the mutant pollen. Through integration of computational and experimental approaches we have extended the framework for the process of pollen aperture formation and provided insight into the potential causes of mutant pollen patterning.</p>

<title>The Gierer-Meinhardt model is able to recapitulate aperture number and patterns in 1D and 3D domains</title>
<p>We implemented the coupled GM equations in FlexPDE, a finite-element partial differential equation (PDE) solving environment, as described in the Materials and Methods. To reproduce the aperture patterning conditions of Arabidopsis, a domain was modeled with a size that corresponded to the size of wild-type haploid (1n) pollen grains with an observed front-view surface area averaging 550 <italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>], hereafter referred to as the WT domain size. We used two distinct types of domains in the model: a one-dimensional (1D) domain representing the equator of the pollen grain and a three-dimensional (3D) domain representing the surface on the pollen grain. We explored parameter values that determine the model’s kinetics on the 1D WT domain to find values that would produce three equally spaced spikes, the areas with increased morphogen concentration, to match the aperture patterns of wild-type Arabidopsis pollen grains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g003">Fig 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006800.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We then verified that these parameter values satisfy the conditions for Turing-type patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref032">32</xref>]. The chosen parameter values were determined to be within the Turing pattern-forming regime. The molecular mechanisms responsible for regulation of the number of apertures and their positioning are still essentially unknown, thus precluding estimations of kinetics for the molecules involved. Therefore, to determine how much change our model could possibly tolerate while still producing Turing patterns, we tested a range of parameter values. We found that when any single parameter was varied between 40% and 270% from the value in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006800.t001">Table 1</xref>, the criteria for the formation of Turing patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref032">32</xref>] remained satisfied, indicating that the model is quite robust in its ability to generate patterns.</p>
<p>To verify that our model can reliably reproduce the patterning of Arabidopsis pollen grains, we then increased the domain to match the larger size of the diploid (2n) Arabidopsis pollen grains (hereafter referred to as the larger-size domain). 2n Arabidopsis pollen grains have an average front-view surface area of 750 <italic>μ</italic>m<sup>2</sup> and often develop patterns with four equatorial apertures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>]. With the base parameters from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006800.t001">Table 1</xref>, our model produced mostly four-spike patterns on the larger-size domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), similar to patterns seen in Arabidopsis mutants with 2n pollen. To test if a change of the same magnitude in the opposite direction would also change the number of spikes produced by our model, the domain size was decreased to correspond to a front-view surface area of 350 <italic>μ</italic>m<sup>2</sup>. In this smaller-size domain the number of spikes was reduced to two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>To test how our model behaved in 3D, we started out with the same parameter values as in 1D. Running initial simulations on the 3D domain, we observed that the WT domain produced mostly three-spike patterns, while the larger-size domain produced mostly four-spike patterns, consistent with the results of the 1D model. The three-spike patterns generated in both 1D and 3D had spikes equally spaced around the equator. However, the four-spikes generated by the 3D model were located at the corners of a tetrahedron. After these initial verifications, we used both the WT domain and the larger-size domain to run our simulations. These two domain sizes, corresponding, respectively, to the sizes of 1n and 2n Arabidopsis pollen grains, were thus capable of reproducing aperture patterns observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Spike number changes in response to domain size</title>
<p>Based on the observations that different numbers of spikes can be produced strictly in response to changes in domain size, we decided to systematically determine the effects of domain size on the produced patterns. To accomplish this, we varied the domain size while keeping all of the model parameters at their original values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006800.t001">Table 1</xref>). We performed this domain-size analysis for both the 1D and 3D domains and cataloged the resulting patterns. For both domain types, increasing the domain size resulted in a higher number of spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The three-spike pattern associated with the wild-type 1n pollen was the most common pattern for 1D domains corresponding to a range of areas between 400 <italic>μ</italic>m<sup>2</sup> and 700 <italic>μ</italic>m<sup>2</sup> (95% of simulations, n = 175). The 3D domain, however, was more sensitive to deviations from the original size of the WT domain: the three-spike pattern was predominant (72%, n = 25) only for the area of 550 <italic>μ</italic>m<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to the wild-type domain. The 1D domain produced patterns ranging from two to five spikes, while the 3D domain was capable of producing patterns with up to eight spikes. These results suggest that the domain size, in the absence of any other kinetic or geometric changes, could be responsible for differences in aperture number and patterning.</p>

<title>The number of spikes is affected by the model kinetics</title>
<p>Higher-ploidy pollen grains have larger size, but they may also have other unknown changes responsible for the changes in aperture patterning. After observing that domain size affects the number of spikes produced, we tested what other mechanisms could be responsible for the aperture phenotypes associated with higher-ploidy pollen. To accomplish this, we performed a one-parameter-at-a-time analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref033">33</xref>], varying the model parameters in both the WT and the larger-size domains.

<title>Novel patterns observed in the 3D model</title>
<p>In 3D, our model tended to produce patterns with various numbers of spikes that were separated from each other by an area where the concentration of the activator was reduced to almost zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g007">Fig 7A–7E</xref>). In addition, in our kinetic experiments we discovered patterns in morphogen concentration that were composed not just of the typical spikes. One of these patterns was the ring-like pattern that had increased morphogen concentration all along a great circle of the spherical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). This pattern was observed on the larger 3D domain, in the cases when the diffusion of the activator was greatly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g005">Fig 5</xref>) or the decay of the activator was sufficiently reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Upon further investigation, we determined that the ring-like aperture was created by merging two separate spikes that were initially located on opposite poles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s006">S1 Video</xref>). The second type of unusual pattern consisted of a single spike located at a pole of the sphere, combined with a ring located on the opposite side of the sphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g007">Fig 7G</xref>).

It could also potentially be considered similar to the two-aperture pattern since the ring aperture in the <italic>mcr</italic> mutants starts as two separate apertures.</p>
<p>Mutants belonging to the <italic>dnt</italic> complementation group also exhibited a novel aperture phenotype: instead of three furrow-like apertures, pollen developed two round, hole-like, apertures that were significantly wider and shorter than the wild-type apertures, had internal deposits of the exine material sporopollenin, and were located at the opposite sites on the pollen surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g008">Fig 8B and 8B’</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s010">S5 Video</xref>). By crossing <italic>DMC1pr:INP1-YFP</italic> into the <italic>dnt</italic> background, we established that, as with <italic>mcr</italic>, in this mutant INP1 became localized to the positions of new apertures. These apertures, however, no longer formed at the pollen equator but rather at its poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g008">Fig 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s011">S6 Video</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s003">S3 Fig</xref> for additional examples of <italic>dnt</italic> phenotypes). Therefore, <italic>dnt</italic> mutations simultaneously affected multiple aspects of aperture patterns—morphology, number, and position. The patterning of the <italic>dnt</italic> mutants qualitatively resembles the two-spike patterns observed in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).</p>

<title>Size, ploidy, and microsporogenesis of the <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> pollen are not affected</title>
<p>Our previous findings that pollen ploidy and/or size have a strong influence on aperture number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g001">Fig 1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>]) prompted us to pay attention to these parameters in <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic>. The size of both <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> pollen did not differ from the size of the normal 1n pollen produced by the 2n wild-type Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In addition, crosses of <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> with the diploid Landsberg and Columbia accessions, as well as with some other diploid Arabidopsis strains, resulted in fully fertile plants that produced homogeneous pollen and themselves generated normal progeny, without any defects indicative of abnormal ploidy. Similarly, the results of ploidy manipulations that were later performed on <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> (see below) were also consistent with the original mutants behaving like the 2n plants and producing 1n pollen. We conclude, therefore, that the changes in aperture number in these mutants were not caused by a size- or ploidy-sensitive mechanism. Also, in both <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> mutants, pollen developed through a normal tetrahedral tetrad stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g008">Fig 8C–8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s008">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s009">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s011">S6</xref> Videos), consistent with the normal progression of meiosis and cytokinesis during microsporogenesis.</p>

<title>Increase in ploidy/size has different effects on apertures in the <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> pollen</title>
<p>Our mathematical model predicted that kinetic changes, such as increased rates of diffusion of an activator (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>) or an inhibitor (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>H</italic></sub>), can result in the formation of wild type-sized pollen with two apertures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The model further predicted that, if similar changes in diffusion occurred on a larger domain (equivalent to changes in size from 1n to 2n pollen), the number of apertures should correspondingly change from four, typically produced by the 2n/larger-size pollen, to three.</p>
<p>Because both <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> pollen grains, at least initially, develop two apertures, we decided to use them to test the model’s predictions by creating <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> plants that would produce larger (2n) pollen and assessing the number of apertures in these pollen grains. By treating <italic>mcr</italic> plants with colchicine, as we did previously for wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>], we generated tetraploid (4n) <italic>mcr</italic> plants that produced 2n pollen through a tetrad stage. Additionally, both <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> mutants were crossed with the <italic>osd1</italic> mutation, which results in the omission of the second meiotic division and leads to the formation of 2n pollen through a dyad stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). In all cases, the size of the resulting 2n <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> pollen was similar to the size of other 2n pollen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), as well as to the size of the larger domain that was used in our simulations.</p>
<p>In wild type, such ploidy-increasing manipulations commonly lead to the development of pollen with four or six apertures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g001">Fig 1B–1D’ and 1G</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>]). In the case of <italic>mcr</italic>, independently of the mechanism through which the 2n pollen was generated and consistent with the model’s predictions, the pollen switched to producing three equidistant apertures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g009">Fig 9A–9B’</xref>). To determine positional orientations of these three apertures in the <italic>mcr osd1</italic> pollen, we used INP1-YFP as a marker for aperture positions. We found that, in each microspore, INP1-YFP localized to three equidistant longitudinal lines, which were not aligned between the sister microspores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s012">S7 Video</xref>), unlike in wild-type tetrads where the lines of INP1 align between sister microspores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref014">14</xref>].</p>

<title>Further increase in pollen ploidy affects aperture patterns in both <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> mutants</title>
<p>In Arabidopsis, pollen with ploidy higher than 2n commonly develops complex and irregular aperture patterns, often consisting of ring-shaped apertures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g001">Fig 1E–1F’</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>]). To test what effect further ploidy increase will have on the <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> pollen, we took advantage of the fact that the <italic>osd1</italic> mutation affects meiosis not only in pollen but also in eggs, thus leading to doubled ploidy after self-pollination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref034">34</xref>]. Using this approach, we generated tetraploid (4n) <italic>mcr</italic> <italic>osd1</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> <italic>osd1</italic> plants that produced 4n pollen through the dyad stage. As with other versions of the <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> pollen, which were similar in size to the other pollen of the same ploidy level, the size of the 4n <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> pollen did not differ from the size of 4n <italic>osd1</italic> pollen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) or from the other 4n pollen types that we previously studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>In the 4n <italic>mcr</italic> <italic>osd1</italic> pollen, the predominant aperture pattern (81%, n = 85) consisted of a ring-shaped aperture located on one side of the pollen grain and 1-2 small, hole-like apertures on the opposite side of the pollen grain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g009">Fig 9F and 9F’</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The remaining grains had variations of this pattern: for example, a ring-shaped aperture and a furrow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s005">S5C and S5C’ Fig</xref>), or two ring-shaped apertures on the opposite sides of a grain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s005">S5D and S5D’ Fig</xref>). Interestingly, this unusual aperture pattern strongly resembled the ring-and-spike pattern produced by the model (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g007">7G</xref>). To determine where on the surface of 4n <italic>mcr</italic> <italic>osd1</italic> pollen the ring and the hole-like apertures were located, we analyzed the late-stage dyads in which apertures were already recognizable. We found that the rings were located at the distal end of microspores, thus placing the hole-like apertures at the proximal end, near the intersporal callose wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g009">Fig 9H–9H”’</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s015">S10 Video</xref>.</p>
<p>In the 4n <italic>dnt osd1</italic> pollen, the shape and size of apertures was still unchanged compared to the 1n <italic>dnt</italic> or 2n <italic>dnt osd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g009">Fig 9G and 9G’</xref>); however, their numbers increased.

<p>It is not clear if some kind of pre-patterning information (e.g. related to meiosis or cytokinesis, such as positions of meiotic spindles or last contact points between sister microspores) influences the number and positions of apertures.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and in many other eudicot species, aperture patterns on the pollen surface are influenced by mutations that affect size and ploidy of the pollen grains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref038">38</xref>]. It is, however, unknown if this aberrant patterning is caused by the increase in the pollen grain size or by changes in some other factor(s) linked to ploidy. To explore possible mechanisms responsible for pollen aperture patterning, a mathematical model based on the Gierer-Meinhardt equations was developed. This GM-based model successfully recapitulated the triaperturate equatorial patterning of the wild-type Arabidopsis pollen both in 1D and in 3D geometries.</p>
<p>Our simulations demonstrated that the domain size, as well as morphogen diffusion and decay, could greatly influence the patterns produced by the morphogens. When the kinetic parameters of the morphogens were kept constant, a domain with a larger surface area generated patterns with a larger number of spikes representing apertures: under these conditions more spikes could fit on the domain.</p>
<p>Areas between the morphogen spikes exhibited reduced concentrations of the two morphogens, the activator and the inhibitor. Importantly, in these areas the concentration of the activator went down almost to zero, whereas the concentration of the inhibitor, although decreased, still remained at a relatively high level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The size of these areas of inhibition depends on the kinetics of the system—in particular, on the diffusion and decay of the two morphogens. If the diffusion of a morphogen is increased, the morphogen can travel further through the domain, leading to the decrease in the number of spikes produced. When the morphogen decay rate is decreased, the morphogens are also able to travel further and a similar decrease in the number of resulting spikes was observed. These two types of kinetic changes both extend the morphogen’s range and increase the area of inhibition, thus limiting the number of spikes that can be formed. The opposite changes to the morphogen kinetics—decrease in the diffusion or increase in the decay—will decrease the area of inhibition and correspondingly increase the number of spikes. The other parameters used in the model, <italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>H</italic></sub>, do not influence the dispersion of the morphogens but instead control the rate of morphogen production at any given location. It appears that the distance the morphogens travel, rather than the amounts of morphogens, can affect the number and patterning of spikes. Formation of the areas of inhibition may be the basis of the mechanism acting in Arabidopsis pollen grains.</p>
<p>To explore how sensitive our model was to the influence of additional stimuli, we first tested transient stimuli, in the form of either patterned or unpatterned initial conditions, followed by continuous stimuli. We found that only a strong transient stimulus could influence the final pattern produced by the model, whereas the weak stimuli, both patterned and unpatterned, were unable to affect the final spike pattern. Similarly, very weak continuous stimuli were often unable to influence patterning. Yet, overall, continuous stimuli of low amplitudes were more successful in specifying patterns than the corresponding transient stimuli. We found that in the presence of either transient or continuous stimuli with three spikes and the amplitude above 10<sup>−4</sup> <italic>μ</italic>M, the larger-sized 3D domain produced only three-spike solutions instead of the typical four, indicating the strong effect of these types of stimuli on the resulting pattern. This suggests that if there exists some form of <italic>in vivo</italic> pre-patterning stimulus specifying three apertures, then the stimulus is likely to be small since pollen is capable of overcoming its influence and producing a different number of apertures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g001">Fig 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>Our model was able to recreate elongated, furrow-like spikes resembling Arabidopsis apertures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g007">Fig 7</xref>) only when we used extreme parameter values that were close to the levels at which the model reaches bifurcation and stops producing patterns. This indicates that the elongation is not robust to perturbations to the model, and that the formation of elongated apertures <italic>in vivo</italic> may be caused by other mechanisms that were not captured by our model.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the distribution of four apertures, equally spaced around the equator and commonly observed in the 2n Arabidopsis pollen, was not captured well in the 3D geometry. The majority of the four-spike patterns produced in 3D had the spikes centered on the corners of a tetrahedron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). In contrast, in 1D the model assumes that the process of initial aperture patterning is restricted to the equator of the microspores, and here four-spikes were the predominant pattern for larger domain sizes and for many of the tested parameter values. If the process that initially positions aperture factors is restricted to the pollen equator, then the 1D domain would be a good fit for the patterning expected in Arabidopsis mutants with larger pollen grains.</p>
<p>In addition to the patterns of three or more apertures that were previously observed in Arabidopsis pollen, our model also predicted that under some conditions pollen might be able to produce two apertures or a ring-shaped aperture that could be created by the fusion of two apertures. The aperture pattern of the <italic>mcr</italic> mutant, with a ring-like aperture produced by joining of the two initial apertures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g008">Fig 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s009">S4 Video</xref>), has a similar phenotype and appears to be generated in the same way as the ring-like patterns in the model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s006">S1 Video</xref>). However, in the mathematical model, the ring-like patterns developed only on the larger-size domain and either when the morphogen diffusion was at an extreme value, close to the boundary of the pattern-forming region, or when the morphogen decay was sufficiently reduced. On the WT domain, the ring-like pattern was not formed with any choice of individually changed parameters, nor was it formed in the presence of a stimulus mimicking the ring-like pattern. Therefore, it is possible that in the <italic>mcr</italic> mutants, which have pollen of normal size, the mutation leads to multiple kinetic changes that together contribute to the production of the ring-like aperture. An alternative possibility is that the apertures in the <italic>mcr</italic> mutant correspond to the two-spike pattern, which was frequently produced by our model for normal-size domains (e.g. in the cases of increased diffusion or decreased decay for an activator). This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that apertures in the tetrad-stage <italic>mcr</italic> microspores start their development at two separate positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g008">Fig 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006800.s009">S4 Video</xref>) and later coalesce into the ring-like pattern. It is, therefore, conceivable that the <italic>mcr</italic> mutation could affect the kinetics of aperture factors and that separate mechanisms could be responsible for positioning the centers of apertures and for promoting aperture elongation that creates their final, furrow-like, morphology.</p>
<p>When pollen ploidy and size were increased in the <italic>mcr</italic> mutant, the behavior of its aperture patterns followed the model’s predictions. The model suggested that, instead of two apertures, three apertures should form if the domain size increased to that of the 2n pollen. Indeed, the 2n <italic>mcr</italic> pollen developed the triaperturate pattern—independently of the way this pollen was produced, through a tetrad or dyad. In the 4n <italic>mcr</italic> pollen, the most common aperture pattern consisted of a ring-shaped aperture on one side of the pollen grain and one or two hole-like apertures on the opposite side. Interestingly, our model was also able to generate this unusual pattern.</p>
<p>In palynological literature, the <italic>mcr</italic> -like aperture pattern is referred to as bi-syncolpate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref006">6</xref>], zonacolpate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref039">39</xref>], or ring-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref002">2</xref>]. The examples of pollen with this aperture pattern are relatively infrequent in nature: for instance, only 15 species out of almost 3,000 species represented in the palynological database PalDat exhibit this pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref002">2</xref>]. Interestingly, in the case of one well-documented example, the genus <italic>Pedicularis</italic> includes multiple species with bi-syncolpate pollen, as well as species that produce triaperturate (tricolpate and tri-syncolpate) pollen grains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref041">41</xref>]. This suggests a possibility that the variations in aperture patterns among the <italic>Pedicularis</italic> species could be the result of mutations affecting the homologs of <italic>mcr</italic> or related aperture factors.</p>
<p>The phenotype of the <italic>dnt</italic> mutant, with its two round apertures on the opposite poles of the pollen grain, mimics the two-spike patterns produced by the model. This indicates that the <italic>dnt</italic> mutation may affect the useful lifespan of the morphogens or the way they are transported within the microspores. The <italic>dnt</italic> mutation might increase the area of inhibition in microspores, so that only two spikes in the concentration of aperture factors will form.</p>
<p>If there are indeed kinetic changes in the Arabidopsis mutants, it is unlikely that they only affect one of the parameters in the model. To account for this, a multi-parameter kinetics analysis could be performed to test all possible combinations of parameter values. In addition, our mathematical model only considered a single microspore in the shape of a perfect sphere, whereas <italic>in vivo</italic> apertures are formed on the microspores that are not entirely spherical and are joined into tetrads. Differently shaped microspores could be modeled to determine if the surface morphology plays a role in the number and positions of apertures. The local geometric and biophysical properties, such as membrane curvature and pressure from the callose wall that envelopes tetrads, could potentially affect protein kinetics, movement, or positioning and influence such processes as aperture elongation. The identification of the genes affected in the <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> mutants will likely provide important insights into the mechanism of pollen aperture patterning that can be used to further refine the mathematical model.</p>
<p>The choice of the Gierer-Meinhardt model in this study was due to the fact that the patterns observed on pollen grains are equally spaced, similar to the patterns produced by the GM model. The GM model has been successfully used to study similar patterns in other biological systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref028">28</xref>], and we applied that model here to better understand specification of aperture positioning. A similar model has previously been used to simulate pattern forming processes, where the underlying interaction network is unknown, to great effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref025">25</xref>]. As more information is gained about the proteins involved in aperture specification, more detailed and biologically realistic models can be developed to explore aperture formation in more detail. For example, we have recently identified the protein kinase D6PKL3 as an aperture factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref016">16</xref>]. This suggests that mechanisms involving protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation might have to be taken into account in the future models.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we were able to show computationally that aperture formation in Arabidopsis could be controlled by kinetics of aperture factors and by pollen grain size. Following the model’s predictions, we found Arabidopsis plants with the previously unobserved <italic>mcr</italic> and <italic>dnt</italic> aperture phenotypes. These findings demonstrate that mathematical modeling is able to provide valuable insights even when the mechanisms behind the biological phenomena are unknown or when a direct connection between the biological patterning mechanism(s) and the mathematical patterning is not known to exist. Future work with similar qualitative modeling may help to explain the mechanisms responsible for the great variety of patterns that exist in pollen grains across species.</p>

<p>Two types of domains were used to explore the patterning of the two morphogens. The first was a one-dimensional domain representing the equator of a microspore. The second was the surface of a three-dimensional sphere, representing the surface of a microspore. For all simulations, the initial conditions of the two morphogens were set to be near their diffusion-free steady-state values. Turing-type patterns require the initial conditions to have a level of random noise for patterns to form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006800.ref026">26</xref>]. Therefore, we tested random noise levels between 10<sup>−15</sup> <italic>μM</italic> to 10<sup>2</sup> <italic>μM</italic>, and found that the model produced identical patterns, indicating that within these limits the noise did not influence the resulting patterns. However, levels of noise below 10<sup>−6</sup> <italic>μM</italic> and above 10<sup>−2</sup> <italic>μM</italic> resulted in simulations taking longer to run. Therefore, we added a random value between ±5*10<sup>−4</sup> <italic>μM</italic> to every point of our initial conditions.</p>
<p>The following assumptions and simplifications were made:</p>

<p>A single microspore was modeled, thus ignoring any effects that interactions between sister microspores in a tetrad may have on aperture formation.</p>

<p>To see if domain size alone could account for changes in the number of apertures, we ran the model with varying domain sizes.

<sec id="sec022">
<title>Addition of transient and continuous stimuli</title>
<p>Microspores could receive some pre-patterning information via meiosis/cytokinesis events or through interaction between sister microspores. To simulate the potential input from this pre-patterning information, we added external stimuli to our model. Two different types of external stimuli were tested, an initial transient stimulus and a continuous stimulus.</p>
<p>The initial transient stimulus in the model was accomplished by adding a patterned initial condition on top of the random noise of the activator. The stimulus was added only to the activator because we wanted the patterning of the stimulus to directly influence the pattern produced by our model. A stimulus could have been added to the inhibitor, but an increase in inhibitor concentration alone would lead to a decrease in activator concentration at that location and therefore produce a pattern unrelated to the stimulus. The stimulus was made to resemble the types of patterns that occur in the model: one, two, three, or four spikes equally spaced around the equator, four spikes placed at the corners of a tetrahedron, and a ring-like pattern with increased concentration around the equator. The initial conditions with addition of the transient stimulus resembled <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g003">Fig 3</xref> in 1D and 3D or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g007">Fig 7(A)–7(F)</xref> in 3D.

Multiple spikes were simulated by adding additional equations at additional specified locations. For the ring-like stimulus we used a similar equation with only the y-coordinate; this gave the ring-like pattern observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006800.g007">Fig 7(F)</xref>.
