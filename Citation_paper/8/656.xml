          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Wide variations in mortality rates persist between different areas in England, despite an overall steady decline. To evaluate a conceptual model that might explain how population and service characteristics influence population mortality variations, an overall null hypothesis was tested: variations in primary healthcare service do not predict variations in mortality at population level, after adjusting for population characteristics.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>In an observational study of all 152 English primary care trusts (geographical groupings of population and primary care services, total population 52 million), routinely available published data from 2008 and 2009 were modelled using negative binomial regression. Counts for all-cause, coronary heart disease, all cancers, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality were analyzed using explanatory variables of relevant population and service-related characteristics, including an age-correction factor. The main predictors of mortality variations were population characteristics, especially age and socio-economic deprivation. For the service characteristics, a 1% increase in the percentage of patients on a primary care hypertension register was associated with decreases in coronary heart disease mortality of 3% (95% CI 1–4%, p = 0.006) and in stroke mortality of 6% (CI 3–9%, p&lt;0.0001); a 1% increase in the percentage of patients recalling being better able to see their preferred doctor was associated with decreases in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality of 0.7% (CI 0.2–2.0%, p = 0.02) and in all cancer mortality of 0.3% (CI 0.1–0.5%, p = 0.009) (continuity of care). The study found no evidence of an association at primary care trust population level between variations in achievement of pay for performance and mortality.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Some primary healthcare service characteristics were also associated with variations in mortality at population level, supporting the conceptual model. Health care system reforms should strengthen these characteristics by delivering cost-effective evidence-based interventions to whole populations, and fostering sustained patient-provider partnerships.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Population mortality rates vary within and between countries with developed health care systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-World1">[1]</xref>. In England the directly age-standardised rates for all-cause mortality have declined steadily from 790 per 100,000 European Standard population in 1993 to 547 per 100,000 in 2009 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-National1">[2]</xref>. Healthcare in England is free at the point of access <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Schoen1">[3]</xref>, and virtually the entire population is registered with a primary care provider; nonetheless, wide variations in mortality rates persist between different areas (from 354 to 766 deaths per 100,000 in 2009 among the then 152 primary care trusts, geographical groupings of population and primary care services, in England) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-National1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Characteristics of local populations are important determinants of population mortality. There are associations, at individual and population levels, between increased rates of various mortalities and levels of socio-economic deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-TheMarmot1">[4]</xref>, smoking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Surgeon1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Doll1">[6]</xref>, obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Adams1">[7]</xref>, hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-ProspectiveStudies1">[8]</xref>, and diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Seshasai1">[9]</xref>. Different interventions have a variable effect on some of these characteristics, for example, smoking cessation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Anthonisen1">[10]</xref>, lowering blood pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-National2">[11]</xref>, lowering low density lipoprotein cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Law1">[12]</xref>, and low dose aspirin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-AntithromboticTrialists1">[13]</xref>, which can reduce the numbers of adverse events, in particular cardiovascular events, in high risk patients.</p>

          <p>A proportion of the healthy or morbid population will die each year. This may be predicted by relevant population characteristics; however, appropriate health care may alter this predictive effect, either directly on the progression from 1 or more of these diseases to death or indirectly by affecting a “modifiable” population factor (e.g. detecting and treating blood pressure, detecting obesity, delivering smoking cessation or weight reduction care). In addition to primary healthcare, other factors may affect the progression to mortality, including secondary healthcare and non-healthcare led interventions, such as in education, employment and housing.</p>

      <p>Primary care has the potential to improve the effectiveness of health systems by delivering to the majority of the population appropriate preventive measures, and to most of those with common chronic conditions, appropriate management. Primary care has been defined as “the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing the large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients and practising in the context of family and community” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Donaldson1">[14]</xref>. Reviewing the evidence on the contribution of primary care to health systems, Starfield et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Starfield1">[15]</xref> identified mechanisms potentially accounting for the beneficial impact of primary care on population health, including greater access to needed services, better quality of care, greater focus on prevention, earlier disease management, and the cumulative effect, with a holistic focus, of greater continuity and comprehensiveness. The rationale for extending access to healthcare in systems where access is not universal is supported by evidence that better access to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Shi1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Shi2">[17]</xref>, and greater sustained continuity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Haggerty1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Cabana1">[19]</xref> of healthcare are associated with better health outcomes, especially in long term conditions.</p>

      <p>At a time of financial constraint, countries are considering how the contribution of primary care to health system efficiency could be improved, for example through improved disease management and prevention that reduces demand for specialist services <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Schoen1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Hofmarcher1">[20]</xref>. The most important recent developments in primary care in England include the introduction of a pay for performance scheme, the Quality and Outcomes Framework, implemented in 2004 with financial incentives to improve quality of care and reduce variations in management of chronic diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Department1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Roland1">[22]</xref>, and reforms now underway in which primary care trusts are being replaced by a larger number of general practitioner-led clinical commissioning groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Parliament1">[23]</xref>. To improve overall health system performance, evidence on which features of primary care most influence population health, including mortality, should be sought.</p>
      <p>Drawing on Starfield’s mechanisms and our previous finding of an association between the lower detection of hypertension by general practices and higher coronary heart disease mortality at primary care trust population level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Levene1">[24]</xref>, a conceptual model was devised to explain how the effect of population characteristics upon variations in mortality of long-term conditions might be modified by variations in the delivery of primary care that incorporates whole population coverage (greater access to services) and offers sustained relationships with patients (the cumulative effect of primary care delivery characteristics, including continuity and comprehensiveness). Appropriate interventions target both healthy and morbid populations via early detection, prevention and appropriate management of people with established disease. The model also recognises the modifying effect of other factors on mortality, either within secondary healthcare or outside healthcare (e.g. education, housing and employment<sup>4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047800-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Whilst variations in population mortality are predicted mainly by population characteristics, the model asserts that variations in the delivery of primary care do have some predictive effect, particularly when whole populations are involved.</p>
      <p>In order to evaluate this conceptual model, the following testable overall null hypothesis was derived: variations in primary health care do not predict variations in mortality at population level, after adjusting for population characteristics.</p>

        <title>Study Design</title>
        <p>An observational study was undertaken, involving all primary care trusts in England, in which population and service characteristics were used to explain mortality in 5 disease areas (models) in a two year period using negative binomial regression modelling. Data from the two years were modelled jointly using a generalized estimating equations approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Liang1">[25]</xref>, but each model featured only a single outcome, although this outcome was measured twice (once in each year) in the models. The STROBE checklist was used in the design and reporting of this study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-STROBE1">[26]</xref>. We chose to undertake the study at the population level of primary care trusts rather than general practices (of which in England there were 8,305 in the 2009/2010 financial year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-NHS1">[27]</xref> and 8,229 in 2008/2009 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-NHS2">[28]</xref>), since we were unable to obtain mortality data at practice level from the Office for National Statistics and reliable data for several population characteristics, such as rates of obesity, smoking and ethnicity, were not available at practice level.</p>

          <title>Mortality outcomes</title>
          <p>Mortality counts in each trust were the dependent variables. To maintain variable consistency, counts were used in preference to age-standardized rates, as none of the selected explanatory variables were age-standardized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Gardner1">[30]</xref>. To correct for variations in trust population age structures, the percentage of a primary care trust’s population aged 65 years or more was one of the explanatory variables.</p>
          <p>Mortality counts for all cause (total), coronary heart disease (International Classification of Diseases ICD-10 I20–I25), all cancers (International Classification of Diseases ICD-10 C00–C97), stroke (International Classification of Diseases ICD-10 I60–I69) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (International Classification of Diseases ICD-10 J40–J44) were obtained for the last two available years, 2008 and 2009. Coronary heart disease, all cancer, stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality accounted for 14.7%, 28.1%, 8.9% and 4.8% (when combined, more than half) of total mortality in England in 2009, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-National1">[2]</xref>. These mortality groups were selected as, in addition to all-cause mortality, they constituted common long-term conditions potentially amenable to interventions in primary care, including prevention, early detection, and effective management; and data were available for both the mortality group and principal risk factors. Our previous study that contributed to the development of the conceptual model was focused on coronary heart disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Levene1">[24]</xref>, but we included coronary heart disease in the current analysis, because different outcomes (counts instead of age-adjusted rates) and some different predictor variables were used.</p>

          <title>Predictor selection</title>
          <p>Predictor selection was governed by two principles: conceptual relevance and the number of observational units in our dataset. Candidate explanatory variables relating to population or primary healthcare service characteristics were initially selected on the basis of the conceptual model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047800-g001">Figure 1</xref>), using data available for every trust with potential to predict mortality. However, in order for a regression analysis to be reliable, a maximum of no more than m/10 explanatory variables per analysis is recommended <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Harrell1">[31]</xref>, where m is the number of observational units (such as patients). This required selectivity as to which variables were used for modelling each mortality group.</p>

For all respondents, patients who expressed a preference for seeing a particular doctor at their practice were asked: “How often do you see the doctor you prefer to see?” with 4 response options: “always or almost always”, “a lot of the time”, “some of the time” or “never or almost never”. The response options, “always or almost always” and “a lot of the time” were defined as positive, indicating better access to continuity, while the other two options were combined, and defined as indicating worse access to continuity.</p>

        <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
        <p>Descriptive statistics for mortality rates and candidate predictors were carried out for each year separately. In order to test the study hypothesis we undertook a separate regression analysis for each category of mortality. The data were over-dispersed counts, so an appropriate analysis method was negative binomial regression, using the log of the primary care trust size as an offset to adjust for the fact that trust size, and thus the number at risk, varied between trusts. Analyses were undertaken using SAS version 9.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-SAS1">[53]</xref>. Sample size was dictated by the total number of primary care trusts in England. We tested the association between mortality counts and primary care characteristics by using a generalized estimating equations approach in which the two years were modelled jointly as a panel model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Liang1">[25]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Population level predictors assumed to have a major impact on mortality, after adjusting for other predictors, were: deprivation; the percentage of the population aged 65 years or over; diabetes registers; the percentage of the population with white ethnicity; the percentage of male patients.</p>
        <p>The service variables related to the conceptual model were entered into the regression analysis along with all the population level predictors. The deprivation score and the percentages of adults who were obese and who were smokers were the same variable in each year; otherwise all variables were specific to each year. The significance level (alpha) was set at 0.05.</p>
        <p>Interactions between time period (year) and any significant primary care variables were tested to see whether or not effects on the outcome are similar in the two years.</p>

          <p>The main population predictors of variation in each mortality group were age (percentage aged 65 years or more), deprivation and white ethnicity. The percentage of smokers was a predictor for variations in stroke mortality. The Quality and Outcomes Framework diabetes register was a predictor for variations in all cause, coronary heart disease and stroke mortality. The modelled percentage of obese adults was a predictor for stroke mortality and for all cancer mortality. The percentage of males was a predictor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality.</p>

          <title>Service characteristics</title>
          <p>Only two primary healthcare variables were predictors of variations in a mortality group.</p>
          <p>Higher levels of detected hypertension (hypertension registers) were significantly associated with lower levels of coronary heart disease and stroke mortality. Being better able to see a preferred doctor was significantly associated with lower levels of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer mortality.</p>
          <p>An effect for time period (year) was included in each model, together with its interaction with the significant primary care predictor, in order to determine whether the primary care effect differed from year to year, but the interaction between time and each significant primary care variable was not significant in any of the models. To better understand the quantitative effect of these primary healthcare predictors, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047800-t005">table 5</xref> presents the predicted difference in mortality rates between the PCTs with the highest and lowest percentage for each significant predictor, after adjusting for other predictors.</p>
          <p>We found no association between any of the other healthcare variables and variations in trust population mortality in any of the disease groups in our models.</p>
          <p>The analyses were repeated using two potential confounding explanatory variables, rates of exception-reporting for the Quality and Outcomes Framework and the percentage of single-handed general practices, which had not been included in the conceptual model. Neither of these variables was a predictor of variations in mortality in any of the analyses. We used the percentage of the population aged 65 years and over as a variable to account for the effect of population on mortality, but other measures of population age might have been selected, and on checking our age correction factor, a correlation of 0.99 was identified between the percentages of the population aged 65 years or more and those aged 75 years or more in each year.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <sec id="s4a">
        <title>Main Findings</title>
        <p>As expected, variations in mortality rates between primary care trust populations for all-cause mortality and the four specific disease mortality groups were predicted mainly by variations in population factors, particularly deprivation. However, the stated aim of the study was to examine the association between primary healthcare service factors and mortality, with population factors included in the model solely in order to adjust for their effects.</p>
        <p>With respect to demographic factors: indices of deprivation are composites of both health and non-health factors. The strongly positive predictive effect of deprivation is expected and consistent with previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-TheMarmot1">[4]</xref>, and we note, but cannot explain, the independent positive predictive effect of white ethnicity, an unexpected but consistent finding across all of the mortality groups examined.</p>
        <p>With respect to primary healthcare service characteristics, the overall null hypothesis was rejected in each of the four specific disease mortality groups: variations in primary healthcare service factors predicted variations in mortality at the population level, after adjusting for population characteristics. The study’s inability to find a health care predictor for variations in all-cause mortality is perhaps not surprising, due to the heterogeneity of causes of mortality. The negative association of variations in hypertension registers with variations in coronary heart disease and stroke mortality can be explained by the under-detection of hypertension. Thus, the findings suggest that improving detection of hypertension has substantial potential to reduce coronary heart disease and stroke mortality. The much smaller, but still significant, predictive effect of being able to see a preferred doctor (linked to both access and sustained partnership) on variations in cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality may be explained by the mechanisms identified by Starfield, including continuity, comprehensiveness and coordination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Starfield1">[15]</xref> (better partnerships with individual patients are more likely to expose a greater percentage of the population to appropriate interventions). We found a strong negative correlation between deprivation and patients’ perception of being able to see a preferred doctor (−0.53), suggesting that barriers to forming sustained partnerships with healthcare are greater in deprived populations.</p>
        <p>Although the predictive effect of primary care characteristics on variations in mortality is smaller than that of population characteristics, small improvements to primary care performance, when applied to large populations, could produce numerically large benefits, as suggested by <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047800-t004">tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047800-t005">5</xref>.</p>
        <p>The finding that variations in clinical performance (for example, achieving cholesterol targets in known patients with coronary heart disease or stroke) at population levels (i.e. primary care trust), did not have predictive ability does not mean that clinical management is unimportant in reducing mortality risk in individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Doran1">[54]</xref>; but rather, the extent of variation was not sufficient to explain variations in mortality in our model at primary care trust level, and may reflect the Rose perspective on preventive health of small shifts in variables applied to large populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Rose1">[55]</xref>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s4b">
        <title>Limitations of this Study</title>
        <p>The service factors included were limited to those for which good quality data were available. Variations in other primary care characteristics, secondary healthcare delivery and non-health care factors may possibly have predictive ability for variations in population mortality.</p>
        <p>As discussed in the methods section above, the Index of Multiple Deprivation Score has a health domain weighted at 13.5%, including a single mortality indicator (years of potential life lost). The extent to which any correlation between our mortality dependent variables and the overall IMD score would be exaggerated by the presence of the years of life lost indicator is likely to be small <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Baker1">[56]</xref>. However, the advantages of using the generally recognized indicator, underpinned by robust methodology, and the lack of a superior alternative, outweighed this small disadvantage.</p>
        <p>The data were not entirely contemporaneous; smoking and obesity rates were from 2006–2008; the deprivation index was calculated for 2007; mortality data were for the calendar year; and the Quality and Outcomes Framework, smoking cessation and General Practice Patient Survey data relate to the business year (April to March). These were the latest or best contemporaneous fit for the variables analyzed.</p>
        <p>Because of relatively low response rates in the General Practice Patient Survey (22 to 55%), findings using these data have to be interpreted with caution. However, by following rigorous probability sampling processes, these surveys have minimised bias due to low response rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Roland2">[57]</xref>. Also, the surveys were the only source of uniform data on patients’ ability to consult a preferred doctor.</p>
        <p>The study was limited to investigating associations at primary care trust level. However, since the basis of the study was a conceptual model with a framework explaining the modifying effect of primary care on population health outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Starfield1">[15]</xref>, and the findings were consistent with the model, the identified associations almost certainly reflect how primary care features affected population mortality.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s4c">
        <title>Implications</title>
        <p>Healthcare reforms should aim to reduce variations in population mortality. This study’s findings indicate that primary care’s effectiveness will be improved when primary care organisations have a strong public health perspective. In such an approach, strategies and incentives should deliver appropriate interventions, including prevention and early detection, to as many people with potential to benefit as possible, in the context of sustained partnership <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-Hart1">[58]</xref> and be tailored to address local needs and the adverse effects of social factors on health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047800-TheMarmot1">[4]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Primary healthcare service characteristics are associated with variations in mortality rates in England, after adjustment for population characteristics. To reduce these variations, the consistent delivery of simple, cost-effective and appropriate interventions to whole populations is needed, fostered through sustained relationships between patients and healthcare.</p>
