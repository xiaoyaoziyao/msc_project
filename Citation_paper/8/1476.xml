<abstract>
<p>Alpha-synuclein protein is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis Parkinson's disease. Increased expression of α-synuclein due to genetic multiplication or point mutations leads to early onset disease. While α-synuclein is known to modulate membrane vesicle dynamics, it is not clear if this activity is involved in the pathogenic process or if measurable physiological effects of α-synuclein over-expression or mutation exist <italic>in vivo</italic>. Macrophages and microglia isolated from BAC α-synuclein transgenic mice, which overexpress α-synuclein under regulation of its own promoter, express α-synuclein and exhibit impaired cytokine release and phagocytosis. These processes were affected <italic>in vivo</italic> as well, both in peritoneal macrophages and microglia in the CNS. Extending these findings to humans, we found similar results with monocytes and fibroblasts isolated from idiopathic or familial Parkinson's disease patients compared to age-matched controls. In summary, this paper provides 1) a new animal model to measure α-synuclein dysfunction; 2) a cellular system to measure synchronized mobilization of α-synuclein and its functional interactions; 3) observations regarding a potential role for innate immune cell function in the development and progression of Parkinson's disease and other human synucleinopathies; 4) putative peripheral biomarkers to study and track these processes in human subjects. While altered neuronal function is a primary issue in PD, the widespread consequence of abnormal α-synuclein expression in other cell types, including immune cells, could play an important role in the neurodegenerative progression of PD and other synucleinopathies. Moreover, increased α-synuclein and altered phagocytosis may provide a useful biomarker for human PD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The evidence implicating alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is overwhelming. However, there is not a clear consensus on the manner in which α-syn leads to pathology in PD and other synucleinopathies. Alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies (LBs), and descriptions of α-syn overexpression leading to aggregation are abundant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Fink1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Paleologou1">[3]</xref>. Human genetic data have demonstrated that missense mutations and multiplications in the α-syn gene cause familial PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Schiesling1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Lucking1">[5]</xref>. In the case of gene multiplication, increased levels of α-syn protein are presumed to result in a dominant gain-of-function that leads to pathology. While increased levels of α-syn may lead to aggregation and toxicity, research over the past few years has also revealed that elevated α-syn can interfere with the creation, localization, and/or maintenance of vesicle pools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Nemani1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Thayanidhi1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although α-syn dysfunction is largely studied in neurons, α-syn pathology in PD patients has been described in non-CNS cell types and organ systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Ikemura1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Reichmann1">[11]</xref> and the current perspective on PD is evolving from a purely dopaminergic neuron brain disease to a more systemic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Jellinger1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Wakabayashi1">[13]</xref>. Altered microglia responses are a hallmark of PD pathology and recent evidence suggests that reactive microglia represent more than a response to neuronal injury, and may actively participate in the demise of dopaminergic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Halliday1">[14]</xref>. Given a clear role for α-syn in PD pathology, a number of studies have examined the response of microglia to extracellular α-syn, but few studies have explored the function and potential pathogenic role of α-syn expressed by microglial cells themselves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Lee1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Roodveldt1">[16]</xref>. Interestingly, mice in which the α-syn gene was knocked out were reported to have changes in microglial function, specifically, altered phagocytosis and increased cytokine response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Austin1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Engulfment and removal of pathogens and cellular debris is the quintessential function of phagocytes. Phagocytosis is a key process executed by both professional phagocytes (macrophages and microglia) as well as non-professional phagocytes (such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells). Phagocytosis is required for the efficient elimination and destruction of pathogens, timely removal of dead and dying cells, cellular sampling of environmental antigens for presentation to adaptive immune cells, and maintenance of tissue homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Erwig1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Elliott1">[19]</xref>. This process <italic>in vivo</italic> is so efficient, that the presence of dead, dying, and apoptosing cells is generally absent, and can only be observed under conditions of impaired cellular clearance by phagocytes.</p>
<p>Engulfment of medium and large sized particles involves internalization of large expanses of plasma membrane, coupled with addition of new plasma membrane to maintain the surface area and shape of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Braun1">[20]</xref>. Elegant experiments utilizing membrane labeling compounds or electrophysiological methods demonstrated that the maintenance of surface area during particle ingestion is linked to the concomitant mobilization and focal exocytosis of membrane to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Palokangas1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Hackam1">[22]</xref>. While the intracellular source of the replacement membrane varies between different systems, they all share a common process in which the delivery of additional membrane through vesicular fusion is coordinated by various members of the SNARE family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Huynh1">[23]</xref>. SNARE family members associate into stable complexes that direct membrane fusion events. The SNARE mediated process of vesicle exocytosis is not only critical for phagocytosis but is also required for the release of inflammatory cytokines from macrophages and microglia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Murray1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>SNARE complexes prime vesicles for fusion with the plasma membrane and are composed of proteins from each of three separate families: a SNAP, a Syntaxin, and a VAMP. SNARE complexes are formed by cells in anticipation of membrane fusion events and upon stimulation, the complexes localize to the points of vesicle contact, facilitate membrane fusion, and then dissociate into their individual components that are recycled to form new complexes. Numerous studies in other labs have shown that α-syn may affect SNARE complex assembly either through direct interaction with members of the SNARE family, or by sequestering agents, such as arachadonic acid, which promote SNARE assembly and activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Burr1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Darios1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have recently developed a novel transgenic genomic mouse model in which wild type or the E46K mutant form of human α-syn was expressed from a human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). This model is similar to that created by Kou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Kuo1">[27]</xref> however, we focused on wild type and the E46K mutated form of α-syn rather than the A30P and A53T mutations described previously. The BAC construct contains the α-syn promoter and other potential regulatory regions including upstream, and 15 kb downstream sequences. Because α-syn expression is driven from its own promoter, not from a highly active exogenous promoter, this <italic>in vivo</italic> system may provide insight into human disease, because in humans duplication or triplication of the gene is sufficient to lead to early onset PD. In addition, the potential impact of elevated α-syn levels on multiple cellular and tissue systems can be assessed. In the work described here, we used these mice to examine the role of α-syn in innate immune cell function. We were particularly interested in macrophages and microglia because of their involvement in PD pathology and their intensive reliance on membrane dynamics for their central roles in cytokine release and phagocytic function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Huynh1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Lacy1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data demonstrates that increased expression of the α-syn protein has an inhibitory effect on the release of inflammatory cytokines, vesicular fusion, and phagocytic processes. Defective phagocytosis occurred in brain microglia and peripheral macrophages, either isolated and assayed in culture, or assayed <italic>in situ</italic>. Fibroblasts and monocytes isolated from sporadic PD patients and a patient carrying a triplication of the α-syn gene exhibited elevated α-syn levels, which correlated with defective phagocytic function. We also expand upon the molecular details regarding α-syn interaction with membrane trafficking components, and demonstrate active recruitment of α-syn to a site of stimulated membrane fusion during phagocytosis. Our data further defines the role that α-syn plays in membrane vesicle dynamics and extends these findings into systemic processes beyond neuronal function, which may provide a valuable peripheral biomarker of elevated α-syn levels and dysfunctional vesicle dynamics. Our data suggest that there may be a previously unappreciated involvement of innate immune cell function in synucleinopathies, and that cells of the innate immune system provide an excellent, tightly regulated cellular model in which to study the effects of increased α-syn levels on vesicle function.</p>

<title>α-syn is expressed in microglia from BAC transgenic mice</title>
<p>To examine the impact of α-syn overexpression on innate immune cell function, we utilized three transgenic mouse lines, each of which expresses α-syn from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) genomic context; line 422 expressing wild type α-syn and two lines, line 26 and line 3, expressing the mutant E46K form. The BAC transgene results in an increase in α-syn expression (as measured by RT-PCR and ELISA) and a full characterization of these animals will be reported elsewhere (Hilton et al., in preparation). Because the expression of α-syn is driven by endogenous regulatory sequences, we first examined if human α-syn was detectable in mouse microglia isolated from genomic mice, and whether expression was increased compared to wild type microglia. Non-transgenic (non-TG) and α-syn genomic transgenic (α-syn TG) microglia expressed α-syn detectable by immunoblot and the specificity was validated with microglia isolated from α-syn null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref><bold>, top panel</bold>). Microglia isolated from all three α-syn TG lines (3, 26, and 422) expressed elevated levels of human α-syn as confirmed by mRNA analysis (representative line26 samples shown here <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and total α-syn protein as shown by immunoblot compared to non-TG littermates <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref><bold>, bottom panel)</bold>. Since α-syn expression can occur in astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Gu1">[29]</xref> we verified microglial cell expression by flow cytometry, double labeling cells with anti-α-syn and a microglia marker, IBA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). Specific microglia α-syn expression as determined by intracellular staining was increased in cells from α-syn TG animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>). These results also show that microglial cells are the predominant cell type (and hence the predominant source of α-syn) in our cultures.</p>

<title>Increased α-syn in microglia and macrophages disrupts cytokine exocytosis</title>
<p>Microglia deficient in α-syn were reported to have altered cytokine release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Austin1">[17]</xref> prompting us to investigate the consequence of elevated expression on cytokine secretion. To induce cytokine release, microglia from line 26 TG and non-TG littermate controls were exposed to LPS for 18hrs. Microglia from the α-syn TG mice secreted significantly less IL-6 and TNF-α compared to their non-TG controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g002"><bold>Figure</bold> <bold>2A</bold></xref>), which is in contrast with increased cytokine secretion reported from α-syn null cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Austin1">[17]</xref>. These deficits were not due to aberrant insertion of the BAC transgene into a cytokine locus, or other interference, since the same effects on cytokine release were measured in microglia isolated from all three independent BAC transgenic lines (lines 3, 26 and 422) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0071634.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). The deficit was also not due solely to the E46K mutation of α-syn, since line 422 expresses the WT α-syn sequence. Alterations in cytokine secretion were also found <italic>in vivo</italic>, where α-syn TG mice had muted levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines following low dose lipopolysaccharides (LPS) administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>Secretion of specific cytokines requires dynamic vesicle mobilization and fusion of cargo containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. Therefore, we investigated whether α-syn altered innate immune responsiveness by negatively regulating vesicle dynamics, or by affecting signaling pathways upstream of membrane events, such as LPS induced toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. To distinguish between these two possibilities, cytokine mRNA production in non-TG and α-syn TG microglia was evaluated following LPS exposure. Microglia from human α-syn TG animals crossed onto a murineα-syn null background were utilized to limit potential confounding effects of endogenous murine α-syn <italic>(line 26 x α-syn null)</italic>. LPS stimulated equivalent cytokine mRNA production in non-TG and α-syn TG microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed that the non-TG and α-syn TG cells made similar levels of cytokines at the protein level by blocking cytokine release with Brefeldin A (BFA) and measuring intracellular cytokine levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g002"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g002"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref>).

<p>Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells requires engagement of specific receptors, while ingestion of inert particles such as latex beads is believed to be independent of receptor expression and engagement. Because ingestion of both beads and cells was decreased in the human α-syn TG cells, it is unlikely to be caused by a specific receptor defect and more likely caused by a failure in membrane mobilization and function. The observed phagocytic deficit was also likely not due to insertion artifacts of the BAC construct since the three α-syn TG lines examined exhibited a similar reduction in phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>), and occurred with both wild type α-syn (line 422) and the E46K α-syn mutation (lines 3 and 26). Phenotypes associated with human α-syn overexpression may be exacerbated in the absence of murine α-syn. However, the absence of murine α-syn did not amplify the phagocytic defect associated with human α-syn overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>) nor did it affect the deficit in cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). The phagocytic defect was also not restricted to microglia or to cells isolated during early development as peritoneal macrophages isolated from adult human α-syn TG animals also exhibited decreased phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that α-syn impairs large particle phagocytosis in microglia and macrophages.</p>
<p>Membrane addition to the cell surface in the initial phase of phagocytosis can be tracked with FM1-43, a fluorescent dye that incorporates into exposed membranes and hence provides increased fluorescence during the processes of phagocytosis. With non-TG microglia, FM1-43 incorporation and fluorescence increased after bead addition, however, FM1-43 membrane incorporation and fluorescence did not increase in α-syn TG microglia after bead addition of beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g003"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref>). Alterations in FM1-43 labeling were quantified as mean fluorescence intensity compared to unlabeled cells from 3 independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g003"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>) and this data suggest that increased α-syn results in defects in vesicle recruitment to the plasma membrane.</p>

<p>Genetic manipulation of microglia is technically challenging since they do not transfect easily and are inclined to activation with transfection reagents. Therefore, we established a cultured cell model to assess the mechanism by which α-syn blocks vesicle dynamics. H4 cells are a human neuroglioma cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Outeiro1">[36]</xref> that are easy to transfect and can ingest latex beads (see below). Transient transfection of H4 cells with α- or β-syn resulted in elevated expression of these proteins, however only α-syn expression reduced phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>). Alpha-synuclein modulation of phagocytosis in H4 cells appeared to be due to alteration in vesicle trafficking, as vector transfected H4 cells displayed increased FM1-43 fluorescence following bead addition, while α-syn-transfected cells did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g005"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>). Importantly, the data generated in the transfected H4 system confirms the data from the α-syn genomic microglia and macrophages (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g003">Figure <bold>3B</bold></xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g005">Figure <bold>5C</bold></xref>) since increased expression of α-syn in both systems prevented membrane expansion in response to bead stimulation and reduced phagocytosis by 50%.</p>

To examine α-syn dynamics during the phagocytic process, H4 cells (expressing endogenous α-syn) were fixed at various times after bead addition, stained with anti-α-syn antibodies and localization of α-syn protein within the phagocytic cup assessed. Alpha-synuclein translocated to the point of bead contact in the phagocytic cup within 15macrophages (compare minutes, and by 90macrophages (compare minutes most of the α-syn had localized to this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref> and <bold>enlarged image 6B</bold>).

<p>To assess α-syn induced defects on SNARE complex assembly we employed the method described by Chen and Scheller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Chen1">[37]</xref>, who demonstrated that SNARE proteins form energetically favorable, SDS stable complexes that can be identified by SDS-PAGE gel analysis. If samples are not boiled the SNARE complexes remain intact and run as a high molecular weight complex, however with sample boiling the complex is disrupted and the components run as individual proteins. H4 cells transfected with α-syn or control vector were stimulated with beads for 15, 45, or 90 minutes and SNAP23, as a component of SNARE complexes, was tracked by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g007"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref> <bold>shows results from two independent experiments</bold>). At time 0, SNAP23 could be visualized within a pre-existing high molecular weight SNARE complex (molecular weight of the complex in this figure is approximately 100 kDa). In control cells, addition of beads induced a decrease in SNAP23 containing SNARE complexes over a 45 minute time period, and by 90 minutes the high molecular weight complex containing SNAP23 was reformed. However, in α-syn overexpressing cells the pre-formed SNAP23 containing SNARE complex appeared to remain stable over the entire period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g007"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>In order to test for association of α-syn with the SNARE complex in our system, we immunoprecipitated α-syn from H4 cells and looked for co-precipitation of SNAP23 and VAMP2.

The defect in phagocytosis was associated with increased α-syn levels as assessed by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g008"><bold>Figure 8B</bold></xref>) and intracellular staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g008"><bold>Figure 8C</bold></xref>).

<p>While fibroblasts are a useful model system to assess phagocytic activity, monocytes isolated from patient blood could prove to be a more practical way to assess defective vesicle dynamics in large numbers of PD patients. Using immunoblotting and flow cytometry, we determined that monocytes isolated from a SNCA triplication patient expressed increased α-syn levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g009"><bold>Figure 9A</bold></xref>). Phagocytic activity in monocytes isolated from a SNCA triplicate patient was compared to two normal control donors and the phagocytic activity was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g009"><bold>Figure 9B</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>To extend our findings to sporadic PD patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from thirty-four independent sporadic PD patients and fourteen age-matched controls, detailed patient data included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0071634-t001">Table 1</xref>, were assessed for intracellular α-syn levels and phagocytic activity. Separate analysis of monocytic and lymphocytic populations within the PBMC samples was performed based on standard FACS forward and side-scatter parameters. Alpha-synuclein levels were elevated in monocytes and lymphocytes of sporadic PD patients when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g009"><bold>Figure 9C</bold></xref>). Increased α-syn staining was confirmed by immunoblot analysis for a subset of the PBMC samples, as indicated by numbering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g009"><bold>Figure 9C</bold></xref>). No hemoglobin signal by immunoblot was detected, minimizing the possibility that RBC contamination influenced the data. These data indicate that α-syn is generally elevated in sporadic PD in peripheral white blood cells, and although the range of expression overlaps with control subjects, the high expressing patients are a clearly an identifiable population that may be of value for stratification in specific therapeutic intervention strategies. In addition to α-syn levels, we analyzed phagocytosis of fluorescently labeled CD47<sup>−/−</sup> RBCs by sporadic PD patient monocytes, and a significant defect in phagocytosis was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071634-g009"><bold>Figure 9D</bold></xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data demonstrate that α-syn is expressed in innate immune cells and that the level of α-syn expression can regulate immune cell function. In a variety of experimental systems and human cells, we observe that increased α-syn dampens the ability of macrophages to clear cellular debris and release cytokines or chemokines. First, we demonstrate this effect in microglia and macrophages isolated from novel α-syn BAC transgenic mice that exhibit modest α-syn over expression via endogenous human α-syn gene promoter elements. The genomic mice results are corroborated by <italic>in vitro</italic> transfection experiments with H4 neuroglioma cells using stimulated phagocytic activity. We extended our findings to human cells through analysis of isolated monocytes and fibroblasts from a Parkinson's patient carrying a SNCA gene triplication, as well as from idiopathic PD patients. Similar to the SNCA triplication patients, idiopathic PD patients also exhibit elevated levels of α-syn, likely as part of the disease process. Finally, we confirmed our results with both macrophages and microglial cells in their respective <italic>in vivo</italic> settings, examining phagocytosis of beads, apoptotic cells, or CD47<sup>−/−</sup> RBCs in living mice. We believe that all together, these consistent results have important implications for the role of α-syn in diseases such as PD, MSA, and Lewy body dementia, as well as in the synucleinopathies associated with peripheral organs such as the intestine and heart.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that increased levels of α-syn associated with aging and/or disease may lead to slower clearance of dead and dying cells, and may even impair clearance of α-syn itself, leading to a self-perpetuating cycle of increased α-syn that could accelerate disease progression. Furthermore, our findings may provide a new method for tracking the disease process in humans through the study of blood monocytes or skin fibroblast – cells that are easily accessible, and can be studied longitudinally from the same subjects. Finally, the phagocytic process provides a robust cell biological system for the study α-syn regulation of membrane vesicle events, and our results with SNARE complexes in this system are consistent with those of others studying neuronal systems.</p>
<p>Elevated α-syn is not limited to familial PD, but is also observed in sporadic PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Tan1">[40]</xref>. However, publications reporting the expression of α-syn in microglial cells and macrophages are conflicting. Increased α-syn expression with age has been reported in macrophages; however, others have reported no expression at all <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Austin1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Brighina1">[41]</xref>. In the current report, we used culture systems that had minimal numbers of contaminating cells coupled with flow cytometry to specifically quantitate α-syn expression in cells isolated from mice as well as human subjects. Microglia isolated from α-syn TG mice expressed 2–3 fold higher levels of α-syn than those isolated from non-transgenic controls, as assessed by FACS analysis, and this result was confirmed by rt-PCR and immunoblot assessment. In human cells, we found increased levels of α-syn in triplication patients, suggesting our method of measurement was accurately quantitating α-syn levels in cells by flow cytometry, even when the differences in levels were not extraordinary.</p>
<p>Microglia are found throughout the brain with the highest density in the basal ganglia including the substantia nigra, olfactory telencephalon, and hippocampus, and all are areas that are affected in PD. This concentrated distribution may reflect a more direct role for microglia and inflammation in the development of PD than has been previously appreciated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Tansey1">[42]</xref>, and will likely be a fruitful area for future research. Innate immune cells are known to express familial PD genes including LRRK2, Parkin, DJ1, and GBA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Solano1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Miklossy1">[45]</xref>, and changes in expression of these proteins have been shown to have functional consequences in microglia. Loss of Parkin, for example, was shown to change inflammatory responses of microglia, both under basal and stimulated conditions, and was associated with dopamine neuron loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Solano1">[43]</xref>. Additionally, inflammatory stimuli increase LRRK2 expression and induce LRRK2 phosphorylation in microglia. Interestingly, we have found that fibroblasts isolated from patients carrying mutations in proteins of familial PD genes other than α-syn also demonstrated altered phagocytosis (data not shown). It will be important to understand the functional consequence of familial PD-associated genes on microglia function and our data may offer an opportunity to identify common pathways for PD related to innate immune function, both in the CNS and the periphery.</p>
<p>Anomalies in phagocytosis and cytokine release have been documented with various autoimmune-related diseases (Crohn's Disease, COPD, Lupus, Sepsis), however the consequence of similar defects on neurodegenerative processes is yet not established. While inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be elevated in the brains of PD patients, cytokine levels are usually measured at the mRNA level or as total protein levels in brain extracts and therefore do not delineate between secreted and intracellular cytokines. Additionally, reports assessing peripheral inflammatory responses in PD patients have been varied, with reports showing increased cytokines in PD serum, but decreased release of cytokines from PBMCs isolated from PD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Hasegawa1">[46]</xref>. In our <italic>in vitro</italic> system we demonstrate that elevated α-syn impairs the secretion of cytokines without altering inflammatory responses at the mRNA or total protein level, a defect that cannot be observed using pure analytical methodology since it cannot differentiate between intracellular and released cytokines. Misregulated cytokine release may cause chronically stressed and activated microglia, and contribute to perpetuating the inflammation and neurodegeneration seen in PD. Microglia release of critical neurotropic factors, such as NGF and BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Scalzo1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Nagatsu1">[48]</xref> and the general impact on vesicle secretion machinery by elevated levels of α-syn may be as important a contributor to disease as the alterations in inflammation.</p>
<p>Previous studies have identified defective mobilization of dopamine from the reserve vesicle pool in neurons of α-syn TG mice, and the culmination of numerous literature reports implicate α-syn as a negative regulator of vesicle trafficking/and or vesicle fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Nemani1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Auluck1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Burr1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Lotharius1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Lotharius2">[50]</xref>. Although neuronal and inflammatory processes may appear distinct, the release of cytokine containing vesicles following an inflammatory insult is a process akin to the release of neurotransmitter containing synaptic vesicles following stimulation, utilizing similar SNARE machinery. Elevated α-syn levels have been shown to retard the release of neurotransmitters, an outcome that could lead to progressive neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Lotharius2">[50]</xref>, and our observations for immunologic functions provide another avenue by which a common mechanism for decreased vesicular function may lead to neurodegeneration. We demonstrated that increased α-syn disrupts the release of inflammatory mediators from microglia and macrophages, as well as the recruitment of vesicular components necessary to support a phagocytic response. Normal phagocytic function was restored after α-syn siRNA treatment, demonstrating a direct role for α-syn in these processes. Furthermore, using cell culture systems we were able to induce a similar phagocytic deficit by increased α-syn expression in H4 cells.</p>
<p>Evoked cytokine release and phagocytosis are excellent model systems to study membrane and vesicle dynamics, as well as biological readouts of normal SNARE function. The reported relationship between α-syn and SNARE function has been mixed. Chandra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Chandra1">[51]</xref> demonstrated that α-syn overexpression rescued the lethality and neurodegeneration observed in CSP-1 knockout animals. The authors hypothesized that α-syn was protective because it could act as a SNARE chaperone in the absence of the normal chaperone, CSP-1. This hypothesis has recently been confirmed, and it was demonstrated that α-syn binds to members of the SNARE complex to facilitate SNARE assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Burr1">[25]</xref>. Alternatively, others have recently demonstrated thatα-syn binds to and sequesters arachadonic acid, the basis for the lipid platform that promotes SNARE complex formation and normal SNARE activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Darios1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Rickman1">[52]</xref>. In a different model system, wild type and A53T mutated α-syn were shown to block Golgi-ER trafficking, and the data suggested this was due to the interaction of α-syn with members of the ER/Golgi SNARE complex preventing the ability to form stable quaternary SNARE complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Thayanidhi2">[53]</xref>. The data in the work described here contains various aspects of these seemingly disparate observations.</p>
<p>In our experimental systems, we find that α-syn binds to members of the SNARE complex and specific SNARE interactions are dependent on cellular activity and α-syn levels. Increased interactions of α-syn and SNARE component translated to PD striatum, in addition, α-syn was found to interact with a unique higher molecular form of VAMP2 in PD tissue. This higher molecular weight VAMP2 could represent a novel post-translational modification and follow up experiments are required to identify the nature of this apparently modified VAMP2. Additionally, we observed alterations in preformed SNARE complexes, and recycling of SNARE complexes, in all systems with increased α-syn levels. Disassembly of these complexes is critical for continuous cycles of vesicle docking and fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0071634-Burgalossi1">[54]</xref> and interference with proper disassembly may be a mechanism by which elevated levels of α-syn result in defective vesicle fusion. The SNARE interactions that we observed could be a means by which α-syn functions as a SNARE chaperone, alters SNARE complex formation, or sequesters SNARE complex components away from the site of activity. Importantly, our findings are consistent with those of others, indicating that α-syn expression is part of an intricate balance required for proper function of SNARE complexes and membrane vesicle activity. A key finding in our studies was the evoked recruitment of α-syn from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane during a phagocytic stimulus. Increased recruitment of α-syn to the plasma membrane was correlated with decreased recruitment of SNARE complex components.</p>
<p>We observed elevated α-syn levels and defective phagocytosis in fibroblasts and monocytes isolated from SNCA triplication or sporadic PD patients, consistent with our cellular and <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse studies. Using intracellular flow cytometry to monitor α-syn levels, we determined that monocytes from PD patients have increased α-syn levels, which correlated with defective phagocytosis. Changes in phagocytosis did not correlate with patient age or duration of disease indicating that it is truly representative of intracellular α-syn levels. While the range in α-syn expression was broad, with overlap between PD patients and age-matched controls, these data indicate that a subpopulation of patients on the non-overlapping ends of the range can be identified for further study. Our observations were with a relatively small patient subset and will need to be extended and validated in a larger cohort as well as assessed in other synucleinopathies such as MSA and DLB. Such studies are important because CNS diseases are difficult to diagnose and usually neurodegeneration precedes observable symptomatic changes. Therefore, it is critical to identify peripheral markers that can be used as predictive biomarkers of CNS disease long before symptoms of degeneration arise. Overexpression of α-syn is a known risk factor for PD and understanding the development and timing of overexpression compared to onset of disease may provide insight into the disease process and provide ways to stratify patients for study of therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>In summary, this paper provides 1) a new animal model to measure α-syn dysfunction both in the CNS and the PNS; 2) a cellular system to measure synchronized mobilization of α-syn and its functional interactions; 3) data regarding a potential role for innate immune cell function in the development and progression of PD; 4) an accessible peripheral biomarker to study and track these processes in human subjects.</p>

<title>Intracranial injections of CD47 KO RBCs labeled with PKH26</title>
<p>Experimental mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (IP) injection (SOP InVivo-012) of a Ketamine/Medotomidine cocktail (75 mg/kg +1 mg/kg respectively). During anesthesia, mice were placed within a Kopf stereotaxic frame equipped with a heating pad to avoid anesthesia-induced hypothermia. A 1-cm long mid-line scalp incision was made and 1 mm holes were drilled unilateral or bilateral into the skull using stereotaxic coordinates for the CA1 field of the hippocampus according to the Mouse Brain Atlas of Franklin and Paxinos, 1997. The animals in this study underwent one survival surgery comprising of a unilateral stereotaxic injection of 2 µl (∼5000 cells) of PKH labeled CD47-deficient RBC cells, diluted 1∶1000 in 1xPBS. Coordinates (x, y, z)  =  (−1.8, −2.3, −1.75) were relative to bregma. A depth of −1.85 was initially achieved to form a pocket for the injected red blood cells. Material was injected via a Hamilton syringe at a rate of 0.4 µl per min (2 µl total per site), with the needle untouched for 12 min prior to removal. Once the surgery was completed, the anesthetic effect of medetomidine was reversed by IP injection of atipamezole hydrochloride (1.0 mg/kg). Following surgery, the animals were returned to their home cage and observed until they recover from the anesthesia. The mice were checked at least once per day for local infection, bleeding, or open wounds, and for signs of distress or pain until euthanasia to perform tissue analysis. For tissue collection, mice were euthanized by C0<sub>2</sub> narcosis, perfused intracardially with phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4.
