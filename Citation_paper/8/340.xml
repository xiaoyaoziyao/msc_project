<abstract>
<p>Asymptotic and exact conditional approaches have often been used for testing agreement between two raters with binary outcomes. The exact conditional approach is guaranteed to respect the test size as compared to the traditionally used asymptotic approach based on the standardized Cohen's kappa coefficient. An alternative to the conditional approach is an unconditional strategy which relaxes the restriction of fixed marginal totals as in the conditional approach. Three exact unconditional hypothesis testing procedures are considered in this article: an approach based on maximization, an approach based on the conditional p-value and maximization, and an approach based on estimation and maximization. We compared these testing procedures based on the commonly used Cohen's kappa with regards to test size and power. We recommend the following two exact approaches for use in practice due to power advantages: the approach based on conditional p-value and maximization and the approach based on estimation and maximization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Assignment of a binary rating for a fixed number of subjects from two independent raters is often seen in scientific studies. The data from such studies can be organized in a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> table, and it is often of interest in performing inferences regarding the agreement between raters. For example, Smedmark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Smedmark1">[1]</xref> considered a study of assessment of passive inter-vertebral motion of the cervical spine. Patients from a private clinic in Stockholm were examined by two physical therapists (referred to as clinicians A and B) with similar clinical experience. Each patient was determined to have spinal stiffness or not by each rater through use of a medical testing procedure. The exam result for rotation to the right of C1–2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Smedmark1">[1]</xref> was recorded for each patient by the raters, and the associated data is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097386-t001">Table 1</xref>. As seen in the table, both clinicians agreed that there was no stiffness for 50 patients, and spinal stiffness was present in 2 patients. There was one patient that clinician A diagnosed as having stiffness while the clinician B did not. Conversely, for the remaining 7 patients, clinician B concluded spinal stiffness was present where clinician A did not. To quantify agreement, an obvious and straightforward measurement is the probability of agreement, defined by the total number of ratings for which both raters agree, divided by the total number of patients in the study. In this example, the probability of agreement would be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<p>Cohen's kappa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Cohen1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Fleiss1">[3]</xref> is a measure of agreement adjusted for chance. It has been reported that the lower bound of the Cohen's kappa depends on the marginal totals. When the the marginal totals are very unbalanced, the delta model developed by Martin Andres and Femia Marzo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-MartnAndrs1">[4]</xref> may be used as an alternative to the kappa. The Cohen's kappa has some desirable properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Fleiss2">[5]</xref>. A kappa of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> implies perfect agreement, while a kappa of less than 0 means that less agreement was observed than would be expected by chance. In the case of kappa equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the level of agreement is seen by chance. The kappa for the previous example is 0.2793, which is considered to signify fair strength of agreement according the definition by Landis and Koch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Landis1">[6]</xref>. The asymptotic one-sided or two-sided p-values can be computed from the limiting distribution of the standardized kappa test statistic, a standard normal distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Fleiss1">[3]</xref>. In addition to the asymptotic p-value, many software programs, such as SAS PROC FREQ, also provide an exact conditional p-value due to the conditional approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Fisher1">[7]</xref> for testing kappa = 0. Nuisance parameters (two marginal probabilities) are accommodated in the exact conditional approach due to Fisher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Fisher1">[7]</xref> by conditioning on marginal totals (referred to as the C approach). Given both marginal totals, the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097386-t001">Table 1</xref> determines the other three counts <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus, the null reference distribution is constructed by enumerating all possible <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Although the type I error rate of the study is well controlled by the C approach, it may be conservative due to the small size of the sample space, especially in the small to medium sample size settings.</p>
<p>A number of exact unconditional procedures have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Barnard1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Basu1">[9]</xref> to reduce the conservativeness of the C approach. One of them as described by Basu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Basu1">[9]</xref> who considers the exact unconditional approach by maximizing the tail probability over the nuisance parameter space (referred to as the M approach). This is a general approach which has been utilized for testing the equality of two independent proportions. With only the total sample size fixed, the null reference distribution for unconditional approaches produces a much larger sample space than that of the C approach. Boschloo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Boschloo1">[10]</xref> proposed another unconditional approach by combining the C approach and the M approach (referred to as the C+M approach), where the p-value from the C approach is used as a test statistic when maximizing across the nuisance parameter space. Due to the nature of the C+M approach, it is at least as powerful as the C approach. Another recently introduced unconditional strategy by Lloyd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Lloyd1">[11]</xref> is that based on estimation and maximization (referred to as the E+M approach). The estimated p-value is first obtained by replacing unknown nuisance parameters in the null distribution with their maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) using the data; the E+M p-value is then obtained by maximizing the tail probability using the estimated p-value as a test statistic. The E+M approach has been successfully applied to many important statistical and medical problems, such as testing about the difference between two independent proportions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Lloyd2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Lloyd3">[13]</xref>, the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Shan1">[14]</xref>, the difference between two incidence rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Shan2">[15]</xref> and trend tests for binary endpoints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Shan3">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Shan4">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review the existing conditional approach and consider three exact unconditional approaches. In Section 3, we compare the performance of the competing tests, studying the actual type I error rate and power of the procedures under a wide range of conditions. A real example from physical therapy is illustrated for the various testing procedures at the end of this section. Section 4 is given to discussion.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out by Sim and Wright <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Sim1">[20]</xref> that a one-sided hypothesis testing problem is often considered to be appropriate when the observed agreement is equal to the agreement by chance under the null hypothesis, because a negative <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value generally does not have a meaningful practical interpretation.

Among them, a commonly implemented approach utilized in current commercial software for a number of problems is based on the C approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Fisher1">[7]</xref>. The marginal totals in the contingency table are considered to be fixed in finding the null reference distribution. This approach has been extensively investigated by Mehta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Mehta1">[22]</xref> for various classical categorical data analysis, and has been shown to be preferable to asymptotic approaches due to the guarantee of the type I error rate.</p>

<p>An alternative to eliminate nuisance parameters was described by Basu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Basu1">[9]</xref>, where the p-value is maximized over the nuisance parameter space. The associated M p-value is defined as <disp-formula id="pone.0097386.e066"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e066" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the tail area. Traditional grid searches may be used to find the maximum of the tail probability over the region <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It should be noted that the choice of nuisance parameters would not affects the p-value calculation. The computational time increases exponentially with an increase in sample size. Since the ranges of parameters are limited, the function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the software R is chosen to search for the maximum with multiple initial points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Fang1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>The Cohen's kappa <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a commonly used measure of agreement between two raters, and provides a way for the data ordering in the M approach. Boschloo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Boschloo1">[10]</xref> considered the C p-value as the ordering method in the C+M approach. Here, the C p-value is used as a test statistic, not the p value. The enumerated data is sorted by the C p-value, and the C+M p-value is then obtained by treating the C p-value as a test statistic. The corresponding tail area for the C+M p-value of the proposed test is <disp-formula id="pone.0097386.e071"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>and the corresponding p-value is <disp-formula id="pone.0097386.e072"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e072" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>It is easy to show that the C+M approach would be at least as powerful as the C approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Boschloo1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>A simple and naive way to accommodate nuisance parameters is the plugging in method. Nuisance parameters are eliminated by replacing them with their estimated MLEs under the null. For given data, the rejection area of this estimated approach is the same as that of the M approach. The estimated p-value is given as <disp-formula id="pone.0097386.e073"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the MLEs of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively.</p>
<p>While use of the estimated p-value does not result in an exact procedure, an exact method may be obtained by combining the estimated p-value and a maximization step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Lloyd1">[11]</xref>.

<title>Numerical Study</title>
<p>The evaluation of the competing procedures in this note is based on enumerating all possible tables for given <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, that is, there is no simulation involved. There are two nuisance parameters in the null likelihood, therefore the type I error may be expressed in a three-dimension plot. We use this plot to illustrate the unsatisfactory type I error rate for the asymptotic approach based on the standardized kappa, and the guarantee of the type I error rate for exact approaches. The type I error rate surface plots, for the five approaches with sample size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at the nominal level 0.05 are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097386-g001">Figure 1</xref>. As seen in the figure, the majority of the points for the asymptotic approach are over 0.05. As expected, all four exact approaches respect the type I error, having the maximum of the surface less than the nominal level. It can be seen from the figure that the C approach is conservative when compared to the C+M approach and the E+M approach. The M approach is not as good as the C+M approach and the E+M approach as the surface is not as close as to the nominal level for the M approach. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097386-t003">Table 3</xref> shows the actual type I error rates for the asymptotic approach, the C approach, the M approach, the C+M approach, and the E+M approach at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and 100.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article we consider four exact testing procedures for testing agreement between two raters with binary outcomes. The efficient unconditional C+M and E+M approaches not only preserve the test size, but gain higher power when compared to other exact conditional or unconditional approaches. The C+M approach and the E+M approach are recommended for use in practice for small to medium sample sizes. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097386-g002">Figure 2</xref> for the power comparison, we still observe power gain for the C+M approach and E+M approach for sample sizes up to 100 as compared to other two exact approaches. The software program written in R is available from the author's website at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://faculty.unlv.edu/gshan/Agreement.r" xlink:type="simple">https://faculty.unlv.edu/gshan/Agreement.r</ext-link>.</p>
<p>In this note we focused our attention on the one-sided problem, since scientific interest is often in terms of establishing agreement beyond chance, rather than establishing agreement is more or less than that expected by coincidence. If the two-side alternative is of interest, a similar exact testing approach may be taken based on statistics such as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where large values would denote evidence that the true agreement is different than that of chance. In addition, procedures based on non-zero null values of the kappa coefficient may be pursued via the unconditional approach where the null value is set at constant representing a minimally acceptable threshold for agreement, ex. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Such test statistics for use in this problem may have simple forms such as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0097386.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Furthermore, through inversion of such test, an exact confidence interval may be obtained which is a subject of future research.</p>
<p>There are many discussions about the Cohen's kappa test statistic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Feinstein1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Cicchetti1">[25]</xref>, and some test statistics have been proposed to deal with the imbalance in the tables' marginal totals, such as the kappa max <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-Umesh1">[26]</xref>, the delta model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097386-MartnAndrs1">[4]</xref>.
