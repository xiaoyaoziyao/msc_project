          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p>To assess whether grating-based X-ray dark-field imaging can increase the sensitivity of X-ray projection images in the diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema and allow for a more accurate assessment of emphysema distribution.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Materials and Methods</title>
          <p>Lungs from three mice with pulmonary emphysema and three healthy mice were imaged ex vivo using a laser-driven compact synchrotron X-ray source. Median signal intensities of transmission (T), dark-field (V) and a combined parameter (normalized scatter) were compared between emphysema and control group. To determine the diagnostic value of each parameter in differentiating between healthy and emphysematous lung tissue, a receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed both on a per-pixel and a per-individual basis. Parametric maps of emphysema distribution were generated using transmission, dark-field and normalized scatter signal and correlated with histopathology.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Transmission values relative to water were higher for emphysematous lungs than for control lungs (1.11 vs. 1.06, p&lt;0.001). There was no difference in median dark-field signal intensities between both groups (0.66 vs. 0.66). Median normalized scatter was significantly lower in the emphysematous lungs compared to controls (4.9 vs. 10.8, p&lt;0.001), and was the best parameter for differentiation of healthy vs. emphysematous lung tissue. In a per-pixel analysis, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the normalized scatter value was significantly higher than for transmission (0.86 vs. 0.78, p&lt;0.001) and dark-field value (0.86 vs. 0.52, p&lt;0.001) alone. Normalized scatter showed very high sensitivity for a wide range of specificity values (94% sensitivity at 75% specificity). Using the normalized scatter signal to display the regional distribution of emphysema provides color-coded parametric maps, which show the best correlation with histopathology.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>In a murine model, the complementary information provided by X-ray transmission and dark-field images adds incremental diagnostic value in detecting pulmonary emphysema and visualizing its regional distribution as compared to conventional X-ray projections.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) involves progressive airflow obstruction and airway inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Decramer1">[1]</xref> and represents one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Mathers1">[2]</xref> Emphysema is a common component of COPD and is characterized by irreversible destruction of alveolar architecture with enlargement of distal airspaces. The diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema as well as its severity assessment largely relies on pulmonary function tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Soriano1">[3]</xref>. Spirometry, however, strongly depends on patients’ cooperation and cannot assess the regional distribution of emphysematous changes within the lung. Conventional chest radiography is commonly used to diagnose the presence of emphysema in patients with suspected COPD.

Animal experiments were performed with permission of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the district government of Upper Bavaria. Experiments were performed according to national (GV-SOLAS) and international (FELASA) animal welfare guidelines. Mice were kept in fully air-conditioned and pathogen free conditions and had free access to water and rodent laboratory chow at all times. To allow for adaptation, mice were kept in the animal facilities at least 7 days prior to starting the experiments. Mice were visited daily and euthanized if any signs of suffering (such as weight loss &gt;10%, food denial, aggressive or apathetic behavior, heavy breathing, bleeding from mouth or nose) were observed. To ameliorate suffering, mice were anesthetized using intraperitoneal injection of Medetomidine, Midazolam and Fentanyl for both the endotracheal application of elastase and for pulmonary function tests. Following pulmonary function tests, painless euthanasia was performed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia.</p>

          <p>The Compact Light Source (CLS) is a laboratory-scale synchrotron X-ray source, commercially developed and manufactured by Lyncean Technologies, Inc (Palo Alto, CA, USA). A radio-frequency electron gun and a laser-driven photocathode produce single electron bunches, which are accelerated to an energy level in the range of 20 to 45 MeV in a linear electron accelerator section. The bunch is stored at this energy in a miniature storage ring with a circumference of a few meters. A high-finesse bow-tie enhancement cavity is located at one of the straight sections of the storage ring and is resonantly driven by an infrared laser. At the interaction point the laser and the electron bunch are tightly focused and pass through each other on each revolution of the electron bunch and each cycle of the laser pulse. Through the process of inverse Compton scattering, pulses of X-rays are produced on each revolution. A grating interferometer was placed 16 m from the source. A π/2 phase shift grating with 5.28 µm pitch (design energy 33 keV) and an absorption grating with 5.4 µm pitch were used at the first fractional Talbot distance. The Compact Light Source (CLS) was operated at an X-ray energy of E<sub>peak</sub> = 36 keV.</p>

          <p>Data processing and statistical analysis were performed using Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011 (version 14.1.3) and IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac (version 20.0.0.1). Transmission and dark-field signal values normalized against water were recorded for individual pixels as well as median values per individual. From the transmission (T) and dark-field signal (V), we calculated the combined parameter “normalized scatter” defined as S = − (ln V)/(ln T − c). The correction factor c was necessary, since the transmission values were normalized against the water bath outside the specimen container, which does not represent the background of the specimen. The background of the specimen is formed by the formalin within the specimen containers. The transmission signal of the formalin background is slightly higher than the transmission signal of the surrounding water bath, since the x-ray beam passes the plastic container. To correct for this, for each specimen, ROIs were placed in the formalin background inside the containers and in the water bath surrounding the containers. Their values were averaged and the correction factor c was calculated as ln (T<sub>Formalin</sub>/T<sub>Water</sub>). The numerical value of c was 0.02. The resulting parameter S = − (ln V)/(ln T − c) can be regarded as the “normalized scatter” of tissue, i. e. the tissue’s scatter normalized against its transmission. Since both transmission and dark-field signal are logarithmically related to sample thickness, the combined parameter normalized scatter is independent of sample thickness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Schleede1">[23]</xref>.</p>

The resulting values were color-coded on a scale ranging from 0–1 interquartile ranges. Only deviations towards the “emphysematous” signal characteristic were color-coded such as to identify diseased tissue. The resulting color-coded parametric maps were superimposed onto the transmission images depicted in gray scale and compared to histopathology.</p>

        <p>In order to evaluate if transmission, dark-field and normalized scatter can identify emphysematous lung tissue, we compared their median signal values between projections from healthy and diseased samples. Normalized scatter was defined as the scatter signal in a given pixel normalized against its transmission signal as described in the Methods section. In a per-pixel analysis, median transmission values relative to water were higher for emphysematous lungs than for control lungs (1.11 vs. 1.06, interquartile range 1.07–1.17 vs. 1.04–1.10, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059526-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). There was no difference in median dark-field signal intensities relative to water between both groups (0.66 vs. 0.66, interquartile range 0.52–0.81 vs. 0.48–0.85, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059526-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

        <title>Diagnostic Value of Transmission, Dark-field and Normalized Scatter Values for Assessing the Regional Distribution of Pulmonary Emphysema in Correlation to Histopathology</title>
        <p>Histopathology showed marked emphysema distributed homogeneously throughout all three lungs in the emphysema group and preserved healthy lung architecture in all lungs in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059526-g004">Figure 4</xref>). To determine if this disease distribution can be accurately predicted based on our imaging data, we generated parametric maps of emphysema distribution based on the deviation of each pixel values from their respective “optimal” cutoff value (determined in the ROC analysis to maximize AUC). When using transmission values to depict the regional distribution of emphysema, there are obvious differences between healthy and emphysematous lung tissue. However, since the thicker central portions of the lung will inevitably result in higher transmission than thinner peripheral portions, central regions of control lungs C1 and C3 were erroneously displayed as diseased while large peripheral portions of all emphysematous lungs are erroneously displayed as healthy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059526-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Using the dark-field signal alone was clearly inappropriate to depict the regional distribution of emphysema. Instead, the peripheral portions of all lungs are identified as diseased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059526-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Using the normalized scatter signal to display the regional distribution of emphysema yields color-coded parametric maps, which clearly show the best correlation with histopathology. All three emphysematous lungs can be recognized as being homogeneously diseased. In the control lungs, only the large airways and a minimal rim of peripheral lung tissue are falsely displayed as emphysematous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059526-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

            <p>To generate parametric maps of emphysema distribution, the difference between pixel values of transmission (left column), dark-field (second column from left) and normalized scatter (third column from left) from the respective “optimal” cutoff value (determined in the ROC analysis to maximize AUC) was calculated for each pixel and normalized against the interquartile range of this parameter in the control lungs. The resulting values were color-coded on a scale ranging from 0–1 interquartile ranges. Only deviations towards the “emphysematous” signal characteristic were color-coded such as to identify diseased tissue. The resulting color-coded parametric maps were superimposed onto the transmission images depicted in gray scale. Histopathologic images obtained by Mayer’s hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of the corresponding specimen are shown (right column).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>A recent proof-of-concept study has demonstrated that it is feasible to differentiate emphysematous from healthy lung tissue by combining transmission and dark-field signals from grating-based X-ray projection images. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Schleede1">[23]</xref> Based on this data, we show in this manuscript that this approach is superior to X-ray transmission images alone in the diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema and in assessing its regional distribution. Specifically, we demonstrate in the ROC analysis for detecting emphysema that the AUC of normalized scatter (which we defined as local scatter normalized against transmission relative to water) is significantly higher than the AUC of transmission or dark-field signal alone. We further showed that the normalized scatter can be used to generate color-coded parametric maps of emphysema distribution that show a better correlation with histopathology than can be achieved using transmission or dark-field signal alone. We found that the ROC curves of normalized scatter and transmission show a distinct pattern in the per-pixel analysis. Normalized scatter shows an extremely high sensitivity for pulmonary emphysema at intermediate specificity.</p>
      <p>On cross-sectional CT images, the quantitative assessment of transmission values for each voxel known as densitometry allows valid assessment of emphysema distribution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Washko2">[10]</xref> Densitometric mapping of pulmonary emphysema is not feasible on radiographic projection images, since the transmission value of each pixel will not only reflect parenchymal density but largely depend on the local thickness of lung parenchyma. This is reflected in the partly inadequate maps of emphysema distribution that our data generates based on transmission values alone. Defining normalized scatter as the projected small angle scattering normalized against transmission renders this parameter largely independent of sample thickness thus allowing valid mapping of emphysema on projection images.</p>
      <p>The results of this study have to be seen in the context of the study design. The X-ray source used in this study was a laser-driven compact X-ray source also referred to as a laboratory-scale synchrotron. This X-ray source produces a beam with many of the characteristics of synchrotron radiation, such as near-monochromaticity. In contrast to synchrotron facilities which can be up to several 100 m in diameter, the Compact Light Source used in this study measures about 5×2 m. Current routine medical imaging, in contrast, uses conventional X-ray sources with polychromatic spectra. Unlike analyzer-based and standard interferometric methods, grating-based X-ray imaging has relatively low requirements on spatial or temporal coherence and can therefore be readily performed with conventional X-ray sources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Pfeiffer2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Diemoz1">[27]</xref> This has been demonstrated in phantom models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Herzen1">[21]</xref>, animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Bech3">[28]</xref> and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Donath1">[29]</xref> tissue samples. Nevertheless, future studies are needed to confirm our data regarding the diagnostic value of grating based X-ray imaging for pulmonary emphysema using a conventional X-ray source.</p>
      <p>Our study was performed using <italic>ex vivo</italic> mouse lungs. For future applications of grating-based X-ray lung imaging, overlying structures of the thorax, particularly ribs and fur, as well as breathing artifacts may confound both transmission and dark-field signals. These challenges have to be addressed in subsequent studies. In order to avoid breathing artifacts, the exposure time of 5 s used in this study appears short enough to stop ventilation in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated rodents.</p>
      <p>The median radiation dose of our setup was 34 mGy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Schleede2">[25]</xref> This is considerably higher than the radiation dose associated with a standard clinical chest x-ray. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Gray1">[30]</xref> However, as demonstrated previously, reducing the number of phase steps and the spatial resolution can reduce this dose to approximately 2 mGy without significant information loss. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Schleede2">[25]</xref> Also, the setup used in this study is not designed for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments and has therefore not been optimized for dose efficiency. Technical optimization of the setup is likely to result in further decreases in radiation dose approaching that of a conventional radiograph.</p>
      <p>CT and CT densitometry are the current clinical standard for diagnosing and assessing the regional distribution of pulmonary emphysema. The novel aspect of our study is the incremental value for combined transmission and dark-field imaging for plain radiographs. Our study did not compare this approach to CT or CT densitometry. Grating-based imaging allows to acquire not only plain radiographs but also tomographies which can again be reconstructed as transmission and dark-field images. Future studies are needed to assess whether there is also an incremental value for combined transmission and dark-field CT over conventional transmission CT alone.</p>
      <p>It is known that the results of CT lung densitometry are influenced by lung volume, which is why densitometric results should be corrected for lung volume. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059526-Stoel2">[31]</xref> Since we did not perform measurements at different lung volumes, we cannot assess whether the normalized scatter (dark-field signal normalized over transmission signal) is also influenced by lung volume. This issue needs to be addressed in subsequent studies.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Grating-based X-ray imaging allows the acquisition of projection images from which both transmission and dark-field signals can be extracted. The complementary information provided by X-ray transmission and dark-field images adds incremental diagnostic value in detecting pulmonary emphysema and visualizing its regional distribution as compared to conventional X-ray projections. In the future, this may allow to detect human pulmonary emphysema more accurately on chest X-rays and assess its regional distribution without the use of CT.</p>
