<abstract>
<p>Histone proteins are key elements in the packing of eukaryotic DNA into chromosomes. A little understood control system ensures that histone gene expression is balanced with DNA replication so that histone proteins are produced in appropriate amounts. Disturbing or disrupting this system affects genome stability and gene expression, and has detrimental consequences for human development and health. It has been proposed that feedback control involving histone proteins contributes to this regulation and there is evidence implicating cell cycle checkpoint molecules activated when DNA synthesis is impaired in this control. We have developed mathematical models that incorporate these control modes in the form of inhibitory feedback of histone gene expression from free histone proteins, and alternatively a direct link that couples histone RNA synthesis to DNA synthesis. Using our experimental evidence and related published data we provide a simplified description of histone protein synthesis during S phase. Both models reproduce the coordination of histone gene expression with DNA replication during S phase and the down-regulation of histone RNA when DNA synthesis is interrupted, but only the model incorporating histone protein feedback control was able to effectively simulate the coordinate expression of a simplified histone gene family. Our combined theoretical and experimental approach supports the hypothesis that the regulation of histone gene expression involves feedback control.</p>

<title>Histone proteins associate with DNA to form chromatin</title>
<p>Packaging of the genetic material DNA with histone proteins into chromatin is a key feature of eukaryotic cells. Two of the core histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 associate with DNA to form the so-called nucleosome core particle, around which 146 base pairs of DNA are wrapped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref001">1</xref>]. Such particles are formed at regular intervals and connected by between 10 and 70 base pairs of linker DNA. This packaging is required for higher order chromatin structure formation involving the linker histone H1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Histone gene structure and control of expression by modulation of histone RNA levels</title>
<p>In animals, core and linker histone proteins are products of the expression of multi-copy replication-dependent histone genes (referred to as histone genes). DNA replication and histone protein synthesis are synchronised during the cell cycle and are tightly linked during S phase by multiple modes of regulation affecting primarily histone RNA levels (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref004">4</xref>]). Modulation of transcription rates, histone RNA 3’ end formation and stability contribute to the cell cycle control of histone gene expression. Histone RNA levels are between 15- to 50-fold higher during S phase than in G1 or G2 phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref007">7</xref>]. This is achieved by a three to five-fold up-regulation of transcription and a six- to eight fold up-regulation of histone RNA 3’ end formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref007">7</xref>]. Inhibition of DNA replication leads to a rapid switch-off of histone gene expression by downregulation of transcription and a selective destabilisation of histone mRNA, presumably to avoid detrimental accumulation of excess histone proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Mechanisms and factors controlling histone RNA levels</title>
<p>Upregulation of histone gene transcription at G1/S phase transition depends on the transcriptional co-activator NPAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref016">16</xref>]. NPAT is a major component of nuclear structures that assemble at histone gene clusters called histone locus bodies.</p>
<p>Histone RNA 3’ end formation is low in G1 phase and controlled by a checkpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref018">18</xref>]. Histone RNA 3’ ends are produced by RNA cleavage between two conserved elements in the histone RNA 3’ UTR (untranslated region): an RNA hairpin element and the histone downstream element (HDE). This cleavage produces mRNA that ends a few nucleotides after the hairpin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref020">20</xref>]. It depends on the U7snRNP, which binds to the HDE, and the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), also known as hairpin binding protein HBP, that binds to the histone RNA hairpin element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref023">23</xref>]. (For simplicity’s sake we refer to this protein here as SLBP). The histone RNA is cleaved by the nuclease CPSF-73, and several other RNA cleavage-polyadenylation factors are also involved in histone RNA 3’ end formation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref004">4</xref>]).</p>
<p>Previous studies have identified two cell cycle regulated components of the histone RNA cleavage reaction: SLBP and the heat-labile factor (HLF), a complex that contains symplekin as heat-labile component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref025">25</xref>]. SLBP is a key factor in the coordination of histone gene expression with DNA replication. RNAi-mediated depletion of SLBP causes inhibition of histone gene expression and cell cycle arrest in S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref027">27</xref>]. SLBP is further also involved in export and translation of histone mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref030">30</xref>] and the degradation of histone mRNA upon inhibition of DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref032">32</xref>]. SLBP levels are cell cycle regulated and increase 10- to 20-fold in late G1 phase, and decrease again upon exit from S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref024">24</xref>]. The increase is achieved by upregulation of translation while cyclin A/Cdk1-mediated protein phosphorylation at the end of S phase triggers proteasome-mediated degradation of SLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref036">36</xref>]. Degradation of SLBP has been linked to protein isomerisation and dissociation of SLBP-RNA complexes by the prolyl isomerase Pin1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref038">38</xref>]. The cell cycle control of HLF, which contains CPSF-73, is poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Checkpoint control of histone gene expression</title>
<p>During S phase, histone protein synthesis and DNA replication are coupled by checkpoints in an SLBP-dependent manner. Inhibition of DNA replication causes the activation of checkpoint kinases ATR and DNA-PK and the phosphorylation of UPF1, which increases the affinity for SLBP and promotes mRNA degradation by the recruitment of RNA decay factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Degradation of histone proteins</title>
<p>The mechanisms controlling histone protein levels are poorly understood. In yeast, excess histone proteins are rapidly degraded by ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref041">41</xref>]. In mammals, histone proteins are degraded by a lysosome-mediated process during senescence and by acetylation-mediated proteasomal degradation during spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Histone RNA levels are maintained by autoregulatory mechanisms that compensate for gene loss or gene gain</title>
<p>In animals, the expression of the multicopy histone genes is orchestrated to ensure appropriate overall synthesis of histone proteins. Depletion of 21 out of 44 histone genes in chicken cells was compensated for by the up-regulation of the remaining histone genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref044">44</xref>], and, depletion of highly expressed H3 genes led to compensatory upregulation of the remaining H3 genes, without affecting the expression of other histone gene types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref045">45</xref>]. Conversely, inclusion of additional histone H4 gene copies in mouse cells caused a reduction of endogenous histone H4 gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref046">46</xref>]. These observations indicate the presence of mechanisms that coordinate the overall expression of histone genes with DNA replication and maintain the expression of histone gene families at appropriate levels.</p>

<p>Earlier work led to the proposal of a negative feedback mechanism for the control of histone gene expression, with excess histone proteins controlling histone RNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref048">48</xref>]. Histone H3 protein was found to bind to its own RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref049">49</xref>] and biochemical studies demonstrated that free histone proteins stimulate the decay of histone mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref051">51</xref>]. Significantly, inhibition of DNA replication causes an increase of free histone proteins unincorporated into chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref053">53</xref>]. However, whether the signal for the inhibitory feedback originates from an excess of free histone proteins or alternatively some mechanism senses an excess of newly synthesised, but unpackaged DNA, cannot be directly derived from the available data.</p>
<p>We therefore constructed two simplified mathematical models for the coordination of DNA replication with histone gene expression during the cell cycle, reflecting two possible origins of the feedback signal. In the first model (termed histone feedback loop model) free histone proteins inhibit the synthesis of histone RNA and stimulate histone RNA degradation. In the second model (termed DNA coupled model) unpackaged DNA stimulates histone RNA synthesis and inhibits its degradation.</p>
<p>We parameterised the models using published data and our own experimental work. Both models reflect the changes in histone gene expression during the cell cycle and are capable of simulating scenarios in which DNA replication is interrupted during S phase. The simplest model variants, which do not distinguish between different histone families, are unable to discriminate between the two regulatory mechanisms. We extended our basic models to include an additional histone family. These model variants can be generalised to include all five histone families. These expanded model variants show a clearly different behaviour for the two assumed regulatory mechanisms. Findings support the hypothesis of a regulatory negative feedback loop that originates from the histone proteins. To further challenge our models, we experimentally perturbed the system by introducing additional histone genes.</p>

<title>Mathematical modelling of the coordination of DNA replication with histone gene expression</title>
<p>Our mathematical models describe the basic regulation of histone gene expression during S phase. The models focus on the essential features during mid S phase and omit details during the early transition from G1 into S phase, and later during exit from S into G2 phase. We aimed to create models able to describe the regulation of histone gene expression, and the response to perturbations such as the interruption of S phase, in a time-dependent manner. The models use ordinary differential equations (ODEs) capturing rates changing over time for the four core variables histone RNA (<italic>R</italic>), free histone proteins (<italic>H</italic>), new DNA (<italic>D</italic>) representing new histone binding sites and total new nucleosome packed DNA (<italic>T</italic>). Both DNA related variables <italic>D</italic> and <italic>T</italic> are scaled in terms of DNA needed to accommodate histone proteins (98 bp/histone protein of each type). The other variables of the ODE models are scaled in molecules per cell.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g001">Fig 1</xref> describes two simplified mathematical models. While the components and fluxes are identical, the coordination between DNA replication and histone gene expression is implemented either by i) a negative feedback loop where accumulation of histone proteins inhibits histone gene expression by inhibiting histone RNA production and increasing histone RNA degradation (the histone feedback loop model), as proposed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref051">51</xref>]; or ii) a direct coupling of DNA replication (<italic>D</italic>) with histone RNA synthesis and degradation (the DNA coupled model), reflecting an S phase checkpoint linking DNA replication with histone gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref040">40</xref>].</p>

<p>The core structure of the two models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) consists of six fluxes (<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>- <italic>v</italic><sub>6</sub>) that control DNA (<italic>D</italic>) synthesis (<italic>v</italic><sub>5</sub>), histone RNA (<italic>R</italic>) synthesis and degradation (<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub>), new histone proteins (<italic>H</italic>) synthesis and degradation (<italic>v</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>v</italic><sub>4</sub>), and the capture of histones by the new DNA to form nucleosomes (<italic>T</italic>) (<italic>v</italic><sub>6</sub>). The stem loop binding protein, SLBP (<italic>S</italic>), is a master regulator of the system and as such is required for the synthesis of histone mRNA. We use the SLBP as an external control parameter defining S phase and disregard the particular regulation of SLBP during early and late S phase. Note the models do not distinguish between the activities of SLBP in histone RNA processing, translation and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref032">32</xref>]. This is justified because all these different activities are ultimately reflected by the dependence of histone RNA synthesis on SLBP, which was observed experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref027">27</xref>]. The models describe the control of expression of one histone gene family, reflecting the observations that the expression within a gene family is controlled independently of other histone gene types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref046">46</xref>]. For simplicity’s sake the models are independent of the histone gene numbers. The maximal transcription rate <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> for histone RNA synthesis specifies the overall contribution of all gene copies available. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165848.s002">S1 File</xref> lists all the parameters used and describes assumptions and necessary approximations.</p>
<p>The four dynamical variables <italic>R</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>T</italic> are determined by the six fluxes <italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub> –<italic>v</italic><sub>6</sub>. SLBP <italic>S(t)</italic> and newly synthesised DNA <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>5</italic></sub><italic>(t)</italic> are time dependent external controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The negative feedback loop was implemented by linking histone RNA synthesis (<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>) and degradation (<italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub>) to free histone protein levels (<italic>H</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Histone RNA synthesis is modulated by the levels of free histone proteins, and histone mRNA degradation is determined by the combination of both basal degradation and induced degradation due to negative feedback from the free histone protein pool. We assume cooperation effects for the RNA synthesis and replication-stress induced RNA degradation and apply Hill functions for these rates, and linear mass-action kinetics for the basal RNA degradation. The regulation of gene expression with feedback loops through Hill functions is a significant simplification but the most widely used approach to model cooperative effects.</p>
<p>In the alternative model, the links between DNA synthesis and histone RNA reflecting a checkpoint that ensures coupling of DNA synthesis with histone gene expression (dotted lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and fluxes <italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The other interactions are as in the histone feedback loop model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g001">Fig 1B</xref>. A key external quantity which determines the overall temporal behaviour is the time-dependent DNA synthesis rate <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>5</italic></sub><italic>(t)</italic>. As external influence on the regulatory mechanism, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>5</italic></sub><italic>(t)</italic> is only driven by time and not affected by the histone regulation. This rate was derived from an experimental analysis of DNA content and replication in human immortalised U2OS cells. U2OS cells were synchronised at G1/S phase transition by double thymidine block and then released into S phase. DNA synthesis was monitored by pulse-labelling with BrdU and detected by flow cytometry. <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>5</italic></sub><italic>(t)</italic> was fitted from the BrdU data using a plateau e-function as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165848.s003">S2 File</xref> and entered into the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <italic>V</italic><sub>5</sub>). The plateau e-function produced the best approximation to both data sets available. In parallel, the DNA content was measured in the same cells by staining with <italic>7</italic>-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) and analysed and fitted together with the BrdU measurement. This data showed the expected accumulation of DNA during the cell cycle (see Figures E (right) and F (left, red symbols) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165848.s003">S2 File</xref>) and matched well the model prediction for new nucleosome packed DNA accumulation (<italic>T</italic>) during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g002">Fig 2</xref>). A second external quantity is the time-dependent activity of the master regulator SLBP (<italic>S</italic>). This curve was fitted separately for the two models, because its role is different depending on the regulatory mechanism (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165848.s002">S1 File</xref>).</p>

<p>While both models resulted in similar levels of histone RNA (<italic>R</italic>), which strongly paralleled the experimentally derived <italic>V</italic><sub>5</sub>, they differed in the production of new histone binding sites (<italic>D</italic>), and the levels of free histone proteins (<italic>H</italic>). In the histone feedback loop model, histone proteins accumulated prior to and after the peak of DNA production at levels above those during peak DNA production, and contributed to the repression of histone synthesis at these stages. In the DNA coupled model, this accumulation was not observed and histone protein levels increased and decreased largely in parallel to DNA synthesis. The difference in timing of the onset and offset of SLBP (<italic>S</italic>) relative to DNA synthesis <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>5</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g002">Fig 2</xref>) reflects the different role of the master regulator in both models and was fitted to allow undisturbed S phase (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165848.s002">S1 File</xref>). In mid S phase the shape of the <italic>S</italic> curves coincide in both cases and can therefore not be the origin of any differences between the models at this stage of S phase.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g003">Fig 3A</xref> displays the results of model simulations, in which DNA was suddenly stopped after <italic>t = 15000s</italic>. It is well established that the inhibition of DNA replication leads to a rapid reduction of histone RNA by a combination of transcription inhibition and histone RNA destabilisation. Clearly, both model versions are able to reproduce this behaviour. Inhibition of DNA synthesis, modelled by reducing <italic>V</italic><sub>5</sub> to 0 during S phase, caused in both model variants the termination of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <italic>T</italic> and <italic>D</italic>) and a rapid reduction of histone RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <italic>R</italic>) and free histone proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <italic>H</italic>). The reduction of histone RNA results from inhibiting RNA synthesis (<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>) and stimulating RNA degradation (<italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub>), either by the direct link from new DNA or by the negative feedback from the accumulation of free histone proteins. The flux <italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub> is determined by a degradation rate <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>base</italic></sub> reflecting the normal histone RNA half-life during S phase, and an enhanced degradation rate <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>ind</italic></sub> observed when DNA replication is stopped for example by compounds inhibiting DNA synthesis. We measured both basal and enhanced degradation rates in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165848.s004">S3 File</xref>). We used the values <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>base</italic></sub> ≈ 0.00018s<sup>-1</sup> and <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>ind</italic></sub> ≈ 0.00067 s<sup>-1</sup>, which correspond to histone RNA half-lives of 64 min and 17.3 min, respectively. These values are in good agreement with previous measurements, reporting histone mRNA half-lives in normal S phase of 45 min in CHO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref007">7</xref>] and 110 min in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref047">47</xref>]. In mouse myeloma and HeLa cells, the histone RNA half-life was reduced to between 10 min and 15 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref054">54</xref>] upon interruption of DNA replication.</p>

<p>The model outputs differ however in the levels of histone RNA and proteins after the replication block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <italic>R</italic> and <italic>H</italic>). While these levels approach 0 in the DNA coupled model they remain clearly higher in the histone feedback loop model. This is necessary for the repression of histone RNA levels by the free-histone-mediated feedback on the RNA synthesis rate <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> and the degradation rate <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>. It reflects the standby mode of the histone feedback regulated model with a small pool of histone proteins ready to form chromatin and low level of histone RNA. In both models, the inhibition of DNA replication prevents completion of the duplication of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <italic>T</italic>), while SLBP levels are not affected by the inhibition of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <italic>S</italic>). This is compatible with the observation that the inhibition of DNA replication does not affect SLBP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>Inhibition of histone gene transcription leads to a different response of the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). While the free histone pool (<italic>H</italic>) drops down to 0 in both models, DNA replication is not affected and continues. RNA (<italic>R</italic>) decays with a much slower rate than when DNA replication is inhibited as induced RNA degradation is not activated either because of a lack of free histone proteins (histone feedback loop model) or because DNA synthesis continues (DNA coupled model). This means that while the model is able to reproduce the downregulation of histone gene expression when DNA replication is inhibited, it is unable to reproduce the inhibition of DNA synthesis observed when histone gene expression is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) by for example RNAi knock down of SLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref026">26</xref>], as the model does not contain a mechanism linking histone gene expression with DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We then compared histone RNA levels measured experimentally in parallel to DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) with calculated histone RNA levels based on our cell cycle analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165848.s003">S2 File</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g004">Fig 4B</xref> the prediction and experimental data correspond reasonably well in the middle of S phase (280 min– 480 min), but they differ significantly in early and late time points. This is also the case in a second experiment for which the prediction of histone RNA levels and measured histone RNA levels are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g004">Fig 4B</xref>.</p>

<title>Autoregulation of histone gene expression</title>
<p>Histone gene expression is responsive to the loss or gain of histone genes, and compensatory mechanisms ensure that expression is maintained at an appropriate level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref044">44</xref>]. Crucially, this occurs within histone gene families without affecting the expression of other histone types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref046">46</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g005">Fig 5A</xref> illustrates the schematic concept of our experiment and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g006">Fig 6A–6D</xref> shows experimental evidence for this compensatory mechanism. To introduce additional copies of the histone H2B gene we transfected U2OS cells with a pEGFP derivative plasmid expressing a H2B-GFP fusion protein (pEGFP-H2B) or, as control, with pEGFP only. It is known that GFP-tagged H2B proteins are integrated into nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref056">56</xref>]. As the H2B-GFP protein is under the control of a viral promoter and polyadenylation signal, it is not subject to histone-specific control. After enrichment of transformed cells by antibiotic selection we confirmed that the selection procedure did not affect cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165848.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The expression of histones H2B and H2B-GFP, and as comparison histone H3, was detected by Western blotting using anti-H2B antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g006">Fig 6A and 6C</xref>). H2B protein was detected in extracts from both cell populations while H2B-GFP was detected only in cells transfected with pEGFP-H2B. The quantitation of protein levels showed that histone H3 levels were similar between the two cell populations while the levels of genome-encoded histone H2B was significantly reduced in pEGFP-H2B transfected cells. These cells contained a significant amount of H2B-GFP, which together with the remaining endogenous H2B added up to a similar amount as in the control-transfected cells. This is indicative of an autoregulatory mechanism compensating for loss or gain of histone genes. We also analysed histone H2B RNA levels by Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g006">Fig 6B and 6D</xref>). Total H2B RNA levels were slightly higher in cells transfected with pEGFP-H2B, mostly due to extra H2B-GFP transcripts. Interestingly we detect some shorter than full-length H2B RNA fragments in cells expressing H2B-GFP, but not in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). This indicates that increased histone RNA degradation is taking place in these cells, which is compatible with histone mRNA being a target for control of histone gene expression.</p>

The model allows for alternative and competitive chromatin formation by endogenous or exogenous H2B (<italic>He2B</italic> and <italic>Hp2B</italic>, respectively). It is able to predict the effect of introducing extra histone H2B genes (<italic>Hp2B</italic>) which can associate with histone H3 (<italic>H3)</italic> to form separate nucleosomes (<italic>Tp</italic>).</p>
<p>We compared the ability of histone feedback loop model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) and DNA coupled model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) to meet the experimental results. In both models, H2B-GFP RNA (red curve, <italic>Rp2B</italic>) is constantly expressed and not affected by any feedback control, leading to a similarly constant H2B-GFP RNA level in both models. During S phase, H2B-GFP protein (red curve, <italic>Hp2B</italic>) is incorporated into chromatin (<italic>Tp</italic>) and the level of free H2B-GFP protein is low. Outside S phase, free H2B-GFP protein accumulates and levels are determined by synthesis and degradation. The response of the two models to extra H2B differs. In the histone feedback loop model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), endogenous H2B RNA and proteins are selectively down-regulated (black curves, <italic>Re2B</italic> and <italic>He2B</italic>, respectively) and significantly reduced compared to H3 RNA and protein levels. In contrast, in the DNA coupled model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), an excess of H2B proteins is produced during S phase.</p>
<p>The Northern and Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g006">Fig 6A and 6D</xref>) were done with material from non-synchronised cell populations, with cells at all possible stages of the cell cycle. In contrast the models simulate the behaviour of a single cell during S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). Integration of the model predictions over the time of a full cell cycle results in average quantities of a non-synchronised population comparable to the experiments. The strength of the viral H2B-GFP promoter is unknown and so we simulate a range of promoter strengths <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>mp2b</italic></sub>. The bar charts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g006">Fig 6E–6H</xref>) show the predicted levels of H2B-GFP and H2B RNA (F,H) and proteins (E,G) for different viral promoter strength <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>1</italic>,<italic>p2b</italic></sub> derived from the histone feedback (E,F) model and DNA coupled model (G,H). The same amounts of H2B proteins are integrated into chromatin and both models produce a similar outcome. The predictions of RNA levels differ between both control mechanisms. The lack of individual histone type specific regulation in the DNA feedback model results in constant endogenous H2B RNA (<italic>Re2B</italic>) for different plasmid promoter strength (<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>1</italic>,<italic>p2b</italic></sub>). The H2B-GFP RNA (<italic>Rp2B</italic>) adds to the endogenous H2B RNA. The histone feedback mechanism on the other hand leads to a down regulation of the endogenous H2B RNA (<italic>Re2B</italic>) during the S phase. The constant expression of H2B-GFP also beyond S phase leads to an overexpression of the total H2B RNA over the entire cell cycle.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We combined experimental approaches with mathematical modelling to examine and describe quantities which are not experimentally accessible and time evaluations of the regulation of animal histone gene expression. We compared two models where histone synthesis is either controlled by a histone feedback loop or directly coupled to DNA synthesis. We parameterised both models with experimental results and related these back to our experimental data and to reports by others.</p>
<p>Starting with a basic model with only one histone type, both models result in very similar predictions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g002">2</xref>). Both control mechanisms are able to simulate with reasonable accuracy the levels of histone RNA, the free histone protein pool and the capture of histones by the new DNA to form nucleosomes throughout S phase, and simultaneously avoid excessive accumulation of free histones or a lack of histones, which would slow down DNA replication and thus endanger this vital process. The models are adaptable to different experimental data and the robustness of the models and their parameterisation has been confirmed by parameter variation and sensitivity analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref057">57</xref>]. Both basic models are a suitable base for further investigations and modifications. The deviation of the model simulations of histone RNA in early S phase from the experimental analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g004">Fig 4</xref>) might be the result of an intended simplification of RNA synthesis in the mathematical model. We focused the modelling on events occurring in mid S phase rather than on the transition stages when cells enter or exit S phase, and DNA replication changes accordingly. The model assumes that the product of histone RNA synthesis is histone mRNA and does not consider the processing of histone RNA to form functional mRNA, and the export from the nucleus for translation in the cytoplasm. In contrast our analysis of histone RNA by Northern blotting captures precursor RNA, mRNA and RNA destined for degradation located in the cytosol or nucleus. Including these other stages of the histone RNA life cycle into the model may increase its accuracy in early S phase and allow addressing open questions about the role of histone RNA processing, localisation and degradation in the production of histone proteins. This is supported by a time delay in DNA synthesis compared to histone gene expression observed in an analysis of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of histone gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
<p>We tested both models also under extreme perturbed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We blocked in mid S phase either DNA replication or histone RNA synthesis completely, and compared the model results to findings from experiments where these processes were inhibited using either hydroxyurea and/or actinomycin D. Both regulatory mechanisms displayed a very similar behaviour for the inhibition of histone RNA synthesis with actinomycin D. The interruption of DNA replication with hydroxyurea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) led to a downregulation of histone RNA levels and an increased free histone protein pool for the histone feedback loop model whereas the direct DNA coupled model downregulated both histone RNA levels and the histone protein pool. Both regulatory mechanisms prevented the accumulation of superfluous histone proteins, but only in the histone feedback loop model a low amount of histone RNA was maintained. An increase in free histone proteins in cells treated with hydroxyurea has been observed experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref052">52</xref>], and hydroxyurea treatment has in many examples caused a severe reduction but not complete absence of histone mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref059">59</xref>]. The presence of low levels of histone RNA and of a pool of histone proteins would be advantageous for a quick resumption of chromatin formation upon release from any DNA replication block. We see this inherent standby feature of the histone feedback loop model as a biologically reasonable advantage over the alternative DNA coupled model.</p>
<p>Artificial overexpression of one histone gene is a strong perturbation of the histone regulatory system to test whether the models are able to simulate the expression coordination of histone gene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref045">45</xref>]. Experimentally we introduce additional copies of the histone H2B gene by transfecting U2OS cells with a plasmid expressing a H2B-GFP fusion protein (pEGFP-H2B) or, as control, with pEGFP only. We used the parameterised basic mathematical models as building block to simulate the endogenous histone types H2B and H3 and added a constantly expressed H2B gene to the model for the exogenous H2B gene on the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The histone feedback loop model predicted a selective downregulation of endogenous H2B RNA and prevented the system from accumulation of free H2B histones. The non-histone type specific regulation of the DNA coupled model was unable to down-regulate the H2B RNA in presence of the exogenous H2B-GFP. Both models differed most in their predictions of the free histone pool during S phase (histone proteins <italic>H</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). The expression of endogenous histone RNA is another indicator of the different regulatory mechanisms. Experimental time-resolved measurement of the free histone pools of the different types and RNAs during S phase would be a direct test to discriminate between the alternative regulatory mechanisms. However the analysis of the free histone pool is technically challenging.</p>
<p>We compared the different model results with an experimental analysis of histone protein and RNA levels in unsynchronised cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g006">Fig 6A–6D</xref>). Both models indicated similar effects on protein levels. The histone feedback model predicted for non-synchronised cells a partial down regulation of endogenous H2B RNA but not a full compensation of the additional exogenous H2B-GFP RNA because the histone specific regulation is active during S phase and the expression of exogenous H2B-GFP is cell cycle independent. In contrast the DNA coupled model predicted a constant amount of endogenous H2B, with exogenous H2B-GFP expressed in addition. We could clearly detect expression of endogenous H2B RNA and of exogenous H2B-GFP RNA in U2OS cells. As expected, no H2B-GFP RNA was expressed in the control cells. Unfortunately, we were not able to distinguish between these two models as we failed to observe a down regulation of endogenous H2B RNA in cells expressing also H2B-GFP. Interestingly, the Northern Blots reveal an enhanced H2B RNA degradation in the cells expressing H2B-GFP, but not in the control cells expressing GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165848.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), which is compatible with control of RNA by the histone feedback loop model.</p>
<p>Possibly histone precursor RNAs are targets for enhanced degradation controlled by histone proteins. This, possibly combined with inefficient degradation of these transcripts, perhaps linked to their cellular localisation or to the stage of cells in the cell cycle, may explain the detection of histone RNA degradation intermediate products. But our findings also suggest possible roles for translation control and histone protein turnover in the expression coordination of histone gene families.</p>
<p>The cell cycle and the circadian clock are linked in NIH-3T3 cells, and U2OS cells used in the work described here also have a circadian clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref061">61</xref>]. An analysis of RNA levels using CircaDB reveals that some histone RNA levels oscillate with an approximately 24 h periodicity in mouse tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref062">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref064">64</xref>]. The RNA levels of the histone gene expression regulators NPAT, SLBP and symplekin lack a clear circadian rhythm; only the RNAs of the U7snRNP components Lsm10 and Lsm 11 oscillate with a 24–28 h periodicity in mouse adipose and lung tissue. These limited observations indicate that histone gene expression may be subject to circadian control, by a mechanism possibly involving the U7 snRNP. Contributions of other factors such as SLBP, which is subject to control at the protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165848.ref024">24</xref>], would need to be investigated to firmly establish a connection between the cell cycle control of histone gene expression and the circadian clock.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have produced mathematical models for the coordination of histone gene expression with DNA replication during S phase. These models are able to reproduce the key feature of the control of histone gene expression: the link between DNA and histone RNA synthesis. The comparison of model predictions indicates that histone feedback control would be an effective mechanism to coordinate histone gene expression.</p>
