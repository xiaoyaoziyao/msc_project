        <p>Social aggregation is a common behavioral phenomenon thought to evolve through adaptive benefits to group living. Comparing fitness differences between aggregated and solitary individuals in nature – necessary to infer an evolutionary benefit to living in groups – has proven difficult because communally-living species tend to be obligately social and behaviorally complex. However, these differences and the mechanisms driving them are critical to understanding how solitary individuals transition to group living, as well as how and why nascent social systems change over time. Here we demonstrate that facultative aggregation in a reptile (the Desert Night Lizard, <italic>Xantusia vigilis</italic>) confers direct reproductive success and survival advantages and that thermal benefits of winter huddling disproportionately benefit small juveniles, which can favor delayed dispersal of offspring and the formation of kin groups. Using climate projection models, however, we estimate that future aggregation in night lizards could decline more than 50% due to warmer temperatures. Our results support the theory that transitions to group living arise from direct benefits to social individuals and offer a clear mechanism for the origin of kin groups through juvenile philopatry. The temperature dependence of aggregation in this and other taxa suggests that environmental variation may be a powerful but underappreciated force in the rapid transition between social and solitary behavior.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Few topics within evolutionary biology have inspired more excitement and controversy than the origin and evolution of social behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Hamilton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Wilson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Nowak1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Abbot1">[4]</xref>. The tendency for individuals to form conspicuous groups is surprisingly widespread and easy to observe across both vertebrates and invertebrates, with repeated independent origins throughout many taxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Agnarsson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-CluttonBrock1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Hatchwell1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Davis1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Chapple1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Hughes1">[10]</xref>. Sociality can take many forms, from the simple clustering of individuals in space to complex forms of cooperative breeding and reciprocal altruism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Krause1">[11]</xref>. However, one of the most poorly understood aspects of the evolution of any social system is the origin of group interaction in a population of solitary individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Agnarsson1">[5]</xref>. Regardless of the eventual complexity of a social system, the evolutionary transition from solitary living to any form of sociality must begin with the simple act of initiating and maintaining contact with conspecifics, which is best described as aggregation.</p>
      <p>Social aggregation is thought to evolve though adaptive benefits to group living, but hypothesized benefits of communal behavior can be difficult to quantify, compare, and interpret in natural systems. Most empirical research on social evolution has focused on taxa with obligate sociality (eusocial insects, most birds and mammals) and highly complex social interactions, precluding comparison to solitary individuals and limiting insights to the maintenance of sociality rather than its origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Silk1">[12]</xref>. Thus, the mechanisms and directionality of fitness advantages to group living remain contentious but critical to understanding why solitary individuals transition to communal living and how group formation can change over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-West1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Wilson2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Okasha1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-HelmsCahan1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Comparative studies across social insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Hunt1">[17]</xref>, spiders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Jones1">[18]</xref>, birds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Hatchwell1">[7]</xref>, mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-CluttonBrock1">[6]</xref>, fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Dierkes1">[19]</xref>, and lizards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Davis1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Chapple1">[9]</xref> have revealed that many groups form specifically through delayed dispersal of offspring, creating highly related kin groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Emlen1">[20]</xref>. The broad taxonomic distribution of this pattern suggests that extending the interaction of parents and offspring is a simple, common process by which solitary animals become social <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Davis1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Emlen1">[20]</xref>. However, the ecological mechanisms promoting long-term juvenile philopatry are rarely tested empirically (but see evidence in cooperatively-breeding birds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Eikenaar1">[21]</xref> and fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Heg1">[22]</xref>). Hypothesized mechanisms tend to be species-specific and invoke complicated group cooperation scenarios, but several suggest dependence on resource availability or environmental conditions (biotic or abiotic) that are inherently unstable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Emlen1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Eikenaar1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Jetz1">[23]</xref>. Directly testing these mechanisms offers a powerful way to understand how kin groups form by explaining why juveniles may drive the transition from solitary to group living and by predicting when and how this behavior may change as environmental conditions vary. This integration of ultimate fitness consequences of social behavior with the proximate mechanisms promoting aggregation among kin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-West1">[13]</xref> is key to understanding how and why social systems may form and change over time.</p>
      <p>Here we show direct empirical evidence that social group participation in a reptile (the Desert Night Lizard, <italic>Xantusia vigilis</italic>) provides both survival and reproductive success advantages, test a physiological mechanism driving these fitness benefits, and predict changes to social behavior with changing environmental conditions. <italic>Xantusia vigilis</italic> is a very small (1.5 g), long-lived (at least 8–10 years), viviparous lizard that lives at high densities under fallen logs (<italic>Yucca sp.</italic>) in the Mojave Desert of California, USA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Stebbins1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Zweifel1">[25]</xref>. Night lizards are highly secretive and rarely seen away from cover objects. Despite their common name, night lizards are diurnally active, especially in the winter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Miller1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Every winter between November and February, night lizards aggregate into groups of 2–20 individuals underneath fallen logs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040866.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Molecular analyses and field studies have previously shown that these aggregations are often highly related family groups produced through delayed juvenile dispersal, although groups without juveniles can contain kin or unrelated individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Davis1">[8]</xref>. Cross-fostering manipulations show that juveniles remain philopatric and aggregate specifically when with kin as opposed to unrelated individuals, so these family groups do not form simply as a by-product of globally infrequent dispersal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Davis2">[27]</xref>. Furthermore, groups of related individuals are stable across years despite aggregation being a winter-restricted phenomenon, as individuals will re-select former aggregation partners from a high density pool after eight months of solitary living during the spring, summer, and early fall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Davis1">[8]</xref>. These groups form outside of the mating (May–June) or birthing (August–September) seasons and independently of resource distribution and habitat quality, as there are no environmental differences between sites containing aggregations as opposed to solitary lizards (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040866.s002">Figure S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040866.s003">S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040866.s008">Text S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Davis1">[8]</xref>). However, only about 2/3 of the population participates in aggregations each winter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Davis1">[8]</xref>, and this facultative behavior allows the rare comparison between aggregated and solitary individuals and a test of mechanisms promoting social group formation.</p>
      <p>We used this natural variation in social behavior for three specific tests. First, we compared fitness measurements between naturally aggregated and solitary individuals in the field to test for adaptive benefits encouraging the formation of social groups. Second, we examined the temperature-dependence of aggregation behavior and compared rates of heat loss between solitary lizards and aggregations to test a thermal mechanism driving juveniles to join groups. Third, we used climate models to predict how this temperature-dependent aggregation will respond to changing environmental conditions, informing how social behavior can change over time.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>To test for reproductive success and survival consequences of aggregation, we combined a mark-recapture field study of 2,332 lizards in 441 social groups with a DNA microsatellite analysis of parentage. For both males and females, we found that lizards caught in winter aggregations had higher reproductive success in the following summer than solitary individuals (females: <italic>t</italic> = 2.70, df = 32, <italic>P</italic> = 0.011; males: x = 24, n = 24, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040866-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In males, this reproductive skew was extreme, and no winter-solitary male was ever found to sire offspring in a consecutive summer, while several winter-aggregated males sired offspring by multiple females within a single reproductive season. We also found higher survival of aggregated individuals in adult females (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.31, df = 1, <italic>P</italic> = 0.038) and a trend in the same direction for juveniles (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.82, df = 1, <italic>P</italic> = 0.093) and adult males (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.20, df = 1, <italic>P</italic> = 0.138; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040866-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which are significant when combined with a weighted Z-test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Whitlock1">[28]</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0116; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040866.s006">Table S1</xref>). Additionally, we found that aggregated lizards had better body condition (plumper per unit body length) than solitary lizards, although this effect was not significant in adult males (females: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,638</sub> = 4.07, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04; males: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,387</sub> = 0.398, <italic>P</italic> = 0.53; juveniles: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,505</sub> = 7.15, <italic>P</italic> = 0.008; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040866-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

      <p>As aggregation was only observed during winter, we next examined the role of environmental temperature in the prevalence of this behavior (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040866.s008">Text S1</xref> for tests and discussion of other non-significant environmental variables).

      <p>Due to the basic principles of convective heat transfer and the fact that huddling physically alters surface area to volume ratios, there are unavoidable thermal consequences to winter aggregation in night lizards. We quantified these consequences by comparing heat flux in solitary individuals, natural aggregations, and experimentally isolated lizards. We found that, as expected, aggregations cool more slowly than solitary lizards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040866-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; decay time for solitary lizards: F<sub>1,51</sub> = 5.07, <italic>P</italic> = 0.029, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040866-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; decay time for aggregations: F<sub>1,53</sub> = 12.16, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040866-g003">Figure 3C</xref>; decay rate for aggregations: F<sub>1,52</sub> = 14.08, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040866-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). This relationship scales positively with mass, such that small juveniles track environmental temperature very closely and derive the greatest increase in thermal stability from social behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040866-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; note comparison to blank [empty arena] showing environmental temperature). Small-massed juveniles joining aggregations take 30–60% longer to reach equilibrium with environmental temperature than solitary juveniles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040866-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>). When comparing solitary neonates to aggregations under natural field conditions, this heat loss difference translates into an average time lag to temperature equilibrium of about 6.5 hours during a typical night of cooling, and aggregations only experience the coldest temperatures for a limited amount of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040866-g003">Figure 3E</xref>; solitary mean rate = −0.484, aggregation mean rate = −0.329).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our study provides strong empirical evidence that direct fitness benefits favor social aggregation and offers a clear mechanistic explanation for the formation of kin groups through juvenile philopatry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Emlen1">[20]</xref>. Juvenile lizards are disproportionately favored to join winter groups because of their small size, but the fitness and thermal benefits of aggregation are evident in all age and sex classes. However, our results also suggest that aggregated males, females, and juveniles may have multiple ways of benefiting in this system. Our finding that aggregated lizards have higher fitness could be explained either by social interaction driving fitness benefits or by the preferential aggregation of otherwise high fitness individuals. The former interpretation better fits the observed data because the ability of aggregations to increase thermal buffering and reduce metabolic costs uniquely accounts for both the temperature dependence of group living and the absence of body condition differences in males. Both juveniles and females have special body condition needs not experienced by adult males; juveniles are challenged by their tiny size (average mass = 0.25 g) and high ratio of surface area to volume, and viviparous females by their high reproductive investment in litters up to half their body mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Miller1">[26]</xref>. However, males may also use aggregations as a form of mate-guarding and be better able to retain female aggregation mates, accounting for the extreme reproductive skew towards social males. These two processes are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and they may well form a positive feedback loop promoting the maintenance of aggregative behavior even after the initial benefit to philopatric juveniles.</p>
      <p>This research has implications for appreciating the potentially large ecological consequences of environmental variation that can occur when animal behavior is mediated by temperature. Potential and realized effects of climate change on species diversification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Rabosky1">[30]</xref>, extinction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Sinervo1">[31]</xref>, geographic range or niche shifts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Tingley1">[32]</xref>, and reproductive phenology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Fitter1">[33]</xref> have been thoroughly discussed, but purely behavioral responses to climate change have received less attention (except for migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Cotton1">[34]</xref>). However, temperature-mediated behavior is present in many animal systems, of which huddling at cold temperatures is especially common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Ancel1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Berteaux1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Arnold1">[37]</xref>, suggesting that our results are part of a more general phenomenon. In line with what we describe here in <italic>Xantusia</italic>, aggregation is considered beneficial in other winter huddling species because of the thermal advantages of buffering against extreme temperatures, although exact mechanisms vary slightly due to the differences in metabolic profiles between endotherms and ectotherms. Indeed, winter aggregation in some lizard species is also suggested to be mediated by thermal buffering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Elfstrom1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Shah1">[39]</xref>, although it should be noted that other species seem to have quite extensive social interactions without significant thermal pressures (especially in the Australian skink genus <italic>Egernia</italic>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Chapple1">[9]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The major question for species with temperature-mediated social aggregation is the ecological and behavioral response to broad scale changes in climate. Although our data suggest that there may be additional benefits to aggregation other than simple thermal buffering at cold temperatures (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., male reproductive success), the strong temperature dependence of social behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040866-g002">Figure 2</xref>) means that a mechanism is already in place that yields less aggregation at warmer temperatures. For annual aggregation to be maintained at current levels under future climate scenarios, this established relationship between temperature and group formation would have to break down. Moreover, several recent studies have implicated a strong environmental effect on macroevolutionary patterns of sociality and facultative social behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Jetz1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Avils1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Field1">[41]</xref>, and changes in either behavior or ecology should be expected when the benefits of sociality are dependent on particular environmental conditions. Recognizing that simple changes in temperature may have profound and cascading effects on higher-order processes like social evolution is critical to appreciating the ramifications of future environmental change.</p>
      <p>From a macroevolutionary perspective, investigating the transition between solitary and group living may inform the ramifications of extended conspecific interactions in the broader context of the evolution of sociality. The popular perception of social evolution is one of a unidirectional “evolutionary trajectory,” a progressive process in which species get locked into obligate sociality. Although this model is likely true for some systems (particularly eusocial insects), our data support the idea that social group formation may be a very dynamic process in species that maintain reproductive independence of individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-HelmsCahan1">[16]</xref>, including repeated bidirectional transitions between social and solitary states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Wcislo1">[42]</xref>. Especially in the early stages of sociality, transitions between social and solitary behavior may occur easily and rapidly by tracking changes in an ecological or environmental variable like temperature. Behavioral modifications are likely to be the first changes seen when environmental conditions vary through time, and this study adds to a growing body of work highlighting the importance of social plasticity and the role of environment in social evolution. Broadening such perspectives can guide both theoretical and empirical research by generating testable predictions about how, why, when, and in which species social behavior may arise and change over time and space.</p>

        <title>Field Collection</title>
        <p>We conducted a mark-recapture survey of 2,332 lizards from 441 social groups every summer and winter from August 2003 - January 2008 on a 36 hectare plot in the western Mojave Desert, approximately 16 km from Pearblossom, CA, USA (UTM coordinates easting 434561, northing 3816412, zone 11N). We hand-captured lizards by turning every fallen Joshua tree (<italic>Yucca brevifolia</italic>) log in this plot once per season.</p>
        <p>Each winter, we classified any lizards found within a radius of approximately 30 cm of each other as aggregated. Although the vast majority of aggregated lizards were found in direct physical contact and unambiguously intertwined with the other group members, this guideline was occasionally necessary to account for the fleeing of lizards due to the unavoidable effects of sampling disturbance incurred by the rolling of logs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040866.s001">Figure S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Davis1">[8]</xref>). For reference, this distance corresponds to approximately 3.5 times the total length of an adult <italic>X. vigilis</italic> and to the distance an adult can sprint in 0.5–1.5 seconds, even at cold body temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Kaufmann1">[43]</xref>; Supporting Information). Although we think it is important to report that this guideline was used, we rarely needed to employ it and do not believe that it had a significant effect on our results or interpretation.</p>
        <p>At each capture or birth, we measured the mass, snout-vent length (SVL), and tail condition (broken, regrown, intact) of each lizard. We sexed each lizard by shining a light through the base of the tail to visualize hemipenes in males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040866-Davis3">[44]</xref>.

        <title>Reproductive Success</title>
        <p>To assess the reproductive success of social and solitary lizards, we analyzed only adults for which we knew aggregation status in the winter directly preceding summer reproduction (<italic>N</italic> = 34 females, 24 males, all from separate aggregations). Summer-recaptured females were kept in the laboratory until parturition to determine litter size and then returned with their offspring to their exact log of capture.

We assigned paternity to candidate sires with pair or trio critical LOD scores above the 80% confidence level in C<sc>ervus</sc> v3.0.3 and included genotypes of known mothers when available. Although we were able to confidently assign paternity of 230 juveniles to 123 sires, only 24 of these males were also captured in the winter directly preceding offspring birth. Because all 24 of these sires were aggregated males, we used a binomial test with probabilities equal to the observed frequencies of the two aggregation states (69% of winter-captured males were aggregated) to assess the effect of winter sociality on male reproductive success. There was no significant effect of male body size (SVL) on reproductive success (<italic>P</italic> = 0.36).</p>

We constructed four main models with constant but state-specific survival (<italic>Φ</italic><sub>A</sub>, <italic>Φ</italic><sub>B</sub>), time-dependent state transition probabilities (<italic>Ψ</italic><sub>A</sub>, <italic>Ψ</italic><sub>B</sub>), and all four combinations of constant and time-dependent capture probabilities by aggregation state (pA, pB). To minimize over-parameterizing models, we independently analyzed adult males, adult females, and juveniles. Our sampling occasions were not equally spaced across the year, as winter observations were taken in December/January and summer observations in August/September during late stages of female pregnancy (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for Reproductive Success). We accounted for these unequal time intervals by calculating the fraction of one year that had passed between the last day of the earlier sampling occasion and the first day of the later sampling occasions, and then scaling them by dividing each by the longest duration between sampling occasions. To account for aggregation (State B) only being present in the winter, we fixed eight of the possible 18 state transition probabilities (<italic>Ψ</italic>): <italic>Ψ</italic><sub>A→B</sub> was fixed to 0 and <italic>Ψ</italic><sub>B→A</sub> was fixed to 1 for all four winter to summer transitions.</p>
        <p>We ran all models with the logit link function, 2ndPart variation estimation, and identity design matrix options.

We then placed these arenas inside an environmental chamber for at least two hours at 16°C before the temperature dropped to 1°C for 12 hours to simulate natural daytime and nighttime winter temperatures. Each heat flux disk was connected to an external data logger (Hydra®) that scanned all arenas once every six seconds and recorded heat loss curves for each arena each night.

          <p><bold>Daily temperature profiles underneath fallen logs.</bold> Microhabitat temperatures measured by HOBO data loggers underneath five fallen logs are remarkably similar to environmental temperatures at the Pearblossom weather station, especially underneath preferred logs of medium decomposition (top row). Sheltering logs can weakly buffer lizards against extreme temperatures, but the maximum effect of this buffer is no more than a few degrees C and subzero temperatures are encountered as late as March.</p>

We then placed these arenas inside an environmental chamber at 16°C before the temperature dropped to 1°C for 12 hours to simulate natural daytime and nighttime winter temperatures. We recorded changes in heat flux over time to generate heat loss curves for which we then calculated decay rate and half-life to compare the thermal stability of solitary and aggregated lizards.</p>
