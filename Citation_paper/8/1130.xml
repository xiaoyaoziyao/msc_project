<abstract>
<p>In many cancers, cells undergo re-programming of metabolism, cell survival and anti-apoptotic defense strategies, with the proteins mediating this reprogramming representing potential biomarkers. Here, we searched for novel biomarker proteins in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that can impact diagnosis, treatment and prognosis by comparing the protein expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients and healthy donors using specific antibodies, mass spectrometry and binary logistic regression analyses and other bioinformatics tools. Mass spectrometry (LC-HR-MS/MS) analysis identified 1,360 proteins whose expression levels were modified in CLL-derived lymphocytes. Some of these proteins were previously connected to different cancer types, including CLL, while four other highly expressed proteins were not previously reported to be associated with cancer, and here, for the first time, DDX46 and AK3 are linked to CLL. Down-regulation expression of two of these proteins resulted in cell growth inhibition. High DDX46 expression levels were associated with shorter survival of CLL patients and thus can serve as a prognosis marker. The proteins with modified expression include proteins involved in RNA splicing and translation and particularly mitochondrial proteins involved in apoptosis and metabolism. Thus, we focused on several metabolism- and apoptosis-modulating proteins, particularly on the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), regulating both metabolism and apoptosis. Expression levels of Bcl-2, VDAC1, MAVS, AIF and SMAC/Diablo were markedly increased in CLL-derived lymphocytes. VDAC1 levels were highly correlated with the amount of CLL-cancerous CD19+/CD5+ cells and with the levels of all other apoptosis-modulating proteins tested. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated the ability to predict probability of disease with over 90% accuracy. Finally, based on the changes in the levels of several proteins in CLL patients, as revealed from LC-HR-MS/MS, we could distinguish between patients in a stable disease state and those who would be later transferred to anti-cancer treatments. The over-expressed proteins can thus serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, new targets for CLL therapy, and treatment guidance of CLL, forming the basis for personalized therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer biomarkers are molecular indicators of a biological status, often produced by the tumor itself or the host system in response to the tumor, and can be used for early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to treatment and cancer recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref001">1</xref>]. While deep sequencing and other genetic tools are widely accepted as means to detect and analyze such cancer biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref002">2</xref>], many cancer-associated changes are not mutation-related but rather appear as changes in the expression level or post-translational modification of marker proteins.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of most solid tumors, even at a single cancer site, it is now well accepted that a single biomarker is not sufficient for disease diagnosis, progression or treatment efficacy. Proteins, as the actual functional molecules in the cell that can be identified at the expression level and in terms of post-translational modification (i.e. glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, etc.) are often better suited for use as biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The ‘hallmarks of cancer’, as defined by Hanahan and Weinberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref004">4</xref>], comprise a set of cellular traits thought to be necessary for tumorigenesis that include resisting cell death and reprogramming energy metabolism. Such alterations occur in CLL, a cancer characterized by an accumulation of CD19+/CD5+ B lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref005">5</xref>]. Evasion of apoptosis is often promoted by dysregulation of the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref006">6</xref>]. Indeed, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are expressed at high levels in many types of cancer, including CLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref007">7</xref>], and were found to govern mitochondrial apoptotic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref008">8</xref>]. Levels of Mcl-1, another member of the Bcl-2 family, have been correlated with more advanced forms of CLL and resistance to both chemotherapy and Bcl-2 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref009">9</xref>]. In addition, in a number of cancers, including advanced CLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref011">11</xref>], reduced levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax or Bak contribute to chemoresistance.</p>
<p>In many cancers, cells undergo metabolic re-programing and rely on glycolysis as the main energy-generating pathway, even in the presence of oxygen (the ‘Warburg effect’), with this pathway also providing precursors for protein, nucleotide and lipid biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Mitochondria play key roles in cellular energy and metabolism, and in apoptosis, with mitochondrial abnormalities have been recognized in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref013">13</xref>]. VDAC1, a multi-functional channel, lies in the mitochondrial outer membrane and forms a pathway for the exchange of metabolites between mitochondria and cytosol, thereby regulating mitochondrial metabolic function and energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref017">17</xref>]. VDAC1 also contributes to cancer cell metabolism via its binding to HK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref021">21</xref>]. VDAC1-bound HK allows the coupling of mitochondrially-generated ATP to glucose phosphorylation, thus regulating glycolytic flux with the TCA cycle and ATP synthesis to balance the energy and metabolite requirements of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref021">21</xref>]. However, VDAC1 also directly contributes to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by participating in the release of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins to the cytosol (e.g. cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (Cyto <italic>c</italic>), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/Direct IAP-binding protein (SMAC/Diablo), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref022">22</xref>] and by interacting with apoptosis regulatory proteins, such as members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref025">25</xref>] and HK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref027">27</xref>]. The relationship between the expression level of these energy and metabolic homeostasis- and apoptosis-associated proteins to CLL state and sensitivity to treatment was not previously addressed.</p>
<p>In this study, we profiled the expression of various proteins, including apoptosis and metabolic modulators, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from CLL patients and healthy donors, in order to identify potential early biomarkers for CLL detection and guide treatment. Using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HR-MS/MS) analysis, we discovered 1,360 differentially expressed proteins in CLL patients compared to healthy donors, several of which had been previously reported to be associated with cancer, yet four of which were identified as being associated with any cancer, including CLL, for the first time. Many of these proteins are involved in mitochondrial metabolism, apoptosis, RNA splicing and translation. We demonstrate that besides increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, VDAC1, and the apoptosis-related proteins MAVS (mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein, also known as IPS-1, Cardif or VISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref028">28</xref>]), AIF, and SMAC/Diablo, are also markedly over-expressed in lymphocytes of CLL patients. Furthermore, we could identify several proteins allowing for distinction between patients in a stable disease state and those transferred to anti-cancer treatments. The proteins identified in this study can thus serve as potential biomarkers for CLL diagnosis, predicting treatment effectiveness, new targets for cancer therapy and for defining optimal therapeutic interventions for patients, forming the basis for personalized therapy.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Thirty one CLL patients from Soroka University Medical Center (14 males and 17 females with a median age of 69 years) were studied. CLL diagnosis was based on clinical examination, peripheral blood count and immuno-phenotyping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148500.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Patients were not receiving any disease treatment, with 68% being at stage 0–1, 6% at stage 2 and 26% at stage 3–4. The research was approved by the Soroka University Medical center Advisory Committee on Ethics in Human Experimentation.</p>
<p>All of the experiments were conducted in accordance with national laws and regulations, the ethical principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki and with good clinical practice as described in the ICH guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to entry into the study. All subjects received a copy of their signed and dated informed consent form.</p>

<title>Isolation of PBMC and CD19-positive cells</title>
<p>PBMCs were isolated from venous blood of CLL patients by Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation. After informed consent, venous blood (10–20 ml) was drawn from CLL patients or from normal adult donors. Blood was collected into heparin tubes and was diluted 1:1 with balance solution composed of solution A (1% D-glucose, 50 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.98 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.4 mM KCl and 0.145 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) and solution B (0.14 M NaCl) in a 1:9 ratio. The resulting mix was carefully layered on Ficoll-Paque Plus (10 ml of diluted blood on 15 ml Ficoll) in 50 ml conical tubes and centrifuged (400xg, 18–20°C, 40 min). The fine layer of mononuclear cells was transferred to a new centrifuge tube, washed thrice with balance solution and resuspended in culture medium appropriate to the application. The proportion of cancerous B cells in the total PBMC pool was analyzed by antibody-based detection of CD19/CD5 double positive cells and flow cytometry (Beckton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA).</p>
<p>CD19-positive cells were isolated from PMBCs using a magnetic bead-based method following the manufacturer's instructions, with minor modifications. Briefly, PMBCs (2.5x10<sup>7</sup> cells) were centrifuged (300g, 10 min), resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (PBS, pH, 7.2, 2 mM EDTA, 2% FBS), labeled with 50 μl of CD19 micro beads (Cat. No: 130-050-301, MACS Miltenyi biotech), mixed and incubated for 15 minutes at 4°C. The cells were washed with buffer A, centrifuged, resuspended in buffer A and subjected to magnetic separation with LS columns and a Midi MACS separator from MACS Miltenyi Biotech.</p>

The mobile phase was: (A) H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.1% formic acid, and (B) acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Desalting of the samples was performed online using a reverse-phase C18 trapping column (180 μm internal diameter, 20 mm length, 5 μm particle size; Waters).

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this study, PBMCs isolated from healthy donors and CLL patients receiving no disease treatment were analyzed using LC-HR-MS/MS and immunoblotting to explore possible CLL biomarkers and disease progression predication. Many potential biomarkers for CLL were identified in this manner, yet we focused on the correlation of CLL occurrence with the expression profiles of several metabolism- and apoptosis-related proteins, as well as other highly specific biomarkers that were identified. Special attention was given to VDAC1, a regulator of cellular energy, metabolism and apoptosis. The results offer novel biomarkers for CLL diagnosis and treatment guidance.</p>

<p>To verify the importance of these proteins to CLL cancer cells, we tested the effects of their silencing on cell viability and growth using specific siRNA. Owing to limited access to CLL samples and their low stability, we instead used MEC-1 cells derived from B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia in prolymphocytoid transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref064">64</xref>] to analyze the effects of siRNA-mediated down-regulated expression of DDX46 and AK3 on cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). While two sets of siRNA were designed and tested for each of four proteins, only those designed for DDX46 and AK3 effectively decreased their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or siRNA specific to DDX46 or AK3 and cell growth was analyzed using the SRB method. Each of the designed siRNAs was highly effective in decreasing cell growth up to 80% 48 h post-transfection, with the combination of both siRNAs being more active in decreasing both mRNA levels and cell growth (over 90%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g002">Fig 2B–2D</xref>). These effects required only nanomolar concentrations (50 nM) and persisted 96 h post-transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g002">Fig 2B–2D</xref>). The decrease in cell growth was due to a decrease in the number of cells and not due to cell death (data not shown).</p>
<p>Finally, to further test the prognostic value of AP3B, ADH5, DDX46 and AK3 proteins in CLL, we used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis on public available gene expression data a set of CLL patients in which the percent of patients surviving with high mRNA levels was compared to the survival of patients with low mRNA levels. Significant difference between the two patient groups was found for DDX46 (p = 0.00097) but not for AP3B (P = 0.469), ADH5 (P = 0.156) and AK3 (P = 0.065) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148500.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<p>Specifically, VDAC1 was found to be substantially over-expressed by 6.2-fold in PBMCs from CLL patients, as compared with healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g003">Fig 3Aa and 3B</xref>). Likewise Bcl-2 protein levels were markedly higher (9.6-fold) in PBMCs obtained from CLL patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g003">Fig 3Ab and 3B</xref>). MAVS was over-expressed on average by 5.2-fold in PBMCs from CLL patients, as compared with healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g003">Fig 3Ac and 3B</xref>). This is the first demonstration of VDAC1 and MAVS over-expression in leukemia.

Unexpectedly, the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins AIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref067">67</xref>] and SMAC/Diablo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref068">68</xref>] were also over-expressed (1.9- and 4-fold on average, respectively) in PBMCs derived from CLL patients, as compared with healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g003">Fig 3Ad and 3Ae</xref>, respectively and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g003">3B</xref>).). This is the first demonstration of AIF and SMAC/Diablo over-expression in leukemia.</p>
<p>To assess HK levels, we used several commercially available antibodies directed against HK-I or HK-II, most of which displayed non-isoform-specific reactivity. In CLL patients, HK-I levels were slightly increased (1.35-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g003">Fig 3Af and 3B</xref>), while assessment of HK-II levels proved inconclusive (not shown). The levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax were very low in CLL patients, being less than 10% of those found in healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g003">Fig 3Ag and 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>The over-expression of Bcl-2, VDAC1 and AIF in CLL as revealed by immunoblotting was in agreement the LH-HR-MS/MS results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148500.t001">Table 1</xref> group A,B).</p>
<p>We also selected PPWD1, over-expressed in CLL patients (35.7 fold, P = 9.7x10<sup>-5</sup> and &gt;100 fold, P = 7.7x10<sup>-3</sup>, from the newly identified CLL associated proteins group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148500.t001">Table 1</xref>, group B).

<p>The observed increases in protein levels were not due to increased mitochondrial numbers/mass, since analysis using MitoTracker green, a dye that localizes to mitochondria regardless of mitochondrial membrane potential, revealed similar levels of mitochondria in PBMCs derived from either CLL patients or healthy donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148500.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

Eighty to over 90% of the CLL patients showed VDAC1, Bcl-2, SMAC/Diablo, MAVS and AIF levels higher than seen in all healthy donors. In some patients, Bcl-2 and VDAC1 levels were 30- and 14-fold higher than in healthy donors, respectively. Similarly, SMAC/Diablo and MAVS were 6- and 20-fold over-expressed in some patients, respectively.</p>

<p>To demonstrate that VDAC1 levels were high in the cancerous cells, we separated CD19-positive cells using anti-CD19 antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). PBMCs isolated from three CLL patients presented 83, 86 and 92% CD19/CD5-positive cells (data not shown). The CD19 cell population represents cancerous cells as in healthy individuals, B lymphocytes comprise only 1–7% of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref069">69</xref>]. VDAC1 levels in the CD19-positive and negative cells were analyzed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). VDAC1 levels in CD19-positive cells were several-fold higher than in CD19-negative cells.</p>
<p>Next, the level of VDAC1 expression, plotted as a function of the percentage of CD19+/CD5+ cells for each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), showed that the VDAC1 level was positively correlated with the amount of CD19+/CD5+-expressing cancerous cells. This correlation further demonstrates that an elevation in the expression of VDAC1 was strongly associated with cancerous CLL cells. Similarly, positive correlation between the amount of CD19+/CD5+-expressing cells and SMAC/Diablo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g005">Fig 5F</xref>), MAVS, Bcl-2 and AIF (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5–0.7, data not shown) expression levels was obtained.</p>

<p>Differentially expressed proteins between CLL patients in a stable disease state and those transferred to anti-cancer treatments (p-value &lt;0.01, FC <bold>≥|</bold>2<bold>|</bold>) were filtered and proteins of interest are presented based on their relevance to cancer and potential as biomarkers. For each protein, its name, fold change and p-value are indicated, as are its function, subcellular localization and relevance to cancer.</p>
<p>To confirm this analysis and explore potential novel biomarkers for CLL progression, we examined the expression level of DHRS4, SLC25A1, and UBE3A in PBMCs from groups A and B by immunoblotting using specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As cancer-associated changes are not only mutation–related but can also appear as increases or decreases in protein expression levels or be associated with protein post-translational modification, biomarkers other than mutations should be identified and explored as early markers of the disease, as indicators of the disease state, and as predictive and prognostic gauges of treatment effectiveness. By applying LC-HR-MS/MS and immunoblot analyses to PBMCs isolated from healthy donors and CLL patients, we identified expression changes of a number of proteins related to cellular functions and pathways associated with CLL, and with mitochondria, apoptosis and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148500.t001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148500.t002">2</xref>). The identified altered proteins can serve as biomarkers for early CLL diagnosis, and as potential new targets for development of new treatments for CLL.</p>

<title>Alterations in protein expression between healthy and CLL patients—potential CLL biomarkers and potential new targets for CLL therapy</title>
<p>Using LC-HR-MS/MS-based protein profile analysis, we identified a battery of proteins that can distinguish between healthy individuals and CLL patients. When considering only the 59 proteins whose expression was found to be altered in 2 different LC-HR-MS/MS experiments, we identified several proteins that were previously found to be mutated in CLL or proposed as CLL diagnosis and prognosis markers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148500.t001">Table 1</xref>, group A). A second group of proteins associated with metabolism and apoptosis, including VDAC1, VDAC2 and AIF, were reported for some cancers other than CLL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148500.t001">Table 1</xref>, group B).</p>
<p>Finally, we identified several proteins with altered expression in CLL patients that were not previously reported to be associated with any cancer including CLL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148500.t001">Table 1</xref>, group C).</p>
<p>When focusing on the apoptotic modulating proteins, the binary logistic regression model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref033">33</xref>] employed here demonstrated that SMAC/Diablo, AIF, MAVS, VDAC1 or Bcl-2 are with high potential as diagnostic markers of &gt;90% accuracy when using Bivariance analysis, and AUC values of 0.97 to 1.0 in the ROC curve analysis for CLL diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>
<p>The differentially expressed proteins in CLL presented here are consistent with and contribute to the malignant phenotype of the cancer cells. As a single biomarker not always sufficient for cancer diagnosis, the additional proteins explored here with altered expression level in CLL may be used for CLL early diagnosis, prediction of disease progress and assessment of future treatment effectiveness.</p>
<p>Moreover, some of these proteins may be potential new targets for developing CLL treatment. Indeed, down-regulation of the RNA helicase DDX46, involved in pre-mRNA processing, such as pre-mRNA splicing, rRNA biogenesis, and transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref061">61</xref>], and of the mitochondrial protein AK3, involved in maintaining the homeostasis of cellular nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref063">63</xref>], resulted in profound inhibition of cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Interestingly, DDX46 was shown to be required for multi-lineage differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref088">88</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, high DDX46 expression levels are significantly associated with shorter survival of CLL patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148500.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and thus, DDX46 can serve a marker of prognosis in these patients.</p>
<p>The second protein whose down-regulation inhibited cell growth was AK3 located exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix and involved in adenine metabolism. AK3 was not previously connected to CLL or any cancer, apart from the finding that deletion of chromosome 9p frequently occurs in bladder tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref089">89</xref>], with chromosome 9 carrying AK1, AK2 and AK3. The mechanism(s) by which down-regulation of DDX46 or AK3 leads to decreased cell growth is not clear but will be explored in future study.</p>

<title>CLL patients express high levels of apoptosis-modulating proteins, except the pro-apoptotic protein Bax</title>
<p>Alterations that attenuate apoptosis pathways are selected for during tumor initiation and progression, with ‘apoptosis evasion’ being considered an essential hallmark of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref004">4</xref>]. Hence, we analyzed the levels of apoptosis-modulating proteins, including Bcl-2, SMAC/Diablo, AIF, MAVS, and VDAC1, and found that all are markedly over-expressed in CLL (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g004">4</xref>).

<title>Alterations in protein expression between CLL patients—potential disease progression biomarkers</title>
<p>Analysis of CLL LC-HR-MS/MS results with respect to disease state, meaning patients in a stable condition or patients with progressing disease that required treatment or who died of the disease, revealed additional proteins that allow distinguishing between these two groups. Of the 50 proteins, the selected 19 were either associated with cancer, mainly breast cancer, or were not previously connected to cancer (5 proteins) and found here for the first time to be over-expressed in CLL patient-derived PBMCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148500.t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). These include DHRS4, a peroxisomal protein which reduces all-trans-retinal and 9-cis retinal, SLC25A1, a mitochondrial tricarboxylate transporter mediating citrate-H+/malate exchange, and UBE3A, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>). Additional proteins of interest that were over-expressed in CLL patients that required treatment at later stage of the disease progression (group B), include SNX18, involved in endocytosis and vesicle trafficking during interphase and at the end of mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref090">90</xref>], APRT, which sensitizes cells to treatment with E. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref082">82</xref>], Acox3-acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 3 (ACOX3), with a SNP shown to be associated with prediction of outcome of CLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref072">72</xref>] being highly (54.2-fold) over-expressed in CLL patients group B, as confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148500.t002">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, ectonucleotide pyrop-hosphatase/phosphodiesterase 4 (ENPP4), involved in hydrolyze phosphodiester bonds and acting as a pro-coagulant and highly expressed in the metastatic osteosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref087">87</xref>], was highly reduced (51.8-fold) in CLL group B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148500.t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings suggest that we could predict which CLL patients were in a stable condition with no need for treatment and those who should be treated. This molecular-based prognostic assay could help in decisions regarding the start of treatment and may complement current methods for predicting disease outcome and improve patient care.</p>

VDAC1 was found to be over-expressed in several types of cancers, such as lung, cervical, thyroide and ovarey cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref091">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref092">92</xref>], yet this report is the first to demonstrate VDAC1 over-expression in CLL (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148500.t001">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, in some patients, VDAC1 levels were increased up to 14-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Moreover, tight correlation between VDAC1 levels and the amount of cancerous cells, represented by CD19/CD5 double positive cells, was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Similarly, VDAC1 levels were correlated with the expression levels of the apoptosis-associated protein tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148500.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, no studies have explored the potential diagnostic value of VDAC1 in cancer, and particularly, in CLL. VDAC1 over-expression offers numerous advantages to cancer cells, given its multi-functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref022">22</xref>]. These include being the main transporter through the OMM of ATP and other metabolites and ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref022">22</xref>], involved in cholesterol transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref093">93</xref>], and presenting anchoring sites for HK, allowing direct transport of mitochondrial ATP for glucose phosphorylation, thereby increasing the glycolytic rate, a characteristic of cancer cells (i.e., the Warburg effect) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref004">4</xref>]. Finally, over-expressed VDAC1 offers binding sites for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, allowing these proteins to mediate their anti-apoptotic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref094">94</xref>].</p>
<p>VDAC1 is also directly involved in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref027">27</xref>].

In cancer cells, over-expressed anti-apoptotic proteins interact with VDAC1, thereby preventing VDAC1 pro-apoptotic activity. However, when association of these proteins with VDAC1 is interrupted, such as by VDAC1-based peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref095">95</xref>], over-expressed VDAC1 becomes pro-apoptotic. Thus, VDAC1 over-expression in CLL can function as double-edged sword, on the one hand providing metabolic advantages to cancer cells and binding sites for over-expressed anti-apoptotic proteins, yet on the other hand, by interfering with anti-apoptotic protein binding to VDAC1, over-expressed VDAC1 displays pro-apoptotic activity, encouraging cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref027">27</xref>].</p>

However, others found higher SMAC/Diablo expression in adenocarcinomas, as compared to squamous cell tumors, and in cervical cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref100">100</xref>] and in gastric adenocarcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref101">101</xref>]. Finally in renal cell carcinoma, SMAC/Diablo mRNA levels in meningiomal cells were higher than in normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref102">102</xref>].</p>
<p>This discrepancy between increased SMAC/Diablo levels in CLL and its pro-apoptotic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref068">68</xref>] may result from another, as yet unidentified, activity of SMAC/Diablo other than countering the activities of IAPs.</p>
<p>AIF is also over-expressed in CLL (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148500.g004">4</xref>). AIF is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-containing, NADH-dependent oxidoreductase residing in the mitochondrial intermembrane space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref067">67</xref>]. Upon apoptosis induction, AIF undergoes proteolysis, is released from the mitochondria and translocates to the nucleus, where it triggers chromatin condensation and large-scale DNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref067">67</xref>]. As a pro-apoptotic protein, it is unclear why AIF is over-expressed in cancer cells. AIF has also emerged as a protein critical for development, as homozygous AIF knockout in mice is lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref103">103</xref>]. The pro-survival activity of AIF was proposed to be related to oxidative phosphorylation, ROS detoxification, redox-sensing, mitochondrial morphology and cell cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148500.ref104">104</xref>]. AIF over-expression in CLL may offer an advantage to cancer cells via these processes. Both SMAC/DIBLO and AIF over-expressed in CLL can serve as CLL biomarkers and as possible new targets for CLL therapy.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The expression levels of many proteins identified by LC-HR-MS/MS analysis are highly altered in CLL patients, reflecting cancer cells reprogramming including of metabolic and anti-apoptotic features. Some of these proteins were previously identified as associated with CLL or other cancers, but some are newly identified as related to CLL. Down-regulation of two of the newly identified proteins resulted in cell growth inhibition. Based on the levels of some of these proteins in CLL patients, it is possible to distinguish between patients in a stable disease state and those eventually subjected to anti-cancer treatments or who had died of the disease. Furthermore, immunoblotting analysis further exposed several proteins (e.g., VDAC1, MAVS, AIF and SMAC/Diablo) as highly over-expressed in CLL and pointed to new functions for these pro-apoptotic proteins. The use of these advanced molecular diagnostics protein-based biomarkers may facilitate accurate diagnosis, prognostic prediction and monitoring response to treatment and could contribute to individualized CLL treatment. Finally, these newly identified biomarkers may also serve as targets for the development of new treatments for CLL.</p>

<p>Kaplan-Meier survival curves for CLL patients are presented for patients with high expression (red line) and low expression (blue line) of AP3B (A), ADH5 (B), DDX46 (C) and AK3 (D). Tick marks represent the survival time for patients that did not participate in the full duration of the experiment. Survival time was measured from date of diagnosis to date of death for patients who died and to the date of the last follow-up for those who were alive at the time of the analysis. A difference between two curves was considered statistically significant when P &lt; 0.05.</p>

<p>All patients were untreated at the time of this study. Patients’ average age was 69 years, composed 14 males and 17 females. The T cell specific zeta-associated protein 70 (Zap 70) is an intracellular tyrosine kinase. ZAP-70 is the gene used to distinguish the CLL subtypes. The expression of ZAP-70 and the co-expression of the T-cell antigen CD5 and B-cell surface antigens CD19 were analyzed in peripheral-blood samples from the patients with CLL using specific antibodies and flow cytometry. Positive (over 15%) and negative (less than 14%) signals are indicated by + and–, and ND indicates not determined. About 13% of the tested samples were ZAP-positive.</p>
