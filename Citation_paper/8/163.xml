<abstract>
<p>Inhibition of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, which is often accompanied by painful inflammatory and immunopathological processes, is challenging. Current IVD gene therapeutic approaches are based on adenoviral gene delivery systems, which are limited by immune reactions to their viral proteins. Their applications in IVDs near to sensitive neural structure could provoke toxicity and immunological side-effects with neurological deficits. Self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) vectors, which do not express any viral gene and are not linked with any known disease in humans, are attractive therapeutic gene delivery vectors in degenerative IVDs. However, scAAV-based silencing of catabolic or inflammatory factor has not yet been investigated in human IVD cells. Therefore, we used scAAV6, the most suitable serotype for transduction of human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells, to knockdown the major catabolic gene (ADAMTS4) of IVD degeneration. IVD degeneration grades were determined by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Lumbar NP tissues of degeneration grade III were removed from 12 patients by nucleotomy. NP cells were isolated and cultured with low-glucose. Titre of recombinant scAAV6 vectors targeting ADAMTS4, transduction efficiencies, transduction units, cell viabilities and expression levels of target genes were analysed using quantitative PCR, fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays during 48 days of post-transduction. Transduction efficiencies between 98.2% and 37.4% and transduction units between 611 and 245 TU/cell were verified during 48 days of post-transduction (p&lt;0.001). scAAV6-mediated knockdown of ADAMTS4 with maximum 87.7% and minimum 40.1% was confirmed on day 8 and 48 with enhanced the level of aggrecan 48.5% and 30.2% respectively (p&lt;0.001). scAAV6-mediated knockdown of ADAMTS4 showed no impact on cell viability and expression levels of other inflammatory catabolic proteins. Thus, our results are promising and may help to design long-term and less immunogenic gene therapeutic approaches in IVD disorders, which usually need prolonged therapeutic period between weeks and months.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intervertebral discs (IVDs) have a particular load-bearing organization that distributes loading consistently on the vertebral bodies, withstands spinal compression and provides flexibility in the spine. IVDs consist of hydrated nucleus pulposus (NP), radially aligned annulus fibrosus (AF) and cartilaginous endplates (EP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref002">2</xref>]. NP contains predominantly proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid and type II collagen. The major proteoglycan constituent is aggrecan, which is connected by link protein to the hyaluronic acid. A fibril network of AF made from various types of collagen and glycoproteins enfolds the NP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref002">2</xref>]. Painful IVD degeneration is associated with structural failure of IVD tissues, which is often accompanied by inflammatory and immunopathological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Degenerative NP cells have been shown to induce inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which evidently induce overexpression of the catabolic factor ADAMTS4 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref008">8</xref>]. Overexpression of ADAMTS4 has been shown to adversely affect the biomechanics of IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref008">8</xref>]. ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase-1) and ADAMTS5 (aggrecanase-2) are identified to be the primary degrading agents of aggrecan in the gene family of metalloproteinases. Thus far, 20 genetically different members of ADAMTSs have been identified in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref016">16</xref>]. While ADAMTS5 is constitutively expressed in IVD cells, overexpression of ADAMTS4 is induced by the inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref017">17</xref>]. Moreover, in degenerative IVDs and articular cartilages the levels of ADAMTS4 were shown to increase with grades of degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref017">17</xref>]. Although TIMP-3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3) and fibronectin are described to be the physiological inhibitors of ADAMTS4, their expression levels seem to be inadequate for effective inhibition of ADAMTS4 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref008">8</xref>]. Therefore, progressive overexpression of ADAMTS4 seems to be a key therapeutic target in degenerative joint and IVD diseases.</p>
<p>Current gene therapeutic approaches used to target degenerative IVD cells <italic>in vitro</italic> or in small animal models are based mostly on adenoviral gene delivery systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref026">26</xref>]. Although adenoviral vectors can be used for high level and persistent expression of therapeutic genes, their therapeutic potential is limited by the immune reactions to their viral proteins. Accordingly, their applications in spinal discs near to sensitive neural structure could provoke toxicity and immunological side-effects that could result in neurological deficits and serious pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), which do not express any viral gene and are not linked with any known disease in humans, have become attractive therapeutic gene delivery vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref035">35</xref>]. The advantage of self-complementary AAV (scAAV) vectors over standard AAV vectors is based on their ability to fold upon themselves and immediately form transcriptionally competent double-stranded DNA, which allow them to bypass the limiting aspects of second-strand synthesis and shorten the lag time before transgene expression; and that could increase their biological efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref036">36</xref>].They can thus preferably be used than standard AAV vectors, especially for cloning of small therapeutic molecules. Therefore, in our preliminary study we aimed at identifying the optimal scAAV vectors for effective and long-term transduction of human NP cells. By screening different scAAV serotypes, we identified scAAV6 as the most suitable serotype for effective and long-term transduction of human NP cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref037">37</xref>]. However, functional applications of recombinant scAAV vectors in human IVD research have not yet been examined. Thus, we determined to investigate a functional application of recombinant scAAV6 vectors in degenerative human NP cells by inducing shRNA mediated knockdown of ADAMTS4. scAAV6 mediated knockdown of ADAMTS4 showed long-term enhancement of aggrecan without any impact on cell viability and the expression of other inflammatory, catabolic or matrix proteins. Thus, this study may help to establish less immunogenic gene therapeutic approaches in degenerative IVD disorders.</p>

<title>Recruitment of NP tissues from patients</title>
<p>The local research ethics committee (Innsbruck Medical University: project AN2014-0027 333/4.24) authorized this experimental study of human IVD tissues. Samples of NP tissues were recruited from patients during lumbar disc surgery with informed consents of the patients. Patients provided their written informed consent to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria for surgery were intervertebral disc herniation with nerve root compression detected on MRI, which correlated to primary symptoms that remained unresponsive to non-operative treatment for six weeks, or demonstrated progressive neurological deterioration in the face of conservative treatment. 12 lumbar discs of Pfirman degeneration grade III from 12 patients (mean age of 49 years: range 34–61 years) were involved in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0172181.t001">Table 1</xref>). Disc degeneration grade (DDG) was determined by preoperative MRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref039">39</xref>]. A representative MRI picture of the 12 IVD samples, which presents a herniated lumbar disc of DDG III with nerve root compression, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g001">Fig 1</xref>.

<title>Isolation and monolayer expansion of NP cells</title>
<p>IVD tissues isolated from patients were immediately brought to the laboratory and washed twice in PBS (1000 x g, 2 min). NP tissues were separated from AF tissues on the basis of their macroscopic morphology (identification of the innermost lamellar rings of the AF) and finely minced into small fragments of approximately 2 mm<sup>3</sup>. NP tissues were then digested with 0.02% w/v pronase (Sigma-Aldrich) (37°C, 5% CO2, 1 h) in 20 ml DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium), which contained 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glucose and 10% FCS (Fetal Calf Serum) (Sigma-Aldrich). After filtration of samples through sterile 75 gm nylon mesh filters (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifugation of the supernatants (1000 x g, 5 min), pellets were resuspended in 20 ml culture medium and digested with 0.02% w/v collagenase II (Sigma-Aldrich) (37°C, 5% CO2, 3 h). Samples were again filtered and centrifuged as stated above. Pellets were then resuspended in 5 ml culture medium and cultured in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> tissue culture flask till reaching 100% confluent by changing the culture medium every two days (37°C, 5% CO2, about 2 weeks). For later experiments NP cells were cryopreserved at -196°C in culture medium containing 30% FCS and 15% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich).</p>

<title>Production and purification of the recombinant scAAV6 vectors</title>
<p>For the production of the recombinant scAAV6 vectors human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were grown in DMEM, which contained 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 4.5% glucose and 10% FCS, and passaged 2 times prior to transfection. For the transfection 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> HEK293 cells were cultured in 15 cm culture dish with 20 ml culture medium till reaching 70–80% confluence. To prepare the transfection medium 30 μg of shuttle plasmid pAAV-ADAMTS4 or pAAV-Ctrl were mixed with 96 μg of the helper plasmid (pDP6rs). The respective mixture was added to 2.5 ml of 300 mM calcium phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) and gently mixed with 2.5 ml of 2 x HBS (Hepes Buffered Saline) (Sigma-Aldrich). The transfection medium was directly pipetted to the culture dish and changed with DMEM containing 2% FCS after 6 hours of incubation (37°C, 5% CO2). After 72 h of transfection culture medium was collected and cells were harvested by trypsinization and combined for centrifugation (2000 x g, 5 min). Pellet was resuspended in a serum-free DMEM (2.5 ml) and subjected to eight rounds of freeze/thaw cycles by alternating the tube between dry ice-ethanol bath and 37°C water bath. AAV supernatant was then collected by centrifugation (8000 x g, 30 min) and stored at -80°C for subsequent purification. Purification of the recombinant scAAV6 vectors was performed as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref042">42</xref>]. Briefly, the recombinant scAAV6 vectors were purified from freeze/thaw-supernatants by iodixanol (Sigma-Aldrich) gradient centrifugation and iodixanol was removed by running the iodixanol fractions through PD10 gel filtration columns (GE Healthcare). 10 fractions of 1 ml eluate were collected and fractions 4 to 6 were pooled for quantification. The recombinant scAAV6 vectors (AAV6-ADAMTS4 or AAV6-Ctrl) were then quantified by using quantitative PCR.</p>

<p>As only a portion of AAV6-ADAMTS4 or AAV6-Ctrl are able to enter NP cells, quantifying the number of internalized recombinant vectors (transduction units: TU) is very important to obtain reproducible functional results. The qPCR results showed that both vectors consistently reached similar numbers of TU per cell (TU/cell) (p ≥ 0.216) and the TU reached a plateau within the first 8 days of post-transduction. On day 8 the maximum mean transduction units were (609 ± 4.45) and (611 ± 5.56) TU/cell for AAV6-Ctrl and AAV6-ADAMTS4 respectively. After day 8 the number of transduction units continuously decreased and on day 48 they reached the mean values of (242 ± 4.92) TU/cell for AAV6-Ctrl and (245 ± 2.05) TU/cell for AAV6-ADAMTS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g003">Fig 3a</xref>).

Using RT-qPCR the maximum knockdown of ADAMTS4 was confirmed on day 8 with an average reduction level of 87.7%. Although the knockdown effect was continuously weakened in the course of 48 days, the mean level of ADAMTS4 was still reduced by 74% on day 16 and by 40.1% on day 48 (p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g004">Fig 4a</xref>).

<title>Specificity of AAV6-ADAMTS4 mediated knockdown</title>
<p>Treatment of NP cells with AAV6-ADAMTS4 vectors, encoding the shRNA directed against ADAMTS4, showed high transduction efficiencies, efficient transduction units and no impact on the viability of NP cells. Moreover, AAV6-ADAMTS4 promoted effective and long-term knockdown of ADAMTS4 that resulted in increased level of aggrecan.

On day 48 the level of ADAMTS4 in AAV6-ADAMTS4 treated cells was reduced by 46.8% with mean value of 867 ± 26 pg/ml and the level of aggrecan was enhanced by 28.3% with mean value of 36795 ± 270 pg/ml (p &lt; 0.001). In AAV6-Ctrl treated and untreated cells the levels of ADAMTS4 and aggrecan remained unaffected. The results these experiments indicated that the treatment of NP cells with AAV6-ADAMTS4 had only specific effects on the levels of ADAMTS4 and aggrecan. Age and gender did not show any additional effect on the specificity of AAV6-ADAMTS4 mediated knockdown.</p>

<p>To examine whether AAV6-ADAMTS4 induces unspecific changes in the expression levels of catabolic, inflammatory and matrix proteins in degenerative NP cells, the expression levels of ADAMTS5, IL-1β, TNF-α and collagen II were examined by using ELISA. 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> NP cells were seeded, transduced with 5000 vg/c of AAV6-Ctrl or AAV6-ADAMTS4 and transferred to scaffold on day 3 of post-transduction. On day 8, 16, 24, 32, 48 NP cells were harvested from scaffold and 100 μg of total protein extracts were used for ELISA. Box plots with whiskers represent the expression levels on day 8 (Fig 6a–6f). AAV6-ADAMTS4 mediated knockdown showed specific impact on the levels of ADAMTS4 and aggrecan (Fig 6a &amp; 6e). The expression levels of ADAMTS5, IL-1β, TNF-α and collagen II were not affected (Fig 6b, 6c, 6d &amp; 6f). In AAV6-Ctrl treated and untreated cells the levels of all tested proteins remained unaffected (Fig 6a–6f).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>AAV vectors that do not express any viral protein and are not linked with any known disease in humans are important for gene therapeutic approaches in degenerative IVD diseases. Their applications in IVDs near to sensitive neural structure could minimise toxicity and immunological side-effects, which could result in neurological deficits and serious pain. Current studies regarding the potential use of AAV in therapeutic approaches of degenerative IVD disorders are only based on the use of standard AAV2 vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref046">46</xref>]. However, various tissues have been detected to be more susceptible to other AAV serotypes than AAV2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref048">48</xref>]. Since lack of tissue tropism and pre-existing immune response are major problems of AAV-based gene therapeutic applications, we aimed in our preliminary study at identifying the optimal AAV serotype for efficient and long-term transduction of human NP cells. scAAV6 was identified as the most suitable vector for efficient and long-term transduction of human NP cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref037">37</xref>]. However, the functional application of scAAV vectors in human IVD research is a new approach that has not yet been examined. Therefore, we determined to perform functional experiments to prove the therapeutic potential of recombinant scAAV6 vectors in degenerative human NP cells. scAAV6 vectors were used rather than standard AAV6 vectors, as they can bypass the limiting aspects of second-strand synthesis and possibly increase their biological efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In spite of big advantages of using scAAV vectors, there are some limitations. Because of their small genome size (4.5 kbp) scAAV vectors are not convenient for cloning of large genes. Possibilities are currently being explored to override this limiting capacity. For example the ITRs of two AAV genomes can anneal to form head to tail concatemer that could almost double the coding capacity of the vector. However, scAAV vectors have become very interesting for the delivery of small therapeutic genes (up to 3.0 kbp) and shRNAs in RNAi approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>For the application of the RNA interference (RNAi) technique, we generated the recombinant scAAV6 vectors encoding the shRNA targeting ADAMTS4 (AAV6-ADAMTS4) or the non-target control shRNA (AAV6-Ctrl). ADAMTS4 is considered as a key therapeutic target, since it is the main degrading agent of aggrecan and its level continuously rises in degenerating NP cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref008">8</xref>]. In this study NP cells of disc degeneration grade III (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0172181.t001">Table 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g001">Fig 1</xref>) transduced with the recombinant scAAV6 vectors AAV6-ADAMTS4 or AAV6-Ctrl showed high and similar long-term transduction efficiencies in the course of 48 days (p ≥ 0.648). The maximum transduction efficiencies were confirmed on day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g002">Fig 2a &amp; 2b</xref>) and the transduction efficiencies of both vectors were steadily weakened between day 8 and 48. They were declined from 98.2% on day 8 to 37.4% on day 48 for AAV6-ADAMTS4 and from 98.0% on day 8 to 37.2% on day 48 for AAV6-Ctrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g002">Fig 2b</xref>). Similarly, the number of transduction units per cell (TU/cell) reached their maximum values on day 8 and their values also monotonically decreased between day 8 and 48 from 611 to 245 TU/cell for AAV6-ADAMTS4 and from 609 to 242 TU/cell for AAV6-Ctrl (p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g003">Fig 3a</xref>). Both vectors did not show any impact on the viability or proliferation rate of NP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g003">Fig 3b</xref>). These results are consistent with the data of our prior publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref037">37</xref>], which indicate that the cloned shRNA sequences had no impact on the transduction efficiencies, transduction units and cell viabilities. During the course of 48 days the transduction efficiencies and number of transduction units were monotonically reduced. Due to the fact that NP cells frequently divide, AAV vector genome got diluted over time in the growing cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g003">Fig 3b</xref>). The dilution of the AAV vector genome was in line with our expectation, as recombinant AAV vectors could remain episomal without integration into chromosome 19 and thus they could possibly get lost during cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref035">35</xref>]. Nonetheless, using AAV6-ADAMTS4 efficient and long-term knockdown of ADAMTS4 was achieved. The knockdown of ADAMTS4 and the enhancement of aggrecan in degenerative NP cells were verified in a period of 48 days by at mRNA and protein levels. The maximum knockdown of ADAMTS4 reached about 88% on day 8 and at the same time the level of aggrecan was enhanced by about 49%. Although the knockdown effect was continuously weakened to about 40% by day 48, it could still improve the level of aggrecan by about 31% (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g004">4a, 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g005">5a and 5b</xref>). Moreover, AAV6-ADAMTS4 mediated knockdown of ADAMTS4 and enhancement of aggrecan showed a direct correlation with the number of transduction units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g005">Fig 5c</xref>). This confirms that frequent determination of transduction units is very important to ensure reproducible results in a long-term functional analysis of recombinant AAV vectors. Furthermore, the AAV6-ADAMTS4 mediated knockdown showed only specific effects on the levels of ADAMTS4 and aggrecan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g006">Fig 6a &amp; 6e</xref>). It had no effect on the expression levels of ADAMTS5, IL-1β, TNF-α and collagen II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172181.g006">Fig 6b, 6c, 6d &amp; 6f</xref>). These results indicated that there were no inflammatory catabolic responses of NP cells to the recombinant vectors AAV6-ADAMTS4 or AAV6-Ctrl.</p>
<p>In this study we focused on the use of scAAV6 for effective and long-term inhibition of ADAMTS4, which is one of the direct and primary degrading agents of aggrecan in the gene family of metalloproteinases. The sites of aggrecan cleavage by ADAMTS4 are known; and the thrombospondin motif of ADAMTS4 is known to be critical for aggrecan substrate recognition and cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref015">15</xref>]. This verifies the direct link between these two genes. Regulation mechanism of ADAMTS4 in degenerative NP cells by the inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) through MAPK and NF-κB signalling is reported [Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref006">6</xref>]. However, additional mechanisms might exist that may affect aggrecan degeneration.</p>
<p>We in fact used a narrow range of patient population to test this technology (12 patients with disc degeneration grade III). We showed in our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172181.ref008">8</xref>] with a larger range of patient population (78 patients with disc degeneration grade III, IV and V) higher levels of ADAMTS4 and lower levels of aggrecan in grade IV and V discs. Certainly, before future <italic>in vivo</italic> application the efficiency of this technology need to be proved additionally in higher degenerated (grade IV and V) disc cells.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> delivery of scAAV vectors could affect the transduction efficiencies due to serotype-specific interactions with the extracellular matrix. This could be a very challenging problem for achieving high transduction efficiencies <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, highly scAAV6-transduced monolayer cultured NP cells could be transferred into 3D culture to maintain their phenotypic character before <italic>in vivo</italic> application. This strategy could probably be an efficient and suitable method for generating large populations of scAAV6 modified NP cells. Such modified NP cells would be used in the future for cell-based regenerative treatment approaches in view of autologous or allogenic disc cell transplantation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this is the first study to analyse a functional application of recombinant scAAV vectors in human IVD research. Recombinant scAAV6 vectors could be used in degenerative NP cells for effective and less immunogenic gene therapeutic approaches. AAV6-ADAMTS4 mediated knockdown of ADAMTS4 could substantially enhance the level of aggrecan, without inducing any toxicity or inflammatory catabolic responses. The effective ADAMTS4 silencing and enhancement of aggrecan that lasted more than six weeks without any inflammatory catabolic response are promising, as IVD disorders usually need prolonged therapeutic periods. However, intervertebral disc degeneration is as an age and genetics dependent molecular degeneration process, which can be accelerated by toxic and biomechanical factors. Collective involvement of these factors can result in structural failures that are often associated with pain. Therefore, combinatorial molecular therapies and physio-medical strategies that improve the biomechanics of the spine could be very useful for future <italic>in vivo</italic> applications.</p>
