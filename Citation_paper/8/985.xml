<abstract>
<p>Crop plants are regularly challenged by a range of environmental stresses which typically retard their growth and ultimately compromise economic yield. The stress response involves the reprogramming of approximately 4% of the transcriptome. Here, the behavior of <italic>AtRD22</italic> and <italic>AtUSPL1</italic>, both members of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> BURP (BNM2, USP, RD22 and polygalacturonase isozyme) domain-containing gene family, has been characterized. Both genes are up-regulated as part of the abscisic acid (ABA) mediated moisture stress response. While <italic>AtRD22</italic> transcript was largely restricted to the leaf, that of <italic>AtUSPL1</italic> was more prevalent in the root. As the loss of function of either gene increased the plant's moisture stress tolerance, the implication was that their products act to suppress the drought stress response. In addition to the known involvement of AtUSPL1 in seed development, a further role in stress tolerance was demonstrated. Based on transcriptomic data and phenotype we concluded that the enhanced moisture stress tolerance of the two loss-of-function mutants is a consequence of an enhanced basal defense response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Abiotic stress factors such as moisture stress, salinity, extreme temperature and variable light intensity can disturb plant metabolism and growth. It has been estimated that crop yield losses due to such stresses lie in the order of 50% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Bray1">[1]</xref>, so increasing the resilience of crop plants will be an important contributor to yield stability. Abiotic stress affects both photosynthesis and photorespiration, as well as having an impact on the energy and redox status of the plant cell. One of the most damaging products of stress is the group of compounds referred to as reactive oxygen species (ROS). The plant response also includes the induced synthesis of certain enzymes and low molecular weight compounds associated with antioxidant activity, redox regulators, chaperones such as heat shock proteins and late embryogenesis abundant proteins, water and ion transporters, the production of compatible osmolytes to maintain cellular water content and the fine tuning of proteolysis involved in programmed cell death. Numerous attempts, with varying levels of success, have been made to genetically engineer the production of some of these components with a view to enhancing abiotic stress tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Sreenivasulu1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in the regulation of expression of many stress-responsive genes, although other stress responsive genes are known to be regulated in an ABA-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Agarwal1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-YamaguchiShinozaki1">[5]</xref>. The regulation of several stress-inducible genes is mediated by the interaction of bZIP transcription factors (ABFs) with ABA-response elements (ABRE) in target gene promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Kasuga1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> gene <italic>RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION22</italic> (<italic>AtRD22</italic>), originally identified as a gene which responded to dehydration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-YamaguchiShinozaki2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-YamaguchiShinozaki3">[8]</xref>, encodes a member of the BURP protein family, members of which share a highly conserved BURP domain at their C terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Hattori1">[9]</xref>), sometimes also referred to as a U domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Baumlein1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Wohlfarth1">[11]</xref>.

The 18 <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> BURP family members fall into five recognizable sub-families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Shao1">[21]</xref>. There are 15 related genes in maize, one of which is specifically expressed in the root cortex parenchyma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Held1">[22]</xref> while the sorghum genome harbors 11 homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Gan1">[23]</xref>.

<title>Automated plant phenotyping and image analysis</title>
<p>After 14 days of pre-cultivation pots (diameter 10 cm) were transferred to an automated phenotyping system composed of a conveyor belt transport system and three imaging chambers for plant imaging in the visible (390–750 nm) and NIR (1400–1510 nm with detection peak at 1452 nm) wavelength ranges as well as capturing fluorescence emission (520–750 nm) as well as a watering and weighing station (LemnaTec 3D Scanalyzer; LemnaTec, GmbH, Aachen, Germany) installed in a climate controlled plant cultivation chamber (environmental conditions: 8 h/16 h night/day, 20/22°C (night/day), relative air humidity of 60% and 240 µmol m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> light intensity). Ten blocks (corresponding to ten biological replicates) with each 15 plants (2×5 genotypes under stress conditions, 1×5 under control conditions) were used. Half of the blocks were placed on opposite sides of the cultivation chamber and pots within one block were randomized in order to account for lane or block effects. For reasons of acclimation, plants were grown under control conditions for another week (till day 21 after sowing) before stress application was started. Automated watering was performed every 2<sup>nd</sup> day to reach defined target values of the pot weight (70% field capacity for control, no watering for soil drought stress). Relative soil water content [%] was controlled in parallel to pot weight with HH2 moisture meter (delta-T devices, Cambridge, UK). The growth rate was calculated as Relative Growth Rate (RGR)  =  (log(LA[tn+1]) - log(LA[tn]))/((tn+1) - tn) following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Poorter1">[38]</xref>; Leaf area (LA), timepoint n (tn).

The microarray experiment and basic data interpretation was performed by ATLAS biolabs GmbH (Berlin, Germany) by GeneChip Operating System (GCOS) 1.4. To ensure reliability of the analyses, each GeneChip experiment was performed with two biological replicates. After logarithmic transformation of the data, the average expression for all experimental samples for this probe set was subtracted from each individual expression value, thus leading to a positive value in case of above-average expression levels and a negative value in case of below-average expression levels. GeneSpring GX software (Agilent) was used to gene-wise normalize the expression data. To identify potentially differentially expressed genes, the fold changes &gt;2 and &lt;2 of expression values were identified. This was done separately for the Col-0 and mutant series at different conditions. For the Col-0 and respective mutant sample, a simple moderated t-test was performed and P values were corrected using the Benjamini and Hochberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Benjamini1">[44]</xref> false discovery rate control, applying standard limma procedures. Differentially expressed genes, between Col-0 and mutant samples were identified for both conditions using the limma nestedF procedure, applying a significance threshold of 0.5 in combination with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate control and a minimal log2-fold change value of 2. A functional categorization of the differentially transcribed genes was derived using Mapman software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Thimm1">[45]</xref>.</p>

<title>The <italic>BURP</italic> gene family</title>
<p>The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome contains five <italic>BURP</italic> family genes; these include both <italic>AtUSPL1 (At1g49320)</italic> and <italic>AtRD22 (At5g25610)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110065-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), but also three genes encoding proteins sharing similarity with the tomato non-catalytic β-subunit of polygalacturonase.

<title>The behavior of <italic>AtRD22</italic> and <italic>AtUSPL1</italic> T-DNA insertion mutants</title>

<title>Detection of plant growth via automated phenotyping</title>

The first significant drought related difference in growth rate was detectable after 7 days without watering (28 DAS, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110065.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).

<p>Plant senescence as consequence of the drought stress was monitored by quantifying the ratio of yellow to green pixels.

<title>Plant growth response to salinity and osmotic stress and exposure to ABA</title>
<p>To further investigate the role of <italic>AtRD22</italic> and <italic>AtUSPL1</italic> during salinity stress and correlating responses on the transcriptional level, wild type and mutant plants were grown on plates with the respective treatments. Two-weeks-old seedlings were transferred for three days to MS basal medium containing one of the following stress inducing compounds: 150 mM and 300 mM NaCl, 100 µM ABA, 4% trehalose, 4% sorbitol, 4% glucose, 4% fructose, 4% sucrose, 300 mM manitol, 15% PEG 6000 and 4% PEG 20000. Although these conditions are artificially mimicking drought, they were chosen to achieve a uniform plant response to the stimulus. When exposed to either 150 mM NaCl or 100 µM ABA, only minor signs of stress symptoms were apparent, but in the former case, the growth of both the wild type and single mutant plants was retarded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110065.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). Wild type and <italic>rd22-1</italic> plants exhibited the least extent of leaf bleaching, while the double mutant and particularly the <italic>uspl1</italic> single mutant, were more visibly affected. Exposure to the various sugars had only a mild effect on plant growth, but a general tendency was for the mutant plants to be more vigorous than the wild type ones.

<title>Chlorophyll and pheophytin content</title>
<p>After a four day exposure to moisture stress, the quantity of chlorophyll a and b in the <italic>rd22-1</italic> mutant and the double mutant leaves was less than that in non-stressed plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110065.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). Since the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b were strongly correlated with one another, subsequent measurements considered the total chlorophyll content. Pheophytin is a degradation product of chlorophyll, that accumulates during senescence, dark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Schelbert1">[50]</xref> and salt stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Santos1">[51]</xref>. In plants grown in the presence of 300 mM NaCl, the content of chlorophyll (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110065-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) fell sharply, while that of pheophytin rose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110065-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However when challenged by a lesser level of stress (100 µM ABA or 150 mM NaCl), while the chlorophyll content was reduced, there was no measurable increase in pheophytin content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110065-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Chlorophyll content in the <italic>rd22-1</italic> and <italic>uspl1</italic> mutants was more severely reduced in the presence of either 150 mM NaCl or 100 µM ABA. The <italic>uspl1</italic> mutant was the most compromised genotype with respect to chlorophyll content when the medium was supplemented with fructose, while the <italic>rd22-1</italic> and the double mutant plants out-performed the wild type and <italic>uspl1</italic> mutant plants when the stress was imparted by PEG. To clearly indicate this different chlorophyll degradation in the <italic>rd22-1</italic> single and double mutant plants the amount [%] of total clorophyll is indicated relative to the amount of clorophyll at control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110065-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Compared to the amount of chlorophyll under control conditions the <italic>rd22-1</italic> and <italic>uspl1</italic> mutant plants show the strongest reduction upon 150 mM NaCl and 100 µM ABA. In addition, the reduction of chlorophyll in the <italic>uspl1</italic> mutant with fructose show a major difference compared to the other genotypes. In the <italic>rd22-1</italic> and <italic>rd22-1/uspl1</italic> mutant plants the amount of chlorophyll is higher on fructose, 150 mM NaCl and PEG supplemented media compared to the wild type and <italic>uspl1</italic> mutant plants. Taken into account that the chlorophyll content in the mutant in the unstressed condition varies from the wild type a relative value is indicated to show the change due to the treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110065.s006">Figure S6B</xref>).</p>

<title>RD22 and USPL1 have suppressor function during drought stress</title>
<p><italic>AtRD22</italic> and <italic>AtUSPL1</italic> were transcribed predominantly in, respectively, the leaf and the root. The induction of both genes by moisture stress generated a slight growth reduction. While the induction by moisture stress of <italic>AtRD22</italic> has been noted previously, this was not the case for <italic>AtUSPL1</italic>, most likely due to a concentration on the short-term stress response. Microarray-based transcriptomic analyses have shown that exposure to either NaCl or trehalose induces not only the up-regulation of salinity, trehalose and moisture stress responsive genes, but also the down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes. The latter is implied by both the induction of leaf chlorosis and senescence and the measured fall in the chlorophyll content of the leaves of stressed plants. The present data confirmed that both salinity and trehalose activate the ABA-mediated moisture stress response. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Barrero1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Rosado1">[58]</xref>. The sole <italic>BURP</italic> gene family to be up- regulated in the aerial part of the plant was <italic>AtRD22,</italic> consistent with observations based on the expression of the transgene <italic>pAtRD22::GUS</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Iwasaki1">[26]</xref>. The root specificity of <italic>AtUSPL1</italic> expression was confirmed both by the behavior of the <italic>pAtUSPL1::GUS</italic> transgene and by Northern hybridization experiments.</p>
<p>The T-DNA insertion mutants of both <italic>AtRD22</italic> and <italic>AtUSPL1</italic> produced no detectable relevant transcript, so each was taken as a genuine loss-of- function allele. In both cases, a reduced photosynthesis phenotype was exhibited, as reflected by a fall in both chlorophyll content under non-stressed growing conditions and photosynthesis-associated gene transcript abundance in stressed plants. Both under prolonged moisture stress mimicking conditions and actual moisture stress, stress tolerance was enhanced in all of the mutants. The mutants' performance (and particularly that of the double mutant), as measured by either the development of leaf area or by the rate of leaf tissue senescence, showed that they were more tolerant of moisture stress than were wild type plants. NIR intensity appeared to reliably reflect relative water content, which was higher in each of the mutants than in wild type.</p>
<p>Given that photosynthesis is clearly compromised by moisture stress, it was not surprising that the transcription of several photosynthesis-associated genes was altered when the plants were exposed to moisture stress. Although the mutant plants' transcriptomes were indistinguishable from that of the wild type with respect to photosynthesis-related genes, nevertheless their leaves contained less chlorophyll than the leaves of wild type plants raised under non-stressed conditions. The reduction in chlorophyll content in the mutants induced by exposure to either NaCl or PEG was less severe than that in wild type plants. Notably, under moisture stress conditions, the leaves of double mutant plants retained more chlorophyll than those of wild type ones. The retention of chlorophyll can be expected to support a higher rate of photosynthesis, so that less transpiration is required to generate a given quantity of assimilate. Since the plant's capacity to retain its water is improved, its water content under moisture stress conditions was greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110065-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>The observed up-regulation of peroxidase encoding genes in the mutants suggested a secondary effect of the loss-of-function mutations. The transcriptomic data implied that the oxidative state within the mutant plants differed from that within the wild type, with a knock-on effect on gene expression in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Shinozaki1">[59]</xref>. Both the phenotype of the mutants as well as the transcriptional response of both genes suggested that under moisture stress conditions, their products exerted a suppressor function. Similar conclusions have been drawn regarding the effect of mutations of genes encoding SnRK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Fujii1">[60]</xref> the effect of which is an almost complete abolition of the ABA response. In particular, <italic>AtRD22</italic> is not transcribed in these mutants when the growing medium is supplemented with ABA reflecting moisture stress condition. Under normal growing conditions, the <italic>SnRK2</italic> mutants exhibit reduced growth, which (along with plant survival) is improved by the addition of ABA to the growing medium. The inference is that the BURP domain containing proteins AtRD22 and AtUSPL1 act as suppressors of the ABA-mediated moisture stress response.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>RD22 act as suppressor predominantly in the leaf, while USPL1 act in the root</title>
<p>Although both <italic>AtRD22</italic> and <italic>AtUSPL1</italic> exhibited organ-specific transcription, the loss of function of each gene induced a comparable improvement in the plant's tolerance to moisture stress, at least at the level of the vigour of the leaves. The sensitivity of the microarray platform rules out any trans-silencing effects of either T-DNA insertion on other members of the BURP gene family. Since this sort of silencing has been associated with several T-DNA insertion mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Daxinger1">[61]</xref>, the assumption is that both <italic>AtRD22</italic> and <italic>AtUSP1</italic> are involved in a holistic moisture stress response. The microarray analysis demonstrated that the two loss-of-function mutations resulted in the induction of a partially overlapping set of genes in the aerial part of the plant, even though <italic>AtUSPL1</italic> was transcribed specifically in the root. Not only was the tolerance of moisture stress enhanced in both mutants, but also their chlorophyll content was reduced. As the lack of <italic>AtRD22</italic> and <italic>AtUSP1</italic> led to an enhanced tolerance to moisture stress, the proposed suppressor function of the BURP domain-containing proteins during an episode of moisture stress includes an organ-specific component. Both proteins are part of an ABA mediated moisture stress response pathway, with AtRD22 functioning mainly in the aerial part of the plant and AtUSPL1 in the root.</p>

<title>Increased drought resistance might be correlated to an increased defence gene response</title>
<p>The transcriptomic analysis of the two mutants revealed an increased transcript abundance compared to the wild type levels with respect to various genes associated with the response to biotic stress (for example, the gene <italic>PDF1.2</italic> was up-regulated by nearly 50 fold). This class of genes was differentially transcribed both under non-stressed and moisture stressed conditions. Several peroxidase encoding genes were also up-regulated. Peroxidases are known to represent an integral component of the plant's hypersensitive response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Almagro1">[62]</xref>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is also known as signal molecule during the stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Desikan1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Hancock1">[64]</xref>. A loss of control over the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> might result in the described reduction of chlorophyll content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Kar1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Hynninen1">[66]</xref> and increased water content under drought stress conditions. Such regulation would subsequently lead to better performance of the mutant plants under drought stress.</p>
<p>The up-regulation of peroxidase encoding genes implies a level of linkage between the ABA-mediated moisture stress response and defense against pathogen invasion. Such a connection has been proposed in a suggested model for the function of OCP3, a homeodomain transcription factor. The loss of <italic>OCP3</italic> function results in an enhanced tolerance to moisture stress and at the same time an increased sensitivity to ABA. The abundance of <italic>AtRD22</italic> transcript in the <italic>ocp3</italic> mutant is not different to that in the wild type, and the plant's susceptibility to <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> infection is reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Ramirez1">[67]</xref>. The <italic>ocp3</italic> mutant was initially identified and named after the phenotype of constitutive over expression of a cationic peroxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Coego1">[68]</xref>. Here, <italic>AtOCP3</italic> was marginally down regulated when the plants were challenged by NaCl, but there was no transcriptional difference between wild type and either of the two mutants. The implication is that the BURP-containing proteins act to enhance the plant's moisture stress response via the up-regulation of peroxidase encoding genes. In soybean, a direct interaction between RD22 and cell wall-localized peroxidases has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Wang3">[69]</xref>. The up- regulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> detoxifying enzymes enhances moisture stress tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Miao1">[70]</xref> as well as explaining the link with the pathogen defense response.</p>
<p>A reduced chlorophyll content, in conjunction with an elevated level of transcription of defense response genes under non-stressed growing conditions, suggests that the mutant plants are primed to mount a stronger and/or more rapid set of measures to prevent the accumulation of ROS. A change in the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> would not only have an impact on the defense response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Mullineaux1">[71]</xref>, but also on the response to moisture stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Desikan1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0110065-Neill1">[72]</xref>. Due to the overall elevated expression of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-detoxifying enzymes such responses could be limited, leading to an enhanced drought resistance. Our study provides the first functional approach to investigate <italic>BURP-</italic>domain encoding gene function in addition to the previously published structural comparisons.</p>
