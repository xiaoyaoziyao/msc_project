<abstract>
<p>Working memory plays a key role in cognition, and yet its mechanisms remain much debated. Human performance on memory tasks is severely limited; however, the two major classes of theory explaining the limits leave open questions about key issues such as how multiple simultaneously-represented items can be distinguished. We propose a palimpsest model, with the occurrent activity of a single population of neurons coding for several multi-featured items. Using a probabilistic approach to storage and recall, we show how this model can account for many qualitative aspects of existing experimental data. In our account, the underlying nature of a memory item depends entirely on the characteristics of the population representation, and we provide analytical and numerical insights into critical issues such as multiplicity and binding. We consider representations in which information about individual feature values is partially separate from the information about binding that creates single items out of multiple features. An appropriate balance between these two types of information is required to capture fully the different types of error seen in human experimental data. Our model provides the first principled account of misbinding errors. We also suggest a specific set of stimuli designed to elucidate the representations that subjects actually employ.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Humans can remember several visual items for a few seconds and recall them; however, performance deteriorates surprisingly quickly with the number of items that must be stored. Along with increasingly inaccurate recollection, subjects make association errors, sometimes apparently recalling the wrong item altogether. No current model accounts for these data fully. We discuss a simple model that focuses attention on the population representations that are putatively involved, and thereby on limits to the amount of information that can be stored and recalled. We use theoretical and numerical methods to examine the characteristics and performance of our model.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to store information about the world and use it at a later time is a critical aspect of human cognition, and comes in many different forms. One such is visual short term memory, which holds visual information for brief intervals, for example to make a decision or complete a task. Since it is important in many contexts, it has been the subject of a wealth of psychophysical and neurophysiological investigations, and offers constraints on coding and representation as well as on pure storage.</p>
<p>Here, we consider a paradigmatic visual short-term memory experiment from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref001">1</xref>] which is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g001">Fig. 1A</xref>. Subjects were presented with an array of oriented coloured bars. After a short presentation time, the array was removed and one of the coloured bars was re-presented at a random orientation. The subjects had to rotate the bar back to its previously presented orientation (the target orientation) from memory. Thus multiple items must be stored, each having two features (colour and orientation). One such feature is cued (here colour), and the associated other feature (orientation) had to be recalled.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) The experimental paradigm. First, an array of items was shown for 1000ms, followed by a 1000ms blank screen. Next, a probe with the colour of one of the items in the array was presented, but at a random orientation. Subjects had to adjust the orientation of the probe item to match that of the relevant item in the original array. (<bold>B</bold>) Graphical model of the storage process. Several items <italic>i</italic>, each composed of two features (here, orientation <italic>ϕ<sub>i</sub></italic> and colour <italic>ψ<sub>i</sub></italic>), eliciting individual responses <bold>x<sub>i</sub></bold> in a neuronal population code, are combined together additively to form a final memory state <bold>y<sub>N</sub></bold>.</p>

<p>As one might expect, the mean precision of recall (typically defined as the inverse of the standard deviation of the errors) decreases with the number of items, and does so smoothly. However, along with small deviations from the target orientation, subjects can sometimes make large errors. This effect has historically been explained by considering that memory can only store a small number of items, in a finite number of “slots” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref005">5</xref>]. Items not allocated a slot cannot be recalled even approximately, and so are assumed to be guessed (leading to large errors). The number of slots has been estimated to be fairly low for most individuals (∼4 items), although it can be expanded significantly by explicit training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>More recently, several groups have proposed alternative mechanisms for storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref011">11</xref>] based on the metaphor of a divisible, but limited resource. This resource is allocated amongst all the items that are stored, rather than only some being remembered at all. However, as more items are stored, each receives less of the resource, hence decreasing the precision of storage and/or recall.</p>
<p>One key battleground for this debate has been the observation of characteristic, so-called misbinding errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref012">12</xref>]. These arise when subjects recall the orientation of another item with which they are presented (that of a “non-target”) instead of that of the target. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g002">Fig. 2</xref>, reanalysed from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref007">7</xref>] shows this for a task in which colour had to be recalled based on a cued location (items did not have an orientation in this task). On the upper row, the distribution of errors around the correct target colour is shown; each plot is for a different number <italic>N</italic> of items in the array. The responses are distributed around the correct target colour, with a dispersion increasing with <italic>N</italic>. A characteristic baseline error level, increasing with set size, is also visible. This uniform baseline has been interpreted as the signature of guessing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref005">5</xref>]. The lower row of graphs shows how this dispersion hides misbinding, by indicating the distributions of deviations between the response and all other non-target items. The presence of a significantly higher proportion of small such deviations is a sign of responses incorrectly reporting other non-target items. We measured the significance using a resampling procedure (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Methods</xref> and the Misbinding errors section for details) that ensure that the effect is not just due to the increased probability of being close to an item when their overall number increases; rather, it arises from biases in the recall process.</p>

Any bias towards 0 indicates misbinding. Error bars show one standard error of the mean, for 8 subjects. A resampling-based estimation of the probability of misbinding error was performed, and the p-value for a non-zero non-target response component is shown for N = 2, 4 and 6. Misbinding errors are significantly present in all conditions. See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Methods</xref> for a description of the resampling analysis.

<p>Finite resource models provide a more natural account of misbinding than classical slot models. This is because all items are stored to some fidelity, making it possible that subjects recall the wrong item in some circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref013">13</xref>]. However, a formal theory of these circumstances is presently lacking.</p>
<p>Further, although resource models have been successful in explaining psychophysical data, there is as yet no canonical implementation, or agreement about what exactly is the limited resource. One suggestion is that it is the total number of spikes available in a population of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref015">15</xref>], using normalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref016">16</xref>] or by otherwise limiting the number of bits available to store the items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref017">17</xref>]. However, accounts based on versions of this solve in a rather unusual way the problem of “multiplicity”, i.e., when multiple items need to be represented simultaneously. That is, they typically employ distinct and separable storage for each possible item (i.e., effectively an unbounded number of slots), with the competition coming from restricting the total amount of activation across all storage units. This leaves unclear the mechanics of allocation of these distinct pools, which is key to misbinding.</p>
<p>Here, we consider a different model in which a single set of storage units is employed, with different items being overlaid, as in a palimpsest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref021">21</xref>]. A conventional palimpsest is a manuscript which has been partly scraped-off or cleaned before being written upon again, allowing past inscriptions to be recovered along with the most recent content. Similarly, we consider the case where multiple items are written on top of each other in the same neuronal population. For a paradigm in which items are presented sequentially, partial erasure would occur between each presentations. However, for the sake of simplicity, here we only consider paradigms in which all items are presented simultaneously, and so without erasure of the palimpsest in between. We will refer to this as a restricted palimpsest storage process. Depending on the representations used and how patterns decay and combine, the final memory state of the neuronal population will retain a trace of all items that have been written onto it. From this final memory state, we then consider a Bayesian probabilistic recall process starting from the cued feature, mimicking the experimental paradigm presented above.</p>
<p>Recall performance in our model depends sensitively on the representation used to store different items in the memory. We consider two specific examples that we call “mixed” and “hierarchical”. These are intended as paradigm cases of a wider range of possibilities, rather than be fully comprehensive; we analyse their characteristics empirically and theoretically. One particularly important aspect for both codes is the balance between allocating units to storing information about individual feature values, and storing binding information to link each item’s features together. This translates, through the medium of probabilistic recall, into a balance between two of the types of experimentally observed error mentioned above: the small displacements from the target item, and the more theoretically elusive misbinding, here rendered as a (slightly displaced) recall of one of the non-target stored items. The third type of random guessing errors also arise in the model via probabilistic recall, even though all items are actually stored. The relative frequencies of these errors varies with the nature of the population code and the number of items stored.</p>
<p>A classical way to quantify the quality of population codes is the Fisher information (FI). The FI cannot be used to capture the frequency of misbinding—we therefore provide a thorough empirical characterization of the model’s production of this sort of error. However, the FI does correctly determine the width of the distribution of responses around either target or non-target items—the displacements mentioned above.</p>
<p>We show how it may be possible to distinguish between particular population codes based on available experimental data, and so propose new experiments that focus on the interplay between simultaneously-stored stimuli, which could shed light on how items interact in human working memory. Note that the goals of this paper are to introduce and explore population palimpsest memories rather than to fit psychophysical data in quantitative detail.</p>
<p>We start by presenting the three key facets of our model: representation, storage and recall. We consider its empirical and theoretical properties, relative respectively to data from existing visual short-term memory experiments and to the Fisher information, which characterizes memory fidelity. This raises the complex issue of misbinding, which we treat in some detail, for both a classical feature-based representation, and a hierarchical representation that we then describe. Finally, we consider specific arrangements of targets in the space of possible memories that are expected to lead to patterns of errors that can help distinguish between different representations.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We propose a model of representation, storage and recall in visual working memory. By considering all aspects together, we show how to accommodate a range of experimental findings with a small set of assumptions. To be concrete, we consider the experimental paradigm shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g001">Fig. 1A</xref> (based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref001">1</xref>]), and described above. Here, each item is determined by two features: angle and colour, both of which are taken as being angular (as the latter can be encoded as an angle on a colour wheel).</p>
<sec id="sec002a">
<title>Representation</title>
<p>Consider the case of a population of <italic>M</italic> units representing the memory of all items seen in a trial. The simultaneous population activity of these units is read during recall to infer the feature of the item of interest. The finiteness of the population, the nature of the representation employed and the influence of noise jointly constitute the limited resource associated with our memory.</p>
<p>In terms of the representation, we assume that units have continuous firing rates, and are tuned to specific combinations of features. Unit <italic>i</italic> has a preferred angle and colour, with separate tuning widths to each feature, and its mean activity follows a Von Mises curve as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004003.e001">Equation (1)</xref>. We use Bivariate Von Mises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref023">23</xref>] tuning curves as they provide a convenient parametrisation of the sensitivity to a pair of angular features.</p>

<p>Depending on the distribution of <italic>τ</italic><sub>1,<italic>m</italic></sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>2,<italic>m</italic></sub>, several types of population code can be generated (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g010">10</xref>). <italic>τ</italic><sub>1,<italic>m</italic></sub> = <italic>τ</italic><sub>2,<italic>m</italic></sub> = <italic>τ</italic> ∀<italic>i</italic> corresponds to a “conjunctive” population code, in which each unit is sensitive to a combination of the two features. Conversely, a “feature” population code employs two subpopulations; one has <italic>τ</italic><sub>1,<italic>m</italic></sub> = <italic>τ</italic>,<italic>τ</italic><sub>2,<italic>m</italic></sub> = 0, and is sensitive only to the first feature; the other has <italic>τ</italic><sub>1,<italic>m</italic></sub> = 0,<italic>τ</italic><sub>2,<italic>m</italic></sub> = <italic>τ</italic>, and is only sensitive to the second. We also consider a “mixed” population code including both conjunctive and feature units, and entertain various possibilities for the relative proportions of the two types. This “mixed” population code provides an easy way to parametrise the relative information required to store feature values accurately (these are mostly encoded in the feature sub-population) versus the binding information required to link features together into item-like representations (only encoded by the conjunctive sub-population). Moreover, the different types of population code will require different number of neurons to cover the entire stimulus space appropriately. This will become increasingly important as the number of features increases.</p>

<title>Storage and recall process</title>
<p>According to our restricted palimpsest memory process (“restricted”, because, as mentioned in the introduction, we do not assume erasure of the palimpsest between storage steps), the noisy population activities associated with all the items are simply summed to produce the final memory. As can be expected, the characteristics of the representation used will determine how readily possible it is to extract items when they are overlaid.</p>
<p>The storage process is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, in which <italic>N</italic> items are stored simultaneously. Again, for simplicity, assuming that the final memory suffers from spherical Gaussian noise, we derive:

<p>Having produced this final memory state, the next step is to recall the correct feature based on the recall cue. Bayes optimal recall would require marginalising over the non-target items that were simultaneously presented. Given the final memory state <bold>y<sub>N</sub></bold>, and a cued feature value (e.g. a colour <italic>ψ</italic>), this would lead to the posterior distribution over the value of the other feature of this item. However, this marginalisation would be computationally penal, since it would likely require explicitly representing and processing all the non-cued items. Instead, we make the simplifying assumption that only the item to be recalled is explicitly modelled, with the non-targets being collapsed together and treated as background noise. Conceptually, this corresponds to extracting a specific item of interest out of irrelevant noise. This approach was adopted by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref025">25</xref>], in the context of retrieval from long-term memory in multistate synapses.</p>
<p>The algorithm is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g004">Fig. 4</xref>. Given a memory state <bold>y<sub>N</sub></bold> and the cued colour <italic>ψ</italic>, we compute the posterior distribution over <italic>ϕ</italic> explicitly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). No closed-form solution exists for this posterior in general, because of the non-linear transform associated with the population code <italic><bold>μ</bold></italic>(⋅). Therefore we sample from it using slice sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref026">26</xref>]. We treat a single sample as the output of recalling a feature from our model for this trial. The use of sampling instead of a maximum likelihood (or MAP) solution has two main consequences: the variance of the posterior has a direct effect on the variance of the recalled orientation, and multi-modal posteriors will reflect situations in which another orientation may be reported in place of the appropriate one.</p>
<p>We formalize this process by writing <bold>m<sub>N–1</sub></bold> as the contribution of the noise process to the mean of the final memory state and Σ<sub><bold>N</bold></sub> as the contribution of the noise to the full memory covariance, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g004">Fig. 4C</xref>. <italic>r</italic> is the index of the item to be recalled, which we integrate over, as it is unknown during recall.</p>

<p>This posterior is usually peaked around the appropriate orientation; however, depending on the population code used and the number of stored memories, additional modes can appear (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, middle and right). These correspond to the effects of noise and other items on the recall of the item of interest; the latter allows us to study the question of binding.</p>
<p>We now consider various characteristics of our models in the context of visual short-term memory experiments.</p>

<sec id="sec002c">
<title>Modelling visual working memory experiments</title>
<p>First, the model reproduces the baseline, apparently uniform, component of the distribution of errors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g005">Fig. 5</xref> upper row, compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g002">Fig. 2</xref>). However, this does not arise from pure random guessing. Rather, a sample is always taken from the posterior distribution given a memory state composed after storing all items. Nevertheless, interactions between items and the overall background noise in the memory imply that the model sometimes samples values away from the target, so producing output resembling guessing. On the lower row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g005">Fig. 5</xref>, we see that our model can also reproduce misbinding errors, shown by the over-abundance of small errors towards non-target items values during recall. This central tendency is reduced compared to the experimental data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, but is still significantly present. In addition, the magenta curve and penumbra represent the distribution of samples from the model when inter-items correlations have been removed.</p>

<p>The second experimental observation captured by the model is the decrease in recall precision as a function of the set size, which is the number of stored items. Here we study the precision of recall using the procedure defined by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref007">7</xref>]. This involves fitting a mixture of Von Mises components on the recall samples, using a procedure based on the EM algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref027">27</xref>]. This mixture model consists of one Von Mises component per item (target or non-target) and a uniform random component. All Von Mises components share a single concentration parameter <italic>κ</italic>. This mixture model approach turns out to be substantially more robust to outliers than computing the circular standard deviation of the raw errors directly. We refer to <italic>κ</italic> as the memory fidelity, and show how it depends on set size. In addition to this memory fidelity, two other types of errors are specifically captured by this analysis: misbinding errors, the probability of recalling from a non-target, and random errors, the probability of recalling from the uniform random component. These will be analysed more thoroughly in the Misbinding errors section.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g006">Fig. 6</xref> shows the fit of our model (in green) to human data (dark blue) from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref013">13</xref>], where we report the memory fidelity. The shaded region indicates one standard deviation, computed over multiple reruns of the model (or across different subjects for the human data). The smooth decay in performance as set size increases is appropriately captured by our model. This decay arises in our model from the increase in recall noise as the number of stored items increases, but also from interference between items in the memory. We report in both cases the memory fidelity, the concentration <italic>κ</italic> of the Von Mises component obtained from fitting the mixture model on the responses from human subjects and our model. Here, we used a mixed population code, optimizing the fit to the experimental curve by adjusting the ratio of conjunctive to feature units and the encoding noise <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, for a population of <italic>M</italic> = 200 units (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Methods</xref> for the optimisation procedure). The model does not capture the reduced decay rate for 4 and 6 items to its full extent. However, this is a rather specific characteristic of this dataset. For comparison, the inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g006">Fig. 6</xref> shows the fit of our model to the data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref001">1</xref>].

<title>Fisher information analysis</title>
<p>A common theoretical technique used to study the representational capacity of a population code is the Fisher information (FI), which, via the Cramer-Rao lower bound, limits the precision of any estimator based on the output of the code [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref030">30</xref>]. If the posterior distribution in our model can be well approximated as being Gaussian, the FI will accurately characterize memory fidelity, allowing us to examine the effects of different parameters and representations.</p>
<p>In our case, the FI should readily be able to characterise the spread of the errors around the correct target value when a single item is stored (when there is sufficient signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref032">32</xref>]). In this section (and the Supplementary information), we study this case.</p>
<p>When there are multiple items, complexity arises from the fact that errors are distributed around both the target feature value and misbound, non-target, features, with the posterior distribution being multi-modal (and therefore not Gaussian). Nevertheless, as we will see in the next section, the Fisher information, calculated assuming storage of just a single item, can still characterise the memory fidelity around each mode.</p>
<p>Assuming a population code with Gaussian noise and signal-independent noise, the Fisher information is defined as follows:

<p>We see that they are all similar on average; the most important being the match between samples from our model and the Fisher information analysis.</p>
<p>When more than one item is stored, errors arise from two sources: variance around a mode, and mistakenly reporting the wrong mode (misbinding error). One can adapt the Fisher information analysis to characterize the former, capturing the variability about each mode, conditioned on the fact that the posterior is close to Gaussian. However, it does not capture the component of variance coming from misbinding errors. Further analysis that quantifies both sources of variability will be required to account in a theoretical manner for the full distribution of errors observed in the data.</p>

<title>Misbinding errors</title>
<p>As noted above, several groups have shown that a significant proportion of the errors made by humans can be explained as arising from “misbinding”, i.e., recalling (at least approximately) the appropriate feature of an inappropriate item, i.e., of a non-target item that also formed part of the array. Such mistakes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, and could contribute to the appearance of a baseline of errors seen in experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), since these stimuli are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution across all possible angles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The proportion of errors classified as misbinding varies between experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref036">36</xref>]. Although some studies seem to show none at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref037">37</xref>]; in others, they are reported as making up to 30% of all errors when the memory load is high. Misbinding has not been well addressed in the theoretical literature on visual working memory, since current models typically assume distinct subpopulations storing the different items, hence removing any possibility for direct misbinding errors.</p>
<p>Our model uses a single population of units for storage, and so can account for misbinding when the posterior distribution (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004003.e007">Equation 6</xref>) becomes multimodal. This usually happens when there is insufficient information in the representation of items to bind the features together (i.e., when the codes are insufficiently conjunctive); the different modes arise from the different items that are stored. The relative heights of the modes of the posterior determine the frequency of misbinding errors. The classical conjunctive population code represents one extreme, offering near perfect binding information, being limited only by the size of each unit’s receptive field. Feature-based population codes, on the other hand, constitute the other extreme: they do not perform binding at all.</p>
<p>For a mixed population code, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g008">Fig. 8</xref> shows that the proportion of conjunctive units has a strong effect on misbinding errors and posterior multimodality. We construct a situation with two possible angles, <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004003.e011"><mml:math id="M11" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004003.e012"><mml:math id="M12" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is to be recalled. In this case, using a mixed population code with around 40% of conjunctive units dramatically reduces the number of misbinding errors produced by the model. This proportion will depend on the number of items to be stored, as more items will require more precise binding information.</p>

However, feature units improve the localization; as their number decreases, the widths of the posterior modes increases. <bold>Right</bold>: Distribution of 1000 sampled responses, showing how misbinding errors tend to disappear when sufficient conjunctive information is available.

<p>The widths of the posterior modes depend directly on the amount of information provided by feature and conjunctive units. Feature units are more efficient than conjunctive units at representing single features, and so the cost of reducing misbinding by increasing the proportion of conjunctive units is to increase the width of the posterior over the recalled feature. This can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g009">Fig. 9</xref>, where we fitted the mixture model presented in the Modelling visual working memory experiments section to the recall samples, we report the concentration (an inverse width) of the Von Mises component in panel A, and the mixture proportions in panel B.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g009">Fig. 9A</xref> confirms the relationships of the width of the posterior mode with the proportion of conjunctive units. The concentration of the Von Mises component (in blue), closely follows the theoretical Fisher information (in green), although overestimating it. The Fisher information provides a good local estimate of the variability around a mode, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g008">Fig. 8</xref> on the right, where we overlap in red a Von Mises PDF with a concentration predicted from the Fisher information (with a height set to be aligned with the histogram of the right mode).</p>
<p>The mixture proportions corresponding to the target, non-target and random responses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g009">Fig. 9B</xref> as a function of the fraction of conjunctive units. They show that for around 50% or more conjunctive units, more than 75% of responses are on target. The mixture proportion associated with the random component appears to be overestimated, compared visually to the distribution of the samples of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g008">Fig. 8</xref>. However, the mixture model well characterizes the proportion of misbinding errors.</p>
<p>Finally, as a last check, we verified that the mixture model estimates of non-target proportions were reliable. To do this, we performed a resampling-based analysis of the mixture of non-target responses, by randomizing the assumed locations of non-target angles and re-fitting the mixture model. Using the empirical cumulative distribution over those samples, we could then compute a p-value for the null hypothesis that the mixture probability for non-target would be zero. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g009">Fig. 9C</xref>, where the p-values as a function of the proportion of conjunctive units in the mixed population code are reported. For proportions of conjunctive units below 70%, the null hypothesis can be rejected significantly (at a 5% level), consistent with the presence of misbinding errors.</p>
<p>We applied this resampling analysis to the human experimental data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g002">Fig. 2</xref>, as well as to our model’s fit to these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The p-values for the data collapsed across subjects are shown above the histograms of biases towards non-target angles; they all are significant. Redoing the analysis per subject indicates that for 2 items, 8 out of 12 subjects show significant misbinding errors; for 4 items, 7 out of 12 are significant; and finally for, 6 items 10 out of 12 subjects show misbinding errors.</p>

<p>Such an hierarchical code can be considered an abstract representation of a layered neural architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>The “mixed” and “hierarchical” population codes were specifically introduced to parametrise subtly different forms of binding, controlled by the ratio of binding to non-binding units. In the “mixed” population code, conjunctive units introduce binding information independently from the rest of the feature units. In the “hierarchical” population code, the random layer two units bind together the activity of layer one units, generating seemingly arbitrary combinations of feature values, yet providing sufficient conjunctive information. It allows us to check how structured the binding information should be for the results to hold.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g011">Fig. 11</xref> shows the behaviour of recall for a hierarchical population code based on a feature population code at the lower layer. The total number of units was fixed (at <italic>M</italic> = 200); the ratio of upper to lower units was varied. The optimal arrangement changes markedly when multiple items must be stored. Having few random binding units is very efficient in the single item case, but this breaks down completely when multiple items are stored and interfere with each other. The dependence of the memory fidelity on the ratio of upper to lower units is similar for increasing number of items, with the exception of the overall scale. Unsurprisingly, memory fidelity is lower when increasing the number of items and conjunctivity, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g011">Fig. 11A</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g011">Fig. 11B</xref>, the probability of the response being related to the correct target changes completely going from one to many items, with non-target responses becoming prevalent for small ratios of upper to lower units. Moreover, there is an optimal ratio of upper to lower units when storing multiple items, if one tries to optimise the proportion of correct target angle recall.</p>

<title>Effects on experimental data fits</title>
<p>The patterns of errors arising from specific choices of population codes can be used to help discriminate between different representations. Misbinding, which we quantify via the mixture model approach of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref007">7</xref>], is of particular value, since, as observed, it is rare for conjunctive codes; but ubiquitous for feature codes. We therefore compare the misbinding exhibited by human subjects with the output of our model based on different population codes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Methods</xref> for details about the optimisation).</p>
<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g013">Fig. 13</xref>, there are clear differences in the mixture weights associated with misbinding errors, errors arising from local deviations from the correct feature to be recalled, and the uniform component.</p>

<p>As expected, the feature code makes a large number of misbinding errors when more than one item is stored. On the other hand, the conjunctive code makes only a few errors that appear to arise from random guesses. Misbinding errors are highly unlikely in this configuration. In total, a mixed code provides a better fit to the human data, matching the increase in non-target responses as well as a baseline random response rate.</p>

<title>The canary</title>
<p>This analysis suggests that stimuli specifically designed to induce patterns of misbinding could be useful for understanding representations in population codes. Consider three stimuli, arranged on a diagonal, separated by a variable distance in feature-space (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g014">Fig. 14</xref>). These create clear interference patterns for feature codes, with multi-modal posteriors and misbinding errors. These errors will be expected to change as a function of the characteristics of the population code. We therefore call this stimuli pattern the “canary” in honour of its capacity to reveal such characteristics.</p>

</fig>
<p>In particular, by making the stimuli close to each other in feature space, this pattern allows intra-receptive field misbinding to be examined. This happens when the pattern lies entirely in a single receptive field of a conjunctive unit, and can thus provide a somewhat crude and indirect measure of the receptive field size of a mixed conjunctive code. Note, though, that hierarchical conjunctive codes cannot be expected to have such a simple signature; and indeed even mixed codes are ultimately likely to be multi-scale in character.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g015">Fig. 15</xref> (left panels), we show what happens for a mixed population codes. We report how the parameters of the mixture model we considered before vary with conjunctivity in several conditions, using a population code of 200 units, and allowing the ratio of conjunctive to feature units to vary from 0 to 1 (corresponding to full-feature and full-conjunctive, respectively). We set the item noise <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> = 0.25, a level compatible with experimental data fits, and show two characteristic distances between stimuli, Δ<italic>x</italic> = {0.22,1} rad. The goal is to recall one of the three items, randomly chosen on different trials. We characterize the errors using the mixture model presented before and report the mixture proportions and the fitted <italic>κ</italic> from the Von Mises component.</p>

</fig>
<p>For the large separation, Δ<italic>x</italic> = 1.0, the mixed population code behaves in a regular manner as the degree of conjunctivity increases. For a feature-based population, recall suffers from much misbinding; it is only when more than 50% of the units are conjunctive that correct binding typically occurs. The mixed population code increases rapidly at around 70% of conjunctive units and saturates.</p>
<p>The outcome is quite different for the small separation Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0.2. In this case, no amount of conjunctivity can help the discrimination between the three stimuli. This corresponds to a situation in which intra-receptive field misbinding occurs. Even for a fully conjunctive population code, the size of the receptive field is larger than the distance between two items (<italic>M</italic> = 200, <italic>τ</italic> = 5.5 ⇒ width of 0.44 <italic>rad</italic> for one standard deviation of a receptive field).</p>
<p>For the single-scale receptive fields that we employed to create the mixed population code, it is possible to recover the scale from the error patterns as a function of the separation between the stimuli. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g016">Fig. 16</xref> for two mixed population, with 50% and 98% of conjunctive units. This plots the target (blue) and non-target (green) mixture probabilities (normalized by their joint sum). These start at the same value, but diverge after the point when conjunctive information becomes available and hence when intra-receptive field misbinding become less prevalent. The black vertical dotted line indicates half the size of the receptive field for the conjunctive subpopulation—misbindings stop being prevalent once the stimuli covers multiple receptive fields. The red line for the case of 98% conjunctive units corresponds to two times the size of the receptive field for the conjunctive subpopulation. Once this point is reached, each stimulus lies in its own receptive field, so misbinding should not happen. This is again in agreement with the results, with very few non-target responses in this regime.</p>

In this situation, each stimulus occupies one receptive field, and misbinding should rarely occur.</p>

<p>We originally expected a hierarchical population code to perform differently, since it encodes binding information in a quite different manner. However, surprisingly, we find consistent results, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g015">Fig. 15</xref> (right panels). Again, we show two characteristic distances between stimuli in the canary pattern, Δ<italic>x</italic> = {0.15,0.8} rad (we chose different values than in the mixed code situation, as the population codes behave slightly differently).</p>
<p>When the separation is large, the hierarchical code also behaves in a regular fashion similar to that of the mixed code as the degree of conjunctivity increases. When conjunctivity is low, the memory performs poorly, as no binding information is present. However, as conjunctivity increases, performance does as well. Interestingly, performance with a hierarchical code increases monotonically with conjunctivity (before dropping sharply when the input lower layer population decreases past the required precision needed to discriminate the stimuli). This architecture uses conjunctive information quite effectively, but does not attain the same maximum performance.</p>
<p>The situation is less clear for a small distance between stimuli. Having a large proportion of conjunctive units is actually detrimental in this case, as the input lower layer decreases in size, and thus the encoding precision decreases with it. Hence there is an optimal proportion of conjunctive units for a given required minimum discrimination. The smallest distance for which the target and non-target responses can be discriminated when analysing the results is Δ<italic>x</italic> ≈ 0.30, using a hierarchical code with a conjunctivity of 80% (see Section 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004003.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Hence the hierarchical code seems to discriminate smaller patterns for a given population size, which is surprising for such a crude representation of a hierarchical representation.</p>
<p>Thus we find that even this simple stimulus pattern can provide something of a formal window into misbinding and the structure of receptive fields.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We built a model of short-term visual working memory, assuming a single population of units, an additive, palimpsest, storage scheme and sample-based probabilistic recall. We showed how this model could qualitatively reproduce key aspects of human experimental data, including the decrease in performance with memory load, and also error distributions, including misbinding errors, which have not previously been the focus of theoretical study. It is the next phase of this work to fit human data quantitatively, looking in detail at individual differences in performance and patterns of errors.</p>
<p>We studied several different sorts of population code. The most critical question concerns binding, which in our case is performed by conjunctive units that are sensitive to specific combinations of two or more features. Non-conjunctive, feature-based codes, can be more efficient at storing single items, but fail catastrophically whenever multiple items are stored simultaneously. We considered including both single-feature and conjunctive units, and showed that a combination is likely to offer a better characterization of experimental data than either alone. Finally, we considered experiments that would offer useful guidance to discriminating theories.</p>
<p>The original such model of this class of experiments was formalised by Wilken &amp; Ma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref039">39</xref>], based on experiments and arguments from Pashler and Luck &amp; Vogel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref040">40</xref>]. This includes a finite set of “slots”; items that are not allocated a slot are therefore not remembered at all (requiring pure guessing for recall). The assumed error distribution was thus a mixture model with two components: a Von Mises centred around the target item, and a random uniform component. The alternative models are based on the notion of a finite resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref011">11</xref>], arguing against a fixed number of slots, but rather that there is a constraint on the whole collection, such that storage of multiple items leads to interference. More recently, intermediate accounts have been suggested, such as a “slots and averaging” model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref005">5</xref>], letting individual items be stored in more than one slot, with the outputs of all the slots concerned being averaged.</p>
<p>By comparison, our model, as a palimpsest, can best be seen as abandoning the notion of slots altogether—be they finite or infinite—and so does not need a mechanism for allocating the slots. There is a finite resource—the population of units that can be active—but this leads to two resource-like limitations on storage, rather than one. The first limitation is noise—this acts just like some of the resource limits in previous models. The second limitation is representational—the fact that the items overlap in the palimpsest in a way that depends on how they are encoded in the population implies a form of interference and interaction that leads to misbinding. This explicit element has been missing in previous treatments. Along with the variability in the process of sampling, it is key to the model’s account of the pattern of errors of human subjects, with heavier tails than a Gaussian/Von Mises distribution. Other factors have also been implicated in this pattern, such as different memory encoding precision on different trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref041">41</xref>], or the limited width of neuronal tuning functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref015">15</xref>]. It would be straightforward to extend our scheme to allow for partial information about which item will have to be recalled.</p>
<p>We have shown how our model can encode information about each feature separately, with the binding information being provided by another subpopulation. A model along related lines was recently proposed by Swan and Wyble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref042">42</xref>]. In this, an associative network, which they call the “binding pool”, provides binding information. However, one could think of other ways to encode and store this binding information, for example by using object-files. If one were to limit how many object-files could be used at a given time, and if object-files made errors in binding the features together, this would provide an hybrid slot-based treatment of the problem.</p>
<p>Another related model has been suggested in the context of dynamic field theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref044">44</xref>]. These authors consider a population of rate-based units with temporal dynamics governed by first order differential equations. Given specific layers and connectivity patterns, they simulate the evolution of bumps of activity through time, which can be used to store information for later recall. In their model, feature binding is completely linked to space in that each feature is stored in different feature-space population bound only to location. A separate working memory population stores the locations of all items seen. Recall relies on using location to couple and constrain the possible features to their original values. This idea resembles “feature integration theory”, proposed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref045">45</xref>] as a model for attention.</p>
<p>That the dynamical (e.g., drifting) behaviour of the bumps is the critical focus of the model sits a little uneasily with the observation that performance in visual short-term memory experiments does not drop significantly when recall is delayed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref046">46</xref>]. Further, location cannot be the only variable determining binding given experiments in which items are presented at the same location but at different times. Our model is agnostic about the source of binding in its input, lending itself to the study of different representations. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to model richer aspects of the temporal evolution of the memory state.</p>
<p>Here, we assumed that only two features were stored per item, namely colour and angle. However, we report in Section, 5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004003.s001">S1 Text</xref> the effect of using more than two features. One feature that is particularly important is spatial location. In the actual experiments in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref007">7</xref>], space (which, for simplicity and consistency with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref001">1</xref>], we treated as another angular variable) was used as the cueing feature, with colour being recalled. It is possible, given the importance of space for object recognition, that spatial tuning has quite different characteristics from that of other cues. Hints of this are apparent in the properties of early visual neurons. This could make it a stronger cue for recall and recognition, something that it would be interesting to examine systematically through experiment and the model.</p>
<p>With more features, we could address directly one of the key findings that led support to the slot models, namely the observation of an object benefit in recalling features. That is, despite the sometime fragility of episodic memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref047">47</xref>], which this functionally resembles, remembering a fixed number of features is easier when those features are parts of fewer conjunctive items. The magnitude of that effect has been the subject of intense debate, but there is broad agreement about a significant object benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref052">52</xref>]. In our model, such effects arise through two mechanisms: first, having fewer items will add less encoding noise to the final memory state, which will directly reduce the overall noise level in recall. Second, the conjunctive units also directly contribute to the storage precision for bound items. Our model would thus also show an object benefit without additional machinery.</p>
<p>Our model treats storage as a bottom-up, feedforward process. However certain top-down effects are known, such as directed forgetting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref054">54</xref>]. Such an effect could be accommodated in the model by considering a multiple step process in which following regular storage, recall would be executed based on the cue for the to-be-forgotten item, with the representation of whatever is retrieved being subtracted from the previous memory state. As this would still be a noisy process, the resulting precision for the other items would be less than if the forgotten item had never been stored at all, albeit still greater than if its main influence over the memory state remained.</p>
<p>We made a number of simplifying assumptions, notably to do with the noise model and the sampling process. For the former, we only considered additive isotropic Gaussian noise corrupting the encoding. This could be readily extended to more complex noise models, for example to a more neurally plausible Poisson noise model. The key difference from using Poisson noise would be its signal-dependence—storing larger numbers of items would lead to greater activities and thus a higher variance. Signal-dependent Gaussian noise is a related modelling choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref055">55</xref>]. Amongst other differences, this would reintroduce the second term in the equation for the Fisher information (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004003.e038">Equation 30</xref>). This term can be large compared to the first [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref055">55</xref>] and it adds extra inferential complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref056">56</xref>], hence fully accounting for it can be complicated.</p>
<p>We considered a process of recall that involves the full posterior distribution over the responses. Determining how the brain would use and represent distributional information has been an active recent research topic. One set of ideas considers what amounts to a deterministic treatment (albeit corrupted by noise) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref062">62</xref>]. However, there is a growing body of research showing how the brain might instead use samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref063">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref066">66</xref>], and we adopted this approach. Inference might involve combining together larger numbers of samples, and thus reporting some (noisy) function of the posterior other than just the samples. However, such operations are currently underdetermined by the experimental data, as they would interact with other sources of noise. Sampling from the posterior instead of simply reporting the maximum a-posteriori mode value has the additional benefits of capturing variability around the mode itself, which varies depending on the representation used. Nevertheless, it is important to stress that this sampling scheme is not the main bottleneck in our model. Rather, it is the representation that constrains the nature and magnitude of the errors in recall. The sampling scheme simply provides a mechanism for reporting on the ultimate posterior distribution. A more limited report, such as the MAP value, would likely lack the appropriate characteristics by reflecting too little of this distribution.</p>
<p>One of the major tools that we used to analyse the population codes was the Fisher information (and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bound). However, this is only useful if the posterior distribution is close to being Gaussian, and, in particular, unimodal. This will almost always be true for a single item; and often be true when there are multiple items and a conjunctive population code that solves the binding problem. However, as we saw, feature codes lead to multimodality, rendering a direct application of the Cramer-Rao lower bound useless. What is still possible is to use the Fisher information as an indication for the variability around one of the mode. We have shown how it still produces a good approximation to the width of a mode, even in the presence of misbinding errors.</p>
<p>We characterized misbinding errors through a mixture model and a resampling-based estimator. It is also possible to assess the multimodality of the posterior itself directly, for example by fitting a parametric mixture model on the posterior. This analysis leads to similar results. But it would then be possible to analyse this multi-modality analytically, and perhaps obtain a closed form expression for the proportion of misbinding errors expected from a given posterior.</p>
<p>We considered a case of recalling only a single item given a memory. It would be possible to treat recall differently, with a mixture model, estimating the features associated with all items, and thereby answering the memory query directly. Total recall could be performed using a fixed finite mixture model, e.g. a Gaussian Mixture model, but lends itself well to a nonparametric extension, characterizing the whole collection of elements in an array. Approaches of this sort have been pursued by various recent authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref071">71</xref>]. For instance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref071">71</xref>] considered both the encoding and recall to be implemented with a Dirichlet process mixture model. They show how this provides a natural account of ensemble statistics effects that can be seen in some experiments, such as regression to the mean of the presented samples. By contrast, our approach is closer to the experimental paradigm, as there is no evidence that subjects recall all features of all items when asked to recall an unique item. Regression to the mean still arises, but from local interactions between items in the representation. Indeed, even for a conjunctive code, when items are close-by the recalled angle will be biased towards the mean of all items, as bumps of activity merge together. There is substantial precedence for the approximation of focusing on a single item, ignoring some or all of the statistical structure associated with other actual or potential items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref072">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref075">75</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results depend crucially on the nature of the underlying population code. As a proof of principle, we tested two schemes—one mixing feature-based and conjunctive codes; the other building a hierarchy on top of feature codes. However, many more sophisticated representations would also be possible—studies of population coding suggest that using multiple scales is particularly beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref076">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref077">77</xref>], and it would be interesting to test these.</p>
<p>For our single-scale case, we suggested a particular pattern of three stimuli that we expect to be of particular value in discriminating between different population coding schemes. The pattern was designed to promote misbinding in a way that would also be revealing about the size of the receptive fields. We also expect there to be a strong effect of distance in stimulus space on misbinding probability, if a mixed-like representation is used. On the other hand, by the very nature of our hierarchical population code, it is harder to make specific predictions about the dependence of proximity and other features on misbinding probability. If subjects were too proficient at recall from this pattern, as might be the case for just three items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref001">1</xref>], it would be straightforward to complicate the scheme to include a larger number of items.</p>
<p>An interesting extension to this analysis would be to introduce an asymmetry in the pattern of stimuli, in order to displace the mean of the stimuli from the centre stimulus. This would in turn introduce asymmetric biases and deviations for the different items depending on the sources of the errors. Indeed, as briefly mentioned above, it has been shown that the mean statistics of the stimuli have an effect in determining responses characteristics. Such an asymmetric pattern would indicate if the variability is biased towards the mean of the stimuli or to close-by items only.</p>
<p>Although our proposal has primarily been grounded on the psychophysical literature, the use of population representations, and the abandonment of anatomical “slots”, makes it appealing to consider the neural basis of the memory. There is substantial work on population-based working memory with a foundation in persistent activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref078">78</xref>], and even in the gating of storage necessary to make such memories work efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref079">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref080">80</xref>]. It would be interesting to study the extra constraints that come from a more realistic neural implementation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we proposed a model which accounts for errors in working memory by considering explicitly the link between storage and representation. We showed it can successfully account for key aspects of the psychophysical data on visual short term memory, and allows for a better understanding of the relationship between being precise in the representation of single features and the representation of binding information across all the features of a single pattern to be able to handle cued recall. Based on observations on the form of the errors arising when recalling information from a palimpsest memory, we proposed a specific stimulus template that would produce different error patterns depending on characteristics of the underlying representation, and so we suggest as an attractive target for psychophysical investigation.</p>

<p>Similarly, Σ<sub><bold>N</bold></sub> is the covariance of <italic>N</italic> items, marginalising over feature values. We obtain estimates by sampling 5000 memory items from the storage process before estimating those two empirical estimates.</p>
<p>We use a slice sampling scheme to obtain samples of <italic>ϕ</italic> given a memory state. In addition to the classical slice sampling algorithm, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings jumps, which can randomly set the sampler in another part of the state space. This allows to jump between modes in a multi-modal posterior setting. The jump probability is set to 10% and a jump is accepted depending on a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance ratio. We discard the first 500 samples as burn-in steps for the slice sampler. We perform step-out and shrinkage to determine the slice width (initially set to <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004003.e033"><mml:math id="M33" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>40</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004003.ref026">26</xref>].

<p>We perform a grid search over several population code parameters to provide a qualitative fit to human experiments. For the mixed population code, we varied <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and the <italic>ratio</italic> of conjunctivity, as <italic>β</italic>, <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> were kept fixed. For the hierarchical code, we set <italic>p</italic> = 1, <italic>λ</italic> = 1 and Θ = 1 and varied <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and the <italic>ratio</italic> of conjunctivity (defined as <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004003.e046"><mml:math id="M46" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>M</italic><sub>1</sub> (respectively <italic>M</italic><sub>2</sub>) is the size of the layer one subpopulation (respectively layer two)). A full fit, which is the subject of future work, would require at least the consideration of heterogeneous and multi-scale population representations.</p>

<title>Supplementary Material.</title>
<p>Additional derivations and results omitted from main manuscript. Derivations include the computation of the large population limit for Fisher information and the relation between the memory fidelity and the Fisher information. We report the stimuli separation analysis for the hierarchical code, analogous to the analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004003.g016">Fig. 16</xref> in the manuscript. Following the comments of a reviewer, we studied the relationship between the conjunctivity ratio and the population size in a mixed population code, as our parametrisation creates a dependence between them. Finally, we show how increasing the number of features affects the ratio of conjunctivity for a fixed population size.</p>
