        <p>To understand how two organisms that have not previously been in contact can establish mutualism, it is first necessary to examine temporal changes in their phenotypes during the establishment of mutualism. Instead of tracing back the history of known, well-established, natural mutualisms, we experimentally simulated the development of mutualism using two genetically-engineered auxotrophic strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which mimic two organisms that have never met before but later establish mutualism. In the development of this synthetic mutualism, one strain, approximately 10 hours after meeting the partner strain, started oversupplying a metabolite essential for the partner's growth, eventually leading to the successive growth of both strains. This cooperative phenotype adaptively appeared only after encountering the partner strain but before the growth of the strain itself. By transcriptome analysis, we found that the cooperative phenotype of the strain was not accompanied by the local activation of the biosynthesis and transport of the oversupplied metabolite but rather by the global activation of anabolic metabolism. This study demonstrates that an organism has the potential to adapt its phenotype after the first encounter with another organism to establish mutualism before its extinction. As diverse organisms inevitably encounter each other in nature, this potential would play an important role in the establishment of a nascent mutualism in nature.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mutualism is based on a mutually beneficial interaction between two organisms and is ubiquitous in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Herre1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Sachs1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-McArthur1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Douglas1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Boucher1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Begon1">[6]</xref>. Mutualisms observed in nature are thought to be the result of adaptation of each organism to the existence of the partner after their first encounter. The genetic origin and trajectory of this adaptation has been investigated via a phylogenetic approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Sachs1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Aanen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Machado1">[8]</xref>. However, tracing back established mutualisms to their origin is challenging as no intermittent states are defined with which to measure the adaptation in terms of phenotypic traits, population size and local environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Herre1">[1]</xref>. To investigate the environmental conditions required to establish a nascent mutualism, one study reported a synthetically designed mutualism using two species of bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Harcombe1">[9]</xref>. The findings of that study clearly demonstrated the importance of spatially structured environments for the establishment of mutualism, providing proof of principle of natural selection of cooperative behavior that has been proposed by the theoretical studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-May1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Hamilton1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Nowak1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-West1">[13]</xref>. These types of experimental studies using microbial ecosystems to test the theories of cooperative systems have recently been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Griffin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-MacLean1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Chuang1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Rainey1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-RossGillespie1">[18]</xref>. Most of these studies focused not on the adaptation of the organisms but on the environmental conditions required for the persistence of cooperative behavior in natural selection.</p>
      <p>Some studies have characterized the behavior of organisms in nascent mutualisms. Wintermute <italic>et al.</italic> synthetically designed mutualisms comprising certain pairs of auxotrophs of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and found significant metabolic synergy in 17% of 1035 such pairs tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Wintermute1">[19]</xref>, although it was unclear if any adaptation of the bacteria contributed. Shou <italic>et al</italic>. synthetically designed an obligate mutualism composed of two yeast auxotrophs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Shou1">[20]</xref>, each of which was genetically engineered to overproduce the metabolite essential for the growth of the partner. Both of the auxotrophic strains grew to saturation without the need for external supplementation of their essential metabolites compensating for the auxotrophy. Moreover, they showed adaptation in as little as one hundred generations, where they became capable of growing from diluted cell densities or ceased growth due to weakening of the beneficial interaction. Hillesland <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the growth rate of microorganisms in another synthetic mutualism increased after serial passage, even in the absence of spatially structured environment, while the extent of the adaptation was increased in a spatially structured environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Hillesland1">[21]</xref>. These adaptations of microorganisms occurred after the establishment of nascent mutualisms, strengthening their interactions.</p>
      <p>Can adaptation occur before the establishment of a nascent mutualism, leading to its establishment? Here we show that a strain of bacteria became more beneficial to another strain before their population started growing and establishing a nascent mutualism. Specifically, we synthetically designed an obligate mutualism comprising two auxotrophs of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We show that one of the two auxotrophs, upon encountering the partner strain before their own population growth, adapted by oversupplying the metabolite essential for growth of the partner, which in turn permitted its own growth, leading to the successive growth of both strains. This study therefore shows the potential of organisms to adaptively respond to the first encounter with another organism, which could lead to the establishment of nascent mutualisms. As diverse organisms inevitably encounter each other in nature, this potential would play an important role in the establishment of nascent mutualisms in nature.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>To create a synthetic model of obligate mutualism, we constructed two different types of nutrient auxotrophs of <italic>E. coli</italic> by genetic recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>): an isoleucine (Ile) auxotroph, designated I<sup>–</sup>, labeled with a red-fluorescent protein (<italic>dsred.T3</italic>), and a leucine (Leu) auxotroph, L<sup>–</sup>, labeled with a green-fluorescent protein (<italic>gfpuv5</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Hosoda1">[22]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We were able to distinguish these two strains by flow cytometry (FCM). In minimal medium without amino acid supplements, neither strain was able to grow in monoculture. However, in coculture, if the two strains supplied a sufficient amount of the essential amino acids required by the other strain, they would successively grow and thereby establish mutualism.</p>

          <p>(A) Schematic diagram of the synthetic mutualism. Two auxotrophs of <italic>E. coli</italic>, strains I<sup>–</sup> and L<sup>–</sup>, supply amino acids to each other and potentially establish mutualism, as described in the text. (B–E) Cell growth and nutrient release in the monocultures. The concentration of Leu or Ile is indicated as the density of L<sup>–</sup> or I<sup>–</sup> cells which can be produced by the amount of Leu or Ile, respectively. When the amino acid concentration was not detected (under the detection limit 10<sup>5</sup>/ml), we plotted it at 10<sup>5</sup>/ml. (B and C) The time course of the concentration of Leu (blue square) and I<sup>–</sup> cells (red circle) in monoculture. (B) 10<sup>3</sup>/ml (closed symbol) or 10<sup>5</sup>/ml (open symbol) I<sup>–</sup> cells were inoculated into minimal media along with 10 µM of Ile. 10 µM of Ile supports the generation of about 10<sup>7</sup>/ml I<sup>–</sup> cells. (C) 10<sup>7</sup>/ml I<sup>–</sup> cells were inoculated into minimal media without the addition of Ile. Closed and open symbols represent two independent experiments. (D and E) The time course of Ile (orange square) and L<sup>–</sup> cells (green circle). (D) 10<sup>3</sup>/ml (closed symbol) or 10<sup>5</sup>/ml (open symbol) of L<sup>–</sup> cells were inoculated into minimal media along with 10 µM of Leu. 10 µM of Leu was the amount required for the growth of about 10<sup>7</sup>/ml of L<sup>–</sup> cells. (E) 10<sup>7</sup>/ml of L<sup>–</sup> cells were inoculated into minimal media without the addition of Leu. Closed and open symbols represent replicates of two individual cultures. (F) The time course of the concentration of amino acids and the cells in coculture: I<sup>–</sup> (red •), L<sup>–</sup> (green ▴), Ile (orange ×), Leu (blue +). 10<sup>7</sup>/ml of both I<sup>–</sup> and L<sup>–</sup> cells were inoculated into minimal media without the addition of any amino acids.</p>

      <p>We measured the supply of amino acids from each strain in monoculture to test whether the quantities were sufficient for the successive growth of both strains in coculture. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Figs. 1B and 1C</xref> show the supply of Leu from I<sup>–</sup> cells in monoculture, with and without the addition of 10 µM Ile, respectively, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Figs. 1D and 1E</xref> show the supply of Ile from L<sup>–</sup> cells in monoculture, with and without the addition of 10 µM Leu, respectively. Before inoculation of these cultures, we washed each strain with minimal media not containing amino acids to exclude the carry-over of supplements from preculture (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Obviously, both strains did not grow without the addition of amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1C and 1E</xref>). We measured the concentrations of Leu and Ile in the culture media using a bioassay (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), and expressed these as the cell concentration of L<sup>–</sup> and I<sup>–</sup> cells which can be produced by the amount of amino acid supplied, respectively. In every case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1B–E</xref>), the final concentrations of an amino acid in the recipient cell were always less than the maximum concentrations of the donor cell. That is, the nutrient supply from the donor cells was insufficient to produce an equal amount of nutrients in the recipient cells, and was therefore insufficient to sustain the net growth of both strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Shou1">[20]</xref>. These results implied that any adaptation to the mutualism, such as an increase in the nutrient supply, needs to occur in coculture for the successive growth of both strains.</p>
      <p>Despite the insufficient amino acid supply in monoculture, both strains grew to saturation (around 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> cells/ml) in coculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). Initially, I<sup>–</sup> cells grew (red • at &lt;10 h), followed by L<sup>–</sup> cells (green ▴ at ∼20 h). Qualitatively, the initial growth of I<sup>–</sup> cells was consistent with the results of amino acid supplementation in monoculture as follows. In monoculture, I<sup>–</sup> cells supplied Leu only after growth and the uptake of Ile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1B and 1C</xref>), while L<sup>–</sup> cells supplied Ile regardless of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1D and 1E</xref>). These results suggested that initially L<sup>–</sup> cells supplied Ile promoting the growth of I<sup>–</sup> cells. In addition to the initial growth of I<sup>–</sup> cells, the amount of Leu was detected at time 0 in coculture, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1F</xref> (blue +). As I<sup>–</sup> cells supplied Leu only when they consumed Ile, these results indicated that I<sup>–</sup> cells consumed Ile supplied from L<sup>–</sup> cells and then supplied Leu just after mixing but prior to sampling. However, quantitatively, the initial growth of I<sup>–</sup> cells was inconsistent with the results from monoculture. I<sup>–</sup> cells grew to greater than twice the concentration of L<sup>–</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>, red • at &lt;10 h). That is, the Ile supply from L<sup>–</sup> cells was sufficiently high to produce a greater concentration of I<sup>–</sup> cells than L<sup>–</sup> cells, which was different from the results of monoculture described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1D and 1E</xref>). The final concentration of Ile was also significantly higher than that of L<sup>–</sup> cells in coculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>, orange ×). The inconsistency in the quantity of Ile supplied by L<sup>–</sup> cells in coculture and monoculture suggested the enhanced supply of Ile from L<sup>–</sup> cells on encountering I<sup>–</sup> cells. It should be noted that L<sup>–</sup> cells did not show significant growth before nine hours in coculture when the Ile supply from L<sup>–</sup> cells already appeared to be enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>), which indicates that enhancement of the Ile supply from L<sup>–</sup> cells did not require the population growth of strain L<sup>–</sup> itself. Also, enhancement of the Leu supply from I<sup>–</sup> cells was detected in coculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>), as discussed later.</p>
      <p>We investigated the growth kinetics of the cocultures at various initial cell concentrations of strains I<sup>–</sup> and L<sup>–</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The cells entered stationary phase at around 20–30, 40–120, and 300–600 h when the initial cell concentration of strain L<sup>–</sup> was 10<sup>7</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup>/ml, respectively. Cell growth was not observed when the initial cell concentration of strain L<sup>–</sup> was 10<sup>4</sup>/ml. On the other hand, clear dependency on the initial cell concentration of strain I<sup>–</sup> was not observed. The difference in the dependencies on the initial concentration of I<sup>–</sup> and L<sup>–</sup> cells was consistent with the differences in the features of nutrient supply found in the monocultures: only L<sup>–</sup> cells supplied Ile even in the absence of amino acids in monoculture as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). These results suggested that L<sup>–</sup> cells initiated the first steps towards establishing mutualism in coculture.</p>

When I<sup>–</sup><sub>0</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>0</sub> were both at a concentration of 10<sup>5</sup>/ml, mutualism had been established six out of nine times. The features of the mutualism, discussed in the text, were reproducible, although the time scale varied about two-fold. The initial increase in the concentration of I<sup>–</sup> cells to approximately 10-fold greater than that of L<sup>–</sup> cells after the lag phase is depicted by arrows.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The time courses of the cocultures also showed another feature. In some cases, the initial growth of I<sup>–</sup> cells reached a concentration of up to approximately 10-fold greater than that of L<sup>–</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, depicted by arrows). This suggested that the Ile supply from L<sup>–</sup> cells was sufficiently high to produce this concentration of I<sup>–</sup> cells. As the Ile supply from L<sup>–</sup> cells was insufficient to produce an I<sup>–</sup> cell concentration equal to that in monoculture, which was equivalent to the initial lag time in coculture, the sufficient supply of Ile from L<sup>–</sup> cells in coculture suggested that L<sup>–</sup> cells changed to a "high supplier" phenotype prior to growth. Indeed, a mathematical model assuming the change in L<sup>–</sup> cell phenotype could explain the time course of coculture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017105.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). It should also be noted that the lag period was dependent on the initial cell concentration of L<sup>–</sup> cells in the coculture, which suggested that the interactions between cells were required for the change in L<sup>–</sup> cell phenotype.</p>
      <p>To directly observe the change in L<sup>–</sup> cells to a high supplier phenotype, we tested reconstituted cocultures (re-coculture) using L<sup>–</sup> cells prepared from mid- coculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). To prepare L<sup>–</sup> cells separately from I<sup>–</sup> cells from mid-coculture, we inoculated each strain into media separated by a membrane, which was permeable to amino acids but not to <italic>E. coli</italic> (membrane coculture) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The time course of the membrane coculture was almost the same as that of coculture without membrane separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). For the re-coculture, we used both strains harvested from three different culture conditions: (i) at the log phase in monoculture with the addition of the required amino acids, which is the same as the initial state (0 h) of membrane coculture (I<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub>), (ii) at 23 h of membrane coculture, when I<sup>–</sup> cells had grown to a concentration approximately 10-fold higher than that of the L<sup>–</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) (I<sup>–</sup><sub>co</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>co</sub>), and (iii) at 23 h of membrane monoculture in the absence of amino acids, when both strains were not growing (I<sup>–</sup><sub>mono</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>mono</sub>). Before inoculation of the re-cocultures, we washed each strain with minimal media to exclude supplements carried over from the first membrane cultures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g003">Fig. 3B–E</xref> show the time courses of the re-cocultures comprising I<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub>, I<sup>–</sup><sub>co</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub>, I<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>co</sub>, and I<sup>–</sup><sub>co</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>co</sub> cells, respectively. Only the re-coculture containing L<sup>–</sup><sub>co</sub> cells showed initial growth of I<sup>–</sup> cells without a lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g003">Fig. 3D and 3E</xref>, arrows). These results indicated that L<sup>–</sup><sub>co</sub> cells were high suppliers of Ile at time 0 in the re-coculture, in contrast to L<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> cells. It is worth noting that L<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> cells represent the initial state of L<sup>–</sup><sub>co</sub> cells in the first membrane coculture, <italic>i.e.</italic>, L<sup>–</sup> cells change to a high supplier phenotype in the first membrane coculture. Re-coculture containing L<sup>–</sup><sub>mono</sub> cells exhibited a lag phase before the initial growth of I<sup>–</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g003">Fig. 3F and 3G</xref>). These results indicated that L<sup>–</sup><sub>mono</sub> cells were not high suppliers, like L<sup>–</sup><sub>co</sub> cells, and the change to a high supplier phenotype was dependent on coculturing. A significant change in I<sup>–</sup> cells was not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g003">Fig. 3B and 3C</xref>) in the re-coculture, although the oversupply of Leu from strain I<sup>–</sup> was observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>. These results experimentally confirmed that L<sup>–</sup> cells changed to a high supplier phenotype in coculture prior to their own growth.</p>

      <p>These findings raised the question: how does gene expression change in the two strains during coculture? To investigate this, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of gene expression in these two strains. To harvest each strain separately from coculture, we again employed membrane coculture. Using a DNA microarray, we measured and compared the expression intensities of all 4345 genes of each strain cultured under three different conditions. These three conditions were: (i) at the log phase in monoculture, which is the same as the initial state (0 h) of membrane coculture, as described above (I<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub>), (ii) at the stationary phase (45 h) of membrane coculture (I<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub>), and (iii) at the stationary phase (45 h) of monoculture after growth in the presence of the required amino acids (I<sup>–</sup><sub>st,mo</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,mo</sub>). As <italic>E. coli</italic> is known to substantially change its gene expression depending on the growth phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Selinger1">[23]</xref>, samples were taken at 45 h (not 23 h) to identify coculture-specific changes by comparing samples at the same phase (stationary phase). In the I<sup>–</sup> strain, the changes in gene expression from I<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> to I<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> strongly correlated with those from I<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> to I<sup>–</sup><sub>st,mo</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), that is, the dominant changes were dependent on the growth phase. This correlation was also observed in L<sup>–</sup> cells and the slope of linear regression was smaller than of I<sup>–</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), which may have been because the time after entering stationary phase was shorter in L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> cells than in I<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). More importantly, in strain L<sup>–</sup>, the correlation coefficient was smaller than that in strain I<sup>–</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results indicated that the change in gene expression of L<sup>–</sup> cells in coculture was more coculture-specific than that of I<sup>–</sup> cells.</p>

      <p>The next question raised was: which categories of genes were involved in the coculture-specific changes in expression in L<sup>–</sup> cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>? Initially, we focused on genes that showed significantly induced or repressed expression in coculture compared to monoculture, <italic>i.e.</italic>, those in which the ratio of gene expression in L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> cells to that in L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,mo</sub> cells was greater than three or lower than one-third. We statistically screened the up-regulated and down-regulated gene categories to which the significantly induced or repressed genes belonged (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0017105-t001">Table 1</xref>). For the gene categories, we adopted the “cellular processes” category in the Gene Ontology (GO) database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Riley1">[24]</xref>, and the categories for genes regulated by sigma factors in the database, RegulonDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-GamaCastro1">[25]</xref>. In the "cellular processes" category of the GO database, 14 categories out of 124 were found to be up-regulated, and most of these up-regulated categories were related to anabolism, such as the biosynthesis of amino acids (tryptophan, proline, methionine, phenylalanine, leucine, cysteine, and chorismate, which is a precursor of tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan), polyamines and proteins. In contrast, of the nine down-regulated categories, most were related to catabolism, such as the various energy cycles (glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycles), fatty acid oxidation, and the catabolism of amino acids, aminobutyrate and carbohydrates. Some of these up- and down-regulated categories were also identified when comparing L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0017105-t001">Table 1</xref>, indicated by arrows). Although L<sup>–</sup> cells oversupplied Ile in coculture, no significant increase was found in the expression of genes related to Ile biosynthesis or Ile transport in L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> cells compared with both L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,mo</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017105.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). It is worth noting that the results of liquid chromatography showed that the predominant supplement from L<sup>–</sup> cells required by I<sup>–</sup> cells was Ile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017105.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Among the genes regulated by sigma factors, we detected the down-regulation of genes regulated by Sigma 70, the housekeeping sigma factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Magnusson1">[26]</xref>, during the change from L<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> to L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> cells (arrows, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0017105-t001">Table 1</xref>) and the change from L<sup>–</sup><sub>ini</sub> to L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,mo</sub> cells. These results were consistent with the change in growth phase to stationary phase. Although the down-regulation of Sigma 70 genes occurred in both L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,mo</sub> cells, the gene expression significantly differed between L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,mo</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Therefore both up- and down-regulation was found when comparing L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> and L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,mo</sub> cells. Down-regulation of the glutamine biosynthesis gene category correlated with the down-regulation by Sigma 54, the sigma factor controlling nitrogen usage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Magnusson1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Reitzer1">[27]</xref>. As glutamine biosynthesis opposes glutamate biosynthesis leading to the biosynthesis of other amino acids, the down-regulation of glutamine biosynthesis is not inconsistent with the up-regulation of the anabolic categories. As above, we found that the coculture-specific changes in gene expression in L<sup>–</sup> cells were not related to the local activation of the biosynthesis and transport of isoleucine, but were related to the global activation of anabolic metabolism.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In our synthetic model of obligate mutualism comprising two auxotrophs of <italic>E. coli</italic>, strains I<sup>–</sup> and L<sup>–</sup>, the increase in the Ile supply from L<sup>–</sup> cells occurred before the population growth of L<sup>–</sup> cells, and both strains grew successively thereafter in coculture. We found that the increase in the Ile supply from L<sup>–</sup> cells depended on coculture with I<sup>–</sup> cells and was accompanied by coculture-specific changes in the gene expression of L<sup>–</sup> cells. This change in L<sup>–</sup> cells in coculture was not related to the local activation of the biosynthesis and transport of isoleucine, but was related to the global activation of anabolic metabolism.</p>
      <p>What is the mechanism behind the phenotypic change in L<sup>–</sup> cells to become “high suppliers” of isoleucine? There are two possibilities: (i) a fraction of high suppliers preexisted in the initial population and their fraction in the L<sup>–</sup> population increased in the coculture (natural selection), (ii) L<sup>–</sup> cells changed their phenotypes in response to the changes in the environment from monoculture to coculture (phenotypic plasticity). We can rule out neither possibility completely.</p>
      <p>Let us first assume that (i) is true, and estimate an approximate range of the fraction of preexisting high suppliers in the initial population (<italic>f</italic><sub>H0</sub>). At first, the supply of Ile from high suppliers was about 10-fold higher than that of “normal” L<sup>–</sup> cells. Therefore, <italic>f</italic><sub>H0</sub> would be less than 10%, otherwise the supply of Ile from L<sup>–</sup> cells at the initial state or in the monoculture would be higher than the experimental results. Second, the shortest time until the initial growth of I<sup>–</sup> cells was about 10 hours. By then the high suppliers had already been the majority in the L<sup>–</sup> population and their concentration was approximately 10<sup>7</sup>/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). For the concentration of the high suppliers to become 10<sup>7</sup>/ml in 10 hours from the initial concentration 10<sup>7</sup>·<italic>f</italic><sub>H0</sub>/ml, <italic>f</italic><sub>H0</sub>&gt; exp(–10<italic>g</italic><sub>H</sub>) must be satisfied, where <italic>g</italic><sub>H</sub> is the growth rate of the high suppliers. Even if only high suppliers grew at a maximum growth rate of L<sup>–</sup> cells (<italic>g</italic><sub>H</sub> = 0.4/h, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017105.s006">Table S1</xref>), <italic>f</italic><sub>H0</sub>&gt;2% was required. <italic>f</italic><sub>H0</sub> thus can be estimated as 2%&lt;<italic>f</italic><sub>H0</sub>&lt;10%. Note that there is no reason why only high suppliers grew at a maximum rate in the environment, where the normal L<sup>–</sup> cells did not grow. In the mixed liquid culture, all of the L<sup>–</sup> cells were considered to acquire Leu from the media (not from I<sup>–</sup> cells directly) in a homologous environment (actually, physical contacts were negligible; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Moreover, <italic>f</italic><sub>H0</sub> must be kept in this range in monoculture because the time until the initial growth of I<sup>–</sup> cells were reproducible even when we used another clone of L<sup>–</sup> cell for the preparation of the initial population.</p>
      <p>We then discuss about the possibility (ii). <italic>E. coli</italic> is known to alter its phenotype in response to environmental changes, such as amino acid starvation, and this is known as a stringent response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Cashel1">[28]</xref> and represents a kind of phenotypic plasticity. As L<sup>–</sup> cells were subject to Leu starvation at the initial in coculture, they would have changed their phenotype as the stringent response. This response might have been preserved even after their growth in which they had already been released from Leu starvation. Indeed, the up-regulation of amino acid synthesis, which is known to occur in the stringent response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Cashel1">[28]</xref>, was observed in L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,co</sub> relative to L<sup>–</sup><sub>st,mo</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0017105-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, although L<sup>–</sup> cells in monoculture without Leu (L<sup>–</sup><sub>mono</sub>) were subject to Leu starvation, they did not change to the high supplier phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g003">Fig. 3F and 3G</xref>). In our experiments, L<sup>–</sup> cells changed to a high supplier phenotype only in coculture, and the genes related to Ile biosynthesis and transport were not significantly induced in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017105.s002">Fig. S2</xref>), in contrast, these genes are induced during the stringent response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Cashel1">[28]</xref>. It is known that Ile uptake is increased and amino acid permeability is decreased during the stringent response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Cashel1">[28]</xref>, which seems to oppose the extracellular leakage of Ile. Our results might therefore indicate that the phenotypic change in L<sup>–</sup> cells was related not only to the known stringent responses, but also to other responses due to the interaction among strains via the media. As both the I<sup>–</sup> and L<sup>–</sup> strains were constructed by a single gene deletion from the same original strain, DH1 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), the substances supplied by them via cell leakage would be expected to be almost the same. Thus, the interaction between these strains is unlikely due to the expression of a specific substance, as is the case in quorum sensing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Hooshangi1">[29]</xref>, but is more likely due to a global change of the composition of multiple substances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Huang1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-BarYam1">[31]</xref>. This might be consistent with the observed global activation of expression of genes involved in anabolic metabolism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0017105-t001">Table 1</xref>). It is worth noting that a similar phenomenon was observed in a synthetic mutualism comprising I<sup>–</sup> cells and an uracil auxotroph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017105.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), therefore, the change in L<sup>–</sup> cell phenotype is not due to the similarities between the metabolism of Ile and Leu. Further studies are required to fully elucidate the mechanism behind the phenotypic change in strain L<sup>–</sup>.</p>
      <p>It is unknown to what extent such an adaptation to a first encounter contributes to the establishment of a nascent mutualism in nature. However, this potential would provide insight into the positive factors required for the establishment of natural mutualisms. We do not believe that an adaptation, such as that described in this study, results in the establishment of nascent mutualism in every case, because we actually failed to establish mutualism with some combinations of auxotrophs (such as a glutamine auxotroph and an uracil auxotroph). Synthetic mutualism also failed to be established in other types of organisms without the introduction of metabolite-overproducing mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Harcombe1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Shou1">[20]</xref>. However, due to the great variety of organisms in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-McArthur1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-ReakaKudla1">[32]</xref>, organisms inevitably encounter other kinds of organisms and have the opportunity to establish a nascent mutualism, where such an adaptation to this first encounter can facilitate this process. It is worth noting that such an adaptation to first encounter might be a kind of the phenotypic plasticity in response to a new environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Pigliucci1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Ghalambor1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Waddington1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-WestEberhard1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Badyaev1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Shimada1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-deJong1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Yamada1">[40]</xref>, and the adaptation in response to a first encounter might have evolved because the organisms possessing this potential should survive in the bio-diversified nature. Field studies are required to fully investigate the contribution of such an adaptation to the establishment of nascent mutualism in nature.</p>
      <p>The simplicity of the synthetic model of mutualism used in this study enabled us to identify unexpected and quantitative changes in the organisms. Experimental ecosystems not only provide empirical proof of theories but also highlight unexpected phenomena, such as the unknown potential of organisms which may lead to novel theories. For example, in another bacterial system, Fiegna <italic>et al</italic>. found that a single point mutation changed a cheater into a cooperator with a tolerance to exploitation by the cheater <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Velicer1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Fiegna1">[42]</xref>. Without the simplicity of the system, it would have been impossible to detect such a phenomenon. For future studies, synthetically-constructed experimental ecosystems combining naturally non-interacting species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Hillesland1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Buchsbaum1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Tsuchiya1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Kim1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Todoriki1">[46]</xref> and reconstructing interactions using genetic modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Chuang1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Wintermute1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Shou1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Basu1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Weber1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Balagadde1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Song1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Chuang2">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Hu1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017105-Wintermute2">[53]</xref>, would be invaluable for the detection of other unexpected phenomena.</p>
      <p>The simplicity of our synthetic model of mutualism will enable further studies to experimentally resolve some of the remaining questions, such as the molecular mechanisms behind the observed adaptation in L<sup>–</sup> cells and the evolutionary pathway of this mutualism. Our findings may also contribute to the study of mutualism in other organisms, including higher organisms, and in field studies investigating natural ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Mathematical model of the growth kinetics of the coculture. (A) Mathematical model of the growth kinetics. [X] indicates the concentration in the culture media of X. We defined active cells of strains I<sup>−</sup> and L<sup>−</sup> as I<sup>−</sup><sub>act</sub> and L<sup>−</sup><sub>act</sub>, respectively, for the following reason. When we measured the cell concentration as colony forming units (cfu) under starvation conditions, the concentration determined by cfu was less than the concentration determined by analysis of fluorescent particles by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017105.s005">Fig. S5B and S5C</xref>). Although it was difficult to determine whether cells were alive or dead, we defined a cell being able to form a single colony as an active cell. This model neglects the decrease in [I<sup>−</sup>] and [L<sup>−</sup>] because it was slow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017105.s005">Fig. S5B and S5C</xref>).

          <p>The ratio of the concentration of amino acids determined by HPLC to those determined by a bioassay. We determined the quantity of Ile and Leu in the supernatants of the cultures in which each strain reached saturation phase in the presence of the required amino acid (1 µM Ile or 1 µM Leu for I<sup>−</sup> or L<sup>−</sup> cells, respectively) using two different methods: HPLC and a bioassay. The results indicated that the supplied nutrient from L<sup>−</sup> cells that compensated for the Ile auxotrophy of I<sup>−</sup> cells consisted mainly of Ile, while the supplied nutrient from I<sup>−</sup> cells that compensated for the Leu auxotrophy of L<sup>−</sup> cells consisted mainly of substances other than Leu. Methods for the bioassay are described in the text and the methods for HPLC are described below. We added Ile and Leu to the supernatants (both 0.05 µM) to raise the concentrations in the supernatants above the detection range of HPLC. As an internal standard, norleucine was also added to 0.25 µM in the supernatant. The resultant solutions were derivatized by phenylisothiocyanate (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and applied to a reverse phase HPLC on a Waters LC Module 1 (Waters Corporation, MA, USA) with a column of Wakosil-PTC (4.0×250 mm, Wako, Osaka, Japan). The column was soaked in a circulating water bath at 40°C. The mobile phase comprised 60 mM sodium acetate (pH 6.0) and acetonitrile (94∶6) as eluant A; eluant B consisted of 60 mM sodium acetate (pH 6.0) and acetonitrile (40∶60). Gradient elution was employed according to the following linear program: time 0, 0% eluant B; 20 min, 70% eluant B; 21 min, 100% eluent B. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Amino acid derivatives were detected by their absorbance at 254 nm.</p>

          <p>Basic design and cell growth of the synthetic mutualism comprising I<sup>−</sup> cells and a Ura auxotroph (U<sup>−</sup>). (A) Schematic diagram of the synthetic mutualism. Two auxotrophs of <italic>E. coli</italic>, strains I<sup>−</sup> and U<sup>−</sup>, supply nutrients to each other to form a potential mutualism. (B–E) Cell growth and nutrient release properties of the monocultures. The concentration of Ura was determined by a bioassay, as was the concentration of Ile and Leu. The concentration of Ura or Ile is indicated as the density of U<sup>−</sup> or I<sup>−</sup> cells which can be produced by that amount of Ura or Ile, respectively. When the nutrient concentration was not detected (under the detection limit 10<sup>5</sup>/ml), we plotted it at 10<sup>5</sup>/ml. (B and C) The time courses of the concentration of Ura (blue square) and I<sup>−</sup> cells (red circle) in monoculture. (B) 10<sup>5</sup>/ml of I<sup>−</sup> cells were inoculated into minimal media along with 10 µM of Ile. (C) 10<sup>7</sup>/ml of I<sup>−</sup> cells were inoculated into minimal media along with Ile. (D and E) The time courses of the concentration of Ile (orange square) and U<sup>−</sup> cells (green circle). (D) 10<sup>5</sup>/ml of U<sup>−</sup> cells were inoculated into minimal media along with 10 µM of Ura. (E) 10<sup>7</sup>/ml of U<sup>−</sup> cells were inoculated into minimal media without the addition of Ura. (F) The time courses of the concentration of I<sup>−</sup> cells (red symbols) and U<sup>−</sup> cells (green symbols) in coculture. 10<sup>7</sup>/ml of both I<sup>−</sup> and U<sup>−</sup> cells (• and ▴, respectively), 10<sup>7</sup>/ml of I<sup>−</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup>/ml of U<sup>−</sup> (○ and Δ), or 10<sup>6</sup>/ml of I<sup>−</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup>/ml of U<sup>−</sup> (× and +) were inoculated into minimal media in the presence of Ile and Ura. These results were similar to the results of the mutualism with I<sup>−</sup> and L<sup>−</sup> cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017105-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. The final concentrations of nutrients were always less than the maximum concentrations of the donor cell in monoculture (B–E), which meant that the nutrient supplies from these strains in monoculture were insufficient for the continuous growth of both strains in coculture. Despite the insufficient level of nutrient supply in monoculture, both strains grew to saturation in coculture with all of the initial cell concentrations used (F). Strain U<sup>−</sup> (DH1Δ<italic>leuB</italic>::(<italic>gfpuv5-Km<sup>r</sup></italic>)) was constructed from DH1 cells, as was strain L<sup>−</sup>, by replacing the chromosomal <italic>pyrE</italic> gene with a foreign DNA fragment comprising a reporter gene (<italic>gfpuv5</italic>) and the kanamycin resistance gene (<italic>Km<sup>r</sup></italic>).</p>

          <p>Measurement of the cell concentrations by flow cytometry (FCM). (A) The dot plot of the data collected from the coculture by FCM. I<sup>−</sup> cells (red dots), L<sup>−</sup> cells (green dots), and the calibration beads (yellow dots) were clearly segregated.

(B and C) The difference in the cell concentrations determined by FCM (closed symbols) and colony forming units (cfu) (open symbols) for I<sup>−</sup> (B) and L<sup>−</sup> cells (C). 10<sup>7</sup>/ml (black circles) or 10<sup>5</sup>/ml (blue squares) of the cells were inoculated into minimal media without the addition of any amino acid, or 10<sup>5</sup>/ml of the cells were inoculated into minimal media with 10 µM of the required amino acid (Ile for I<sup>−</sup> cells and Leu for L<sup>−</sup> cells) (red triangles). Although there was little difference between the concentration determined by FCM and the concentration determined by cfu at time 0, the concentration determined by cfu decreased more quickly than the concentration determined by FCM. Therefore, although it is difficult to determine whether a cell is alive or dead, we defined an active cell as a cell that was able to form a single colony in the mathematical model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017105.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>.</p>
