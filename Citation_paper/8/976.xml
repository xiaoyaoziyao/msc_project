<abstract>
<p>Sumoylation is one of the post translational modifications, which affects cellular processes in plants through conjugation of small ubiquitin like modifier (SUMO) to target substrate proteins. Response to various abiotic environmental stresses is one of the major cellular functions regulated by SUMO conjugation. SIZ1 is a SUMO E3 ligase, facilitating a vital step in the sumoylation pathway. In this report, it is demonstrated that over-expression of the rice gene <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> in Arabidopsis leads to increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. For example, <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to salt, drought, and heat stresses, and generated greater seed yields under a variety of stress conditions. Furthermore, <italic>OsSIZ1-</italic>overexpressing plants were able to exclude sodium ions more efficiently when grown in saline soils and accumulate higher potassium ions as compared to wild-type plants. Further analysis revealed that <italic>OsSIZ1-</italic>overexpressing plants expressed higher transcript levels of <italic>P5CS</italic>, a gene involved in the biosynthesis of proline, under both salt and drought stress conditions. Therefore, proline here is acting as an osmoprotectant to alleviate damages caused by drought and salt stresses. These results demonstrate that the rice gene <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> has a great potential to be used for improving crop’s tolerance to several abiotic stresses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Post translational modification of proteins occurs via processes such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref001">1</xref>]. Sumoylation is one of the highly conserved post translational modifications in eukaryotes. It is very similar to ubiquitination except that proteins tagged with ubiquitin(s) are likely destined for degradation by the 26S proteasome, whereas SUMO conjugation to target proteins affects various cellular processes in plants including plant’s response to various abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref002">2</xref>]. SUMO is attached to target proteins by formation of an isopeptide bond between SUMO’s C terminal Gly residue and Lys residue located in the consensus motif (ψKXE) of target proteins, where ψ is a hydrophobic amino acid residue usually Ile or Val and X can be any amino acid residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref003">3</xref>]. Similar to ubiquitin, SUMOs are synthesized as longer precursors and the glycine at the C-terminus of mature SUMO is exposed by a SUMO-specific isopeptidase. Then, SUMO’s C- terminus is activated by SUMO E1 activating enzyme using ATP, thereafter the activated SUMO is transferred to a cysteine of SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme. Finally, SUMO is ligated to the ε-amino group of a lysine residue in target proteins with the help of SUMO E3 ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>SIZ/PIAS (SAP and MIZ/Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT) is first identified and most well characterized SUMO E3 ligase in plants. The SAP, PINIT, SP-RING, SXS motif, and NLS domains are well conserved in all SIZ/PIAS proteins with each domain having a specific function. Additionally, SIZ/PIAS plant homologs possess a plant homeodomain (PHD) that is a zinc finger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref006">6</xref>]. Three additional E3 ligases have been identified in plants: RanBP2 (Ran binding protein), Pc2 (polycomb group), and NSE2/MMS21 (non-SMC element/methyl methanesulfonate sensitive). Very recently MMS21 from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has been characterized and is known to regulate drought tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Mutations in genes that encode E1 activating or E2 conjugating enzymes cause embryonic lethal phenotypes, suggesting that these genes are important for plant viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref008">8</xref>]. SUMO proteases, enzymes responsible to recycle free SUMO, are known to be involved in several regulatory pathways in plant development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref012">12</xref>], plant pathogen interaction for altering host cell defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref013">13</xref>], as well as in plant salt tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref015">15</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been found that the SIZ1 is known to regulate various vital processes in plants, one of which is response to several abiotic stresses. Most of studies reported till date have utilized knockout mutants to study the function of gene SIZ1. There is only one SIZ1 gene in Arabidopsis (i.e. <italic>AtSIZ1</italic>), and knockout mutants were found to be dwarf with increased <italic>PR1</italic> (Pathogenesis Related gene 1) expression, resistance to bacterial pathogens with an increased level of salicylic acid and hypersensitivity to phosphorus limited conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Rice homologs of AtSIZ1, OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2, share 51% and 43% sequence identity with AtSIZ1 at the amino acid level, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref017">17</xref>]. Additionally, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref017">17</xref>] showed that <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> and <italic>OsSIZ2</italic> partially complement the ABA hypersensitive phenotype of the At<italic>siz1</italic> mutant. <italic>AtSIZ1</italic> directly regulates plant growth and development through regulation of salicylic acid signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref011">11</xref>], progression of cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref018">18</xref>], and cytokinin signaling affecting proliferation of root cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref020">20</xref>]. <italic>AtSIZ1</italic> regulates salicylic acid signaling which in turn affects several processes such as cell division, expansion, flowering and innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Besides these, AtSIZ1 negatively regulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling via sumoylation of ABI5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref024">24</xref>], modulates the expression of various ABA and other abiotic stress responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref026">26</xref>]. siz1 knockout mutants showed enhanced ABA sensitivity and ABA induced gene expression. With the help of knockout mutant study it was found that SIZ1 is involved in sumoylation of nitrate which in turn positively affects nitrogen assimilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref027">27</xref>]. Many studies have shown that SIZ1 is involved in tolerance to various environmental stresses with the use of reverse genetics. Most of the studies were conducted on Arabidopsis SIZ1. AtSIZ1 is also known to regulate plant response to various environmental stresses including drought tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref028">28</xref>], heat tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref030">30</xref>] low temperature tolerance via sumoylation of ICE1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref031">31</xref>], phosphate (Pi) starvation via sumoylation of PHR1 (a myb transcription factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref032">32</xref>], excess copper tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref034">34</xref>], and salt stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref036">36</xref>] reported that overexpression of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> in creeping bentgrass enhances resistance to several abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, and Pi starvation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> in cotton improves both drought and heat tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>With all the studies doe till date, it is evident that SIZ1 is potentially involved in enhancing plant’s tolerance to several environmental stresses. Under natural conditions, plant survival is often challenged by two or more stresses at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref039">39</xref>]. Multiple stress tolerance can be achieved by using different strategies. One approach is the gene pyramiding approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref040">40</xref>], where co-expression of two or more genes concurrently can further increase multi-stress tolerance, second approach is to express transcription factor genes such as <italic>NAC</italic>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref041">41</xref>] or genes that can provide tolerance towards multiple stresses such as the <italic>mtID</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref042">42</xref>]. In the present study, we showed that overexpression of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> in Arabidopsis improves tolerance to drought, heat, and salt stress as transgenic plants were able to maintain higher chlorophyll content and generated greater seed yield than wild-type plants under these stresses individually or in combinations. Additionally, we have observed that, when grown under saline conditions, <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants accumulate less sodium ions in cytoplasm than wild-type plants, thereby avoiding the toxic effects of sodium ions in cytoplasm. Moreover, it was also observed that under both drought and salt stress conditions, <italic>O</italic>s<italic>SIZ1-</italic>transgenic plants expressed higher transcript level for the pyrroline 5-carboxylate synthase (a rate limiting enzyme in proline biosynthesis) than wild-type plants. This is an indication that enhanced performance of transgenic plants under salt and drought stresses might be due to synthesis of higher amounts of osmo-protectant, i.e. proline, which is consequently responsible for maintaining a low water potential in plant cells. Therefore, we believe that <italic>SIZ1</italic> can be used to improve multiple-stress tolerance in crop plants.</p>

<p>The Ubi-OsSIZ1 construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref036">36</xref>] provided to us by Dr. Hong Luo, Clemson University was transformed into <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> strain GV3101 and then the transformed strain containing the <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> gene was used to transform wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis (Col-0) using the “floral dip” method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref043">43</xref>]. The cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter driven <italic>bar</italic> gene coding for herbicide glufosinate ammonium (BASTA) resistance was used for selection of transgenic plants. A total of 20 independent transgenic lines were chosen for further analysis and homozygous plants were obtained by selecting the T<sub>2</sub> seeds on Murashige and Skoog (MS) media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref044">44</xref>] supplemented with 30 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> of BASTA (for selection of transgenic plants).</p>

<title>RNA blot and DNA blot analyses</title>
<p>Ten day-old Arabidopsis plants were ground in liquid nitrogen, and total RNAs were extracted by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Ten micrograms of the extracted RNAs were run on 1.2% (w/v) denaturing agarose gel and then transferred onto a BioTrans <sup>(+)</sup> nylon membrane (ICN Biochemicals). After cross-linking, nylon membrane was hybridized with P<sup>32</sup> labelled probes (<italic>OsSIZ1</italic> and <italic>Actin 8</italic>) under the condition described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref045">45</xref>]. After hybridization, nylon membranes were washed and then exposed to a Phosphor Imager screen for 24 h before data were collected. The <italic>Actin 8</italic> gene was used as the RNA loading control.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA was extracted using the CTAB DNA extraction method with minor modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref046">46</xref>]. Ten micrograms of DNA from both WT and two <italic>OsSIZ1-</italic>overexpressing lines were digested with <italic>Eco</italic> RI in 400 μl reaction volume according to the protocol (NEB, MA, and USA). After overnight digestion, DNA was precipitated using ethanol and dissolved into 33 μl of water, and mixed with 7 μl of 6X loading dye. The resultant 40 μl solution were loaded into 0.8% agarose gel for electrophoresis overnight. Thereafter, membrane transfer and DNA hybridization were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref047">47</xref>]. Two cDNA fragments of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> were used as the probes for DNA hybridization.</p>

<title>Preparation of radioactive labels and hybridization conditions</title>
<p>Gene-specific probes used for RNA blot analyses were designed as SIZ1-1, SIZ1-2 and Actin 8 that have lengths of 1056 bp, 663 bp, and 502 bp, respectively. The pHL080<italic>SIZ1</italic> construct was used as the template to amplify the two <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> fragments (i.e. SIZ-1 and SIZ-2) via PCR. An Arabidopsis cDNA library was used to amplify the <italic>Actin 8</italic> gene. Probe for DNA blot analysis was made by using the <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> gene fragments amplified by PCR. Two PCR products of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> were gel-purified and mixed in equal amounts and then used as templates for making probes. Random priming reaction was performed with the DECAprime™ II DNA Labeling Kit (Life Technologies) to radio-chemically label the PCR fragments using <sup>32</sup>P-α-dATP as the <sup>32</sup>P donor. The oligonucleotide primers used were ACT8_F and ACT8_R for <italic>Actin8</italic>, SIZ1-1_F, SIZ1-1_R and SIZ1-2_F, SIZ1-2_R for <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>. The hybridization conditions for both RNA blot analysis and DNA blot analysis were essentially the same as those described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref045">45</xref>].</p>

<title>Effects of heat stress on plant survival and reproductive development</title>
<p>To examine the effects of heat stress on hypocotyl elongation in darkness, stratified seeds were plated vertically on MS media and kept in darkness for 3 days and then plates were transferred to a temperature controlled incubator set at 45 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 h. After heat shock, plates were transferred back to a temperature of 22 <sup>o</sup>C in darkness and hypocotyl length was recorded one week after recovery under normal conditions (22 <sup>o</sup>C). To study the basal heat tolerance response in early seedling stages, seedling survival assay was done as described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref048">48</xref>]. Five days old horizontally grown seedlings on MS media were heat shocked (45 <sup>o</sup>C for 20 min) in a temperature controlled water bath and seedling survival was scored after a 7-day recovery period under normal conditions, and represented as a percentage of viable seedlings. Seedlings that were still green and producing new leaves were scored as surviving.</p>
<p>For heat stress treatment in soil, 4 weeks after germination, pots containing seedlings were transferred to a growth chamber that was set at 16 h/8 h photoperiod, 22 <sup>o</sup>C for 19 h and 37 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 h every day (12:00 noon– 5:00 pm). Pictures were taken 2 months after heat stress was started and rosette leaf samples were harvested for biochemical analyses. At the end of experiment, seed yield was measured for both WT and <italic>OsSIZ1-</italic>transgenic lines. Seed collectors were used to ensure no seed loss before harvesting. Experiment was repeated three times with 6 biological replicates for each genotype.</p>

<title>Effect of salinity stress on root growth and seed yield</title>
<p>For salt stress treatment, seeds were sterilized and stratified as described above and plated vertically on MS media. After 3 days, seedlings were transferred to MS media supplemented with 125 mM and 150 mM NaCl, respectively. Root lengths were measured 12 days after transferring to plates containing 125 mM NaCl. However, for plates supplemented with 150 mM NaCl, fresh weight of ten seedlings were measured one week after transferring for both WT and two <italic>OsSIZ1-</italic>transgenic lines as no significant root growth could be seen after transfer. For salt stress treatments in soil, three and a half weeks after germination, salt was applied incrementally from 50 mM NaCl (100 ml per pot, twice in 6 days), to 100 mM (twice in the next 6 days), and to 150 NaCl (three times in the next 9 days). Phenotypic differences were documented 21 days after incremental salt stress treatment and rosette leaves were sampled for biochemical analysis and RNA extraction for real time PCR experiments. Thereafter, plants were watered for 4 weeks with regular water and seed weight were measured for all genotypes at the end of experiment. Additionally, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ion contents in roots and shoots were analyzed for plants grown under both control and salt stress conditions as described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref049">49</xref>].

<title>Effects of drought stress on seed germination and seed yield</title>
<p>To examine the effect of drought stress on seed germination, seeds were plated on MS media containing 0.05 M (40%) polyethylene glycol (PEG-8000) and germination was scored every day for 2 weeks. PEG reduces water potential in plant growth media, creating a dehydration condition (osmotic stress) for plant growth. PEG containing plates were prepared according to the protocol from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref050">50</xref>]. For long term assays, WT and two <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic lines were grown under 22 <sup>o</sup>C, 16 h/8 h photoperiod in growth chamber for 3.5 weeks, and then watering was stopped for two weeks and rosette leaves were sampled for biochemical analysis and RNA extraction for real time PCR experiments. Pots were weighed before starting the drought stress to ensure that same amount of water is present in all pots. After two weeks of drought stress (no watering) treatment, plants were re-watered, then one day later plants were watered every two days, as opposed to control plants that were watered every other day until harvesting. At the end of experiment, seed yield was measured for all plants. Experiments were repeated three times with five biological replicates.</p>

<p>For combined heat and salt stress treatment, seeds were directly plated on the MS media supplemented with 100 mM NaCl and kept in growth chamber that was set at 30 <sup>o</sup>C and 16 h/8 h photoperiod. After 18 days, pictures were taken to document the phenotypic differences between WT and the two <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic lines, and root length was measured for all genotypes. Additionally, plants were sown in soil to determine the long-term effect of combined stresses of heat and salt. Four and a half weeks after germination, plants were transferred to growth chamber that was set at 22 <sup>o</sup>C for 19 h and 37 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 h (12:00 noon -5:00 pm) per day with a photoperiod of 16 h light and 8 h night. Salt was applied incrementally starting from 50 mM NaCl (150 ml per pot, three times in 6 days), to 100 mM (three times in the next 6 days), and thereafter plants were watered with normal water until harvesting. Pictures were taken 18 days after the start of incremental salt stress treatment<strike>s</strike> to document the phenotypic differences between the WT and <italic>OsSIZ1-</italic>transgenic plants.

<title>Creation and molecular characterization of OsSIZ1-overexpressing plants</title>
<p>Wild-type Arabidopsis (Col-0) plants were transformed with Agrobacterium using the floral dip method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref043">43</xref>]. A total of 20 independent T<sub>0</sub> transgenic plants were obtained. Thereafter, T<sub>1</sub> seeds were screened on MS plates supplemented with 30 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> BASTA. T<sub>2</sub> to T<sub>4</sub> homozygous plants were obtained for transgenic lines by selecting the transgenic plants on MS media supplemented with BASTA. RNA blot analysis was carried out to confirm the lines expressing the <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> gene. One such RNA blot is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. Two high expression lines, SIZ1-3 and SIZ1-5, were chosen for further analyses. DNA blot analysis was performed using an <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> cDNA fragment as probe to determine the copy number of transgene. It appears that the SIZ1-5 line contains just one copy of the <italic>OsSIZ</italic>1 transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), whereas the SIZ1-3 line displayed three bands in the DNA blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating the presence of 3 copies of the <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> transgene. However, on MS media supplemented with BASTA, this line gave a 3:1 segregation ratio of resistant plants vs. sensitive plants at T<sub>1</sub> generation, therefore, it might be a single T-DNA insertion event, but the T-DNA went through a tandem duplication twice before or after insertion.</p>

<title>Overexpression of OsSIZ1 in Arabidopsis makes plants more tolerant to high temperatures at seedling and adult stages</title>
<p>Higher temperatures can negatively affect all stages of plant life including germination, development, and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref055">55</xref>]. We studied the response of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants when grown under higher temperatures. Under normal temperature conditions of around 23 <sup>o</sup>C, we did not observe significant differences between control and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants in hypocotyl length at seedling stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g002">Fig 2A &amp; 2C</xref>). In contrast, the hypocotyl lengths of seedlings exposed to heat stress (45 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 h) were 57% and 54% longer in transgenic lines SIZ1-3 and SIZ1-5, respectively, when compared to WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g002">Fig 2B &amp; 2C</xref>). In addition, the heat stress tolerance in photosynthetically active seedlings was evaluated as a function of seedling survival after imposition of heat stress. Seedlings that remain green and actively growing after heat shock (45 <sup>o</sup>C for 20 min) were considered to be viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). It was observed that only 13% of WT seedlings could survive after heat shock, whereas transgenic lines SIZ1-3 and SIZ1-5 displayed 32% and 34% survival rates, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). No significant differences were observed between WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants when grown under normal temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g002">Fig 2D &amp; 2F</xref>). Long term effect of heat stress was also evaluated by exposing soil grown plants under heat stress conditions. Plants were grown under normal condition for 4 weeks and no differences were observed between WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants (data not shown). Then these plants were transferred to a growth chamber that was set for heat stress treatment (37 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 h per day), we found that one month after heat stress started, most flowers in WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants were sterile and only a few siliques could be generated. Despite this, <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic lines generated 40–43% higher seed yield than WT plants under that condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g002">Fig 2H &amp; 2I</xref>). No significant differences in seed yield were observed between WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants when grown under normal temperature conditions (22 <sup>o</sup>C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g002">Fig 2G &amp; 2I</xref>).</p>

<title>Overexpression of OsSIZ1 significantly improves salt tolerance in Arabidopsis</title>
<p>We analyzed the salt tolerance of WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants using short term assays on MS plates and long term assays with soil grown plants. We did not observe significant differences in root lengths between WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants when plants were grown on MS media without NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). However, with 125 mM NaCl in media, <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants performed significantly better than WT plants by having 52–53% longer root length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g003">Fig 3B &amp; 3D</xref>). With 150 mM NaCl media, more than 90% of WT seedlings became chlorotic after one week of salt treatment, generating ~70% less fresh weight than <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g003">Fig 3C &amp; 3E</xref>). For soil grown plants, before starting the salt stress treatments, no differences were observed between the WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201716.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). However, after incremental application of salt solution (50 mM NaCl twice in 6 days, 100 mM NaCl twice in the next 6 days, and 150 mM NaCl three times in the next 9 days), WT plants became withered due to salt stress while <italic>OsSIZ1-</italic>transgenic plants were much healthier. <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants generated ~79% greater seed yield than WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g003">Fig 3G &amp; 3H</xref>).

<title>OsSIZ1-transgenic plants exclude Na<sup>+</sup> ions from cytoplasm better than WT plants and accumulate higher K<sup>+</sup> ions</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-overexpression on ion contents in transgenic plants, sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) contents were analyzed in roots and shoots of WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants grown under normal and salt stress conditions. It was found that WT plants accumulated ~40% higher Na<sup>+</sup> content in shoots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and ~45% higher Na<sup>+</sup> content in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) as compared to <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants. It appears that <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants have higher ability to exclude Na<sup>+</sup> ions from plant cells than WT plants.

<title>Overexpression of OsSIZ1 in Arabidopsis significantly improves germination and seed yield under water deficit conditions</title>
<p>To study the effect of water deficit stress on seed germination, seeds of WT plants and two <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic lines were plated on MS media containing polyethylene glycol (PEG-8000). PEG is known to induce low water potential in growth media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref050">50</xref>], thereby creating a water deficit stress condition. Because PEG prevents polymerization of agar, it was added as an overlay solution to agar media (sterilized liquid MS media with PEG added after autoclaving). Forty percent PEG-8000 (0.5M) was added to the MS media, creating a water potential of -0.7 MPa. We did not observe differences in germination between WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants when grown on MS media without PEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g005">Fig 5A &amp; 5C</xref>), but germination was significantly affected with the addition of PEG in the media. The <italic>OsSIZ1-</italic>transgenic lines showed an average of 64% higher germination rate as compared to that of WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g005">Fig 5B &amp; 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Long term effect of water deficit stress was investigated with soil grown plants. Three and a half weeks after germination, plants were fully watered and no differences could be distinguished between <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic and WT plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201716.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). However, once watering was stopped for two weeks, significant differences were seen between <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic and WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Thereafter, plants were allowed to recover for 24 h after re-watering, almost 50% of WT plants could not recover, yet ~ 95% of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants recovered from drought stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants generated 64% higher seed yield than WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). In comparison, no differences were observed between WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants when grown under full irrigation conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201716.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>OsSIZ1-transgenic plants outperformed wild-type plants under combined stresses of heat and salt</title>
<p>In nature, multiple stresses can occur simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref056">56</xref>]. Moreover, salinity stress gets intensified under high temperature conditions due to increased evapo-transpiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref057">57</xref>], causing a greater loss in crop yields. To test how <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants would perform under multiple stress conditions, seeds of WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants were plated on MS media supplemented with 100 mM NaCl and plates were kept in growth chamber adjusted to 30 <sup>o</sup>C as opposed to an optimal temperature of 22 <sup>o</sup>C. It was observed that after 2 weeks of growth, the root length of WT plants were significantly reduced as compared to that of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g006">Fig 6B &amp; 6C</xref>). In contrast, no significant differences in root length could be seen between WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic seedlings grown under normal conditions (i.e. MS plates without NaCl and kept at 22 <sup>o</sup>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). For plants grown in soil for 4.5 weeks under normal conditions, no phenotypic differences were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Then these plants were transferred to a growth chamber that was set at 37 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 h per day (12:00 noon to 5:00 pm), and salt was applied incrementally from 50 mM NaCl (three times in 6 days) to 100 mM NaCl (three times in the next 6 days). We then found that the growth of WT plants was severely inhibited, many were dead, and those survived produced fewer siliques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g007">Fig 7B &amp; 7C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>OsSIZ</italic>1-transgenic plants were much larger in sizes, 100% survived, and produced far more siliques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g007">Fig 7C &amp; 7D</xref>).</p>

<title>OsSIZ1-transgenic plants demonstrated enhanced performance than wild-type plants under combined stresses of heat and water deficit</title>
<p>Heat and drought stresses often occur at the same time, therefore they are the most common combination of abiotic stresses in nature, which can cause detrimental effects on crop yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref056">56</xref>]. To study the effect of combined heat and drought/osmotic stresses on plants, seeds of WT and two <italic>OsSIZ1-</italic>transgenic lines were directly plated on MS media supplemented with 300 mM mannitol and soon after plating, plates were kept in an incubator that was set at 37 <sup>o</sup>C for 48 h, then these plates were returned to normal temperature condition (22 <sup>o</sup>C). We observed that even two weeks after returning to normal temperature, only 10–15% of WT seeds germinated, however almost ~100% of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants germinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g008">Fig 8A &amp; 8B</xref>). No differences in germination could be seen between WT and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants grown under normal conditions (MS media) and under mannitol caused osmotic stress conditions (MS media with 300 mM mannitol) (data not shown). To study the long-term effect of combined stresses of heat and drought, WT and Os<italic>SIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants were grown in soil under normal conditions for 4.5 weeks (picture not shown), then plants were transferred to a growth chamber that was set at 37 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 h every day and watering was stopped for a week. We observed that almost half of WT plants died, and the remaining ones were severely withered, yet 100% of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants survived under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g008">Fig 8C &amp; 8D</xref>). Also, most WT plants that survived could not recover after re-watering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g008">Fig 8E</xref>), and the ones that did recover produced ~70% less yield than <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g008">Fig 8F</xref>).

<title>OsSIZ1-transgenic plants are more efficient in scavenging reactive oxygen species and have higher proline content</title>
<p>Abiotic stresses usually lead to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that in turn cause oxidative damages in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref056">56</xref>]. Increased peroxidation and degradation of lipids were reported in plants growing under environmental stresses, and malondialdehyde (MDA) is one of the final products of peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref059">59</xref>]. We observed that WT plants produced 35%, 50%, and 30% higher MDA content under salt, drought, and heat stress conditions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). To alleviate the damages caused by ROS, plants have evolved several mechanisms to scavenge ROS. One scavenger molecule of ROS is anthocyanin, a flavonoid, which is an important molecule responsible for detoxification of ROS. We observed that <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants accumulated 42%, 38% and 37% more anthocyanin as compared to WT plants under salt, drought, and heat stress conditions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). Increased production of anthocyanin, a ROS scavenger, might be one of the reasons for decreased MDA content in <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants. Furthermore, <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants were shown to have significantly higher proline content than wild-type plants under salt, drought, and heat stress conditions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). Because proline is an amino acid that can protect plant cells under various abiotic stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref061">61</xref>], therefore <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants have a higher capacity to deal with ROS under abiotic stress conditions.</p>

<title>OsSIZ1-transgenic plants do not respond to osmotic stress alone</title>
<p>To test if <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> overexpression is involved in enhancing osmotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis, three days old seedlings of wild-type and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic lines were transferred to MS plates supplemented with 250 mM mannitol, a non-metabolizable sugar that could cause non-ionic osmotic stress in plants. We did not observe significant differences between wild-type and <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants in root length on MS media with or without mannitol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201716.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). However, root lengths were significantly reduced in the presence of mannitol in all genotypes as compared to under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201716.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants do not respond to mannitol caused osmotic stress alone in root growth at seedling stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201716.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). However, when osmotic stress imposed by mannitol was combined with heat stress, germination was significantly inhibited in WT plants as compared to <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).</p>

<title>Enhanced expression of stress related genes in OsSIZ1-transgenic plants under abiotic stress conditions</title>
<p>Both drought stress and salt stress impose an osmotic stress that can lead to loss of turgor in plant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref062">62</xref>]. Plants respond to these stresses by activating expression of a group of stress related genes.

The expression of <italic>P5CS</italic> that encodes the pyrroline 5-carboxylate synthase (a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of proline) was reported to be increased by various abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref065">65</xref>], and indeed our real time PCR analysis indicated that the <italic>P5CS</italic> transcript was higher in <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants under salt and drought stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g010">Fig 10D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Drought, heat and salt stresses are the three major abiotic stresses adversely affecting crop yields worldwide. In natural conditions, these stresses come alone or in various combinations at different stages of plant development. Considering the devastating effects caused by the multiple stresses, there is an urgent need to develop crops that can tolerate multiple stresses with minimal yield loss. Here we report that transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> display improved tolerance to salt, heat and drought separately and in combinations as compared to wild-type plants. Under heat stress conditions, transgenic plants outperformed wild-type plants by displaying better hypocotyl length, seedling survival and seed yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Under salt stress conditions, <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants demonstrated better root growth and higher seed yield than wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g003">Fig 3</xref>), and they are able to exclude Na<sup>+</sup> more efficiently than wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Under drought stress, transgenic plants outperformed wild-type plants by exhibiting better germination rates and higher seed yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Also, <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants performed significantly better than wild-type plants under combined stress conditions such as heat plus salt (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g006">6</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g007">7</xref>) and heat plus drought (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Although it was known that overexpression of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> could increase drought and heat tolerance in transgenic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref037">37</xref>], discovering that overexpression of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> could also increase salt tolerance was a surprise to us. Transgenic plants expressing <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> gene were found to tolerate abiotic stresses much better than those of wild type plants. At the same time, they were able to maintain the seed yield or showed less penalty than wild type plants in terms of seed yield. It is really a good candidate to improve production in cereals where seed is economically important part of plants. Our study with overexpression of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> in Arabidopsis indicate that there does not appear a penalty for transgenic plants under normal growth conditions, yet under salt, drought, and heat stress conditions, overexpression of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> provides an indisputable edge for transgenic plants, an indication that the <italic>OsSIZ</italic>1 gene has the great potential to be used for crop’s improvement.</p>
<p>One of major consequences of plant response to abiotic stresses is the production of ROS. Accumulation of ROS in plant cells can lead to oxidation of various cellular components such as proteins and lipids, leading to enzyme inactivation or inhibition, resulting in degradation of chlorophyll and eventually cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref066">66</xref>]. <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants are able to handle ROS more effectively as they can maintain higher chlorophyll content under salt, drought, and heat conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). One consequence of plant response to abiotic stresses is the production of MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation by ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref067">67</xref>]. In this study, we found that although MDA content increased under salt, drought, and heat stress conditions, <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants produced much less MDA as compared to that of wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g009">Fig 9B</xref>), again supporting that transgenic plants can scavenge ROS better than those of wild-type plants. One plausible reason for <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants to scavenge ROS more efficiently is that they have higher capacity to remove ROS. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants produced more anthocyanin pigment, an effective ROS scavenger under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). Our study with <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-tranegnic cotton showed that transcript levels of several antioxidant genes such as <italic>APX</italic>, <italic>SOD</italic>, and <italic>GST</italic> were higher in <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic cotton plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref037">37</xref>], a result that is consistent with the discovery in this study. Production of osmoprotectants is one of the strategies adopted by plants to cope up with the damaging effects of water deficit stress. Both drought and salt stress impose conditions of dehydration stress, as under drought stress, no water is available to plants, and under salt stress, plants cannot take up water from soil due to decreased water potential in soil solution. Osmoprotectants such as proline are known to reduce the cellular water potential, thereby preserving water in the cell and maintaining turgor pressure in plant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref068">68</xref>]. Under salt, drought, and heat stress conditions, <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants are able to maintain a higher level of proline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g009">Fig 9D</xref>), another reason why <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants can perform better than wild-type plants under salt, drought and heat stress conditions.</p>
<p>It is not completely clear why overexpression of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> could confer multi-stress tolerance in transgenic plants. Because SIZ1 protein is located in the nucleus of plant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref072">72</xref>], it is likely that one of the major functions of SIZ1 is to activate transcriptional factors that in turn activate expression of a battery of stress related genes. It was shown that AtSIZ1 could regulate the transcriptional factor ABI5 and ICE1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref031">31</xref>] a clear indication that SIZ1 serves as a master regulator that controls expression of many genes. We analyzed transcripts of a few stress related genes and we found that their transcripts were indeed higher in <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants than those in wild-type plants. For example, the transcripts of <italic>RD29A</italic> and <italic>RD29B</italic> were enhanced in <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g010">Fig 10A and 10B</xref>). The transcript of <italic>P5CS</italic>, a gene encoding the rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of proline, was also higher in <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants than that in wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g010">Fig 10D</xref>), which explains why the proline content was higher in <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g009">Fig 9D</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the Arabidopsis <italic>siz1</italic> mutant displays multi-facet deficiencies in plant growth and development, plant response to abiotic stresses, and plant cellular metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref032">32</xref>] the increased multi-stress tolerance by overexpression of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> transgenic plants could involve several potential mechanisms. For example, <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> transgenic plants could exclude more Na<sup>+</sup> from the cytoplasm and at the same time accumulate higher amounts of K<sup>+</sup> ions in both roots and shoots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201716.g004">Fig 4</xref>), suggesting that <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-transgenic plants might use both low- and high-affinity systems for K<sup>+</sup> uptake. Sodium ions have a more damaging effect as once Na<sup>+</sup> gets into the cytoplasm, it inhibits the activities of many enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0201716.ref073">73</xref>]. Therefore, we speculate that SIZ1 can activate either K<sup>+</sup> transporters such as HKT1 or Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters on the plasma membrane such as SOS1. However, further studies are needed to confirm the potential action of SIZ1 (or OsSIZ1) on ion transporters and antiporters. Although we could not provide a mechanistic understanding of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic>-mediated multi-stress tolerance in transgenic plants at this time, the benefits of <italic>OsSIZ1</italic> overexpression in transgenic plants are obvious.</p>
