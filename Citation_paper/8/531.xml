<abstract>
<p>How instructive signals are translated into robust and predictable changes in growth is a central question in developmental biology. Recently, much interest has centered on the feedback between chemical instructions and mechanical changes for pattern formation in development. In plants, the patterned arrangement of aerial organs, or phyllotaxis, is instructed by the phytohormone auxin; however, it still remains to be seen how auxin is linked, at the apex, to the biochemical and mechanical changes of the cell wall required for organ outgrowth. Here, using Atomic Force Microscopy, we demonstrate that auxin reduces tissue rigidity prior to organ outgrowth in the shoot apex of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and that the de-methyl-esterification of pectin is necessary for this reduction. We further show that development of functional organs produced by pectin-mediated ectopic wall softening requires auxin signaling. Lastly, we demonstrate that coordinated localization of the auxin transport protein, PIN1, is disrupted in a naked-apex produced by increasing cell wall rigidity. Our data indicates that a feedback loop between the instructive chemical auxin and cell wall mechanics may play a crucial role in phyllotactic patterning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patterns in nature have always fascinated humans, from children to scientists. As exemplified by the seminal work of Alan Turing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Turing1">[1]</xref>, scientists of diverse disciplines have all attempted to explain biological patterns within their own frameworks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Cho1">[2]</xref>. Within the field of developmental biology, these disciplines have been interacting more and more to provide richer details for patterning mechanisms, a trend which will surely continue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Reinitz1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Howard1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Urdy1">[5]</xref>. One of the most riveting proposals of Turing is that models explaining morphogenesis should consist of 'two parts, the mechanical and the chemical' <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Turing1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Howard1">[4]</xref>; using this simple statement as a starting point, we have undertaken to examine how a chemical signal, it's chemical responses, and it's mechanical outputs combine in plant patterning to provide a mechano-chemical regulatory loop.</p>
<p>The pattern of aerial organs in plants, or phyllotaxis, is highly regulated. Within the past ∼10 years a picture has emerged of the instructive mechanism for phyllotaxis: regulated distribution and accumulation of the phytohormone auxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Smith1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Braybrook1">[7]</xref>. Through a series of biological and computational approaches it has been demonstrated that the correct distribution of auxin by its efflux transport proteins, the PIN family, is necessary and sufficient (<italic>in silico</italic>) for the establishment of phyllotactic patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Reinhardt1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Smith2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-deReuille1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Jnsson1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Bainbridge1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Krupinski1">[13]</xref>. The emergence of new organs, once positioned by auxin, requires precisely regulated cell expansion. Since cell expansion is mechanically limited by the cell wall, organ emergence ultimately requires changes in the cell wall chemistry or structure that then affect its mechanical properties. A large and historically rich body of evidence indicates that auxin can induce changes in the cell wall mechanical properties, largely through supposed acidification of the cell wall compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Cosgrove1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Burgert1">[15]</xref>. The acidification of the cell wall is thought to trigger enhanced activity of several wall modifying agents leading to enhanced elastic and viscoelastic behaviors (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Verbelen1">[16]</xref>). In shoot apices, the wall modifying agent expansin has been demonstrated to trigger organ formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Fleming1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Pien1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Reinhardt2">[19]</xref>, and the alteration of pectin de-methyl-esterification in cell walls is necessary and sufficient for organ formation in wild-type apices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle1">[20]</xref>; however, observations of auxin induced changes in cell wall mechanics in the shoot apex have remained elusive. Recent work also suggests that regulated auxin transport may be effected either by tissue mechanics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Heisler1">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Hamant1">22</xref>, by the mechanical integrity of the cell wall itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Feraru1">[23]</xref>, or by mechanical strain in the cell wall and membrane ultimately affecting auxin transporter delivery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Nakayama1">[24]</xref> - implying the existence of a mechano-chemical regulatory loop in plant organ development.</p>
<p>Within this work we will focus on a particular mechanical property of the cell wall, elasticity (hereafter referred to as its converse, rigidity), its regulation by auxin, and how it relates to organ growth. The relationship between cell wall rigidity and cell growth is correlative at best. There is a body of work indicating that auxin affects rigidity of plant tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Cleland1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Cleland2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Tagawa1">[27]</xref>, and there are numerous examples of correlations between tissue rigidity and growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Cleland1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Proseus1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Kierzkowski1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Otto1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peters1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Braybrook2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Hofte1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Uhrstrm1">[35]</xref>. The closest we have come recently to direct evidence of elasticity effecting growth lies in manipulating the chemistry of the pectin matrix, effecting rigidity, and seeing changes in organ emergence in the apex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>. Indeed, even here there is debate: how could the cell wall matrix control growth when we know that cellulose fibers are the load bearing component of the wall? Interestingly, there is a wealth of evidence pointing to a role for pectins in plant growth although the idea has been limited to the field of algal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Hofte1">[33]</xref> or lost in history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Cleland2">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Cleland3">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Cleland4">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Ordin1">38</xref>. We have recently discussed several possible ways that changes in the mechanical properties of the pectin matrix could alter higher plant growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Braybrook2">[32]</xref>. In the following work, we focus on further exploring the idea that changes in the pectin matrix, and cell wall elasticity, are essential for growth in plants.</p>
<p>Within this work, we use Atomic Force Microscopy on living <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> meristems to study the relationship between auxin signaling, pectin de-methyl-esterification, and cell wall rigidity. We demonstrate that auxin induces a reduction in cell wall rigidity at the shoot apex. We show that this process strictly requires de-methyl-esterification of the pectin homogalacturonan (HG), and that inhibition of HG de-methyl-esterification disrupts organized polarity of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1). We also demonstrate that while de-methyl-esterification of pectin alone is sufficient to induce local tissue growth in the meristem, auxin signaling is required for the formation of a fully structured organ- supporting the presence of a mechano-chemical regulatory loop between auxin and organ outgrowth.</p>

<title>Auxin induces a decrease in cell wall rigidity prior to organ emergence</title>
<p>Previous observations have demonstrated that cell walls in the Arabidopsis inflorescence shoot apex displayed a reduced rigidity at emerged and incipient organ sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>. Based on the wealth of knowledge surrounding the role of auxin in organ positioning and emergence, we investigated whether auxin was sufficient to trigger a reduction in cell wall rigidity (measured as a reduction in cell wall apparent Young's modulus (E<sub>A</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>). We used an auxin efflux carrier mutant, <italic>pin1</italic>, which displays an organ free apex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Okada1">[39]</xref>, as a template to examine auxin induced changes in wall mechanics. As shown previously, local application of the natural auxin Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) rescued organ formation, with bulges becoming visible after ∼24–30 h and full organs after 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Reinhardt1">[8]</xref>); bulging was defined as an AFM-detectable change in surface topology. Interestingly, a decrease in cell wall rigidity was observed surrounding the position of auxin application as early as 18 h post application, before any detected bulging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g001">Fig. 1C, 1D, 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Note that <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s004">Figure S4</xref> diagrams the application site relative to the area analyzed by AFM. In order to assess the bias introduced by sample curvature, fake silicon <italic>pin1</italic> meristems were produced which would mimic sample geometry, but have uniform rigidity (for further details see Technical Discussion). The analysis and comparison of representative samples may be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s005">Figure S5</xref>; in summary, geometrical bias was minimal compared to biological changes induced by IAA.</p>

<p>As previously shown in wild type incipient organ sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>, rigidity changes were only observed with AFM tips loaded with 5 µm spherical tips (n = 13/13) and not with 1 µm spherical tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g001">Fig. 1B, 1D, 1E</xref> vs. 1C, 1D, 1F, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s003">Fig. S3</xref>); there is a strong possibility that this discrepancy reflects changes occurring first in subepidermal tissues or non-surface walls, a hypothesis also supported by chemical and genetic data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>. Neither mechanical changes nor organ formation occurred when inactivated IAA was applied to <italic>pin1</italic> apices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). This data provides direct evidence for measurable changes in cell wall rigidity, after auxin application in shoot apices, which presage organ outgrowth.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Auxin induces local de-methyl-esterification of HG in subepidermal tissues</title>
<p>Since organ formation was previously shown to be dependent on the de-methyl-esterification of HG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>, we next analyzed the HG methyl-esterification status in <italic>pin1</italic> apices following IAA application using immunolocalization of de-methyl-esterification by the anti-body 2F4. We observed 2F4 labeling locally below the auxin application site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>), whereas no such changes were observed for the mock-treated samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). 2F4 labeling was only detected in subepidermal tissues, consistent with a proposed decreased rigidity in deeper tissue layers. These observations were also consistent with observed 2F4 labeling in wild-type shoot apices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>. These data indicate that auxin acts, in part, by triggering the de-methyl-esterification of HG, causing a decrease in wall rigidity.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Inhibition of HG de-methyl-esterification blocks auxin induced organ formation</title>
<p>To confirm that HG de-methyl-esterification takes place downstream of auxin accumulation during organ formation, we attempted a rescue experiment on apices overexpressing an inducible form of the <italic>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR3</italic> gene (<italic>PMEI3oe</italic>); the PMEI3 enzyme acts to block HG de-methyl-esterification and rigidifies cell walls in the shoot apex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>. As shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>, induced <italic>PMEI3oe</italic> lines display an organ-free <italic>pin1</italic>-like meristem upon induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Local IAA applications on these naked meristems failed to induce organ formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, 72 h post application). IAA application on <italic>pin1</italic> meristems in the presence of the inducer (EtOH) stimulated organ formation normally (data not shown). These results establish that the inhibition of HG de-methyl-esterification blocks organ formation despite the local accumulation of auxin, thereby confirming the position of de-methyl-esterification of HG downstream of auxin in organ formation.</p>

<p>To test if IAA application on induced <italic>PMEI3oe</italic> naked apices could trigger changes in tissue mechanics even though no organs were formed, we measured mechanical properties of such apices ∼18 hours after application. No changes in rigidity were observed around the application site in either IAA treated or mock treated apices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g002">Fig. 2C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s006">Fig. S6</xref>).

<title>Local HG de-methyl-esterification is sufficient for local tissue outgrowth, but not whole organ development, in the absence of functional auxin transport</title>
<p>Next we tested if HG de-methyl-esterification alone could induce organ formation in the absence of auxin transport. We achieved local HG de-methyl-esterification on naked <italic>pin1</italic> meristems by applying PECTIN METHYLESTERASE (PME) -loaded beads; the PME enzyme acts to de-methyl-esterifiy HG. PME application triggered the formation of bumps or stick-like projections, but these did not develop further into functional lateral organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g003">Fig. 3B, 3C, 3E, 3F</xref>). No such bumps were observed upon application of denatured PME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g003">Fig. 3A, 3D</xref>). Thus, in the absence of auxin transport, de-methyl-esterification of HG was only able to cause local tissue growth but not full organ formation.</p>

<title>Coordinated local organization of the auxin transporter PIN1 is affected by inhibition of HG de-methyl-esterification</title>
<p>Since organ formation induced by de-methyl-esterification of HG required auxin transport, we next investigated a possible loop linking HG de-methyl-esterification and polar auxin transport. The existence of such a loop was suggested by the phenotype of recovering <italic>PMEI3oe</italic> apices; when <italic>PMEI3oe</italic> plants were allowed to recover from induction, the new organs did not follow the normal phyllotactic pattern and presented abnormal sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g004">Fig. 4A, 4B</xref> vs. 4C, 4D).

In contrast to these scenarios, <italic>PMEI3oe</italic> naked apices have functional auxin transporters. To test if the absence of HG de-methyl-esterification could alter auxin transport we immunolocalized PIN1 in <italic>PMEI3oe</italic> induced apices. In <italic>PMEI3oe</italic> lines, PIN1 presented disorganized polarity in the epidermis whereas in non-transgenic plants it presented areas of coordinated polar intracellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g004">Fig. 4E</xref> vs. 4F, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s009">Fig. S9</xref>). In <italic>PMEI3oe</italic> meristems, PIN1 could be observed in adjacent membranes of two neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>), a phenomenon not seen in non-transgenic apices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Additionally, no PIN1 convergence points could be detected consistent with a lack of organ formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s009">Fig. S9</xref>). In order to more quantitatively examine PIN polarity, we measured the ratio of cells with a unique PIN carrying wall to those with multiple PIN carrying walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>); In <italic>PMEI3oe</italic> plants this ratio was close to 1 indicating that most cells have multiple PIN walls. To look at PIN coordination between cells, we measured the fraction of neighboring cells displaying PIN orientation within 20° of a given reference cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g004">Fig. 4H</xref>). While non-transgenic apices displayed and average of ∼0.65 correlation, this was reduced to ∼0.2 in induced <italic>PMEI3oe</italic> apices.

<title>Biological Discussion</title>
<p>Here we provide evidence that local accumulation of auxin in the shoot apex leads to tissue softening and, thus, organ outgrowth.

Here we demonstrate that auxin triggers changes in cell wall mechanics at the shoot apex, providing direct evidence for a long assumed link between auxin and new organ emergence.</p>
<p>Within the past 25 years several key components in auxin-mediated changes in cell mechanics have emerged, including the cell wall loosening expansins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Fleming1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Pien1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-McQueenMason1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-McQueenMason2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Cosgrove2">[54]</xref>, Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs/XETs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-VanSandt1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Fry1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Kaku1">[57]</xref>, and polygalacturaonases (PG). With respect to new organs, expansin expression is indicative of organ formation at the apex, and ectopic expansin activity can trigger organ formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Fleming1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Pien1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Reinhardt2">[19]</xref>. Interestingly, the cell wall matrix is also critical as changes in the cell wall pectin matrix chemistry, the de-methyl-esterification of HG, are necessary and sufficient for new organ emergence at the shoot apex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle1">[20]</xref>;these changes in pectin chemistry alter the elastic mechanical properties of the cell wall under nano-indentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>. Here, we demonstrate that auxin leads to tissue softening through the de-methyl-esterification of HG and that this chemical modification of the cell wall is required for auxin-induced organ formation. As we have previously discussed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Braybrook2">[32]</xref>, the tissue softening associated with organ formation likely results from a combination of changes in the cell wall catalyzed by agents such as expansins, XET, PGs, and PME/PMEIs; however, it appears that the modification of the pectin matrix is either a major component of the measured softening or a required trigger (see Technical Discussion for more detail).</p>
<p>One of the most striking results of this study is that auxin signaling acts through a mechanical bottle-neck, namely de-methyl-esterification of HG. This implies that the complex suite of changes induced by auxin within the apex cannot proceed without HG-mediated changes in cell wall rigidity; there is evidence that pectin rigidity (as implied by de-methyl-esterification status) can limit the action of agents such as expansin in other tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Zhao1">[58]</xref>. There also exists evidence that the selective methylation and de-methylation (methyltransfer) of existing pectins within the cell wall may be involved in cell expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Cleland4">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Ordin1">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, calcium has been shown to inhibit elasticity in hypocotyls, again hinting at an important regulatory role for pectic complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Tagawa1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Another interesting observation arising from the work here is that physical modification of the wall mechanics alone via pectin, in the absence of functional auxin transport, was unable to yield a functional organ. These data imply that auxin action is required to trigger mechanical changes and <italic>also</italic> for developmental processes after initial mechanical bulging and/or other necessary mechanical changes, e.g. expansin activity (Schematic, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g004">Fig. 4I</xref>).</p>
<p>That blocking HG de-methyl-esterification disrupted organized PIN1 polarity indicates that mechanical changes within the apex may in turn control correct auxin distribution. This is supported by recent evidence that PIN1 can respond to changes in tissue mechanics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Heisler1">[21]</xref>, that PIN1 polarity requires cell wall integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Feraru1">[23]</xref>, and that changes in cell wall and membrane strain affect PIN1 polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Nakayama1">[24]</xref>. The induced <italic>PMEIoe</italic> naked apex had a functional auxin transport system, but it was disorganized- perhaps due to uniform wall mechanics, a lack of organs to act as organizers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Smith1">[6]</xref>, a lack of differential growth which may organize PIN1 through tissue stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Heisler1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Hamant1">[22]</xref>, or a combination of all. It is clear that upon release of PMEI activity, the apices regained competence to form organs although sizing and patterning was initially affected. These recovery phenotypes would be consistent with an apex with disorganized PIN1 being allowed to 'soften' due to auxin accumulation in random places, which then could feedback onto PIN polarity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Heisler1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Hamant1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Feraru1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Nakayama1">[24]</xref> and stabilize organ size and phyllotaxis.</p>
<p>But what does the presence of this regulatory loop between auxin and tissue bulging mean? Phyllotactic patterning is extremely robust <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Mirabet1">[59]</xref>; a mechano-chemical loop may provide a robust feedback mechanism that could help to control and buffer phyllotactic patterning at the apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057813-g004">Fig. 4I</xref>). Since the auxin transporter PIN1 appears to respond to mechanical cues, it is also possible that the mechanical map of the meristem (areas of rigidity and softening) help to coordinate PIN1 polartiy and localization. As hypothesized previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>, the wild-type meristem displays areas of softening that begin in subepidermal layers, but rapidly progress to the epidermis during organ growth- where PIN1 is localized. The altered strain that could result from such changes in rigidity, could in turn effect cell membrane strain/stress, and thus effect PIN1 polarity as suggested recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Nakayama1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>This type of patterning mechanism, requiring the active directional transport of an instructive chemical signal and the mechanical changes it induces, both invokes historical ideas and inspires future directions; indeed, further exploration of mechano-chemical regulatory loops in developmental biology will likely provide a rich landscape of interdisciplinary hypotheses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Howard1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Urdy1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Cassereau1">[60]</xref>.</p>

<title>Technical Discussion</title>
<p>AFM-based nano indentation has only recently been applied to plant cells and tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Hayot1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Fernandes1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Radoti1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Milani1">[64]</xref>, as such many technical questions arise from its application (Note that we define nano indentation based upon the precision of the AFM vertical movement and the sub micrometer depth of indentations performed). We will attempt to discuss some of these points here (More discussion can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Braybrook2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>). First, what structural part of the cell wall contributes to the measured properties? For the scale of the experiments presented here, a large part of the data likely comes from the pectin matrix either directly or indirectly by influencing the behavior of embedded cellulose fibers. This is supported by immunocytochemistry and genetic manipulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>. Thus, it appears as though the rigidity of the pectin matrix has a large influence on the patterning of growth. Discussion on how changes in pectin rigidity might influence cell growth mechanics may be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Braybrook2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Hofte1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Second, are indentations perpendicular to the axis of growth informative? AFM tips indent tissues and cell wall segments perpendicular to the tissue surface, and in many tissues this is also perpendicular to the major growth axis. Based on the hypothesis that the rigidity data presented here is majorly influenced by the pectin matrix, it is likely that data perpendicular to the axis of growth is highly relevant; as a gel, the pectin matrix should behave as a relatively isotropic material under indentation and thus its properties perpendicular to the growth axis very close to those along it. In addition, within the meristem organ outgrowth will occur perpendicular to the surface as organ emergence is a plane-breaking phenomenon. As such, data on wall properties perpendicular to the surface may be highly relevant. As mentioned above, changes in the pectin rigidity may have significant effects on other cell wall polymers and their behavior. While our methods are not influenced by the predicted degree of cellulose anisotropy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>, other larger scale methods are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Suslov1">[65]</xref> and a combination of techniques is required for a more complete understanding of growth mechanics.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if the above points are assumed, how could changes in the isotropic pectin matrix lead to localized anisotropic growth as seen in organ formation? It is possible that changing the matrix rigidity alters the elastic strain profile of the cell, a phenomenon which could be predicted to alter microtubule orientation and thus redirect cellulose orientation, yielding anisotropy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Heisler1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Hamant1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Uyttewaal1">[66]</xref>. This posits that a localized change in an isotropic material could yield anisotropic outgrowth via feed forward signaling. If we assume that not everything we measure is pectins, but also that a contribution for the important xyloglucans is detected, this framework still holds as it is unlikely that hemicelluloses display anisotropy independent of cellulose microfibrils.</p>
<p>Lastly, what happens when a curved surface is probed with a nano-indenter? For the most part, it is assumed during data interpretation that the indentation occurs normal to the material surface. This is obviously an over simplification. At any given position, the indenter tip will be at an angle to the sample, and the degree of the angle will be determined by the curvature of the sample- when the degree is large enough some of the energy in the system is lost leading to bias in the data due simply to geometry. In order to assess the bias introduced by sample geometry, we developed a new procedure: replicate meristems were produced from a silicon polymer which had meristem geometry but uniform mechanical properties. These types of samples enable the effects of geometry to be assessed. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s005">Figure S5</xref>, a silicon <italic>pin1</italic>meristem did show a bias due to geometry (Wilcoxon signed rank test, W = 8337.5 p-value&lt;2.2E-16, mean percent difference 22%); however, the geometrical bias is dwarfed by the biological difference produced by IAA application (Wilcoxon signed rank test, W = 25421 p-value&lt;2.2E-16, mean percent difference 128%). These experiments provide a concrete comparison method for analyzing the effect of sample geometry, and will hopefully contribute to the ongoing development of a precise analytical method for subtracting such a bias from data.</p>
<p>Within the past two years several research groups have begun using AFM to explore cell mechanics on tissue and single cell levels. This new and exciting application has already opened up new avenues of research, and as in this work, confirmed long assumed hypothesis. AFM-based nano indentation is a valuable tool for plant research, whose interpretation and development are continually evolving, providing new biological insights and advancing technological ideas.</p>

<title>AFM measurements</title>
<p>The AFM data were collected following the same protocol as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>, except that the AFM machine, a stand-alone NanoWizard AFM, was now equipped with a CellHesion module allowing greater z-movement (JPK Instruments AG, Germany). Meristems were dissected from soil grown plants and immobilized on glass slides and surrounded by stiff agarose. Measurement of wall properties alone were ensured by suppression of turgor pressure by immersion of all meristems in a hypertonic solution a minimum of 30 minutes before measurement (0.55 M mannitol). We have previously demonstrated that this causes plasmolysis in mersitems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>. The following numbers of meristems were analyzed: <italic>pin1</italic> (+ IAA n = 13, + inactive IAA n = 7, + PME n = 6, + denatured PME n = 3), 24–48 h induced <italic>PMEI3oe</italic> (+ IAA n = 9, + inactive IAA n = 11). When chemically-loaded beads were applied first to meristems, the beads were washed loose (or knocked loose) when meristems were prepared for AFM scanning, and the scans were made just apical to the bead position (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057813.s004">Fig. S4</xref>); Position of beads was noted. The following cantilevers were used: ‘Nano World’ (NanoWorld AG Headquarters, Neuchâtel, Switzerland) TL-NCH-20 tips with a spring constant of 10–130 N/m (those used were estimated to be 1.5 N/m) with Sphere Tips of a 900–1100 nm radius or tip-less probes. Tip-less probes were mounted with 5 µm borosilicate beads attached with Araldite glue (Bostik SA. 77 170, Coubert France). All force spectroscopy experiments was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref>; briefly, rigidity of samples was determined as follows: an AFM cantilever loaded with a spherical tip was used to indent the sample over a 60×60 µm square area, indentations were kept to &lt;10% of cell height (∼250–500 nm), within the area 64×64 measurements were made resulting in 4096 force-indentation experiments, each force-indentation experiment was treated with a Hertzian indentation model to extrapolate the apparent Young's modulus, each pixel in a rigidity map represents the Young's modulus from one force-indentation point. For topographical reconstructions, height of each point was determined by the point-of-contact from the force-indentation curve; each contact point is from the same curve used to determine E<sub>A</sub>. Rigidity data was projected on to topographical maps using MatLab.</p>

<title>Apparent Young's modulus calculations</title>
<p>The Young's modulus is a parameter that relates applied force to indentation; in stricter terms it is the ratio of uniaxial strain and uniaxial stress, within a liner elastic behavior. In order to ensure that indentations are performed within a linear elastic range the following technical controls are confirmed in all tissues used: 1) Indentation depth is &lt;10% of total cell height, 2) approach and retraction curves from the experiments are examined for hysteresis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Braybrook2">[32]</xref>, and 3) indentation times are 0.2 s total to avoid viscous deformation.</p>
<p>In contrast to our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057813-Peaucelle2">[34]</xref> the Apparent Young's modulus in this study was calculated using the JPK Data Processing software (ver. spm-4.0.23, JPK Instruments AG, Germany), which allows for a more standardized analysis (although possibly less accurate in certain situations).The Young's modulus is estimated using a standard Hertzian contact model for spherical indenters. The switch in analysis method was deliberately performed in order to allow greater comparability between different labs using AFM-based technologies to study mechanics. Only the approach curve was used in our analysis to avoid any adhesion interference. The best fit was obtained using a Hertzian model with 0.5 µm or 2.5 µm as tip radii, for a cantilever loaded with the 5 µm or 1 µm spherical beads respectively. A Poisson ratio of 0.5 was assumed for the material. For graphed data, 30–40 points per area of interest were selected (as randomly as humanly possible) and averaged, for each meristem. For 'mean of mean' graphs standard propagation of error calculations were applied. A standard t-test was applied to test for differences between treatments.</p>

<p><bold>Effect of sample geometry on EA values.</bold> To examine the effect on sample geometry on the rigidity data (presented as apparent Young's Modulus, EA) data obtained from a ‘fake’ silicon pin mutant meristem (A), data obtained from an untreated pin mutant meristem (B), and data obtained from an IAA applied pin mutant meristem (C) were compared. Within each panel are a topographical height map, an EA map projected on the topographic surface. (D) Boxplot of regional EA values corresponding to boxes on the height map, distributions were compared with a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and all differences between ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ areas were significant at p-value &lt;0.001 (n per box  =  200 (silicon), 160 (pin meristems); pink asterisks; all distributions were non-normal as determined by a Shapiro-Wilks test except for the +IAA bottom area); however, the percent difference of the control samples was dwarfed by that in the +IAA experimental condition. To maximize the possibility of discovering geometry induced error, the silicon pin meristem was imaged with a new scan set-up allowing X:Y:Z dimensions of 100∶100∶25 µm; thus the silicon meristem presented displays larger analyzed curvature than any plant sample in this study. (A) The silicon meristem EA map shows little bias due to geometry as seen in the EA map and the graph of regional values (D, %diff = 21.86); interestingly the flatter top region appears slightly less rigid than the sloped area. (B) The control pin meristem without IAA application also shows very slight EA bias due to geometry as seen in the EA map and the regional graph; here the predicted decrease in rigidity on sloped areas is observed, although slight (D, %diff = 14.81). (C) For the experimental pin meristem with IAA application, the difference between the area proximal to the application site (AS) and the non-exposed ‘top’ area of the meristem is striking and far larger in magnitude than that expected by geometrical bias alone (D, %diff = 128.41 vs. 14–22% for controls). As such, while an appropriate data-based correction method for geometrical bias is under development- within the experiments presented in this paper the experimental/biological differences eclipse those due to geometrical bias.
