<abstract>
<p>Over the last few years, circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising novel and minimally invasive markers for various diseases, including cancer. We already showed that certain miRNAs are deregulated in the plasma of breast cancer patients when compared to healthy women. Herein we have further explored their potential to serve as breast cancer early detection markers in blood plasma. Circulating miR-127-3p, miR-376a and miR-652, selected as candidates from a miRNA array-based screening, were found to be associated with breast cancer for the first time (n = 417). Further we validated our previously reported circulating miRNAs (miR-148b, miR-376c, miR-409-3p and miR-801) in an independent cohort (n = 210) as elevated in the plasma of breast cancer patients compared to healthy women. We described, for the first time in breast cancer, an over-representation of deregulated miRNAs (miR-127-3p, miR-376a, miR-376c and miR-409-3p) originating from the chromosome 14q32 region. The inclusion of patients with benign breast tumors enabled the observation that miR-148b, miR-652 and miR-801 levels are even elevated in the plasma of women with benign tumors when compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, an analysis of samples stratified by cancer stage demonstrated that miR-127-3p, miR-148b, miR-409-3p, miR-652 and miR-801 can detect also stage I or stage II breast cancer thus making them attractive candidates for early detection. Finally, ROC curve analysis showed that a panel of these seven circulating miRNAs has substantial diagnostic potential with an AUC of 0.81 for the detection of benign and malignant breast tumors, which further increased to 0.86 in younger women (up to 50 years of age).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women in industrialized countries. Worldwide approximately 1.3 million women develop breast cancer each year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Jemal1">[1]</xref>. Fortunately, over the years there has been a decline in mortality rates, which can be attributed to the advances made in early diagnosis and treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Jemal1">[1]</xref>. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of women die from breast cancer each year. Early detection is important as the overall 5-year survival is &gt;90% when diagnosed at an early stage as opposed to ∼20% when the disease has already spread to distant organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-HowladerN1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mammography is the standard breast cancer screening tool, but there are controversial reports regarding its utility as a screening method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Bleyer1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Nystrom1">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, mammographic screening seems to be less sensitive for younger women, possibly due to an increased mammographic breast density, which is usually associated with younger age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Checka1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Boyd1">[6]</xref>. As of now there are no circulating markers for breast cancer screening or detection in clinical use, but a few such markers, e.g. carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3), are being used and seem helpful for making decisions in the metastatic setting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Harris1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs (∼22 nucleotides in length) that regulate gene expression on a post-transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Bartel1">[8]</xref>. By degrading mRNA molecules or blocking their translation miRNAs play an essential role in the regulation of a large number of biological processes, including cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Calin1">[9]</xref>. In 2008 first reports emerged demonstrating the presence of circulating miRNAs in cell-free body fluids such as plasma and serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Lawrie1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Chim1">[11]</xref>. Since then, circulating miRNAs have been reported as being deregulated in blood plasma or serum in different types of disease, including cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Cuk1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Zhang1">[13]</xref>. Although the origin of circulating miRNAs is heterogeneous and still under debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Turchinovich1">[14]</xref>, the possibility of their repeated measurement in a minimally invasive manner as well as their remarkable stability in plasma/serum make them attractive candidates for the development of novel markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Mitchell1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Turchinovich2">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The aims of this study were to improve the breast cancer detection capability by investigating additional miRNA marker candidates, which we selected from a miRNA array-based approach, and to independently validate our previously identified breast cancer associated miRNAs. We linked circulating miR-127-3p, miR-376a and miR-652 to breast cancer for the first time and independently validated them, together with miR-148b, miR-376c, miR-409-3p and miR-801, as elevated in the plasma of breast cancer patients in a second study cohort. Finally, a combination of these seven circulating miRNAs represents our diagnostic miRNA panel for discriminating between healthy women and patients with benign and malignant breast tumors, with superior performance in younger women.</p>

<title>Breast Cancer Patients and Healthy Controls</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical Faculty in Heidelberg. Two study cohorts were investigated. In study cohort A (n = 207) blood samples were collected from 127 sporadic breast cancer patients and 80 healthy female volunteers, who served as controls. In study cohort B (n = 210) samples were collected from 30 women with benign and 120 with malignant breast tumors, respectively, as well as 60 healthy female individuals. All cases and controls were Caucasian. After giving written informed consent patient blood samples were collected between 2010 and 2012 at the time-point of diagnosis before they underwent any therapeutic treatment, such as surgery, radiation or systemic therapy. Patient clinico-pathological features were defined by operative findings. For neoadjuvant patients (n = 26 in cohort A and n = 24 in cohort B), histo-pathological characteristics and tumor stage were assessed based on histobiopsy results and imaging techniques. Control blood samples were collected between 2010 and 2012 from healthy women with no history of malignant diseases, no blood transfusions received in the previous 3 years and no current inflammatory condition (based on self-report). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076729-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s005">Table S1</xref> summarize the clinical features of the patients and lifestyle data of the healthy controls, respectively. No clinico-pathological data is available for the women with benign breast lesions, but their mean and median ages were 47 and 46 years (age range: 32–71 years), respectively. Tissue sample harvesting and clinico-pathological characteristics are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Cuk1">[12]</xref>.</p>

<title>New miRNA Candidates (miR-127-3p, miR-376a and miR-652) are Present at Higher Levels in the Plasma of Breast Cancer Patients</title>
<p>In our previous work, we have conducted an initial screening using TaqMan Low Density (TLDA) arrays to identify circulating miRNAs deregulated between early stage breast cancer patients and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s006">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Cuk1">[12]</xref>). In order to improve our breast cancer detection accuracy here we re-analyzed the TLDA data using less stringent analysis criteria, i.e. by omitting the removal of miRNAs with low inter-quartile ranges (IQR) after quantile normalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s007">Table S3</xref>). Subsequently, three additional miRNA candidates (miR-127-3p, miR-376a and miR-652) were selected for validation studies after applying the following criteria: (i) P&lt;0.05, (ii) mean Ct&lt;33 in at least one investigated group and (iii) |ΔCt|&gt;1 (indicating that the miRNA amounts in the patients and controls differ markedly).</p>
<p>First we measured the miRNA levels of miR-127-3p, miR-376a and miR-652 in study cohort A (n = 207), comprising a total of 127 breast cancer patients and 80 healthy controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076729-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s005">Table S1</xref>), and found that miR-127-3p (P&lt;0.001), miR-376a (P = 0.01) and miR-652 (P&lt;0.0001) are present at higher levels in the plasma of breast cancer patients when compared with healthy women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076729-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s001">S1</xref>).

<title>Seven Circulating miRNAs were Independently Validated as Elevated in the Plasma of Breast Cancer Patients</title>
<p>By investigating an independent validation cohort, we confirmed that circulating miR-127-3p (P = 0.0003), miR-148b (P&lt;0.0001), miR-376a (P = 0.03), miR-376c (P = 0.03), miR-409-3p (P = 0.005), miR-652 (P&lt;0.0001) and miR-801 (P&lt;0.0001) are increased in the plasma of women with breast cancer when compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076729-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

By stratifying the malignant breast cancer patients according to their cancer stage, we observed that miR-127-3p, miR-148b, miR-409-3p, miR-652 and miR-801 are able to identify even stage I or stage II cancer patients when compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s008">Table S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Diagnostic Potential of Circulating miRNAs</title>
<p>Prior to analyzing the diagnostic potential we analyzed the inter-correlations between the seven circulating miRNAs in study cohort B (data from the first validation cohort A is not shown, but was comparable). We found that the levels of miR-127-3p, miR-376a, miR-376c and miR-409-3p correlate strongly to each other with Spearman rank correlation coefficients ρ&gt;0.80 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s009">Table S5</xref>). Additionally, circulating miR-148b correlated considerably with miR-127-3p (ρ = 0.62) and miR-652 (ρ = 0.78), whereas miR-801 showed no significant correlations except for a slight correlation to miR-148b levels (ρ = 0.24).</p>
<p>The diagnostic potential of circulating miRNAs was evaluated by ROC curve analysis and the discriminatory accuracy presented by AUC values. In the herein analyzed cohort B women with benign breast tumors were included to investigate whether the circulating miRNAs can detect benign breast lesions as well. In brief, a combination of these seven circulating miRNAs yielded a good discriminatory accuracy (AUC = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.72–0.91) for benign breast tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Furthermore, the accuracy was higher in younger women up to the age of 50 years (AUC = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.77–0.97). The discriminatory accuracy for differentiating between malignant breast cancer patients and healthy controls was the highest for a combination of all seven miRNAs with AUC = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75–0.88) and an even better AUC of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.78–0.93) for younger women only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, individual and combined ROC curves for discriminating samples from both benign and malignant breast tumor patients versus healthy women are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076729-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Here, circulating miR-127-3p had an AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.57–0.73), miR-148b of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.62–0.78), miR-376a of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.51–0.67), miR-376c of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.51–0.67), miR-409-3p of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.54–0.70), miR-652 of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.67–0.82) and miR-801 of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65–0.80). The combination of all seven circulating miRNAs displayed the highest discriminatory power with AUC = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74–0.87). At a sensitivity of 80% the median specificity was 72%. Again, in younger women (up to the age of 50 years) these circulating miRNAs performed superiorly and had an even higher accuracy (AUC = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.79–0.93) for the detection of both benign and malignant breast lesions.</p>

<title>miR-127-3p, miR-376a and miR-652 are Present at Lower Levels in Malignant Primary Breast Cancer Tissue</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>One of the major challenges in the fight against cancer is early detection as it holds promise to result in a more favourable disease outcome. The standard breast cancer screening tool is mammography. Some of the disadvantages of mammography include the use of ionizing radiation and patient’s discomfort during the screening, but the most important drawback might be its poorer sensitivity in younger women, where tumor growth is the fastest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Checka1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Boyd1">[6]</xref>. Therefore, novel and minimally invasive techniques, which are adequately sensitive for younger women as well, might offer a valuable alternative or complement to the existing methods.</p>
<p>Previous studies in plasma and serum have already identified circulating miRNAs, which seem to be able to discriminate between healthy women and breast cancer patients, such as miR-155, miR-181a, miR-299-5p, miR-411 or miR-1304 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Roth1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-vanSchooneveld1">[23]</xref>. Apart from finding miRNAs with diagnostic potential, some studies revealed other intriguing observations, such as differences in miRNA expression between different ethnic groups or differences in circulating miRNA signatures in localized versus metastatic breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Cuk1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Zhao1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Madhavan1">[24]</xref>. These and sample processing issues might be the reasons for the ostensible lack of reproducibility in published data regarding circulating miRNAs as markers for breast cancer as discussed in greater detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Cuk1">[12]</xref>. The strengths of our study are (i) standardized processing of blood samples to generate plasma within two hours of collection with a two-step centrifugation protocol, (ii) carrying out validation studies in a blinded manner, and (iii) investigation of plasma samples which have been taken at the time-point of breast cancer diagnosis before the patients underwent any therapeutic treatment.</p>
<p>As this study focused on early detection of breast cancer our samples were enriched for patients with stage I and stage II disease, which represented more than 80% of the investigated cancer individuals in cohort B. In addition here we included a separate group of patients with benign breast lesions. Due to a re-analysis of the TLDA array data, we identified three new miRNA candidates. In the herein presented data we confirmed our previous findings (miR-148b, miR-376c, miR-409-3p and miR-801) and showed that our new miRNA candidates (miR-127-3p, miR-376a and miR-652) are also present at significantly higher levels in the plasma of breast cancer patients when compared to healthy women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076729-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076729-g002">2</xref>). Interestingly, miR-148b, miR-652 and miR-801 had increased levels even in the plasma of women with benign breast tumors when compared to healthy women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076729-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Also, by stratifying the cancer patients into different disease stage groups, we were able to demonstrate the capability of miR-127-3p, miR-148b, miR-409-3p, miR-652 and miR-801 to identify also stage I or stage II cancer patients when compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s008">Table S4</xref>). This further strengthens the idea of utilizing them as minimally invasive, blood-based markers for early detection of this disease.</p>
<p>To our best knowledge this is the first study to report an over-representation of chromosome 14q32 miRNAs as deregulated in plasma and tissue of breast cancer patients. This chromosomal region contains the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus and is suspected to harbor tumor suppressor genes as it has already been described as down-regulated in some types of cancer, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, uterine carcinosarcoma or melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Agueli1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Zehavi1">[27]</xref>. Our tissue analysis confirmed this as we found the 14q32 miRNAs (miR-127-3p, miR-376a, miR-376c and miR-409-3p) to be present at lower levels in malignant breast cancer in comparison to benign breast tissue samples indicating these miRNAs might indeed be tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076729-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Cuk1">[12]</xref>).</p>
<p>The involvement of (circulating) miR-148b, miR-376c, miR-409-3p and miR-801 in breast and other types of cancer was discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Cuk1">[12]</xref>. Regarding the three newly identified miRNA candidates, as of now miR-127-3p has been described as up-regulated in a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal cancer with KRAS mutations and decreased in osteosarcoma cell lines and in primary breast cancer tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Duan1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Mosakhani1">[31]</xref>.

Additionally, miR-127-3p seems to be up-regulated in tumor initiating cells (important for disease recurrence and metastasis) in lung carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Lin1">[34]</xref>. This miRNA has also been found to be responsive to methylation-based silencing in the genomic DNA of gastric carcinomas and to radiation treatment, which causes its up-regulation in primary human dermal endothelial cells thereby enhancing their radiosensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Tsai1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-WagnerEcker1">[36]</xref>.

Concordant with our findings in malignant breast cancer, miR-376a was found to be down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Zehavi1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Zheng1">[37]</xref>. Up to now miR-652 has been described as present at lower levels in lung cancer samples when compared to matching normal lung tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Gao1">[38]</xref>. Interestingly, in an investigation of a rat hepatocarcinogenesis model, increasing serum levels of seven miRNAs (including miR-652) were observed during the carcinogenesis process, but an inverse correlation of hepatic tissue and serum miR-652 levels was found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Sukata1">[39]</xref>. This pattern of inverse correlation of tissue and serum levels is in accordance with our observations and might cause speculation that malignant cancer cells can indeed selectively release specific miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Pigati1">[40]</xref>. In that case a selective release of miRNAs into the blood stream could cause levels of specific miRNAs to increase in the circulation and decrease in the malignant tumor cells from which they originate. Alternatively, some of the circulating miRNAs could also originate from blood cells, the stromal compartment and/or tumor microenvironment or be some kind of an immune response to the tumor and are therefore not up-regulated in the malignant tissue itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Pritchard1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Finak1">[43]</xref>. Complete elucidation of the still unclear origin of circulating miRNAs is needed to provide an explanation for these observations.</p>
<p>Concordant with our previous findings plasma levels of miR-801 in the independent validation cohort B correlated to age and menopausal status in the patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Additionally, we detected a correlation of miR-801 to the patients’ progesterone receptor status and more interestingly to the tumor marker p53, the tumor grading and the proliferation marker Ki-67. The latter two clinico-pathological features are indicative of the proliferation potential and aggressiveness of the tumor, so it is possible that miR-801 might be a prognostic marker as well. Unfortunately, not enough time has passed since the recruitment of the patients to have meaningful prognostic information, so we could not test this hypothesis properly yet. Interestingly, in our previous studies miR-801 was the only circulating miRNA, which we found to play a role both in primary and metastatic breast cancer, suggesting that this miRNA might be important for tumor pathogenesis as well as for tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Cuk1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Madhavan1">[24]</xref>. Circulating miR-148b and miR-652 also might have prognostic capabilities as in cohort B they correlated with the tumor marker p53, whose addition (together with Ki-67) to conventional clinico-pathological characteristics seems to be helpful in the prognostic evaluation of breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Millar1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Song1">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>Benign breast tumors can give rise to <italic>in situ</italic> or even invasive carcinomas, therefore it is important to detect them as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Valdes1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-MacGrogan1">[47]</xref>. In the independent validation cohort the seven-miRNA panel reached the same accuracy (AUC = 0.81) in detecting women with benign lesions as in detecting women with malignant breast tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s004">S4</xref>). Furthermore, in an analysis including only younger women (up to the age of 50) our seven-miRNA panel performed even better and reached an AUC of 0.87 for benign tumors and 0.85 for detecting only malignant cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076729.s004">S4</xref>). Finally, the detection of both benign and malignant tumors was equally accurate with an AUC of 0.81 and, again, superior in younger women with an AUC of 0.86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076729-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The increase of discriminatory accuracy of the proposed seven-miRNA panel in women up to the age of 50 years is especially important considering that mammography, the current gold standard breast cancer screening and detection method, seems to be less sensitive in younger women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Checka1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Boyd1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076729-Fletcher1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this is the first study to associate circulating miR-127-3p, miR-376a and miR-652 with breast cancer. In addition, we have independently confirmed that miR-127-3p, miR-148b, miR-376a, miR-376c, miR-409-3p, miR-652 and miR-801 levels are elevated in the plasma of breast cancer patients. These miRNAs can differentiate even women with benign tumors, stage I or stage II breast cancer from healthy controls thereby reinforcing their utility as minimally invasive, early detection markers. The substantial accuracy of breast tumor detection makes this circulating miRNA panel a potentially useful (pre)screening tool, especially in younger women for whom mammography seems to be less sensitive. But, further studies are necessary before these findings can be translated into clinical use.</p>
