<title>Background</title>
<p><underline>M</underline>odified <underline>V</underline>accinia virus <underline>A</underline>nkara (MVA) is a safe, highly attenuated orthopoxvirus that is being developed as a recombinant vaccine vector for immunization against a number of infectious diseases and cancers. However, the expression by MVA vectors of large numbers of poxvirus antigens, which display immunodominance over vectored antigens-of-interest for the priming of T cell responses, and the induction of vector-neutralizing antibodies, which curtail the efficacy of subsequent booster immunizations, remain as significant impediments to the overall utility of such vaccines. Thus, genetic approaches that enable the derivation of MVA vectors that are antigenically less complex may allow for rational improvement of MVA-based vaccines.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Principal Findings</title>
<p>We have developed a genetic complementation system that enables the deletion of essential viral genes from the MVA genome, thereby allowing us to generate MVA vaccine vectors that are antigenically less complex. Using this system, we deleted the essential uracil-DNA-glycosylase (<italic>udg</italic>) gene from MVA and propagated this otherwise replication-defective variant on a complementing cell line that constitutively expresses the poxvirus <italic>udg</italic> gene and that was derived from a newly identified continuous cell line that is permissive for growth of wild type MVA. The resulting virus, MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic>, does not replicate its DNA genome or express late viral gene products during infection of non-complementing cells in culture. As proof-of-concept for immunological ‘focusing’, we demonstrate that immunization of mice with MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> elicits CD8+ T cell responses that are directed against a restricted repertoire of vector antigens, as compared to immunization with parental MVA. Immunization of rhesus macaques with MVAΔ<italic>udg-gag</italic>, a <italic>udg</italic><bold><sup>−</sup></bold> recombinant virus that expresses an HIV subtype-B consensus <italic>gag</italic> transgene, elicited significantly higher frequencies of Gag-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells following both primary (2–4-fold) and booster (2-fold) immunizations as compared to the <italic>udg</italic><sup>+</sup> control virus MVA-<italic>gag</italic>, as determined by intracellular cytokine assay. In contrast, levels of HIV Gag-specific antibodies were elicited similarly in macaques following immunization with MVAΔ<italic>udg-gag</italic> and MVA-<italic>gag</italic>. Furthermore, both <italic>udg</italic><bold><sup>−</sup></bold> and <italic>udg</italic><sup>+</sup> MVA vectors induced comparatively similar titers of MVA-specific neutralizing antibody responses following immunization of mice (over a 4-log range: 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>8</sup> PFU) and rhesus macaques. These results suggest that the generation of MVA-specific neutralizing antibody responses are largely driven by input MVA antigens, rather than those that are synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> during infection, and that the processes governing the generation of antiviral antibody responses are more readily saturated by viral antigen than are those that elicit CD8+ T cell responses.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Significance</title>
<p>Our identification of a spontaneously-immortalized (but not transformed) chicken embryo fibroblast cell line (DF-1) that is fully permissive for MVA growth and that can be engineered to stably express MVA genes provides the basis for a genetic system for MVA. DF-1 cells (and derivatives thereof) constitute viable alternatives, for the manufacture of MVA-based vaccines, to primary CEFs – the conventional cell substrate for MVA vaccines that is not amenable to genetic complementation strategies due to these cells' finite lifespan in culture. The establishment of a genetic system for MVA, as illustrated here to allow <italic>udg</italic> deletion, enables the generation of novel replication-defective MVA mutants and expands the repertoire of genetic viral variants that can now be explored as improved vaccine vectors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), an attenuated strain of vaccinia virus that was originally developed as a smallpox vaccine, was obtained following extensive serial passage on primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Mayr1">[1]</xref>. During this process of attenuation, MVA underwent deletion of 31 kb (∼15%) of its genome, as compared to its parental strain, including a number of genes that contribute to viral evasion from host immune responses and that determine virus host range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Meyer1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Antoine1">[3]</xref>. As a result, MVA is unable to replicate productively in most mammalian cell types, including primary human cells. This block occurs at the relatively late stage of virion assembly and maturation (ie following expression of early (E), intermediate (I), and late (L) viral genes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Blanchard1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Sutter1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Carroll1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Drexler1">[7]</xref>. The resulting inability of MVA to undergo more than one infection cycle in a human host has imbued this virus with inherent safety that was demonstrated historically through the immunization of ∼120,000 individuals during the smallpox eradication campaign. More recently, the safety of MVA has been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies of immune-deficient mice and immune-suppressed macaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Wyatt1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Stittelaar1">[9]</xref> and in phase-I clinical trial evaluations of MVA as a next-generation smallpox vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Parrino1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>The desirable safety profile exhibited by MVA, in concert with its ability to express high levels (and large numbers) of foreign genes, has rendered MVA a leading candidate for evaluation as a vaccine vector against an array of infectious diseases and human cancers. On a number of different fronts, MVA-based vaccines against HIV/AIDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Mwau1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-VasanSS1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-KeeferMCE1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-SandstromEW1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-GoepfertPH1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-HarrerTH1">[16]</xref>, malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Moorthy1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Moorthy2">[18]</xref>, tuberculosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-McShane1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-McShane2">[20]</xref>, HPV-induced CIN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-BoryJPL1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-CoronaGutierrez1">[22]</xref>, and melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Smith1">[23]</xref> are being evaluated in human clinical trials. Such broad interest to develop a diverse array of MVA-based vaccines provides substantial opportunities to engineer MVA vectors to enhance their immunogenicity – but, to date, these have been largely unrealized.</p>
<p>The utility of MVA-based vaccines to prime immune responses against heterologous antigens appears to be limited due to unfavorable competition for immunodominance between the relatively large number of vector-specific gene products (177 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Antoine1">[3]</xref>) and the dramatically smaller number of intended vaccine antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Smith2">[24]</xref>. Moreover, repeated administration of recombinant MVA vaccine vectors typically results in an increasingly diminished efficacy of such booster immunizations, presumably due to the elicitation of vector-specific neutralizing antibody responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Casimiro1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Shiver1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Hirsch1">[27]</xref>. Disappointing results from a phase I clinical trial of an MVA-based AIDS vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-GuimaraesWalker1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Jaoko1">[29]</xref> suggest that there is a substantial need to better understand the mechanisms governing antigen presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Gasteiger1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Kastenmuller1">[31]</xref>, immunodominance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Fischer1">[32]</xref>, and the generation of vector-specific humoral immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Davies1">[33]</xref> in order to improve upon the immunogenicity of currently available MVA vaccine vectors.</p>
<p>One approach towards overcoming these limitations is to block progression of the viral replication cycle at an earlier stage than normally occurs with MVA infection. This genetic restriction of viral gene expression would effectively reduce the overall number of irrelevant, but potentially immunodominant, MVA gene products that are synthesized during infection. These include virion structural proteins, which are synthesized with predominantly late kinetics during infection, that also contain epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibody responses. In this way, deletion of an essential MVA gene(s) could augment the immunogenicity of MVA-based vaccine vectors by effectively reducing the antigenic complexity of the vector, which could focus cellular and/or humoral immune responses away from irrelevant (or even undesirable) antigenic targets of the vector itself and toward the antigen of interest.</p>
<p>Replication-defective mutants of other large DNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Nguyen1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Farrell1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Brockman1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Murphy1">[37]</xref>, adenovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Shiver2">[38]</xref>, and vaccinia virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Holzer1">[39]</xref>, have been produced for use as vaccine vectors, but this approach has not yet been feasible with MVA. This absence of a system for genetic complementation of deletion (or mutation) of essential genes from MVA derives in large part from the fact that MVA is routinely propagated on primary CEFs, which, due to their finite lifespan in culture, are not suitable for long-term (multi-passage) genetic complementation.</p>
<p>In the present study, we describe the establishment of a genetic system to complement deletion of essential MVA genes and its use to create a recombinant MVA from which the uracil-DNA-glycosylase gene has been deleted. This virus, MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic>, exhibits an immune-response phenotype that is distinct from wild type MVA. This system was predicated on the identification of an immortalized CEF-derived cell line (UMNSAH/DF-1, “DF-1” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-SchaeferKlein1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Himly1">[41]</xref>) that supports high-level growth of MVA and that could be engineered to constitutively express <italic>udg</italic>, and presumably, other MVA genes. Importantly, DF-1 cells (and derivatives thereof) are attractive alternatives to primary CEFs for large-scale production of MVA-based vaccines because of their origin through spontaneous immortalization, rather than oncogenic transformation, of embryonic fibroblasts derived from chickens that were free from endogenous retroviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-SchaeferKlein1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Himly1">[41]</xref>. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that immunization of mice with MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> elicits CD8+ T cell responses against fewer MVA vector antigens than does wild type MVA, thereby constituting an effective focusing of the antiviral CD8+ T cell repertoire toward antigens that are expressed early, rather than late, during the MVA replication cycle. We further show that immunization of rhesus macaques with MVAΔ<italic>udg-gag</italic>, a <italic>udg</italic><bold><sup>−</sup></bold> vector that expresses an HIV <italic>gag</italic> transgene from an early viral promoter, elicits significantly higher (2–4-fold) frequencies of HIV Gag-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells following primary and booster immunizations, as compared to a <italic>udg</italic><sup>+</sup> control (MVA-<italic>gag</italic>). In contrast to its positive effects on transgene-specific T cell responses, deletion of <italic>udg</italic> from recombinant MVA vectors had no discernable impact on the magnitudes of transgene-specific antibody responses that were elicited in rhesus macaques or on the MVA-specific antibody responses that were elicited in either mice or macaques.</p>

<title>The DF-1 fibroblast cell line supports high-level growth of MVA</title>
<p>Given that an immortalized cell line is a prerequisite for any viral genetic complementation strategy, we first sought to identify a cell line that was able to support MVA replication efficiently and that might also be suitable for ultimate manufacture of licensable MVA-based vaccines. Based on their derivation and character, we reasoned that the CEF-derived DF-1 cell line might be a promising cell substrate for MVA vector preparation and propagation. We first assayed the ability of DF-1 fibroblasts to support the growth of MVA in comparison with two other permissive cell types, primary CEFs and BHK-21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Cells were infected with MVA at a ratio of 3 infectious units per cell, and MVA yields were calculated via TCID<sub>50</sub> determination on primary CEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) or via plaque assay on DF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) at the indicated times following infection. Following the expected period of viral eclipse at 2 hours post-infection, MVA infection resulted in the net production of approximately 10<sup>8</sup> infectious units per million DF-1 cells by 24 hours post-infection. The yields of MVA from infected DF-1 cells were equivalent to those obtained following infection of primary CEF or BHK-21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Thus, DF-1 fibroblasts are fully permissive for MVA growth and support virus growth to levels that are comparable to those obtained through propagation of MVA on primary CEFs.</p>

<title>Zeocin-resistance/GFP-positivity allows for rapid isolation of MVA recombinants</title>
<p>A number of methods that facilitate selection or screening for recombinant vaccinia virus are also applicable for the isolation of recombinant MVA.

We sought to evaluate the use of zeocin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Berdy1">[48]</xref>, an antibiotic whose mechanism of action rests upon its ability to intercalate into DNA and subsequently cleave DNA molecules, as a new antibiotic selection to facilitate the prompt isolation of MVA and vaccinia recombinants. Zeocin was found to be a potent inhibitor of MVA growth. Addition of this antibiotic to the culture medium of MVA-infected DF-1 cells at concentrations ranging from 50–200 µg/ml reduced MVA yields between 82–98% as compared to growth in the absence of the drug (not shown).</p>
<p>To demonstrate that zeocin selection could be used to facilitate isolation of recombinant viruses, we recombined a DNA cassette that directs early expression of the <italic>gfpzeo</italic> fusion gene, which encodes an N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) in frame with a C-terminal zeocin-resistance polypeptide (<italic>Sh ble</italic> gene product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Calmels1">[49]</xref> ), at deletion site III of the MVA genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and selected for zeocin-resistant recombinants. Microscopic visualization of recombinant GFP<sup>+</sup> plaques at 2 days following infection of DF-1 cells in the presence of zeocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) enabled rapid plaque isolation and subsequent iterative plaque purification of the viral recombinant MVA-<italic>gz</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, simultaneous drug selection and visual screening for GFPZEO<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> plaques expedites the isolation and preparation of recombinant MVA viruses.</p>

<title>Generation and characterization of MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic></title>
<p>Vaccinia virus-encoded uracil-DNA-glycosylase is essential for VV growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Stuart1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Millns1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Holzer2">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Ellison1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-DeSilva1">[54]</xref>. Because MVA is derived from vaccinia virus (strain CVA) and UDG<sup>MVA</sup> shares complete amino acid identity with UDG encoded by other vaccinia strains (Copenhagen, Western Reserve), it was expected that <italic>udg</italic> would also be essential for MVA growth and that its deletion would require a genetic complementation strategy. An initial step towards deleting <italic>udg</italic> from MVA was to generate an MVA-permissive cell line that also expresses UDG at levels sufficient to complement genomic deletion of <italic>udg</italic>. MVA-permissive DF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) were transfected with a <italic>udg</italic>-expression plasmid pCAN<italic>udg</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref>) and G418-resistant cell clones were screened for their ability to complement the growth of <italic>ts</italic>4149, a vaccinia virus mutant that harbors a temperature sensitive mutation in the <italic>udg</italic> (D4R) gene, at the non-permissive temperature of 39.5°C (not shown).

To measure these responses, mice were immunized with MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> or parental MVA and their splenic CD8+ T cell responses characterized at 7 days post-immunization via intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay, which utilized an epitope panel comprised of recently-defined CD8+ determinants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Moutaftsi1">[55]</xref> representing both Early and Late viral antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

Following immunization of mice at the lower dose (10<sup>6</sup> PFU), MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> elicited 14-fold and 9-fold lower frequencies of CD8+ T cells against the A3L<sub>270–277</sub> (Late) and A19L<sub>47–55</sub> (Unknown) determinants, respectively, than did MVA, which were determined to be statistically significant differences (Mann-Whitney test). In contrast, the average frequencies of CD8+ T cells directed against A42R<sub>88–96</sub> (0.05% MVA, 0.05% MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic>), B8R<sub>20–27</sub> (2.6% MVA, 1.9% MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic>), or K3L<sub>6–15</sub> (0.07% MVA, 0.08% MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic>) were not significantly different between groups. Similarly, following immunization of mice at the higher dose (10<sup>8</sup> PFU), both MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> and MVA elicited similar frequencies of A42R<sub>88–96</sub>-, B8R<sub>20–27</sub>-, or K3L<sub>6–15</sub>-specific CD8+ T cells, which were ≥3-fold higher than the corresponding frequencies that were elicited following 10<sup>6</sup> PFU immunization. Interestingly, immunization with MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> at the high dose (10<sup>8</sup> PFU) overcame the deficit of A3L<sub>270–277</sub>-restricted T cells that was observed following immunization with 10<sup>6</sup> PFU MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic>, but did not abrogate the elicitation of a relatively lower frequency of A19L<sub>47–55</sub>-restricted CD8+ T cells, as compared to MVA (MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> = 0.09%, MVA = 0.22%, average No Stim/limit of detection = 0.07%). Because the A3L protein is a structural component of the MVA virion (and therefore present in the viral inoculum), our observation that A3L<sub>270–277</sub>-restricted CD8+ T cells are elicited by MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> only following a relatively high-dose immunization is most readily explained as a result of cross presentation of A3L antigen from the input virus, rather than <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized A3L antigen.</p>

Relatively low frequencies of Gag-specific/IL2-producing CD8 T cells were observed following primary immunization with either virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Similarly, with regard to Gag-specific CD4 T cell responses, MVAΔ<italic>udg-gag</italic> elicited significantly higher frequencies of IL2-producing CD4 T cells at 4 weeks post-immunization than did MVA-<italic>gag</italic> (MVAΔ<italic>udg-gag</italic>: range = 0.12–0.46, median = 0.21; MVA-<italic>gag</italic>: range = 0–0.18, median = 0.087) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g009">Figure 9D</xref>). Effective boosting of both Gag-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses was observed at one week following the second immunization (1<sup>st</sup> booster immunization) in both groups of immunized macaques, but was significantly more pronounced (group median responses were approximately 2-fold higher) in those macaques that were immunized with the MVAΔ<italic>udg-gag</italic> vector as compared to MVA-<italic>gag</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005445-g009">Figure 9A, B, D</xref>). No effective boosting was subsequently observed in either group following the third immunization (2<sup>nd</sup> booster immunization) and likely reflects efficient neutralization of the viral inocula due to the high levels of MVA-specific neutralizing antibodies that were present in all animals this time (see below).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is a substantial need to improve the immunogenicity of MVA-based vaccines, which are currently being developed for use against a number of prominent infectious diseases including AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, as well as human cancers. Engineered MVA vectors, which help focus cellular immune responses away from vector-specific poxvirus antigens and towards heterologous antigens-of-interest, or which engender weaker vector-specific neutralizing antibody responses, should exhibit greater utility than vectors derived from parental MVA for use as vaccines. In the present study, we describe a genetic system that allows for the generation and propagation of MVA mutants that have deletions for essential viral genes, as demonstrated for the deletion of the poxvirus uracil-DNA-glycosylase gene from the MVA genome. We provide a proof-of-concept that MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> elicits CD8+ T cell responses against a restricted repertoire of vector antigens <italic>in vivo</italic>, as compared to wild type MVA. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a relevant non-human primate model that a <italic>udg</italic><bold><sup>−</sup></bold> AIDS vaccine vector, MVAΔ<italic>udg-gag</italic>, elicited 2–4-fold higher frequencies of HIV Gag-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells in immunized macaques, as compared to a <italic>udg</italic><sup>+</sup> control vector (MVA-<italic>gag</italic>) that expresses an identical HIV <italic>gag</italic> transgene.</p>
<p>The genetic system we describe was predicated upon our identification of the DF-1 chicken embryo fibroblast cell line as being fully permissive for MVA infection. The DF-1 cell line possesses a number of desirable attributes that make it a convenient cellular substrate for the production of MVA recombinants in the research laboratory. These include: MVA growth comparable to that achieved with primary CEF cultures, the ability to plaque MVA on DF-1 cells, and the ability to generate DF-1-derived cell lines that stably express poxvirus genes and complement the growth of essential-gene deletion MVA mutants. In addition, the DF-1 cell line possesses numerous attributes that make it an attractive alternative to primary CEF cultures for the production of clinical-grade lots of MVA-based vaccines. The DF-1 cell line is a spontaneously-immortalized cell line derived from CEFs prepared from line 0 chicken eggs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-SchaeferKlein1">[40]</xref>. These cells lack endogenous avian retroviral sequences and exhibit a non-transformed phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-SchaeferKlein1">[40]</xref>. Indeed, based on their lack of spontaneous transformation, DF-1 cells are used to score for transformation by potential oncogenes in avian tumorigenicity models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Himly1">[41]</xref>. Regulatory approval of the DF-1 cell line, or derivatives thereof, as a cell substrate for use in cGMP manufacture of MVA-based vaccines would obviate the existing need for recurrent certification of primary CEF cultures, which exhibit finite lifespans in culture, and might enable new approaches to optimize the yield and cost-effectiveness of such vaccines.</p>
<p>Replication-defective versions of other viral vectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Farrell1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Murphy1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Shiver2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-DaCosta1">[56]</xref> have been developed for use as vaccine vectors, in large part to increase vector safety. In contrast, MVA has historically exhibited a favorable safety profile as a smallpox vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Mayr2">[57]</xref> and is unlikely to overcome its host-range restriction during human infection due to the multiple gene deletions it acquired during its derivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Antoine1">[3]</xref>. Even so, targeted deletion of an essential gene(s) from MVA will only increase the safety of such MVA vectors by further reducing any potential for complementation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, an approach to generate replication-defective vectors from MVA has not been pursued. This is likely because parental MVA undergoes an abortive growth cycle in most cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Blanchard1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Sutter1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Carroll1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Drexler1">[7]</xref> and is commonly propagated on primary CEFs, which, because of their finite lifespan in culture, are not suitable for stable genetic complementation of mutant viruses. Despite reports that the continuous BHK-21 cell line is fully permissive for MVA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Carroll1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Drexler1">[7]</xref>, this cell line has not, to our knowledge, been utilized for genetic complementation of MVA mutants.</p>
<p>Thus, having identified a new cell line that is amenable to genetic complementation strategies for MVA, we proceeded to generate a DF-1-derived cell line that constitutively expresses <italic>udg</italic><sup>MVA</sup> and to use this cell line to complement deletion of <italic>udg</italic> from the MVA genome. Our targeting of <italic>udg</italic>, rather than another essential MVA gene, was based partly on initial studies by Holzer and co-workers that demonstrated the feasibility of trans-complementation of a <italic>udg</italic>-deletion in vaccinia virus, and that a <italic>udg</italic>-deletion mutant of vaccinia virus, which also expressed the prM and E structural proteins of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBE), was better able to protect mice against lethal TBE challenge than was a replication-competent VV recombinant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Holzer1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Holzer2">[52]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Holzer3">[58]</xref>. While the immune mechanisms that mediated this enhanced protection, which potentially include increased levels and/or duration of antigen synthesis from early viral promoters, greater efficiency of antigen processing and/or presentation within infected cells, or augmented cross-presentation of antigens due to the induction of apoptosis in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Gasteiger1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Lauvau1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Basta1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Shen1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Norbury1">[62]</xref>, were not determined, their <italic>in vivo</italic> observations encouraged our studies to delete <italic>udg</italic> from MVA, toward the goal of generating an improved MVA vaccine vector.</p>
<p>Deletion of <italic>udg</italic> from MVA resulted in a virus (MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic>) that is genetically blocked prior to viral DNA synthesis and late gene expression during infection of non-complementing DF-1 fibroblasts. In this regard, the DNA-negative and late gene-negative phenotypes exhibited by MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> during infection of DF-1 cells are analogous to those observed during infection of non-complementing cells with a VVΔ<italic>udg</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Holzer2">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-DeSilva1">[54]</xref>. Thus, the growth of <italic>udg</italic><bold><sup>−</sup></bold> MVA was restricted to the trans-(<italic>udg</italic>)-complementing DF-1-derived cell line. As such, restoration of <italic>udg</italic> to a <italic>udg</italic><bold><sup>−</sup></bold> MVA virus, via genetic recombination, and selection for virus growth on non-complementing cells should provide a powerful system to generate and isolate recombinant MVA viruses, as has been described analogously for the rescue of <italic>udg</italic><bold><sup>−</sup></bold> vaccinia recombinants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Holzer3">[58]</xref>.</p>
<p>With regard to the generation of MVA-specific cellular immune responses, we hypothesized that genetic preclusion of late MVA gene expression, via <italic>udg</italic> deletion, would effect a focusing of T cell responses towards antigens expressed early, rather than late, during the MVA infection cycle. Our characterization of the CD8+ T cell responses elicited in mice following immunization with either MVA or MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> viruses demonstrates, as proof-of-concept, that genetic abrogation of MVA late gene expression results directly in the generation of a restricted repertoire of vector-specific CD8+ T cells that is biased in favor of antigens that are expressed with early, rather than late, kinetics. This was evidenced by the reductions in CD8 T cell responses against determinants encoded within the viral A3L antigen, a known late gene product, as well as the viral A19L antigen, following immunization with MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic>.</p>
<p>With regard to the generation of A3L<sub>270–277</sub>–specific CD8 T cells, there are potentially two sources of the amino acid determinant present during immunization – one from input virion core proteins (in both infectious and non-infectious virus particles) and the second from A3L that is synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> in MVA-, but not MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic>-infected cells. As such, the capacity to prime restricted CD8+ T cells by MVA or MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> may be expected to vary as a function of the input immunization dose. Indeed, our observations bear this out, as A3L<sub>270–277</sub>–restricted CD8+ T cells were elicited by MVA following both low (10<sup>6</sup> PFU) and high (10<sup>8</sup> PFU) dose immunizations, but were only elicited by MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> following the high dose immunization. In contrast, A19L<sub>47–55</sub>-restricted CD8+ T cells were not generated following immunization with MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> at either high or low doses of input virus. While relatively little is currently known about this gene, our model predicts that A19L is a late gene that encodes either a non-structural protein, or a structural protein that does not contain amino acid residues 47–55, such that the A19L<sub>47–55</sub> determinant is not present in the viral inoculum. Taken together, these findings indicate that MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> elicits a restricted repertoire of vector-specific CD8+ T cell responses, but suggest that the effectiveness of such a genetic approach to focus CD8+ responses away from late viral gene products may be limited under conditions of high-dose immunization due to the potential to cross-prime CD8+ T cells with input viral antigens.</p>
<p>However, compensatory increases in the frequencies of CD8+ T cell responses directed against either of two early viral determinants (B8R<sub>20–27</sub>, K3L<sub>6–15</sub>) were not observed following immunization of mice with MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic>. In part, this may reflect a model-specific effect in that the early B8R<sub>20–27</sub> determinant already constitutes the immunodominant CD8+ T cell determinant of MVA in C57Bl/6 mice and, as such, may not be amenable to further enhancement via ‘repertoire focusing’. In an analogous immunization model utilizing MHC-selected (<italic>Mamu</italic> A*01<sup>+</sup>) rhesus macaques, we have similarly observed that deletion of <italic>udg</italic> did not augment the frequencies of CD8 T cells that were elicited by either of two known immunodominant SIV determinants expressed from the MVA vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Engram1">[63]</xref>. Alternatively, genetic abrogation of viral late gene expression may simply reduce the number of different vector-specific determinants that elicit CD8+ T cell responses, rather than the magnitudes of the residual responses.</p>
<p>To address this question directly in a relevant vaccine setting, we conducted an immunization trial in MHC-diverse rhesus macaques in which the levels of transgene-specific T cells that were elicited by Δ<italic>udg</italic> and <italic>udg</italic><sup>+</sup> MVA vectors that express an identical HIV <italic>gag</italic> transgene could be compared directly. As shown, immunization of macaques with MVAΔ<italic>udg-gag</italic> resulted in the generation of 2–4-fold higher frequencies of HIV Gag-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, as compared to MVA-<italic>gag</italic>, at the times of peak T cell responses following both primary and booster immunizations. These data demonstrate that, as a vector for immunizing against a heterologous antigen, the <italic>udg</italic><bold><sup>−</sup></bold> recombinant was modestly more immunogenic than the corresponding <italic>udg</italic><sup>+</sup> control.</p>
<p>With respect to the generation of transgene-specific humoral immune responses, we reasoned that the higher frequencies of Gag-specific CD4 T-helper cellular responses that were elicited in macaques by MVAΔ<italic>udg-gag</italic> might contribute to the generation of relatively higher titers of Gag-specific antibodies. However, our results showing the generation of Gag-specific antibodies with similar titers and with similar kinetics, following immunization of macaques with MVAΔ<italic>udg-gag</italic> or MVA-<italic>gag</italic> recombinants, indicate that deletion of <italic>udg</italic> had neither beneficial nor detrimental effects in this regard. Thus, the positive effects of <italic>udg</italic> deletion on transgene-specific immunity were observed for T cell, rather than humoral, immune responses.</p>
<p>With regard to the generation of MVA-specific humoral immune responses, we originally hypothesized that abrogation of late gene expression, via <italic>udg</italic> deletion from MVA vectors, would result in the generation of reduced levels of vector-specific neutralizing antibodies. Analogous to the dual sources of CD8+ T cell determinants for viral structural antigens, there are potentially two sources of relevant B cell epitopes that can elicit vector-specific neutralizing antibody responses. These include virion structural proteins that are either associated with input virus or are synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> within infected cells. Because such structural proteins are typically synthesized during infection with predominantly late kinetics, it was reasonable to originally hypothesize that MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> might elicit reduced titers of vector-specific neutralizing antibodies, as compared to wild type MVA.</p>
<p>However, our results indicate that deletion of <italic>udg</italic> had no demonstrable effect on the overall levels of MVA-specific antibodies that were generated <italic>in vivo</italic>, in either mice or rhesus macaques, following immunization with Δ<italic>udg</italic> or <italic>udg</italic><bold><sup>+</sup></bold> vectors. In mice, no significant differences were observed between the titers of MVA-specific NAbs that were elicited by either MVAΔ<italic>udg</italic> or MVA following immunization over a 4-log range of input virus (10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>8</sup> PFU). This relatively shallow dose-response relationship between input virus dose and ensuing vector-specific NAb titers suggests that these NAb responses are fully generated by relatively low amounts (containing ≤10<sup>4</sup> PFU) of input viral inocula. Whether a similar dose-response relationship would be observed following immunization of mice by different anatomical routes, or in other species, is under investigation. Additionally, the magnitudes and kinetics of MVA-specific antibody responses (both virion-binding and neutralizing) were virtually identical between Δ<italic>udg</italic> and <italic>udg</italic><sup>+</sup> vectors following both primary and booster immunizations of rhesus macaques.</p>
<p>Our observations that Δ<italic>udg</italic> and <italic>udg</italic><sup>+</sup> MVA vectors elicit similar levels of vector-specific antibodies <italic>in vivo</italic> are consistent with those of Ober, <italic>et al</italic> that showed comparable levels of vaccinia virion-binding antibodies in mice following single-dose immunization with replication-defective (Δ<italic>udg</italic>) vaccinia virus (dVV-L, strain <underline>L</underline>ister), replication-competent vaccinia (VV-L), or MVA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Ober1">[64]</xref>. Interestingly, a subsequent study by this group showed the levels of vector-specific antibodies elicited in mice by MVA to be relatively lower than those elicited by the replication-defective dVV-L virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Coulibaly1">[65]</xref>.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results suggest that any contribution of <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized viral late gene products to the net MVA-specific antibody response <italic>in vivo</italic> is negligible. Given the demonstration that vaccinia-specific antibodies are both necessary and sufficient to confer protection against virulent monkeypox challenge in non-human primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-EdghillSmith1">[66]</xref>, our finding that levels of MVA-specific NAbs may be driven predominantly by input viral antigens should help inform our understanding of the mechanism by which next-generation smallpox vaccines elicit protection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we feel that the genetic system that we have developed provides a platform for the development of a new generation of MVA-based vaccine vectors that may be safer and more efficacious than those currently available. The growth of such vaccine vectors on a continuous, consistent, expandable, and more-readily-certifiable cell line should ultimately facilitate their production for use in humans. The establishment of a genetic complementation system for MVA now allows for genes, other than <italic>udg</italic>, to be deleted from the viral genome to pursue hypothesis-driven efforts to maximize vector immunogenicity. As a result, the methods we have developed increase the facility with which the biology of MVA and its interactions with host cells and host organisms can now be studied. The knowledge gained from such studies promises to enhance our ability to derive novel MVA variants with enhanced immunogenic properties for use as safe and effective vaccines.</p>

Two early viral (modified H5) promoters flanked by restriction endonuclease sites (PmeI, ApaI, PacI, Eco47III←pH5– StuI; StuI –pH5→NaeI, MluI, SacII, SacI) were generated by pairwise ligation of oligonucleotides H5For2+H5Rev2, H5Rev2+H5Rev3: H5For2 = <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-agtttaaacaagggcccaactcgagaattaattaaaaagcgctTATTTAT<italic>GATTATTTCTCGCTTTCAATTTAACACAA</italic>-3′</named-content>, H5Rev2 = <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-aggcctAAAAATTGAAAATAAATACAAAGGTTCTTGAGGG<italic>TTGTGTTAAATTGAAAGCGAGAAATAATCATAAATAA</italic>-3′</named-content>, H5Rev3 = <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-agagctcaatcgcgaaaccgcggaaacgcgtAAGCCGGCTATTTATGA<italic>TTATTTCTCGCTTTCAATTTAACACAA</italic>-3′</named-content> (upper case denotes promoter sequence, italics denote regions of oligonucleotide complementarity). Single strand overhangs of ligated oligonucleotides were filled in using Taq polymerase and these dsDNA products were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) to generate vectors pTA-H5anti and pTA-H5sense, respectively. Modified H5 promoters were assembled into a bidirectional promoter element via ligation of the 3.1 kB StuI/BglII fragment of pTA-H5sense and 1.0 kB StuI/BglII fragment of pTA-H5anti to generate pTA-dH5. The double synthetic promoters of pG06 were removed via digestion with PmeI and SacI and replaced with an EcoRV-SacI fragment containing the bidirectional modified H5 promoter element from pTA-dH5 to yield MVAΔIII transfer vector pG06dH5.</p>

The right and left <italic>udg</italic> flanks were sequentially cloned into pBluescriptII(SK+) (Stratagene) as XhoI-KpnI and SacI-SpeI fragments, respectively, to yield plasmid pBS<italic>udg</italic>LFRF. To position a <italic>gfpzeo</italic> expression cassette between two loxP sites, plasmid pMS102 (kindly provided by J. Murray, University of Cambridge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005445-Snaith1">[71]</xref>) was first digested with SnaBI and EcorRV and religated to render a unique XbaI site between the two loxP elements in this plasmid construct (pMSΔ102). A 1.2 kb StuI-SnaBI pH5-<italic>gfpzeo</italic> expression cassette from pG06dH5<italic>gz</italic> was blunt cloned in both leftward and rightward orientations into the Klenow-filled XbaI site in pMSΔ102 to yield plasmids pMSΔ102H5GZ.1, -.4, respectively. To construct transfer vectors that direct the replacement of the <italic>udg</italic> ORF with a <italic>gfpzeo</italic> expression cassette, SpeI-BglII fragments (containing loxP-flanked pH5-<italic>gfpzeo</italic>) were subcloned from pMS102ΔH5GZ.4 and pMSΔ102H5GZ.1 into SpeI-BamHI linearized pBS<italic>udg</italic>LFRF to generate plasmids pΔ<italic>udg</italic>dloxPH5GZ-A, -B, respectively.
