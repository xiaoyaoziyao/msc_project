<abstract>
<p>Evolution requires phenotypic variation in a population of organisms for selection to function. Gene regulatory processes involved in organismal development affect the phenotypic diversity of organisms. Since only a fraction of all possible phenotypes are predicted to be accessed by the end of development, organisms may evolve strategies to use environmental cues and noise-like fluctuations to produce additional phenotypic diversity, and hence to enhance the speed of adaptation. We used a generic model of organismal development --gene regulatory networks-- to investigate how different levels of noise on gene expression states (i.e. phenotypes) may affect access to new, unique phenotypes, thereby affecting phenotypic diversity. We studied additional strategies that organisms might adopt to attain larger phenotypic diversity: either by augmenting their genome or the number of gene expression states. This was done for different types of gene regulatory networks that allow for distinct levels of regulatory influence on gene expression or are more likely to give rise to stable phenotypes. We found that if gene expression is binary, increasing noise levels generally decreases phenotype accessibility for all network types studied. If more gene expression states are considered, noise can moderately enhance the speed of discovery if three or four gene expression states are allowed, and if there are enough distinct regulatory networks in the population. These results were independent of the network types analyzed, and were robust to different implementations of noise. Hence, for noise to increase the number of accessible phenotypes in gene regulatory networks, very specific conditions need to be satisfied. If the number of distinct regulatory networks involved in organismal development is large enough, and the acquisition of more genes or fine tuning of their expression states proves costly to the organism, noise can be useful in allowing access to more unique phenotypes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Development processes are key in mapping genotypes to phenotypes, often by complex and poorly understood regulatory mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref002">2</xref>]. The nonlinearity of the genotype-phenotype map can induce considerable <italic>degeneracy</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref003">3</xref>], such that many genotypes develop the same phenotype while simultaneously rendering some potential phenotypes inaccessible to evolutionary search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref004">4</xref>]. The developmental process might therefore entail a reduction of the phenotypic variation in these organisms to a fraction of all potential variability, which constrains the evolutionary pathways that populations or species can take [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>A large body of theoretical research has shown that developmental constraints are of great significance for the study of evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref009">9</xref>]. Intriguingly, some shortcomings of reduced phenotypic variation have been shown to be partially compensated for by noise in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Noise is ubiquitous in gene expression processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref013">13</xref>], and organisms have evolved different mechanisms to adapt to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref014">14</xref>]. Some organisms employ mechanisms that use noise to their advantage, making it essential to gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref016">16</xref>]. For example, small fluctuations in protein concentration can lead to significant changes in cell fate, and allow isogenic cells to develop different phenotypes, thus increasing phenotypic variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref017">17</xref>]. Besides phenotypic variability, noise in gene expression has been associated with coordinating the expression of a large set of genes, stochastic phenotype switching, and facilitating evolutionary adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref016">16</xref>]. Conversely, very high levels of noise might have detrimental, destabilizing effects on development, adversely affecting a population’s diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>To address these issues in a widely studied model of development, we studied how noise affects access to new phenotypes that are inaccessible by deterministic gene networks. To this end, we focused on a particular class of random Boolean networks known as Random Threshold Networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref018">18</xref>]. These networks act on initial phenotypes and produce the subsequent changes that define the course of development, until an end state or fixed point is reached, or alternatively some other behavior results. We investigated the effects of noise on two of the routes by which organisms may increase their phenotypic variability, namely by acquiring more genes or by adopting more gene expression states.</p>
<p>We studied different network model types, namely <italic>binary networks</italic>, i. e. networks that only allow for up- or down-regulation on genes, and <italic>real-valued networks</italic>, which can exert a regulatory signal of arbitrary strength. Both types of networks were studied in settings where they could be randomly chosen from the set of all possible networks (termed <italic>random networks</italic>) or alternatively, where they were pre-selected for the stability of their phenotypic outcomes (termed <italic>stable networks</italic>). Additionally, we generalized some aspects of the Boolean framework by allowing multiple gene expression states for the phenotype (not exclusively “on” or “off”).</p>
<p>We found that standard binary network models with two gene expression states can access the maximum number of unique phenotypes by development if enough random networks are sampled, but not if more gene expression states are considered. In general, irrespective of the noise level, stable networks access more phenotypes if only two gene states can be expressed, but less phenotypes if more are expressed.</p>
<p>In general, noise decreases phenotype discovery. However, in developmental models that allow for more expression states, noise can enhance the discovery of new phenotypes, but only under very specific conditions and to a very moderate extent. Real-valued networks strongly enhance phenotype discovery, but again this is negatively affected by noise. These results are robust to the different implementations of noise investigated.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>To study how distinct gene expression or phenotype states are attained during development, we implemented an extensively studied model of gene network dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref025">25</xref>]. The model comprises four components: (1) A gene interaction network that regulates (2) the gene expression state by means of (3) a normalization function. The expression state is subject to (4) noise.</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Interaction Matrix</title>
<p>The interaction network consists of <italic>N</italic> genes, represented by an <italic>N</italic> × <italic>N</italic> matrix, <italic>W</italic>, whose elements, <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, denote the effect on gene <italic>i</italic> of the product of gene <italic>j</italic>. We think of the matrix <italic>W</italic> as representing a genotype, which, in concert with other factors, will codetermine the end state of the gene expression. The matrix is not symmetric and diagonal elements, <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ii</italic></sub>, represent autoregulation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Gene expression states</title>
<p>Gene expression is represented by a state vector <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = (<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>), …, <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>)). The values of <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> represent the expression levels of gene <italic>i</italic> at time <italic>t</italic>. To investigate one possibility for augmentation of the phenotype space open to organisms, we generalized the commonly utilized binary entry values <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ {−1, 1}, usually restricted to two states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref021">21</xref>], to <italic>k</italic> gene expression states, evenly spaced over the interval [0, 1]. The off state of a gene, <italic>s</italic><sub>off</sub>, is often represented by −1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref021">21</xref>]. We choose the more realistic <italic>s</italic><sub>off</sub> = 0, since an expression state of −1 will affect the expression of other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref026">26</xref>].

<p>Standard techniques for the simulation of gene regulatory networks involve either binary gene expression states or a continuum of gene expression levels. On the one hand, the notion that genes are either expressed or not is a useful simplification for the computational investigation of gene regulatory networks, but lacks realism. On the other hand, the idea that all possible gene expression levels can be attained with infinite precision is equally unrealistic, since transcription factor proteins are produced in discrete numbers and are likely to exert different regulatory strengths when binding to promoter regions. Considering discrete levels of gene expression, as we propose by using different <italic>k</italic>, is therefore a more realistic compromise between these two extremes.</p>

where <italic>f</italic> is a normalization function that prevents the system from diverging and <italic>ϵ</italic> is drawn from the normal distribution 𝓝(0, <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup>), <italic>σ</italic> = 0, 0.01, 0.05, …, 0.25. If not stated otherwise, the noise term, <italic>ϵ</italic> is added at each time step <italic>t</italic> and independently for each gene, as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>The Gaussian noise assumption was first introduced in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref024">24</xref>] to simulate environmental perturbations of the development system. In particular, the use of a white noise approach proved useful in simulating environmental shocks, where noise would be increased from small to large values of <italic>σ</italic>. We chose this ansatz due to its analytic simplicity as well as the possibility of studying the effects of noise on a continuous scale. The effects of adding the noise before the action of a canalization function are addressed in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>In this framework, <italic>random binary networks</italic> <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> have elements <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> with values −1 or 1, assigned with equal probability in our experiments. <italic>Random real-valued networks</italic> <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> have real-valued entries, drawn at random from a standard normal distribution 𝓝(0, 1).</p>
<p>To obtain a <italic>stable binary (real-valued) network</italic>, a <italic>random binary (real-valued) network</italic> <italic>W</italic> and a random initial state <italic>S</italic>(0) are sampled first. Subsequently, <italic>W</italic> is evaluated under (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0119972.e002">2</xref>) (with <italic>ϵ</italic> = 0) and tested for the generation of a stable equilibrium using <italic>S</italic>(0) as initial state. If the <italic>W</italic> does not attain a fixed point (i. e. it attains a limit cycle), both the matrix <italic>W</italic> and initial state <italic>S</italic>(0) are discarded, and a new network and initial state are generated. This procedure is repeated until a network is found for which <italic>S</italic>(∞) is a fixed point.</p>
<p>Stable networks were utilized to emulate a biologically more realistic representation of a population of organisms. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref019">19</xref>], stable networks were mainly considered for tractability reasons, but it is reasonable to assume that in most biological contexts, adult organisms maintain their acquired phenotype. For that reason, we defined stable networks as arising from a pre-selection process, which increases the chance that stable phenotypes are produced. Hence, this process implements an artificial selection for stability of phenotypes at the conclusion of development.</p>

<title>Alternative noise models</title>
<p>As an alternative to the simple Gaussian white noise added to the phenotype states, we also explored <italic>random flips</italic> as different implementations of noise. In general, how random flips are implemented requires the specification of three properties: (1) which states a given gene can flip to (transition probabilities), (2) the number of genes that flip, and (3) the timing of the application of noise.</p>
<p>In this study, we consider the effects of two types of flips, <italic>random or no flips</italic> and <italic>neighbor flips</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Transition probabilities for flips.</bold> Random flips act on the <italic>i</italic>-th entry of the gene expression state, <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. If <italic>k</italic> = 2, this is just flipping from <italic>s</italic><sub>on</sub> to <italic>s</italic><sub>off</sub>, with probability 0.5. For <italic>k</italic> &gt; 2, there exist three possibilities to implement random flips. First, the random flip could result in any of the possible <italic>k</italic> states (termed <italic>random or no flip</italic> model). Second, it could have any of the other <italic>k</italic> − 1 different states as an outcome (termed <italic>random other flip</italic> model), or third, it could switch to one of the nearest neighbors (the <italic>neighbor flip</italic>, where 0 and 1 only have one nearest neighbor, but intermediate states have two, in which case we chose randomly between the two). We have focused on the <italic>random or no flip</italic> and <italic>neighbor flip</italic> models only.</p>
<p>For example, with <italic>k</italic> = 4 and <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 0, the random or no flip model allows switches to any state, including the current state, i. e., {0, 1/3, 2/3, 1} (random or no flip); the random other flip model allows switches to any other state in {1/3, 2/3, 1} with equal probability; and the neighbor flip model only allows <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 0 to switch to 1/3 (nearest neighbor).</p>

<title>Solving the dynamic equations</title>
<p>Each gene regulatory network subdivides the space of possible phenotypes into disjoint subsets, called <italic>basins of attraction</italic>. These subsets contain equilibria (termed <italic>attractors</italic>) of the dynamical system. Given an initial gene expression state, the dynamical system (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0119972.e002">2</xref>) may converge to an attractor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref029">29</xref>], which may be a fixed point or a limit cycle.</p>
<p><bold>Solving the dynamic equations without noise.</bold> To find equilibria of the dynamics of the developmental model in the absence of noise, we applied cycle detection algorithms on distinct representations of phenotype vectors. All possible <italic>N</italic>-dimensional state vectors <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) can be represented by an integer <italic>x</italic> ∈ {0, 1, …, <italic>k</italic><sup><italic>N</italic></sup> − 1} using binary or gray code [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref030">30</xref>], for example.</p>
<p>To assess to which attractor the system (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0119972.e002">2</xref>) converges, we use the number representation of the phenotype state. This allows for an increase in simulation speed of up to 5 times.</p>
<p>Using the integer representation <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ {0, 1, …, <italic>k</italic><sup><italic>N</italic></sup> − 1} for a phenotype state after <italic>i</italic> iterations, we can rewrite <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0119972.e002">Eq (2)</xref> as <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>+1</sub> = <italic>F</italic>(<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>), where <italic>F</italic> is the developmental function. Starting from any initial value <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, the sequence of iterated values <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>F</italic>(<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>), <italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub> = <italic>F</italic>(<italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub>), …, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = <italic>F</italic>(<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>−1</sub>),… must eventually generate the same value twice: there must be some <italic>i</italic> ≠ <italic>j</italic> such that <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>. Once this happens, the sequence must continue, repeating the cycle of values from <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> to <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>j</italic>−1</sub>.</p>
<p>Whether the system has converged to a solution of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0119972.e002">Eq (2)</xref> can thus be assessed by a cycle detection algorithm. To this end, we used Brent’s algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref031">31</xref>] to obtain the orbit’s period (where a period of 1 is a fixed point), the path length to equilibrium, i. e. the time of transition from the initial state to the attractor) and the final state of the system (or the first state of a cycle).</p>
<p><bold>Solving the dynamic equations with noise.</bold> Since the presence of noise in the developmental model might perturb stable states, we employed a specific criterion to assess the attractors.

<title>Noise is detrimental to phenotype discovery by binary networks with bi-modal gene expression</title>
<p>This section explores whether the expansion of gene regulatory networks to incorporate more traits or genes could represent a viable pathway for an organism to access additional phenotypic states and how noise affects the discovery of such new phenotypes.</p>
<p>We imagine the outcome of the development of an organism to be captured by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0119972.e002">Eq (2)</xref>, which in turn depends on the number of phenotype traits <italic>N</italic>, the level of noise <italic>σ</italic>, as well as the randomly chosen initial phenotype <italic>S</italic>(0). Here, we set <italic>k</italic> = 2 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). To investigate the extent to which such a simple system could access new unique phenotypes, we repeated <italic>λ</italic> = 10<sup>5</sup> simulations with binary random and stable networks for each <italic>N</italic>.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0119972.g001">Fig 1A</xref> shows that without the addition of noise, the number of unique phenotypes <italic>U</italic> accessed within <italic>λ</italic> repeats is at its maximum (<italic>k</italic><sup><italic>N</italic></sup>) for small <italic>N</italic> and random binary networks <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub>.

<p>Surprisingly, these results suggest that for large enough sample sizes, random binary networks seem capable of accessing all potential phenotypes if the genome size is increased. Access to all potential phenotypes is facilitated by the large number of available and different binary networks, which scales as 2<sup><italic>N</italic>×<italic>N</italic></sup>, whereas the number of potential phenotypes is <italic>U</italic><sub>max</sub> = 2<sup><italic>N</italic></sup>. Hence, despite the degeneracy of several different networks mapping initial phenotypes onto the same stable phenotype, it is possible to access all possible phenotypes if enough random networks are sampled. This behavior extends the observations made in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref004">4</xref>], under a model that involves a single development step, as well as the model here presented. With increasing <italic>N</italic>, the number of all possible phenotypes starts to surpass the sample size <italic>λ</italic>, which limits how many phenotypes can potentially be discovered. Hence, the fraction of accessible phenotypes must decline with <italic>N</italic>, as the maximum number of distinct phenotypes (the size of the phenotype space), <italic>U</italic><sub>max</sub> = 2<sup><italic>N</italic></sup>, approaches <italic>λ</italic>. This explains why in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref004">4</xref>] only a fraction of all phenotypes were visible to the developmental process at a fixed <italic>λ</italic> = 10<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>Noise is exclusively detrimental to phenotype discovery whenever the maximum number of possible phenotypes approaches the sampling size <italic>λ</italic>. This effect is qualitatively robust to different implementations of noise, in accord with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref026">26</xref>]. The pre-selection of regulatory networks <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> leads to substantially greater phenotype discovery close to the theoretical maximum <italic>λ</italic>. This is probably due to the effective increase in the number of explored simulations due to the pre-selection of <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> networks.</p>

<title>The enhancement of phenotypes accessibility by noise in binary networks depends on <italic>λ</italic></title>
<p>In some instances, the expansion of regulatory networks by the acquisition of additional genes might be biologically constrained. The major mechanism by which regulatory networks can increase in size is by gene duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref034">34</xref>] and co-option of other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref036">36</xref>]. However, increasing the network size could be biochemically unfeasible or entail prohibitive costs to the organism. After a gene duplication event, for example, the new copy stands little chance of rising to fixation and being retained long-term (perhaps through acquiring new functions or subdividing old ones), if it is not expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref037">37</xref>]. But being expressed alongside the old copy implies increased dosage, which is frequently deleterious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>To address this issue, we examined alternative means of network expansion. One way to increase the size of phenotypic space without altering the number of genes <italic>N</italic> in the network, is to increase the number of intermediate gene expression states <italic>k</italic>. With <italic>N</italic> fixed, the phenotypic space then increases polynomially with <italic>k</italic> as <italic>k</italic><sup><italic>N</italic></sup>.</p>
<p>Setting <italic>k</italic> &gt; 2 constitutes a departure from commonly employed models, where only two expression states have been considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref032">32</xref>]. However, this assumption does have a biological basis. For example, during embryonic development and many cellular processes, there are threshold responses and gradient-driven processes, which entail that genes have multiple expression states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref039">39</xref>].</p>

<p>These figures capture the degeneracy in unique stable phenotypes induced by many distinct regulatory network matrices <italic>W</italic>. Since many <italic>W</italic>’s define identical equilibrium phenotypic states in the absence of noise, sampling only a small fraction (small <italic>λ</italic>) of them with replacement will lead to an overrepresentation of the most degenerate phenotypes.

<title>Noise decreases the number of phenotypes accessible by real-valued networks</title>
<p>Much of our knowledge about biological networks comes in the form of binary information about the activation or repression of some form of expression (using microarray data, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref040">40</xref>]). This is a consequence of simplification: it is much easier to describe a regulatory interaction in qualitative terms than to quantify it by interaction strengths and binding affinities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref042">42</xref>]. Consequently, most models use either binary weights or random numbers at the start of evolutionary simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref025">25</xref>]. Another reason for modeling regulatory interactions as binary is that fine-tuning of interaction strengths can prove costly or even impossible for an organism, especially in the presence of cellular noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>It is the relative size of these interaction strengths however, that is relevant to the dynamics represented by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0119972.e002">Eq (2)</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref045">45</xref>]. Despite its costs, organisms could evolve fine-tuning of some interactions if it were beneficial in the long term. Such interactions can be captured by the use of real-valued networks, instead of binary networks.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0119972.g006">Fig 6A</xref> shows that random real-valued networks, developing as specified in (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0119972.e002">2</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>), can access almost all possible unique phenotypes <italic>U</italic> in the absence of noise.

<p>These results indicate that fine tuning the regulatory interactions on genes by using real-valued networks could allow a population of organisms to access substantially more phenotypes than binary networks. This effect is much stronger than the incremental improvement on phenotype discovery conferred by pre-selecting real-valued networks for stability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have explored two main ways to increase the absolute number of phenotypes accessible through developmental processes, and in addition, the role of noise in phenotype discovery. First, by increasing the number of genes (<italic>N</italic>), we found that in the absence of noise, all phenotypes become accessible given large enough sample sizes. Second, with an increase in the number of gene expression states (<italic>k</italic>), noise can moderately increase phenotype discovery for small <italic>k</italic>. These results are valid for both, random and stable binary networks.</p>
<p>When the number of gene expression states <italic>k</italic>, becomes larger than two, sample sizes and noise interact in a complex fashion to influence the accessibility of new unique phenotypes. In particular, for <italic>k</italic> = 3, the larger the sample size, the larger the noise levels required to obtain a marginal increase to phenotype discovery. This suggests that increasing the number of gene expression states could open the way to novel phenotypes for organisms whose development is subject to strong noise.</p>
<p>The improvement in phenotype accessibility with increasing noise is most pronounced for <italic>k</italic> = 3, where almost double the number of unique phenotypes can be accessed under high noise compared with no noise. This beneficial effect of noise at large sampling sizes erodes fast with larger <italic>k</italic>. The biological importance of noise as a facilitator of phenotype discovery is therefore limited to small <italic>k</italic> values, where the absolute increase in newly accessed phenotypes is small in absolute terms, but large in relative terms. The diversification of gene expression states from only “on” and “off” to more expression states could therefore be halted before quasi-continuous expression states are attained. However, a more detailed investigation of this question would require accounting for the cost to an organism of acquiring a genetic machinery capable of expressing multiple states of gene expression.</p>
<p>We also explored the behavior of networks that allow for fine-tuning of regulatory interactions, namely real-valued networks. We found that compared to binary networks, real-valued networks substantially increase access to phenotypes for <italic>k</italic> &gt; 2. Again, noise was exclusively detrimental for phenotype accessibility.</p>
<p>Finally, we also studied distinct implementations of noise to assess the robustness of our results. We found that the behavior of the developmental model did not change qualitatively with noise types.</p>
<p>In previous studies, a more differentiated model was employed to represent development, where genotypes were equated with transcription factors for expression, and phenotypes were equated with the gene expression itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref004">4</xref>]. In this context, development entails the one-time application of a mapping function on a genotype to obtain an end-state phenotype.</p>
<p>With one-iteration development, an increase in the size of a network or a regulatory system, also increases the number of potential phenotypes accessible to the system. However, not all potential phenotypes are accessed starting from random genotypes in random binary networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref004">4</xref>]. Redundancy or degeneracy effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref047">47</xref>] and, more generally, the nonlinearity of the genotype-phenotype map, render most of the phenotypic space inaccessible to the regulatory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref005">5</xref>]. This severely limits the space of possibilities accessible by evolutionary search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>A caveat of this study might lie in the sacrifice of the distinction between transcription factor expression and gene expression –as adopted in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref004">4</xref>]– in favor of a simpler interpretation of the developmental process; in our approach, genes act as transcription factors themselves. In this paper, we have studied how phenotypes stabilize after the repeated application of the mapping function. This reflects a reinterpretation of the developmental system: Development starts at an initial phenotype, which is iteratively mapped onto next-generation phenotypes by the developmental mapping function until either a stable phenotype is reached or another behavior becomes apparent. In this perspective, genotypes correspond to the regulatory network acting on the phenotypes, whereas the gene expression states are the phenotypes.</p>
<p>To address the issue of biological constraints imposed by the costs of the acquisition of additional genes in gene regulatory networks, we departed from commonly employed models and introduced the assumption of multiple discrete gene expression states, <italic>k</italic> &gt; 2. Although it is difficult to estimate how widespread multimodal gene expression is in nature, the increasing accumulation of gene expression data should lead to further elucidation of this issue. The assumption is in accordance with evidence for the existence of multiple expression states, including <italic>k</italic> = 3, that have recently been inferred from micro-RNA data by bioinformatic methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref048">48</xref>]. However, the full extent to which such states are inter-dependent in natural gene regulatory networks is unclear. Inter-dependent gene expression would markedly affect phenotype exploration for the organisms, potentially aggravating the effect of degeneracy.</p>
<p>Our adoption of the stability criterion based on a variance measure Ψ as well as restrictive parameter values, precludes the study specific dynamics. In particular, limit cycle behavior, or the alternating adoption of two distinct phenotypes in an organism, termed phenotypic switching, are not captured by this measure. For the values of <italic>δ</italic> employed in this study, these types of dynamics are not identified as stable phenotypes.</p>
<p>As a consequence, we have neglected a known and important stabilizing role of noise for the maintenance of alternating phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref049">49</xref>] by focusing on a restricted set of unchanging stable states. To allow for changing, but non-random phenotypes would require the implementation of more sophisticated measures of phenotype stability, as well as an implementation of noise that acts after the matrix multiplication in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0119972.e002">Eq (2)</xref>, and not before. Such measures would have to account for the cycling nature of phenotype dynamics and allow contributions from randomness to the dynamics to be disentangled from recurring regularities. Studies that focus on how reversible phenotypic switching is induced by noise also employ more detailed models of gene regulatory interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>A more realistic representation of a population of organisms of the same species might restrict the space of possible regulatory networks to a small fraction of all possible networks. To address this issue, we investigated stable networks. The pre-selection procedure involved in stable network choices mimicked artificial selection, reducing the space of networks investigated.</p>
<p>We also chose to simulate development starting from random initial phenotypes. This assumption is probably unrealistic. However, our focus was on the overall effect of noise on phenotype discovery. To satisfy more realistic assumptions, a decision needs to be made on which sub-space of phenotypes corresponds to more realistic biological phenotypes. Since this is currently unknown, such a restriction would be the same as studying random initial conditions.</p>
<p>To assess whether phenotypes had reached an equilibrium state under the influence of noise, we required that a variance-like statistic should satisfy a stability condition after <italic>T</italic> iterations of the developmental mapping function. The value of <italic>T</italic> was fixed for all simulations, and larger <italic>T</italic> might have led to more beneficial effects of noise, since more iterations would have been available for phenotypes to reach stable end states (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0119972.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0119972.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). <italic>T</italic> was held constant to mimic the limited lifetime of the developing organism.</p>
<p>Our results should be interpreted in the context of whether stochasticity can increase phenotypic variation in organisms. By generating phenotypic heterogeneity, stochasticity is expected to be particularly beneficial to microbial cells that may need to adapt efficiently to sudden changes in environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref013">13</xref>]. In eukaryotes such as yeast, it has recently been suggested that, for genes such as plasma-membrane transporters, noise in elevated expression is advantageous, is subject to positive selection, and facilitates evolution of adaptive gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref050">50</xref>]. This suggests that in specific regimes, stochastic models can evolve solutions where purely deterministic models fail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>We suggest that for noise to be beneficial, in the sense of an increase in the number of accessible phenotypes of binary systems, very specific conditions need to be satisfied. If increasing the number of genes in a network or fine-tuning the binding affinities of specific transcription factors to regulatory regions were costly to the organism, noise inherent in the process of gene regulation could be useful in increasing the number of accessible phenotypes.</p>
<p>These considerations also shed new light on the relative importance of regulatory evolution versus gene evolution, studied in the context of the evo-devo paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref054">54</xref>]. Phenotypes are made accessible to or concealed from the system undergoing development through changes in the current phenotypic state instead of in other “structural” processes such as gene duplication or mutation. This suggests an additional role for regulatory evolution in promoting or supporting evolutionary novelties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119972.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
