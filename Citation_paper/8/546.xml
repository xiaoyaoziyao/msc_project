        <p>A fundamental question in developmental biology is how spatial patterns are
                    self-organized from homogeneous structures. In 1952, Turing proposed the
                    reaction-diffusion model in order to explain this issue. Experimental evidence
                    of reaction-diffusion patterns in living organisms was first provided by the
                    pigmentation pattern on the skin of fishes in 1995. However, whether or not this
                    mechanism plays an essential role in developmental events of living organisms
                    remains elusive. Here we show that a reaction-diffusion model can successfully
                    explain the shoot apical meristem (SAM) development of plants. SAM of plants
                    resides in the top of each shoot and consists of a central zone (CZ) and a
                    surrounding peripheral zone (PZ). SAM contains stem cells and continuously
                    produces new organs throughout the lifespan. Molecular genetic studies using
                        <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> revealed that the formation and
                    maintenance of the SAM are essentially regulated by the feedback interaction
                    between WUSHCEL (WUS) and CLAVATA (CLV). We developed a mathematical model of
                    the SAM based on a reaction-diffusion dynamics of the WUS-CLV interaction,
                    incorporating cell division and the spatial restriction of the dynamics. Our
                    model explains the various SAM patterns observed in plants, for example,
                    homeostatic control of SAM size in the wild type, enlarged or fasciated SAM in
                        <italic>clv</italic> mutants, and initiation of ectopic secondary meristems
                    from an initial flattened SAM in <italic>wus</italic> mutant. In addition, the
                    model is supported by comparing its prediction with the expression pattern of
                        <italic>WUS</italic> in the <italic>wus</italic> mutant. Furthermore, the
                    model can account for many experimental results including reorganization
                    processes caused by the CZ ablation and by incision through the meristem center.
                    We thus conclude that the reaction-diffusion dynamics is probably indispensable
                    for the SAM development of plants.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A major subject of developmental biology is how stationary patterns are generated
                from homogeneous fields. In 1952, in order to account for this issue, Turing
                proposed the reaction-diffusion model in which stable patterns are self-organized by
                diffusible components interacting with each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Turing1">[1]</xref>. Whereas this Turing model has
                been extensively studied by mathematical biologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Meinhardt1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Murray1">[4]</xref>, until recently it has not been
                widely accepted by experimental biologists. However, following the description in
                1995 of a Turing pattern in the skin pigmentation of marine angelfish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Kondo1">[5]</xref>, the Turing model
                has attracted attention from developmental and molecular biologists. However, as
                most of morphogenetic events of animals are irreversible, the patterns that we can
                observe have been completed and are fixed. Therefore, it would be difficult to
                verify whether or not the reaction-diffusion pattern plays essential roles in
                morphogenesis processes in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Kondo2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Kondo3">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The shoot apical meristem (SAM) of plants resides in the top of the shoot and
                repetitively produces leaves, branches, and flowers. Whereas many morphogenetic
                events in animals are completed during embryogenesis, SAM continuously forms new
                organs throughout the lifespan. SAM is spatially restricted to a small area with an
                almost constant cell population despite active cell division. The SAM consists of a
                central zone (CZ) and a surrounding peripheral zone (PZ), which are distinct from an
                outer differentiated region named the organ zone (OZ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Clark1">[8]</xref>. Stem cells in the SAM are
                located in the outermost cell layers of the CZ region, and are positively controlled
                by a group of cells, termed the organizing center (OC), located beneath the stem
                cells. Many genes show variable levels of expression in different zones of the SAM
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Yadav1">[9]</xref>. Molecular
                genetic studies in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> revealed that many genes
                are involved in SAM formation and that a feedback interplay between
                    <italic>WUSCHEL</italic> (<italic>WUS</italic>) and <italic>CLAVATA</italic>
                    (<italic>CLV</italic>) is central to the regulation of the SAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Sablowski1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Stahl1">[13]</xref>. Mutation of
                    <italic>WUS</italic> or <italic>CLV</italic> results in opposite phenotypes:
                    <italic>clv</italic> mutants have enlarged meristems and frequently generate
                fasciated and bifurcated shoots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Clark2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Chuang1">[16]</xref>; <italic>wus</italic> mutants initially form a flat shoot
                apex without leaf primordia, in contrast to the dome-shaped structure of the wild
                type, suggesting that WUS is a positive regulator of SAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Laux1">[17]</xref>. Interestingly, the
                    <italic>wus</italic> mutant initiates ectopic secondary shoot meristems across
                the flattened apex, resulting in the formation of a bushy plant with a number of
                shoots and leaves. It is unclear why and how weakened WUS activity in the SAM leads
                to the production of so many ectopic meristems. A small peptide derived from CLV3 is
                perceived as a ligand by the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase CLV1, and
                possibly by CLV2-CORYNE (CRN) complex and RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 2 (RPK2) to
                restrict <italic>WUS</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Fletcher1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Kinoshita1">[22]</xref>. In contrast, the
                homeodomain transcription factor WUS promotes the <italic>CLV3</italic> expression
                in a non-cell-autonomous manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Schoof1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Mayer1">[24]</xref>, and also activates its own expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Leibfried1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Gordon1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To date, three mathematical models for the SAM pattern formation using
                reaction-diffusion system have been proposed based on WUS-CLV dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Jnsson1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Hohm1">[29]</xref>. These models can
                explain autonomous pattern formation in the SAM, for example, the expression of
                    <italic>WUS</italic> is stably established at the meristem center in the wild
                type, is enlarged by defects of <italic>CLV</italic>, and is regenerated following
                CZ ablation. However, these models do not take into account effects of cell division
                and spatial restrictions of the meristem and, accordingly, cannot explain the
                derivation of morphological features such as homeostatic control despite cell
                proliferation in the wild type and drastic morphological changes in
                    <italic>clv</italic> and <italic>wus</italic> mutants. Therefore, we developed
                an alternative mathematical model to describe the mechanism underlying SAM
                proliferation and patterning by integrating cell division and spatial restrictions
                of the meristem into the reaction-diffusion dynamics based on WUS-CLV
                regulation.</p>

        <p>We developed as simple a mathematical model as possible because we aimed to
                    understand the essential dynamics that underlie the proliferation and patterning
                    of the SAM in plants. Our SAM model is based on WUS-CLV dynamics and the spatial
                    restrictions of these dynamic interactions.</p>
        <sec id="s2a1">
          <title>(I) WUS-CLV dynamics</title>
          <p>Pattern formation by a Turing system has been extensively studied, especially
                        the activator-inhibitor system. In this system, the activator enhances its
                        own production and also production of the inhibitor, while the inhibitor
                        represses activator synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Meinhardt1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Murray1">[4]</xref>. Here,
                        we modeled WUS-CLV dynamics by reference to the activator-inhibitor system,
                        because the two systems have very similar regulatory interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018243-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Thus, in our
                        model, WUS and CLV equate to the activator and inhibitor, respectively. In
                        more detail, the diffusible peptide CLV3 corresponds to the inhibitor, and
                        CLV1, CLV2-CRN, and RPK2 are involved in its downstream pathway for
                        repressing the activator. On the other hand, as it is not known whether WUS
                        moves between cells, we assume that WUS is involved in the self-activation
                        pathway of the activator, a hypothetical diffusible molecule distinct from

                        formation of the PZ. The PZ and OZ are differentiated by having a

                        restricted to the CZ and PZ and does not occur in the OZ, by limiting the
                        activator synthesis to the CZ and PZ. Thus, in PZ cells, the activator is

                            (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018243-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). That is,
                        WUS-CLV dynamics induces the CZ and subsequent PZ, and in turn the SAM

                    two-dimensional manner, because its expression domain changes drastically in the
                    lateral direction by defects in the dynamics but does not longitudinally across
                    cell layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Fletcher1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Brand1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Lenhard1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Reddy2">[30]</xref>. We therefore modeled SAM pattern formation in
                    two-dimensional space. <italic>CLV3</italic> is, however, exclusively expressed
                    in the outermost cell layers, while <italic>WUS</italic> is expressed in the
                    underlying layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Sablowski1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Stahl1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Fletcher1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Mayer1">[24]</xref>. We examined the effect of this expressional
                    separation using a simplified two-layered cell network. This analysis indicated
                    that while stable patterns develop in the absence of any expressional
                    restrictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018243.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>), they are completely disrupted by introducing expressional
                    separation in which the activator and inhibitor are synthesized only in the
                    lower or upper layers, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018243.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). We presume that this disappearance
                    of patterning results from the retardation of signal transition from the
                    activator to the inhibitor, because activator synthesized in the lower layer
                    cannot induce the inhibitor until after reaching the upper layer. In fact,
                    stable patterns are restored by adding another diffusible factor
                            (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0018243.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) into the signaling pathway from the activator to
                    inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018243.s001">Fig.
                        S1C</xref>). Furthermore, the patterns depended on the diffusion coefficient
                    of this factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018243.s001">Fig. S1D</xref>). That is, pattern restoration requires that the diffusion
                    coefficient of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0018243.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>
                            (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0018243.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is sufficiently larger than that of the activator
                            (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0018243.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018243.s001">Fig. S1D</xref>). This evidence suggests that the
                        <italic>CLV3</italic> induction pathway involves an unknown diffusible
                    signal molecule other than the activator. These results indicate that pattern
                    formation caused by WUS-CLV dynamics in the SAM is essentially governed by the
                    activator-inhibitor mechanism. Therefore, for simplification, we performed the
                    numerical analyses described below using a conventional activator-inhibitor
                    system in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018243-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, with

                        Since the region with high activator concentrations corresponds to the CZ or
                        the stem cells, the proliferation mode represents the growth pattern of stem
                        cells in the absence of spatial restrictions. The proliferation mode is
                        affected by the dynamic balance between the positive and negative feedback
                        loops. Thus, the mode shifts sequentially from elongation, to division, then
                        to emergence, and finally to the fluctuation mode as the negative feedback
                        increases in strength compared with the positive feedback by decreasing

          <p>It is known that the constraint condition has a crucial effect on pattern
                        formation in reaction-diffusion systems. For example, while the
                        activator-inhibitor system can generate spotted, striped, or reverse spotted
                        patterns on a fixed two-dimensional plane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Meinhardt1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Murray1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Shoji1">[33]</xref>, these
                        patterns are responsive to the ratio of distances from the equilibrium to
                        the upper and lower limitations of the activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Shoji1">[33]</xref>. That is, the spotted
                        pattern, the reverse spotted pattern, and the striped pattern are generated
                        when the equilibrium is closer to the lower limitation, or closer to the
                        upper limitation, or equally distant from the both limitations,
                        respectively.</p>
          <p>Our model dynamics explicitly includes the constraint condition of the
                        activator, and it is shown that this constraint has crucial effects on the

                        with high concentrations becomes small compared to that with low
                        concentrations, and accordingly becomes to generate spots rather than
                        stripes. Resultantly the pattern shifts to the elongation mode, division

      <p>We show here that SAM patterning is essentially governed by only two parameters: the
                proliferation mode and stem cell containment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018243-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). The proliferation mode is defined by the
                dynamics of a molecular network, such as WUS-CLV interaction in <italic>A.
                    thaliana</italic>. We also show that the proliferation mode has only four
                groups, and this is a common property of Turing systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Murray1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Madzvamuse1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Holloway1">[32]</xref>. Accordingly, the summary of
                our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018243-g007">Fig. 7</xref> is
                applicable not only to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> but also to all other plant
                species. However, since the dynamics of each regulatory network may favor particular
                proliferation modes, it is likely that each plant species also show preferred
                patterns. On the other hand, stem cell containment is achieved through a spatial
                restriction mechanism. Under conditions of overly strong containment, a plant will
                die because of SAM breakdown; however, with weak containment, the plant loses
                control over the SAM resulting in excessive shoots. By contrast, under intermediate
                containment conditions, a plant can control the cell populations in the SAM. It is
                likely that this homeostasis pattern is present in most plant species including
                    <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. This result also provides an insight into why and
                how most plant species have a main shoot axis with a constant diameter.</p>

          <p>SAM pattern essentially depends on the proliferation mode and stem cell
                        containment strength. The proliferation mode can be sub-divided into four
                        groups, depending on the molecular dynamics regulating the SAM, such as
                        WUS-CLV dynamics of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. On the other hand, stem
                        cell containment is associated with the spatial restriction of the dynamics.

      <p>The branching of plant shoots is classified into two types: dichotomous or
                monopodial. Dichotomous branching, as is observed in <italic>Psilotum</italic>,
                appears to be the equivalent of the dichotomous pattern in our model. In contrast,
                it is likely that the lateral branches observed in many plant species are not
                associated with the monopodial pattern but rather are controlled by the distinct
                dynamics of auxin and its carrier, PIN1, because shoots in the <italic>pin1</italic>
                mutant of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> elongate normally but fail to generate
                lateral branches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Okada1">[46]</xref>. Our model also provides an insight into how shoot
                structures of plants has evolved between monopodial shoot axis and dichotomous shoot
                branching.</p>
      <p>For extending the model of this article to explain the pattern of a three-dimensional
                shoot, it is first required to introduce a three-dimensional cell network system
                that is capable of cell division. Furthermore, in order to generate the correct
                three-dimensional pattern of WUS-CLV expression, it seems to need spatial
                restrictions according to cell layer. As described in the above, spatial expressions
                of <italic>WUS</italic> and <italic>CLV3</italic> are strongly limited to the
                outermost cell layers and the underlying layers, respectively. It is likely that
                these spatial restrictions are not regulated by WUS-CLV dynamics itself but rather
                depend on an unknown upstream signaling pathway associated with cell layer
                differentiation. Therefore, these expressional limitations according to cell layer
                are required for simulating a three-dimensional meristem.</p>
      <p>Over half a century ago, Turing first proposed the reaction-diffusion mechanism as
                the basis for self-organization and pattern formation in biological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Turing1">[1]</xref>. In several
                developmental events of animals, candidate molecules that play a central role in
                pattern formation by the reaction-diffusion mechanism have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Kondo2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Kondo3">[7]</xref>. However, it
                would be difficult to demonstrate reaction-diffusion activity in these cases,
                because morphogenetic processes in most of them are irreversible and experimental
                perturbations may be lethal. By contrast, the SAM of plants repetitively produces
                new organs throughout the lifespan. In order to demonstrate the reaction-diffusion
                pattern in living systems, it is thought that two lines of evidence are required
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Kondo2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Kondo3">[7]</xref>. One is the
                identification of elements of interactive networks that fulfill the criteria of
                short-range positive feedback and long-range negative feedback. By a number of
                experimental studies, WUS-CLV dynamics clearly satisfies the criteria in the SAM
                pattern formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Sablowski1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Stahl1">[13]</xref>. The other requirement is to show that a
                reaction-diffusion wave exists, that is, we need to identify dynamic properties of
                the reaction-diffusion pattern that is predicted by the computer simulation. In the
                case of the SAM, results of earlier studies suggest that WUS-CLV dynamics satisfies
                this requirement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Jnsson1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018243-Hohm1">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, the findings of this article strongly
                reinforce this argument. Accordingly, it appears that WUS-CLV dynamics fulfills the
                requirement for demonstrating the reaction-diffusion pattern in the SAM. We thus
                conclude that the reaction-diffusion mechanism is probably indispensable for the SAM
                development of plants.</p>

                            in a two-layered cell network.</bold> (A) Stable patterns are developed
                        without any spatial restrictions under the Turing condition (inside the
                        dashed lines, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018243.s009">Methods S1</xref>). (B) However, stable patterns
                        are completely eliminated by introducing expressional separation in which
                        the activator and inhibitor are synthesized only in the lower and upper cell
                        layers, respectively. (C) In contrast, stable patterns are restored by
                        introducing another diffusible signal molecule (<italic>x</italic>) into the
                        signaling pathway from the activator to the inhibitor. (D) Pattern
                        restoration requires that the diffusion coefficient of <italic>x</italic>
                                (<italic>D<sub>x</sub></italic>) is sufficiently larger than that of
                        the activator (<italic>D<sub>u</sub></italic> = 0.25).
                        Filled circles and crosses indicate stable patterns and no stable patterns,
                        respectively. In A–C, the area enclosed by the dashed lines indicates
                        the Turing condition of Equations (3) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018243.s009">Methods
