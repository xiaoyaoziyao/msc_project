<abstract>
<p>Probiotics have been widely reported to increase the growth rate of commercially important fish and shellfish by enhancing the digestion of ingested feed through the production of extracellular enzymes such as proteases and alginases. In order to investigate this further, the objective of this study was to localise the bacterial probiont <italic>Vibrio midae</italic> SY9 and one of the extracellular proteases it produces in the digestive tract of the South African abalone <italic>Haliotis midae.</italic> This was accomplished by inserting a promotorless <italic>gfp</italic> gene into the chromosome of the bacterium which was incorporated in an artificial, fishmeal-based abalone feed. <italic>In situ</italic> histological comparison of abalone fed either a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9::Tn10.52 using a cocktail of DNA probes to the <italic>gfp</italic> gene localised the probiont to the crop/stomach and intestinal regions of the <italic>H. midae</italic> digestive tract. Generally, the ingested probiotic bacterium occurred in association with feed and particulate matter within the crop/stomach and intestinal regions, as well as adhered to the wall of the crop/stomach. Histological immunohistochemical examination using polyclonal anti-VmproA antibodies localised an extracellular protease produced by <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 to the <italic>H. midae</italic> crop/stomach and intestine where it appeared to be associated with feed and/or other particulate matter in the abalone gut. Thus the data suggests that <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 colonises and/or adheres to the mucous lining of the abalone gut. Furthermore, the close association observed between the bacterium, its extracellular protease and ingested feed particles supports the theory that <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 elevates <italic>in situ</italic> digestive enzyme levels and thus enhances feed digestion in farmed abalone.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>South Africa has a rapidly developing abalone aquaculture industry, based on the cultivation of <italic>Haliotis midae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Troell1">[1]</xref>. However, the relatively slow growth rate of abalone represents a major constraint on the aquaculture industry. The use of probiotic microorganisms is becoming increasingly accepted as a means of improving the health and growth of aquacultured species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Gomezgil1">[2]</xref>. Macey and Coyne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Macey1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Macey2">[4]</xref> demonstrated that <italic>H. midae</italic> fed a high protein diet supplemented with the probiotic <italic>Vibrio midae</italic> SY9 had increased digestive tract protease levels, enhanced protein digestion and increased growth rates in comparison to animals fed an un-supplemented diet.</p>
<p>Several possible modes of action have been proposed for probiotic effects observed within aquaculture environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Verschuere1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Balczar1">[6]</xref>, including the production and secretion of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes that contribute to, and improve, the digestion efficiency of the host. Several studies have demonstrated the effect of probiotic supplementation on abalone digestive enzyme activity levels and/or growth, and have suggested a possible role for ‘nutritional probiotics’ in abalone aquaculture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-tenDoeschate1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Iehata1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Abalone possess a unique microbiota that is capable of producing extracellular enzymes which degrade the major constituents of abalone feeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Sawabe1">[9]</xref>. However, less than 10% of the microorganisms associated with the abalone digestive tract can be cultured in the laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Tanaka1">[10]</xref>. Consequently, culture-independent methodologies are necessary for investigating gut microorganisms within their natural habitat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Tanaka2">[11]</xref>. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) using specific 16S rDNA oligonucleotide probes is a culture-independent method used for investigating bacterial population diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Tanaka2">[11]</xref>, and is an ideal method for investigating microorganisms <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Moter1">[12]</xref>. ISH techniques have been successfully used to investigate the microbiota of goldfish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Asfie1">[13]</xref>, abalone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Macey2">[4]</xref>, <italic>Artemia</italic> nauplii <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Hj1">[14]</xref> and salmon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Holben1">[15]</xref>, and to specifically localise intracellular prokaryotes in abalone tissue sections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Antonio1">[16]</xref>. Rengpipat <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Rengpipat1">[17]</xref> successfully tagged the shrimp probiotiont <italic>Bacillus</italic> S11 with GFP and then monitored the presence of this probiotic within the digestive tract of the Black Tiger shrimp <italic>Penaeus monodon</italic> following dietary supplementation. Histological analysis of intestinal samples revealed that the GFP-tagged probiotic bacterium was viable and localised to the surface of the shrimp’s intestine.</p>
<p>Macey and Coyne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Macey1">[3]</xref> observed significantly increased growth rates in abalone fed a probiotic supplemented feed, as well as increased protease activity, protein digestion and protein absorption within the intestinal region of these abalone. This finding supports the view that feeding aquacultured species with probiotic microorganism(s) capable of producing and secreting hydrolytic extracellular enzymes may improve digestion efficiency of the host animal, resulting in enhanced host growth rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Erasmus1">[18]</xref>. Detection of the <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 extracellular protease VmproA within the digestive tract of <italic>H. midae</italic> fed ABFEED® S34 supplemented with the probiont may indicate that a similar process is responsible for the increased growth rate reported in abalone fed ABFEED® containing the bacterium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Macey1">[3]</xref>. Thus the aim of this study was to utilize immunohistochemistry, ISH and standard histological staining techniques to investigate the spatial distribution of <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 and VmproA within the digestive tract of <italic>H. midae.</italic></p>

<title>Preparation of <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9::Tn10.52-supplemented Feed</title>
<p>The basal diet consisted of ABFEED® S34 weaning chips as supplied by Marifeed (Pty.) Ltd., Hermanus, South Africa. The <italic>gfp</italic> chromosomally-tagged probiotic strain <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9::Tn10.52 was incorporated into ABFEED® S34 weaning chips by vacuum infusion, to a final concentration of at least 1.0×10<sup>8</sup> culturable cells g<sup>-1</sup> feed. Briefly, <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9::Tn10.52 was cultivated for 24 hrs in 3 litres of P-MBM supplemented with 120 µg/ml Sm and 400 µg/ml Kan on an orbital shaker (100 rpm) at 22°C. Thereafter, the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,000×g for 15 minutes at 4°C), washed with one volume of artificial seawater (ASW) [(wt/vol): 3% NaCl, 0.23% MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.03% KCl] and resuspended in 100 ml of ASW. Approximately 200 g of the ABFEED® S34 weaning chips were sealed inside a glass vacuum jar and a vacuum drawn within the jar to approximately 80 kPa. Approximately 20 ml of the <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9::Tn10.52 suspension was drawn into the vacuum jar and thoroughly mixed with the feed. During the process of drawing the bacterial suspension into the chamber, the vacuum was decreased to 50 kPa and maintained at this pressure for 5 minutes. Thereafter, the vacuum was slowly released, the impregnated ABFEED® S34 weaning chips removed from the jar and dried at 22°C overnight, before being sealed into clean plastic bags and stored at 4°C. Fresh batches of feed were prepared every 7 days and each batch was analyzed by determining the total number of culturable bacterial cells to ensure that there was at least 1×10<sup>6</sup> culturable <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9::Tn10.52 cells g/feed.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Juvenile <italic>H. midae</italic> (&lt;15 mm shell length) were kept at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Research Aquarium (Cape Town, South Africa). Abalone were maintained in plastic mesh baskets (each containing approximately 50 animals) in adjacent 30 litre tanks supplied with aerated and continuously flowing (approximately 100 l/hr) sand-filtered sea water at 15–18°C, and subjected to a 10∶14 (light:dark) light-cycle. The animals were acclimatized for 3 weeks prior to the start of the experiment. During acclimatization the abalone were fed ABFEED® S34 weaning chips to satiation. All uneaten food was removed from the baskets and the tanks and baskets were thoroughly cleaned every 2 days before the addition of fresh feed.</p>
<p>Abalone in both tanks were starved for a period of 24 hours prior to the beginning of the experiment. At the start of the experiment (Day 0), six randomly selected animals were removed from each tank and immediately sacrificed. The remaining abalone in one tank were fed the <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9::Tn10.52-supplemented diet, while those in the other tank were fed the basal diet. The animals were fed to satiation on the respective diets for the duration of the experiment. Six randomly selected animals were sacrificed from each treatment group on days 2 and 14.</p>

Following fixation, the abalone samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series to 100% xylene (Saarchem) in a Tissue Trek II tissue processor. The dehydrated tissue samples were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 5 µm, adhered onto positively charged microscope slides (SuperFrost® Plus, Menzel-Gläser) and stored in slide boxes at room temperature.</p>
<p>The <italic>H. midae</italic> sections were deparaffinised and stained using standard Harris’ H&amp;E stain according to Hayat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Hayat1">[25]</xref> and mounted with phosphate-buffered glycerin jelly [50% (vol/vol) Glycerol (Merck), 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 7.5% (wt/vol) gelatine (Merck)].

<title>In situ Hybridization</title>
<p><italic>H. midae</italic> sections were processed for ISH after being deparaffinized and rehydrated through an ethanol series [99.9, 95, 80, 70, and 50% (v/v) ethanol]. Slides were covered with pre-warmed ISH buffer [50% (vol/vol) formamide (Sigma), 4x SSC, 1x Denhardt’s solution (Sigma), 0.2 mg yeast tRNA (Sigma), 0.5 mg denatured Herring sperm DNA (Sigma)] and pre-hybridized at 42°C for 60 minutes in a humid chamber to reduce non-specific hybridization of the probe(s). Thereafter, the tissue sections were heat denatured on a heating block (98°C for 10 minutes) and subsequently cooled rapidly on ice. The sections were probed with the cocktail of <italic>gfp</italic>-specific probes (GFP001, GFP002 and GFP003). Each probe was added at a concentration of approximately 6.66 pmol/ml of ISH buffer, resulting in a total probe concentration of 20 pmol/ml. The positive (EUB338) and the negative (ECJ109) control oligonucleotide probes were added at a concentration of 20 pmol/ml of ISH buffer.</p>
<p>Pre-heated ISH buffer containing 20 pmol/ml of the DIG-labeled probes was evenly layered onto the tissue sections and incubated for approximately 16 hours at 40°C in a humid chamber. Any unbound DIG-labeled probes were removed from the tissue sections by washing twice for 5 minutes in 2x SSC at 22°C with gentle agitation, twice for 5 minutes in 1x SSC at 22°C with gentle agitation, and twice for 10 minutes in 0.5x SSC at 40°C with gentle agitation. The tissue sections were then equilibrated in buffer 1 [150 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)] for 2 minutes at 22°C.

Anti-digoxigenin-AP (Roche) signalling molecule was applied to the sections which were incubated for 3 hrs at 22°C in a humid chamber.</p>
<p>The tissue sections were rinsed briefly with buffers 1 and 2 [100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>], respectively, before being overlaid with a NBT/BCIP (Roche) colour development solution, prepared in buffer 2 according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and incubated at 22°C in a dark humid chamber until a signal was visible. The colour development reaction was stopped by washing the slides with TE buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mM EDTA] and rinsing with distilled water. The sections were counter-stained with 0.05% (w/v) aqueous Methyl Green (Sigma) for 2 minutes to enhance the background tissue morphology, rinsed with dH<sub>2</sub>O, dried and mounted as described above. Hybridization signals indicating the presence of the target microorganism(s) were visible as a purple precipitate where the DIG-labelled probe had bound to homologous target DNA within the tissue sections.

<p>Bacteria are known to occur throughout the digestive tract of aquatic invertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Harris1">[27]</xref>.

There was no immunohistochemical evidence of VmproA within the <italic>H. midae</italic> digestive tract of abalone fed the basal diet over the course of the 14 day experimental period. VmproA appeared to be less abundant in the crop/stomach than the intestine of abalone fed <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9::Tn10.52 supplemented feed. Similarly, elevated levels of <italic>in situ</italic> alkaline protease activity detected in the crop/stomach of abalone fed ABFEED® supplemented with <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 were not as pronounced as the protease activity observed in the intestinal regions of these animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Macey2">[4]</xref>. Since <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9::Tn10.52 cells detected in the intestine by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization with the <italic>gfp</italic>-specific probes was more abundant in comparison to the crop/stomach, it is likely that the relative abundance of detectable VmproA in the intestine is a function of the elevated <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 cell number in this portion of the <italic>H. midae</italic> digestive tract. Indeed, a significant positive correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.711, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, n = 17) was found between intestinal protease activity and the number of <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9.8 cells present, supporting an association between <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 and protease activity in the intestine of <italic>H. midae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086623-Macey2">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>VmproA appeared to be generally associated with the feed and/or particulate matter within the intestine of <italic>H. midae</italic> fed the <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9::Tn10.52 -supplemented ABFEED® diet. Immunohistochemical localisation of VmproA within the <italic>H. midae</italic> digestive tract appears to be similar to the <italic>in situ</italic> localisation of <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9::Tn10.52 detected by the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis of whole-animal tissue sections. Thus, it could be hypothesised that viable <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 cells, ingested with the supplemented ABFEED® pellets, may attach to the surface of the digestive tract but are mostly associated with food particles and/or other particulate matter in the abalone digestive tract. Presumably, proximity to protein-rich ABFEED® induces <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 to secrete proteases such as VmproA within the digestive tract of <italic>H. midae</italic>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 and its extracellular protease, VmproA, could be localised within the digestive tract of <italic>H. midae</italic> fed a <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9-supplemented diet. The data suggests that <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 may colonise and/or adhere to the mucous lining of the abalone gut, as well as associate with the surfaces of ingested food particles passing through the digestive tract. In so doing, <italic>V. midae</italic> SY9 may elevate <italic>in situ</italic> enzyme levels and thus enhance feed digestion. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to localize an extracellular protease produced by a probiotic bacterium in the abalone digestive tract.</p>
