<title>Background</title>
<p>Human experimental pain models leading to development of secondary hyperalgesia are used to estimate efficacy of analgesics and antihyperalgesics. The ability to develop an area of secondary hyperalgesia varies substantially between subjects, but little is known about the agreement following repeated measurements. The aim of this study was to determine if the areas of secondary hyperalgesia were consistently robust to be useful for phenotyping subjects, based on their pattern of sensitization by the heat pain models.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We performed post-hoc analyses of 10 completed healthy volunteer studies (n = 342 [409 repeated measurements]). Three different models were used to induce secondary hyperalgesia to monofilament stimulation: the heat/capsaicin sensitization (H/C), the brief thermal sensitization (BTS), and the burn injury (BI) models. Three studies included both the H/C and BTS models.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Within-subject compared to between-subject variability was low, and there was substantial strength of agreement between repeated induction-sessions in most studies. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) improved little with repeated testing beyond two sessions. There was good agreement in categorizing subjects into ‘small area’ (1<sup>st</sup> quartile [&lt;25%]) and ‘large area’ (4<sup>th</sup> quartile [&gt;75%]) responders: 56–76% of subjects consistently fell into same ‘small-area’ or ‘large-area’ category on two consecutive study days. There was moderate to substantial agreement between the areas of secondary hyperalgesia induced on the same day using the H/C (forearm) and BTS (thigh) models.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Secondary hyperalgesia induced by experimental heat pain models seem a consistent measure of sensitization in pharmacodynamic and physiological research. The analysis indicates that healthy volunteers can be phenotyped based on their pattern of sensitization by the heat [and heat plus capsaicin] pain models.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It has been hypothesized that the propensity for developing central sensitization in response to noxious events is a heritable trait and may explain differences in susceptibility to developing chronic pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Woolf1">[1]</xref>. Noxious skin stimulation of sufficient intensity and duration, leads to the development of an area of secondary hyperalgesia surrounding the stimulation site (cutaneous sensitization). The area of secondary hyperalgesia is experimentally induced with either chemical, electrical or heat stimuli. This phenomenon is inducible in most subjects and thought to be due, at least in part, to central neuronal sensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Woolf1">[1]</xref>. Further, the size of the area of secondary hyperalgesia is commonly used as the primary outcome measure in human experimental studies of pain mechanisms, or when testing the effect of anti-hyperalgesic drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Frymoyer1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>It has been recognized that areas of secondary hyperalgesia varies substantially between subjects, but there is a scarcity of information in the literature about the within-subject and between-subject variability. Human twin studies indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the size of the secondary hyperalgesia area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Norbury1">[9]</xref>. In support, a recent study of human twins showed that familial effects accounted for 24–32% of observed variances in heat and cold pressor pain thresholds, and, opioid-mediated elevations in cold pressor pain tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Angst1">[10]</xref>. These observations need further validation.</p>
<p>To address the variability issue, we pooled drug- and placebo-free data from 10 different healthy volunteer pain model studies in which the area of secondary hyperalgesia, determined with mechanical stimulation, was used as a primary outcome measure. We aimed to examine the robustness of cutaneous secondary hyperalgesia induced by one or more of three different human experimental models: the heat/capsaicin sensitization model (H/C), the brief thermal sensitization model (BTS), and the burn injury model (BI). Because some of the studies used two different models (H/C and BTS) in the same subject, the variability and reliability of the 2 models could be compared directly. Our hypothesis was that it is possible to phenotype subjects based on their pattern of sensitization across days and across models.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Data was obtained from ten studies (9 published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Petersen1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Frymoyer1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Petersen2">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks4">[13]</xref> and 1 unpublished [Petersen et al., unpublished data]) of healthy volunteers (conducted in Copenhagen or San Francisco) in which experimental cutaneous secondary hyperalgesia was induced on two or more study days, and in which the area of secondary hyperalgesia to monofilament stimulation was the primary outcome measure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062733-t001">Table 1</xref>). Three different pain models were used: the heat/capsaicin sensitization (H/C) model, the brief thermal sensitization (BTS) model and the burn-injury (BI) model. In the ten studies, five used only the H/C model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Petersen1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Mikkelsen1">[6]</xref>, unpublished data), one used the BTS model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Petersen2">[11]</xref>, and one study used the BI model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Ravn1">[12]</xref>. In three studies subjects underwent both testing with the H/C and BTS model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks3">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Frymoyer1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks4">[13]</xref>. Study design, timing and procedures were largely similar; differences are noted below and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062733-t001">Table 1</xref>. Data collected after administration of a study drug or placebo, were not included in the analyses. In eight studies secondary hyperalgesia areas were measured prior to any study drug or placebo administration, on two or more study days at least one week apart. In two methodology studies not involving any drug administration, secondary hyperalgesia areas were collected during multiple sessions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062733-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Ravn1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks4">[13]</xref>.</p>

Stimulation along each path started well outside the hyperalgesic area and continued toward the stimulated skin area. The subjects, who had their eyes closed during the assessments, reported the occurrence of a definite change in sensation: A mildly noxious pin-like sensation, more intense pricking, burning or tenderness. The border was marked, and the transverse and longitudinal axes were measured for surface area calculations.</p>
<p>In the burn injury study the secondary hyperalgesia border was determined by a monofilament (90.6 g) stimulating in 8 symmetric lines each separated by angles of 45° converging towards the centre of the burn injury. Secondary hyperalgesia areas were measured 1, 2 and 3 hours after the BI. The corners of the octagon were marked on the skin with a felt-tipped pen and transferred to a transparent sheath. The octagonal secondary hyperalgesia area was calculated using a computer-based vector-algorithm (Canvas 12.0, ACD Systems International, Victoria, Canada).</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Parallel analyses were performed for all 3 methods of induction of experimental cutaneous secondary hyperalgesia. Analyses are shown by study, then pooled across all studies. In 4 studies, the data sets no longer contained information on the order of treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks2">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks3">[7]</xref>. For those studies, pre-treatment data from the placebo session was used as the first measurement.</p>
<p>For the continuous outcome of area of secondary hyperalgesia, normality was examined using residual plots and histograms. The strength of association between the first and second measurement was examined with Pearson or Spearman’s correlation coefficients, depending on the distribution. The size of the difference between the 2 measurements was examined with mean differences, tested with a paired t-test. Agreement between the repeat measurements was examined with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs (1,1)) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were indicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Shrout1">[14]</xref>. While there are no agreed upon classifications for levels of agreement for ICCs, for interpretation purposes ICCs were categorized as slight/poor (≤0.2), fair (&gt;0.2 to 0.4), moderate (&gt;0.4 to 0.6), substantial (&gt;0.6 to 0.8) and almost perfect (&gt;0.8) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Landis1">[15]</xref>. Bland-Altman plots were presented on pooled data to assess systematic bias in the differences in measurement 1 and measurement 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Bland1">[16]</xref>. A mixed models approach was used to examine the effect of time in the six studies where the session order was known.</p>
<p>Subjects were categorized in quartiles based on quartile cut-points derived from the distribution of secondary hyperalgesia values from measurement 1 and measurement 2. Some analyses were simplified to three categories, ‘small-’ (1<sup>st</sup> quartile [&lt;25%]), ‘mid-’ (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> quartile [25–75%]) or ‘large-area’ (4<sup>th</sup> quartile [&gt;75%]) secondary hyperalgesia). For the repeatability of categorizations, contingency data were evaluated by a quadratic weighted Cohen’s kappa coefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Armitage1">[17]</xref>. For the three studies in which secondary hyperalgesia was induced by both H/C (forearm) and BTS (thigh) on the same day, similar analyses were performed comparing the categorizations from the two methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks3">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Frymoyer1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks4">[13]</xref>. Levels of agreement were classified similar to those for ICC listed above.</p>
<p>All significance levels reported are 2-sided. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and Medcalc Software version 11.1.6.0 (Mariakerke, Belgium). In the secondary analyses, a Bonferroni correction was applied to <italic>P</italic>-values to examine if the significance observed held after correction for multiple comparisons. The significance level was set to &lt;0.05/9 = 0.006 for the HC analyses, &lt;0.05/5 = 0.01 for the BTS analyses and left as <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 for BI analyses because there is only one study with this method of induction.

The reliability as shown by the ICCs demonstrated ‘fair’ agreement in one study (ICC = 0.30), ‘moderate’ agreement in two studies (0.52 and 0.55), and ‘substantial’ agreement in 5 studies. The analysis on pooled data demonstrated a ‘substantial’ strength of agreement between the 2 measurements (ICC = 0.69). The Bland-Altman plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062733-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) illustrate a random scattering of points both above and below the average mean difference with few points falling outside the 95% confidence interval, showing a lack of systematic bias between the first and second measurements.

In the BI study, using the median values of the 3 hourly post-burn assessments, increases in the correlation coefficient (rho) from 0.64 to 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68–0.84) and for the ICC from 0.58 to 0.67 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.77), were seen.</p>

<title>Secondary statistical analyses</title>
<p>Results were largely similar after applying a Bonferroni correction to <italic>P</italic>-values.

</sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that measurement of secondary hyperalgesia areas, induced by experimental heat [and heat plus capsaicin] pain models, seems a consistent and repeatable measure of sensitization in pharmacodynamic and physiological research. The statistical analyses indicated that healthy volunteers can be phenotyped based on their pattern of sensitization by the heat pain models, confirming the study hypothesis.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Within-Subject vs. Between-Subject Variation</title>
<p>Most importantly, the present analysis showed a low within-subject test-retest variation, compared to the substantial between-subject variation. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated that the within-subject variance was approximately 25% of the between-subject variance demonstrating a good within-subject agreement during repeated assessments.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>Agreement across Measurements and Methods</title>
<p>The agreement between measurements, in pooled secondary hyperalgesia areas, was ‘substantial’ in all models and the agreement between areas induced with the H/C and BTS models on the same study day was ‘moderate’ to ‘substantial’(<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062733-t002">Table 2</xref>). Grouping the first measurement session data into quartiles, widely separating the ‘small-area’ from ‘large-area’ responders, illustrated that the categorizations generally held up at the second measurement session (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062733-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062733-t004">4</xref>). For ‘small-area’ (1<sup>st</sup> quartile) as well as ‘large-area’ (4<sup>th</sup> quartile) responders, 56–76% of subjects remained in the same quartile grouping. Subjects almost never crossed all the way from ‘small-area’ to ‘large-area’ (or vice versa), this was only seen in 1 out of 409 assessments. Surprisingly, for those studies that had more than two sessions, the improvement of ICC from having additional measurement sessions was limited.</p>
<p>These results suggest that the area of secondary hyperalgesia is reproducible across multiple sessions. ‘Small-area’ and ‘large-area’ responders can be selected with reasonable confidence by requiring that a subject fall in the respective categories on two consecutive model inductions. If the goal in a pharmacodynamic trial was to select a group of 20 ‘small-area’ and 20 ‘large-area’ responders, approximately 130 subjects would be needed to undergo pre-trial induction of secondary hyperalgesia on the first measurement. From these tested subjects ‘small-area’ and ‘large-area’ responders are selected (n = 65) and continue with the same model on the second measurement. Since 60–70% will repeat an identical outcome at second measurement, at least 20 ‘small-area’ and 20 ‘large-area’ subjects with a consistent secondary hyperalgesia response are likely to appear. Noteworthy, when secondary hyperalgesia was induced with both the H/C (forearm) and BTS (thigh) in the same subject on the first assessment day, 32% of subjects were classified in the same responder group (‘small' or ‘large') with both models, suggesting robustness across models, and that subjects can be classified as ‘small’ or ‘large’ area subjects in a single study day.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4c">
<title>‘No-Responders'</title>
<p>Little information is available on the proportion of healthy persons in the general population who would fail to develop an area of secondary hyperalgesia in response to one of the three pain models used in the 10 studies analyzed here. For the 9 studies using H/C and/or BTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Petersen1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Frymoyer1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Petersen2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Dirks4">[13]</xref>, unpublished data), such subjects were excluded after the training session for failing to develop the primary outcome measure and no further data were collected. In the BI study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Ravn1">[12]</xref> analyzed, 5% failed to develop an area at any session.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4d">
<title>Limitations and Advantages of the Study</title>
<p><italic>First</italic>, this is a secondary analysis of 9 published and one unpublished study, which should be taken into consideration, when interpreting the results. The study is, as such, a hypothesis generating study, but the high number of subjects (n = 342) and test-retest measurements (409 repeated measurements) seem to make the hypothesis solidly based. <italic>Second</italic>, the studies differ in methodology in regard to thermode size, measurement timing, bending force of the monofilaments, area calculations and body region sensitized. Some of these variables may affect the outcome, but unfortunately there is a void in the literature on the significance of these interactions. In each study, the methods were identical during the test-retest measurements, counterbalancing some of the negative effects by pooling the studies. An illustrative example was seen in the BI-model where a highly significant carry-over effect across the measurements was evident, indicating a habituation effect between measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062733-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The median interval between the measurements was 3 weeks, but hyposensitivity to painful stimuli has been described for up to 6 weeks after the BI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Pedersen1">[18]</xref>. Carry-over effects were not observed with either the H/C or the BTS pain models. To counterbalance this effect in the BI-model we refrained from using absolute area values, but used a relative ranking of the values during each of the two measurements, which seemed to eliminate the effect of habituation. Further, the robustness of the results across models and trial methodology may be considered to strengthen the overall conclusion of the analyses. <italic>Third</italic>, secondary hyperalgesia may differ not only in area-size but also in regard to duration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Pfau1">[19]</xref>, but the present study, based on single time measurements is not accommodated to address this question. <italic>Fourth</italic>, it is important to realize that data from the present study in volunteers, cannot be extrapolated to clinical situations with patients.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4e">
<title>Phenotyping and Prediction of Pain Sensitivity</title>
<p>Although speculative, our findings may represent a window of opportunity to further explore differences (phenotypes) in individual pain sensitivity and propensity to develop areas of secondary hyperalgesia, which likely depends on central neuronal sensitization. As pointed out by Woolf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Woolf1">[1]</xref>, the comorbidity of a number of pain hypersensitivity syndromes and their similar pattern of clinical presentation may reflect inherent, common attributes of central sensitization to their pathophysiology. Most importantly, the potential predictive value of identifying ‘small-’ and ‘large-area’ responders needs to be explored. Thus far, one study comprising 20 patients investigated the potential of preoperatively induced secondary hyperalgesia to predict subsequent dynamic postoperative pain in surgical patients, but no correlations were found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Werner2">[20]</xref>. However, a recent study demonstrated postsurgical area of secondary hyperalgesia to predict chronic postsurgical neuropathic pain in the iliac crest bone harvest model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Martinez1">[21]</xref>. Determining the predictive value of secondary hyperalgesia area for acute pain and other measures of pain hypersensitivity, as well as the risk for development of chronic pain, await much larger sufficiently powered studies.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4f">
<title>Phenotyping and Cutaneous Sensitization</title>
<p>The results of the previously mentioned studies in twins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Norbury1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Angst1">[10]</xref> demonstrate substantial influence of heritable factors for response to pain stimuli, such as the cold pressor response. A subject’s propensity subject of developing cutaneous sensitization may also contain underlying genetic factors that can be explored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Norbury1">[9]</xref>. Phenotyping subjects based on their the ability to develop cutaneous sensitization may, in fact, be equally or more important than phenotyping subjects on the basis of pain thresholds and could potentially be added to the battery of testing following algorithms like those of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062733-Geber1">[22]</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, post-hoc analyses of test-retest data from 342 healthy volunteers in 10 studies, employing experimentally induced cutaneous secondary hyperalgesia, in addition to corroborating the methodological consistency of these models in physiological and pharmacodynamic research, indicated that healthy volunteers can be phenotyped based on their pattern of sensitization by the heat [and heat plus capsaicin] pain models. These findings may represent an incentive to further explore individual differences in ability to develop neuronal sensitization, and to investigate if ‘large-area' responders are at an increased risk of developing conditions associated with pain hypersensitivity and chronification – and whether the pharmacodynamic profiles of analgesics and anti-hyperalgesics differ between ‘large-area' and ‘small-area' responders.</p>
