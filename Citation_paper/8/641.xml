<abstract>
<p>Sex and genetic factors determine skeletal mass, and we tested whether bone histomorphometric parameters were sexually dimorphic in femurs from 1 to 6 month old C57BL/6 mice. Trabecular bone volume declined more rapidly in female mice than in male littermates because of enhanced bone resorption. Although bone formation was not different between sexes, female mice exhibited a higher number of osteoblasts than male littermates, suggesting that osteoblasts from female mice may have a reduced ability to form bone. To determine the impact of sex on osteoblastogenesis, we investigated the potential for osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells from C57BL/6, Friend leukemia virus-B (FVB), C3H/HeJ and BALB/c mice of both sexes. Bone marrow stromal cells from female FVB, C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice exhibited lower <italic>Alpl</italic> and <italic>Osteocalcin</italic> expression and alkaline phosphatase activity, and formed fewer mineralized nodules than cells from male littermates. Proliferative capacity was greater in cells from male than female C57BL/6, but not FVB, mice. Sorting of bone marrow stromal cells from mice expressing an α-Smooth muscle actin-green fluorescent protein transgene, revealed a higher yield of mesenchymal stem cells in cultures from male mice than in those from female littermates. Sex had a modest impact on osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. To determine the influence of sex and genetic factors on osteoblast function, calvarial osteoblasts were harvested from C57BL/6, FVB, C3H/HeJ and BALB/c mice. <italic>Alpl</italic> expression and activity were lower in osteoblasts from C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ, but not FVB or BALB/c, female mice than in cells from littermates. Sex had no effect on osteoclastogenesis of bone marrow cultures of C57BL/6 mice, but osteoblasts from female mice exhibited higher <italic>Rankl</italic> and lower <italic>Opg</italic> expression than cells from male littermates. In conclusion, osteoblastogenesis is sexually dimorphic and influenced by genetic factors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human and rodent males attain higher peak bone mass during growth than females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Seeman1">[1]</xref>. Trabecular bone declines more rapidly and at a younger age in maturing female than in male C57BL/6 mice, so that adult female mice have less cancellous bone than male mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Glatt1">[2]</xref>. Whereas sex differences in skeletal mass and structure are evident, the mechanisms involved are understood poorly. Sex hormones regulate bone remodeling, but skeletal differences related to gender become evident prior to the onset of sexual maturity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Manolagas1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Callewaert1">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, genetic determinants regulate bone mass acquisition, and differences in androgen and estrogen levels do not seem to account for skeletal sexual dimorphism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Beamer1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Xiong1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The balance of osteoblast and osteoclast activity maintains skeletal remodeling and integrity, and alterations in osteoclast or osteoblast number or function can lead to changes in bone mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Canalis1">[7]</xref>. Osteoblast number is determined by the replication and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells toward osteoblasts, the death of mature cells and their differentiation into lining cells or osteocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Bianco1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Canalis2">[9]</xref>. Expression of the myxovirus resistance 1 promoter, or of the mesenchymal gene marker α-Smooth muscle actin (<italic>αSma</italic>) defines a population of osteoblast progenitors able to differentiate into osteoblasts, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Park1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Grcevic1">[12]</xref>. Multinucleated osteoclasts derive from the fusion of mononuclear cell precursors of the hematopoietic lineage residing in the bone marrow. Osteoclast precursors express receptor activator of nuclear factor-κb (Rank), and activation of Rank following contact with cells expressing Rank-ligand (Rankl), is required for osteoclastogenesis. Rankl activity is inhibited by the soluble Rankl receptor osteoprotegerin (Opg), so that the Rankl to Opg ratio determines the number and activity of osteoclasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Lacey1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Teitelbaum1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we explored the mechanisms determining sexual dimorphism in bone mass by performing histomorphometric analysis of cancellous bone from femurs of male and female C57BL/6 littermate mice. To investigate whether sex and genetic factors have an impact on osteoblast differentiation and function, we studied the potential for osteoblastogenesis of bone marrow stromal cells and the function of calvarial osteoblasts from male or female C57BL/6, tropism for Friend leukemia virus-B (FVB), BALB/c or C3H/HeJ mice. In addition, we tested whether the frequency and osteoblastic differentiation potential of mesenchymal cells from transgenic mice, where a fragment of the α<italic>Sma</italic> promoter directs the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), is sexually dimorphic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Wang1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Yokota1">[16]</xref>. To determine the influence of sex on osteoclastogenesis, we investigated the differentiation and activity of osteoclast precursors in bone marrow cell cultures from male or female C57BL/6 mice and measured the <italic>Rankl</italic> to <italic>Opg</italic> ratio in calvarial osteoblasts from male or female C57BL/6 mice.</p>

<title>Bone Histomorphometry</title>
<p>Femurs from 1, 3 and 6 month old male or virgin female C57BL/6 littermate mice were dissected from surrounding tissue, fixed in 70% ethanol, dehydrated and embedded in methyl methacrylate. Static histomorphometry was carried out on 5 µm thick longitudinal sections stained with toluidine blue (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Canalis3">[17]</xref>. Bone volume over tissue volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (TbN) and thickness (TbTh), number of osteoblasts per bone perimeter (NOb/BPm), osteoblast and osteoid surface over bone surface (ObS/BS and OS/BS, respectively), number of osteoclasts per bone perimeter (NOc/BPm) and osteoclast and eroded surface over bone surface (OcS/BS and ES/BS, respectively) were measured with an OsteoMeasure morphometry system (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA) in a defined area between 360 µm and 2160 µm from the growth plate. Dynamic histomorphometry was carried out on sections from mice injected with calcein 20 mg/kg and demeclocycline 50 mg/kg, at an interval of 2 days for 1 month old or 7 days for 3 and 6 month old mice, and sacrificed by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation 2 days after demeclocycline administration. Mineralizing surface per bone surface (MS/BS) and mineral apposition rate (MAR) were measured under ultraviolet light, using a triple diamino-2-phenylindole fluorescein set long-pass filter, and used to calculate bone formation rate (BFR). Terminology and units recommended in the 2012 update of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research Histomorphometry Nomenclature Committee, were used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Dempster1">[18]</xref>.</p>

<title>Primary Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Cultures and Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)</title>
<p>Two to 4, 1 month old C57BL/6, FVB, C3H/HeJ, BALB/c or <italic>αSma-GFP</italic> transgenic male and female littermate mice were sacrificed by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, and femurs and tibiae dissected aseptically. The proximal epiphysis of the femur or the distal epiphysis of the tibia were removed and bone marrow cells recovered by centrifugation or by flushing with α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Following removal of tissue debris and cellular aggregates by filtration, cell number was determined on a Nikon TMS inverted phase-contrast microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY). Whole bone marrow cell extracts from male and female mice exhibited similar number of cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086757-t001">Table 1</xref>). Cells were seeded at a density of 1.25×10<sup>6</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in α-MEM containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), which was inactivated by heating to 55°C for 30 min, and grown in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C. Cells in suspension were removed by replacing culture medium 48 h after seeding and adherent cells were considered bone marrow stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Bianco1">[8]</xref>. Four days after seeding, bone marrow stromal cells from C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ and BALB/c mice were exposed to α-MEM supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% FBS, 100 µg/ml ascorbic acid and 5 mM β-glycerophosphate (all from Sigma-Aldrich), to induce osteoblastic differentiation. Bone marrow stromal cells from FVB mice were exposed to culture conditions favoring osteoblastogenesis upon reaching confluence 12 days after seeding. To calculate the frequency of colony forming units positive for alkaline phosphatase (CFU-ALP) and to estimate cell proliferation, cells were seeded at a density of 6×10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and exposed to conditions favoring osteoblastogenesis 7 days after seeding.</p>

To induce expression of Rankl by adherent osteoblastic cells and differentiation of mononuclear precursors into osteoclast-like cells, cultures were exposed for 7 days to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>, dissolved in 100% Et-OH and diluted to a concentration of 10 nM in α-MEM containing 15% heat-inactivated FBS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Takahashi1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Kim1">[22]</xref>. Parallel control cultures were exposed to an equal volume of 100% Et-OH. To determine bone resorptive activity, cells were seeded on Osteo Assay Surface (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA), cultured for 7 days under conditions favoring osteoclastogenesis and removed with bleach before von Kossa staining of the culture surface. Images of the stained surfaces were acquired with a Coolpix 995 digital camera (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY), imported in ImageJ v 1.48d (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Abramoff1">[23]</xref> and converted to 8-bit grayscale. Identical thresholds of gray intensity were set below the background of each image analyzed and resorbed area was defined as the area occupied by pixels with values of gray intensity below the preset threshold, determined with the measure function of ImageJ.</p>

<p>Data are expressed as means ± SEM. To determine whether the effect of sex and time on parameters of bone histomorphometry was statistically significant, we accounted for the intracorrelation between mice from the same experiment. To this end, generalized linear models were estimated with a generalized estimating equation; exchangeable correlation structures were used. Independent variables in the models were sex and time, and all models included the interaction between sex and time. Dependent variables were static and dynamic parameters of bone histomorphometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Liang1">[33]</xref>.

<title>Histomorphometry of Distal Femur from C57BL/6 Mice</title>
<p>To establish whether the skeleton of maturing mice exhibits changes related to sex, we measured static and dynamic parameters of bone histomorphometry from 1, 3 and 6 month old male and female littermate C57BL/6 mice. Selected control histomorphometric data were extracted from previously published studies aimed at defining the phenotype of mice harboring the global or conditional inactivation of various genes (Canalis and Zanotti, unpublished observations) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Zanotti1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Canalis6">[39]</xref>. Trabecular bone volume, number and thickness were not different between male and female mice at 1 month of age. Trabecular bone volume remained stable in male mice until 6 months of age, but declined in female littermates at 3 months of age, and then it stabilized so that 3 and 6 month old female mice exhibited lower bone volume than male littermates. Trabecular number and thickness followed the same trend, although the differences in trabecular thickness between male and female mice at 6 months of age did not achieve statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Osteoblast number and surface were not sexually dimorphic at 1 month of age, but declined as male, but not female, mice aged, so that female mice had higher osteoblast number and surface than male littermates at 3 and 6 months of age. Osteoid surface was higher in female mice than in male littermates, remained stable in maturing female mice and declined in maturing male littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Parameters of bone formation were not significantly different between sexes as mice matured, with the exception of mineralizing surface per bone surface, which was higher in 3 month old male mice than in female littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Male mice exhibited fewer osteoclasts and less eroded surface than female littermates at 1 month of age. Indices of bone resorption declined to a similar extent in maturing mice of both sexes, so that they were higher in 3 and 6 month old female mice than in male littermates, although the difference in osteoclast number was not statistically significant at 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Histomorphometric analysis of femurs from 1 and 3 month old male and female littermate FVB mice revealed similar trends, although differences between sexes did not achieve statistical significance (data not shown). These findings indicate that trabecular bone volume declines more rapidly in female than in male C57BL/6 mice possibly due to higher bone resorption in female mice than in male littermates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Glatt1">[2]</xref>.</p>

<title>Differentiation of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells from C57BL/6 Mice</title>
<p>The higher number of osteoblasts in mature female mice did not translate in higher bone formation relative to mature male mice and was insufficient to compensate for the enhanced bone resorption so that cancellous bone declined in female mice. Therefore, we explored whether there were differences in the potential for osteoblastogenesis between male and female C57BL/6 mice. A progressive increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and in the formation of mineralized nodules was observed in bone marrow stromal cells from both sexes, demonstrating that osteoblastic differentiation had occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g002">Fig. 2A–B</xref>). At 7 and 14 days of culture, alkaline phosphatase activity was 70% lower in cells from female mice than in those from male littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Accordingly, cultures from female mice formed fewer mineralized nodules than cultures from male mice, suggesting reduced osteoblastic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). As osteoblastic differentiation progressed, <italic>Runx2</italic> expression remained stable in cells from male mice and declined modestly in cells from female littermates. Conversely, <italic>Alpl</italic> and <italic>Osteocalcin</italic> mRNA levels increased to a greater extent in cultures from male than female mice, confirming that cells from female C57BL/6 mice display less osteoblastic differentiation potential than cells from male littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate possible mechanisms responsible for the sexually dimorphic osteoblastic differentiation potential of bone marrow stromal cells, frequency of osteoblast progenitors and cell proliferation were measured in cells seeded at a reduced density, to allow for the formation of discrete cell clusters. Bone marrow stromal cells from female C57BL/6 mice displayed reduced CFU-ALP frequency when compared to cells from male littermates and cell number increased in cultures from male mice to a greater extent than in those from female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g002">Fig. 2C–D</xref>). These findings indicate that differences related to the number of osteoblast progenitors and cell proliferation contribute to the sexually dimorphic osteoblastic differentiation potential of bone marrow stromal cells from C57BL/6 mice.</p>

<title>Differentiation of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells from C3H/HeJ and BALB/c Mice</title>
<p>To assess the impact of genetic factors on the sexually dimorphic potential for osteoblastogenesis of bone marrow stromal cells, we also investigated osteoblastic differentiation in bone marrow stromal cells from C3H/HeJ and BALB/c mice.

<title>Differentiation of Calvarial Osteoblasts</title>
<p>To investigate whether sexual dimorphism affects the function of mature osteoblastic cells, we cultured primary calvarial osteoblasts harvested from C57BL/6, FVB, C3H/HeJ and BALB/c mice. In cells from C57BL/6 mice, alkaline phosphatase activity increased as the culture progressed and the magnitude of the effect was larger in osteoblasts from male than female mice, so that cells from female mice exhibited lower alkaline phosphatase activity than cells from male littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Accordingly, cells from female mice expressed lower levels of <italic>Alpl</italic> transcripts than cells from male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Although cells from female mice exhibited a tendency toward reduced expression of <italic>Runx2</italic> in comparison to cells from male littermates, <italic>Osteocalcin</italic> expression was not different between cells from mice of both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086757-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).

<title>Osteoclastogenesis in Cell Cultures from C57BL/6 Mice</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanisms that determine higher levels of bone resorption in female mice than in male littermates, we assessed the formation and activity of osteoclast-like cells in primary bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice. Under basal conditions, formation of multinucleated osteoclast-like cells was minimal in cultures from both sexes.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present work, we confirmed that cancellous bone volume declines in maturing female C57BL/6 mice, whereas it remains stable in male littermates. Femoral length was not different between male and female mice (), indicating that sex had no bearing on skeletal growth. Bone resorption that exceeds the capacity of osteoblasts to form new bone seems to explain the decline in cancellous bone observed in female mice. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies in osteoblastic cells from C57BL/6 mice suggest that this effect is secondary to differential expression of <italic>Rankl</italic> and <italic>Opg</italic> by mature osteoblasts and not mediated by the expression of sex steroid receptors.</p>
<p>Parameters of bone formation were not sexually dimorphic, although female mice exhibited a higher number of osteoblasts than male mice, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms acting on osteoblast differentiation or function preclude sex from having an impact on bone formation. Accordingly, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies revealed that bone marrow stromal cell cultures from female mice exhibit reduced osteoblastic differentiation potential compared to cultures from male littermates. This phenomenon is not exclusive to the C57BL/6 genetic background and also was observed in cultures from FVB and C3H/HeJ mice, although sex had only a modest influence in cultures from BALB/c mice. The magnitude of the sexual dimorphism was determined by genetic background, confirming previous studies indicating that number of osteoblast progenitors and potential for osteoblastogenesis of bone marrow stromal cell cultures are influenced by the strain of inbred donor mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Phinney1">[40]</xref>. Our findings are in accordance with previous results obtained in cells from Sprague-Dawley rats, suggesting that sex determines the potential for osteoblastogenesis in bone marrow stromal cells from rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Strube1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>In humans and rodents, differences in the levels of androgens and estrogens between sexes influence skeletal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Callewaert1">[4]</xref>. However, it is not likely that hormonal influences determined the sexually dimorphic potential for osteoblastogenesis observed, since cells were obtained from mice before they reached full sexual maturity. Therefore, genetic determinants may establish differences in osteoblastic cellular behavior, and this notion is supported by the observation that different genetic backgrounds exhibit varying degrees of sexual dimorphism in osteoblastic differentiation and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Beamer1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Xiong1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Analysis of frequency of osteoblastic precursors and studies in bone marrow stromal cell cultures from <italic>αSma-GFP</italic> transgenic mice indicate that the sexually dimorphic potential for osteoblastogenesis is due to reduced number of mesenchymal cells in cultures from female mice. Suppressed proliferation in cells from female mice also contributes to this effect, although only cultures from C57BL/6 mice exhibit sex related differences in their capacity for cell proliferation, confirming the influence of genetic background on the extent of sexual dimorphism in osteoblastogenesis. Selected aspects of osteoblast differentiation are suppressed in osteoblast precursors from female <italic>αSma-GFP</italic> transgenic mice in comparison to cells from male littermates, and these differences might contribute to the effect of sex on the potential for osteoblastogenesis. No differences related to sex are observed in the activity of intracellular signaling pathways that regulate osteoblastogenesis, such as bone morphogenetic protein/signaling mothers against decapentaplegic, Wnt/β-catenin and insulin-like growth factor/Akt (data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Canalis7">[42]</xref>. Mesenchymal stem cells harvested from human adipose tissue and murine skeletal muscle can differentiate into osteoblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> and in agreement with our observations, cells from female donors commit to the osteoblastic lineage to a lesser extent than cells from male individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Aksu1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Corsi1">[44]</xref>. Therefore, sexually dimorphic potential for osteoblastogenesis may be a characteristic shared by mesenchymal stem cells irrespective of species and tissue of origin.</p>
<p>In contrast to the observations in mature cultures of bone marrow stromal cells, only limited aspects of the osteoblastic phenotype displayed differences related to sex in primary calvarial osteoblasts. This discrepancy suggests that in male and female mice, factors determining osteoblastogenesis must act early during the differentiation program for sexual dimorphism to develop completely and compensating mechanisms might reduce the impact of sex on osteoblastogenesis as cells mature <italic>in vivo</italic>. An alternative explanation is the different developmental origin of the bones used to provide bone marrow stromal cells and osteoblasts, since long bones derive by condensation of mesenchymal cells in the limb bud, whereas parietal bones originate from the neural crest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Santagati1">[45]</xref>. Studies investigating expression of sex steroid receptors in calvarial osteoblasts revealed that sex had only a modest effect on the expression of androgen and estrogen receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086757.s004">Table S4</xref>), suggesting that differential expression of sex steroid receptors does not mediate the effects of sex on osteoblast function.</p>
<p>In conclusion, sex determines cancellous bone architecture of C57BL/6 mice and sex genetic factors have an impact on osteoblastogenesis. Although sexual dimorphism in humans and rodents is pervasive, findings from studies limited to one sex often are generalized to both sexes, a practice that may lead to erroneous interpretation of experimental results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Cahill1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Klein1">[47]</xref>. Sexual dimorphism extends to mechanisms regulating cellular function, either under physiological or pathological conditions, underlying the importance of declaring the donor sex for studies performed in cell cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Arnold1">[48]</xref>. Our results confirm that sex influences the interpretation of studies addressing skeletal structure and function, as well as highlight the importance of preserving the identity of cell cultures from donors of different sexes when investigating the mechanisms that determine osteoblastogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086757-Glatt1">[2]</xref>.</p>
