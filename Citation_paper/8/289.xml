<title>Study Objectives</title>
<p>To develop and validate a novel non-contact system for whole-night sleep evaluation using breathing sounds analysis (BSA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Design</title>
<p>Whole-night breathing sounds (using ambient microphone) and polysomnography (PSG) were simultaneously collected at a sleep laboratory (mean recording time 7.1 hours). A set of acoustic features quantifying breathing pattern were developed to distinguish between sleep and wake epochs (30 sec segments). Epochs (n = 59,108 design study and n = 68,560 validation study) were classified using AdaBoost classifier and validated epoch-by-epoch for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa. Sleep quality parameters were calculated based on the sleep/wake classifications and compared with PSG for validity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polysomnography (PSG) is currently considered the gold standard for sleep evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This method requires a full night laboratory stay and subjects are connected to numerous electrodes and sensors, which are attached on the patient's body. Time series data are aggregated, processed, and visually examined or mathematically transformed in order to reveal insights about sleep-wake states and many aspects of physiology. Moreover, in routine sleep diagnostic procedures, sleep scoring is done manually by applying complex and visual scoring rules simultaneously on multiple signals acquired by applying contact sensors, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG), and respiratory activity [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PSG is time-consuming, tedious, and costly due to complexity and the need for technical expertise.</p>
<p>Currently, the biomedical engineering field of sleep disorders evaluation is on a “fast track” towards ambulatory sleep medicine [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In recent years, extensive effort has been devoted to seeking alternative simple cost-effective technologies for objective sleep-wake evaluation to increase accessibility in sleep disorders diagnosis. These new technologies are based on reduced-channels and sensors, and sophisticated computer-based algorithms [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Under the assumption that movement is associated with wake phase and lack of movement implies a sleep phase, clinicians and researchers have attempted to measure the binary presence of sleep or wake phases by measuring wrist movements using actigraphy [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Field-based activity monitoring devices are increasingly used as simple and cheap accelerometer-based devices [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Montgomery-Downs et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] recently reported that this new technology has specificity limitations similar to those of a traditional actigraphy device. These devices consistently misidentify wake as sleep and thus overestimate both sleep time and quality.</p>
<p>It was long established that central control of ventilation and upper airway patency are strongly affected by transitions from sleep to wake and vice versa [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. During sleep, there is a considerable increase of upper airway resistance [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] due to decreased activity of the pharyngeal dilator muscles [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This elevated resistance is reflected by amplification of air-pressure oscillations in the upper airways during breathing. These air-pressure oscillations are perceived as breathing sounds during sleep [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast, during wakefulness, there is an increase in activity of the upper airway dilating muscles, hence decreased upper airway resistance and airway oscillations. Recently, we have shown that it is possible to accurately detect and distinguish a whole night’s breathing sounds and snoring events from environmental noises [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We also demonstrated that the audio signal can be acquired using a non-contact sensor (ambient microphone), which minimizes the interruption of sleep [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, little is known about whether acoustic-breathing parameters can distinguish between sleep-wake patterns.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that sleep-wake activity can be estimated using audio signal analysis of breathing sounds, which are altered by changes in ventilation and upper airway patency. The objectives of our work are: 1) to develop a breathing sound analysis (BSA) algorithm for distinguishing between sleep and wake phases using non-contact technology; 2) to reliably estimate sleep quality parameters such as total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset time, and arousal index; and 3) to validate the proposed algorithms in comparison to PSG.</p>

<p>PSG study (SomniPro 19 PSG, Deymed Diagnostic, Hronov, Czech Republic) included EEG (referential derivations, international 10–20 system, C3/A2, C4/A1, and O2/A1, O1/A2), EOG, EMG, ECG, respiratory activity (abdomen and chest effort belts—respiratory inductance plethysmography), oxygen saturation, and snore level intensity (Quest Technology 2700, Orlando, FL, USA). Simultaneous video monitoring was digitally recorded. PSG scoring includes sleep-wake pattern determined by a trained technician and underwent a second scoring by one of the investigators (AT); scoring followed the American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The scoring included labeling of each (30 sec) epoch as sleep or wake using the PSG signals—this was used as the gold-standard labeling for the training and validation of the proposed breathing sound analysis system.

<title>Study protocol</title>
<p>We developed a system for sleep-wake pattern estimation and sleep quality evaluation. The system is composed of a non-contact microphone, digital audio recording device, and an algorithm that estimates sleep and wake states from a full night audio recording (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Using concepts from audio signal processing and pattern recognition techniques, acoustic properties of breathing were classified into two states: sleep and wake. Breathing sounds events were automatically located, segmented, and isolated using our breathing detection system [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] that is capable of detecting even low intensity (&gt;20 dB) breathing sounds. This system was validated to distinguish breathing sounds from irrelevant noises, such as movements, linen noises, speech, and other interferences. Using the detected breathing events and the calculated energy signal from the audio recordings, eight acoustic features were developed and extracted per subject; these features express the acoustic properties of breathing events and emphasize the differences between sleep and wake phases. These eight features were used for training an AdaBoost [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] classifier configured as a time-series model that aimed to classify each 30-sec epoch as sleep or awake. Finally, sleep quality parameters were estimated (i.e., total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, wake time after sleep onset, and awakening index). Validation study was performed prospectively on a separate group of consecutive subjects for whom the breathing analysis was performed using a blind design.</p>

<p>A digital audio recorder device (Edirol R-4 pro, Bellingham, WA, USA) with a directional microphone (RØDE, NTG-1, Silverwater, NSW, Australia) placed at a distance of 1 meter above the subject's head, was used for acquiring the audio signals. <xref rid="pone.0117382.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and E</xref> illustrates examples of audio signal (12-sec interval).

<title>The sleep-wake pattern estimation algorithm</title>
<p>To estimate sleep/wake activity from audio signal, several steps must be applied. <xref rid="pone.0117382.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> is the block diagram of the proposed sleep-wake pattern estimation algorithm for the design and validation phases of the study. The algorithm is composed of three basic steps: A) pre-processing, B) feature extraction, and C) sleep-wake pattern estimation. This last step (C) is designed to classify each 30-sec epoch as sleep or awake. It includes classification parameters that were estimated (trained) in the design phase; the training was performed using labeled epochs (sleep and wake) that were derived from the PSG study. The outputs of this algorithm are the whole-night sleep-wake pattern and sleep quality parameters.</p>

<title>Preprocessing &amp; noise reduction</title>
<p>For design and validation phases, the acquired audio signals were digitized and stored at 16 kHz, 16 bits per sample. Each audio signal underwent adaptive noise suppression (spectral subtraction) process based on the Wiener-filter. The use of the noise suppression in this system is crucial, since it is designed to emphasize low intensity breathing sounds while suppressing any stationary background noise, such as air-conditioner or fan noises. This process relies on automatically and adaptively tracking background noise segments in order to estimate their spectra and subtracting them from the audio signal [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

<p><italic>A) Breathing pattern</italic>—these features are designed to capture and quantify breathing pattern such as breathing cycle period, period intensity, and consistency. Since the breathing pattern changes over time, the audio signal is divided into (fixed-length) time intervals. In order to calculate breathing pattern features such as breathing rate, each audio interval should consist of at least two breathing cycles. Therefore we chose an interval length of 12 seconds. In each time interval the autocorrelation of the audio signal is calculated. The autocorrelation function is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns; informally, it measures the similarity between signal samples as a function of time lag between them [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Since the audio signal may contain noises in different frequencies, the autocorrelation was calculated selectively from part of the spectrum in order to emphasize the periodicity of the interval. For this, a spectrogram, <italic>X</italic>(<italic>k</italic>,<italic>n</italic>), was calculated for each interval (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The spectrogram of the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> interval, <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>,<italic>n</italic>), presents the running frequency (spectral) components that are calculated from 60-msec signal frames (<italic>k</italic> is the frequency component index and <italic>n</italic> is the time frame index). In order to find repeating breathing patterns, we keep the most periodic information in the spectrogram using the autocorrelation function. Therefore, the autocorrelation is calculated separately for each frequency component:

where <italic>t</italic> is the time-frame-lag index and <italic>N</italic> represents the total number of frames in the interval.</p>
<p>For each time interval, we calculate an emphasized version of autocorrelation function. The emphasized autocorrelation function, <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), was calculated as an average function from only the most periodic frequency components according to the <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>,<italic>t</italic>). For that, we sorted the frequency components according to the first peak amplitude value as criterion (see <xref rid="pone.0117382.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), and summed the top 50% components (see <xref rid="pone.0117382.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In this stage, the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> interval is represented with a single function of emphasized autocorrelation, <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) (see <xref rid="pone.0117382.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). From every 12 sec time interval, three features are extracted using the emphasized autocorrelation (see equations in <xref rid="pone.0117382.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>): <bold>Cycle period (<italic>CP</italic>)</bold>—which is the location of the first peak, <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>, excluding the zero-lagged peak; <bold>Cycle intensity (<italic>CI</italic>)</bold>—which is the corresponding peak amplitude, <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>); and <bold>Cycle consistency (<italic>CC</italic>)</bold>—which measures how much the breathing pattern is homogenously periodic and consistent within an interval. The more harmonic and repetitive the interval, the lower this feature’s value, and vice versa. The same “breathing pattern” feature extraction process is repeated for 24 sec intervals of the audio signal. <xref rid="pone.0117382.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> presents an example of the running autocorrelation (used for breathing pattern features extraction) and the running snore properties calculated from a whole-night audio recording. When observing the acoustic energy during sleep (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), breathing becomes more energetic and noisy (sometimes referred to as snores) compared to wake phase. The probability of snores (SLS distribution, <xref rid="pone.0117382.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) is also increased during sleep (SLS&gt;0). The running autocorrelation of the breathing pattern, <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), is shown in <xref rid="pone.0117382.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>; the running autocorrelation is composed of autocorrelation functions (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) calculated for each epoch (30 sec). Note that sleep episodes exhibit more “zebra-like” stripes patterns compared to the more chaotic one in wake phases, meaning that during sleep, respiration is more periodic, as expected. <xref rid="pone.0117382.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> illustrates the association between the different vigilance states and the main acoustic features, extracted from specific locations (epochs from <xref rid="pone.0117382.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). It is clearly notable that there is a similar autocorrelation function during sleep epochs (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E, F</xref>) in contrast to wakefulness (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In order to match the <italic>breathing pattern</italic>'s features’ time-resolution (24 sec and 12 sec) to the epoch resolution (i.e., 30 sec, the same as the PSG’s hypnogram), the <italic>breathing pattern</italic> features were linear-interpolated to be sampled at 30 sec resolution.</p>

<p><italic>B) Snore properties</italic>—these features are based on our previously designed snore detector [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Each energetic acoustic event from the audio signal is assigned an SLS that represents its probability of being a snore event; the more positive this score is, the greater its probability to be a snore event. <xref rid="pone.0117382.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> shows the running SLS distribution (calculated for each 30 sec epoch). Note that in <xref rid="pone.0117382.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> during sleep phases there are more SLS values that are above zero (above the horizontal dashed line), indicating the presence of snoring events and, consequently, evidence of sleep phase. <xref rid="pone.0117382.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> left illustrates the association between the different vigilance states and the SLS distribution. It is clearly noticeable that there is a similar SLS histogram during sleep phases (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, C</xref>) in contrast to wakefulness (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Two features were extracted using this SLS parameter: <bold><italic>Maximum SLS</italic></bold> in epoch (<italic>MaxSLS</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>) and <bold><italic>Snore Index</italic></bold> (<italic>SI</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>). <italic>MaxSLS</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> feature is calculated as the maximum of SLS within 30-sec epoch <italic>l</italic> (see <xref rid="pone.0117382.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The rationale behind this feature is to determine the epoch's maximum likelihood to contain a snore event. The higher this score is, the more probable this epoch is to contain a sleep episode. The second feature is <italic>snoring index</italic> (<italic>SI</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which is the estimation of the number of snores per hour; this estimation is based on counting the snore events within the <italic>l</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup> epoch and multiplying by the number of epochs per hour; see <xref rid="pone.0117382.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> for equation details.

<title>Sleep/wake likelihood estimation</title>
<p>Using the eight sleep/wake features, sleep-wake likelihood (SWL) curve is estimated for each patient at 30 second epoch resolution. In this study we chose AdaBoost classifier [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as a time-series model in which each feature was fed along with two previous epochs (at <italic>l-</italic>1 and <italic>l-</italic>2). In this way, the sleep/wake estimation of the current epoch is supported with the previous epochs' estimations; this approach is suitable for a quasi-stationary process such as sleep and wake phases. <xref rid="pone.0117382.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> presents a visualization of the time series feature matrix configuration. Generally, a <italic>k</italic>-order AdaBoost classifier involves <italic>k</italic> binary discriminations in a <italic>d</italic>-dimensional feature space (in our case <italic>d</italic> = 24, 8×3), based on the true labeling of the epochs. In the design phase, the classifier parameters were estimated to discriminate two classes: sleep and awake. Sleep was assigned the value '-1' and wake with '+1' (arbitrarily to match the hypnogram), hence producing a linear estimation within that range, i.e., a sleep epoch is more likely to have a negative score than a wake phase. The optimal order was found to be <italic>k</italic> = 100 empirically. <xref rid="pone.0117382.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> shows a typical example of SWL curve estimated from whole-night audio recording of a subject from the validation design set. Higher values of SWL indicate increased likelihood towards wake state. Note the impressive similarity between the Hypnogram (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) and the proposed acoustic-based SWL curve (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). It should be emphasized that there is a considerable increase in SWL values as soon as wake initiates and it declines immediately during sleep onset.</p>

<title>Individual decision threshold</title>
<p>Since breathing properties can vary between subjects, we found that applying an individual decision threshold improved system performance. Firstly, for each subject, a likelihood threshold (<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub>) was calculated using his SWL epoch scores (example presented in <xref rid="pone.0117382.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). These SWL values' distribution (histogram) is considered to behave as a bi-modal distribution, since it is assumed to be composed of sleep and wake phases. The threshold was determined using Otsu’s method [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which searches for the threshold that minimizes the intra-class variance (see <xref rid="pone.0117382.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Secondly, according to our preliminary results, we modified the fixed <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub> to better cope with pinpointing the beginning of sleep, as it may considerably affect estimation of sleep parameters. Therefore, for the first 90 minutes of the recording, the threshold gradually decreases, starting from a higher value towards <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub>, in order to reduce false detection of sleep epochs:

<title>Sleep/wake pattern estimation</title>
<p>During the design phase, an AdaBoost model was trained on the entire design dataset in order to classify sleep and wake epochs. Based on the SWL score for each subject, an individual threshold was picked to better fit the global sleep-wake model to the individual. Each subject’s scores (for sleep and awake epochs) were shifted using this threshold value, allowing adaptation for the global sleep-wake model to better fit the individual subject. Moreover, global alignment of the scores from all the subjects will allow standardization and overall evaluation of system performance. On average, the individual <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub> improved system accuracy by 3%. <xref rid="pone.0117382.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> shows a typical example of the SWL curve of an individual; the horizontal dashed line represents the calculated <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub> score.</p>
<p>Epoch-by-epoch system performances (sleep/wake estimation) were analyzed for each subject (individual performances). Based on the individual performances, we calculated a global mean and standard deviation between subjects. <xref rid="pone.0117382.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the comparison between the proposed BSA and PSG for the entire group of subjects using the validation dataset. The overall (global) accuracy between subjects of the BSA system was 0.833. The sensitivity (detecting sleep epochs as sleep epochs) was 0.922 and the specificity was 0.566. Cohen's kappa agreement was 0.508. The ROC curve (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>, solid line) has an area under the curve of 0.829. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, area under the curve, and Cohen's kappa were also calculated for the entire pool of validation epochs (regardless of subjects’ epoch origin), and no discernable differences were observed between the two cases (data not shown). To assess how parameters such as age, gender, BMI, AHI, and SNR affected the kappa agreement of our breathing sound analysis (BSA) system, we tested the Pearson correlation coefficient for each of these parameters. Our calculations reveal negligible correlations (&lt;0.1) for age, gender, BMI, and AHI.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper a novel method for evaluation of sleep-wake patterns using non-contact microphone is proposed. This method utilizes analysis of breathing sounds and machine-learning techniques in order to reliably estimate sleep-wake activity and to reliably estimate sleep quality parameters. The main idea beyond this approach is that central control of ventilation and upper airway patency are strongly affected by sleep and wake activity [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The human upper airway is a complicated structure comprising a number of muscles whose functional integration is essential for several complex tasks including speech [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and breathing [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. From the respiratory perspective, the primary goal of these pharyngeal muscles is to keep the airway open. While the pharyngeal muscles manage this task with relative ease during wakefulness, their activity is often diminished at sleep onset [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. During sleep, there is a considerable increase of upper airway resistance [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] due to decreased activity of the pharyngeal dilator muscles [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This elevated resistance is reflected by amplification of air-pressure oscillations in the upper airways during breathing. These air-pressure oscillations are perceived as typical breathing sounds during sleep. In contrast, during wakefulness, there is an increase in activity of the upper airway dilating muscles, hence decreased upper airway resistance [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and airway oscillations.</p>
<p>This study provides evidence that by audio analysis of breathing sounds, the breathing pattern and hence the sleep-wake activity can be estimated. We developed and validated a system that incorporates eight features (extracted mainly from the audio energy signal; see <xref rid="sec008" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) that were designed to measure and quantify breathing pattern and breathing properties. These features were used for training an AdaBoost [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] classification model to estimate sleep and wake activity at 30 sec epoch resolution. Using the estimated epoch labels (sleep/wake), we calculated five acceptable sleep quality parameters. System performances were analyzed epoch-by-epoch. The accuracy was 0.833, the sensitivity was 0.922, and the specificity was 0.566. Cohen's kappa agreement was 0.508. When analyzing sleep quality parameters (BSA vs. PSG), the average error (in minutes) of sleep-latency, total sleep time, and wake after sleep onset was 16.6, 35.8, and 29.6, respectively.</p>
<sec id="sec027">
<title>Breathing signals and analysis</title>
<p>Extracting sleep-wake activity pattern from breathing sounds using a non-contact microphone is challenging. Since breathing sounds may be “contaminated” by background noise, it is essential to improve SNR prior to analysis in order to enhance the breathing events. To achieve this, we used an adaptive spectral subtraction technique [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] that subtracts the estimated background noise. This technique is acceptable in the speech and audio signal enhancement field [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; however, it was not fully explored on whole-night breathing sounds. By applying this technique, background noise was considerably reduced, similar to earlier studies [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
<p>We developed a unique set of features that are specifically designed to distinguish between sleep and wake phases (<xref rid="pone.0117382.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117382.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These features can be categorized into two categories: <italic>breathing pattern</italic> and <italic>snore-characteristics</italic>. The <italic>breathing pattern</italic> features are designed to capture and to quantify variations in breathing periodicity as they may contribute to distinguishing between sleep and wake epochs. The basic idea here is that the new developed features: CP, CC, and CI (collectively named “periodicity features”; see <xref rid="sec008" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) are strongly influenced by breathing properties, such as rate and consistency. It was well established that changes in vigilance states strongly affect breathing rate and regularity in humans and animals [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The <italic>snore-characteristics</italic> features are designed to find the probability of a given epoch to contain snores. The basic idea is that the probability of detecting snoring events is increased during sleep. Snoring is caused by the vibration of soft tissue in the upper airways due to elevated upper airway resistance during sleep [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Recently, it was shown that snore analysis may carry valuable information about sleep conditions [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In order to calculate these <italic>snore-characteristics</italic> features, we used our high performance (&gt;98% detection accuracy rate) snore detector [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] module. By using all these (eight) features as a multi-dimensional input to our sleep-wake classifier, the performances were superior to using each feature separately (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>
<p>We used the AdaBoost [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] algorithm to classify epochs as sleep or wake. The main advantage of this algorithm is its ability to discriminate multi-dimensional complex-patterns using a non-parametric, non-linear boundary threshold [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The use of this kind of classifier was supported by an earlier study [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which claimed that sleep and wake activity (using wrist-actigraph) should be discriminated using non-linear classifiers. In addition, other studies have shown that there is a strong correlation between the labels (sleep/wake) of adjacent (30 sec) epochs [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, we configured our AdaBoost classifier as a time-series model, in which the prediction of each epoch state is influenced by the adjacent epochs, i.e., it is unlikely (though it's possible) to find a fragmented sequence of [wake-sleep-wake] and vice versa. In our earlier study [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] we also explored the effect of different classifiers such as two states hidden Markov models [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The time-series AdaBoost classifier was found to produce the best results and therefore was chosen.</p>

<title>Comparison to existing approaches</title>
<p>Little information is available about sleep evaluation using a non-contact audio-based approach. In recent years, several other simple cost-effective technologies for sleep evaluation have been presented. These technologies are based on reduced-channels and sensors, in which the preferred methods to detect sleep and wake phases are based on detecting patient movement. The most validated approach is actigraph [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Hedner et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Marino et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Lotjonen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and Tilmanne et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] have validated the performance of actigraphy versus PSG using in-laboratory data collection. They showed an agreement (accuracy) ranging between 80% and 86%. Innovations in mobile and electronic healthcare are revolutionizing the involvement of both doctors and patients in the modern healthcare system by extending the capabilities of physiological monitoring devices. Incorporating smart wearable sensors into the routine care of patients could augment physician-patient relationships, and increase the autonomy and involvement of patients in their healthcare [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, such systems are rarely tested scientifically [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our BSA system yields matched and even superior performances relative to an actigraph technology. Furthermore, in our system, according to Bland-Altman plot (<xref rid="pone.0117382.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>), all sleep quality parameters showed no consistent bias, where actigraphy-based technology showed some bias in the sleep quality parameters [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. When calculating the average error (mean absolute difference) of the sleep quality parameters between PSG and actigraph, Lotjonen at el. [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and Blackwell et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] showed a TST estimation error of 54 min and 44 min, respectively. Blackwell et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] also calculated the estimation error of SE and WASO; they showed an average error of 9.8% for sleep efficiency and 39 min for WASO. By comparing the errors of these sleep quality parameters, our BSA system yields superior performances (TST 35.8 min, SE 8%, and WASO 29.6 min).</p>
<p>In addition to actigraphy-based methods, some researchers took movement detection even further in order to estimate sleep and wake activity in non-contact technologies [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Collectively, these studies showed performances that are inferior to or close to actigraphy-based approaches. It is generally recognized that body-movement-based technologies (contact and non-contact) are biased [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], since any lack of movement is interpreted as sleep, while movement is interpreted as awake. In contrast, our approach of estimating sleep-wake from breathing sounds is based on the notion that during sleep onset there are considerable changes in upper airway mechanics, affecting airflow and pressure oscillations. In contrast to these movement-based technologies, we found that our system performance is not influenced by any physiological variables, such as age, BMI, AHI, and gender.</p>

<sec id="sec029">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>We provide evidence that sleep-wake activity can be reliably estimated by audio analysis of breathing sounds. In this study 127,668 epochs were analyzed from 150 subjects who were referred to sleep evaluation; these subjects represent a diverse population, across a wide range of ages, BMI, AHI, and from both genders, but are not strictly a generalizable population. Our proposed non-contact technology may enable more natural sleep that is not affected by the equipment. It is expected that the wear and tear and costs will be relatively low; however, further studies should determine whether this technology is valid in at-home conditions and its cost-effectiveness. Clearly, the transition of this technology to at-home sleep evaluation mainly depends on third party reimbursements for the use of home study equipment [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It should be recognized that the main limitation of this technology is its sensitivity to low SNR, which results from quiet breathing relative to high environmental background noise. In addition, at the current state of operation, our system is limited to operate in a single-subject environment (one person in the room); since other person's breathing sounds can interrupt. Further studies should investigate methods to cope with several subjects in the room and to further improve SNR mechanically and algorithmically.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>One of the main goals of sleep medicine today is to improve early diagnosis and treatment of the “flood” of subjects presenting with sleep disorders. New simple technologies are needed in order to improve patient accessibility to sleep diagnosis; this in turn will reduce the cost of management and treatment [<xref rid="pone.0117382.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and improve quality of life and health.</p>
<p>This study presents a pioneering approach for determining sleep-wake pattern using non-contact audio-based signals. We found that by analyzing breathing sounds a reliable estimation of sleep quality parameters can be achieved. This study highlights the potential of breathing sound analysis to measure sleep in research and clinical situations.</p>

Each horizontal line represents one individual’s data. Sleep/wake activity pattern was manually annotated epoch-by-epoch using polysomnography (PSG) scoring criteria. Note the large individual differences in sleep-wake pattern, especially the sleep latency (from time zero to the first black mark of sleep) and the large individual variability of awakening during sleep (mustard colors between black regions). The onset of the gray area indicates study termination for each individual. Cohen's kappa (epoch-by-epoch sleep/wake) agreement score for each subject was calculated comparing our proposed breathing sound analysis (BSA) system and the PSG scoring. For study protocol, see main body of the manuscript.
