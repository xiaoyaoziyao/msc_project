<title>Background</title>
<p>In the absence of randomized clinical trials, meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) from observational studies may provide the most accurate effect estimates for an intervention. However, confounding by indication remains an important concern that can be addressed by incorporating individual patient covariates in different ways. We compared different analytic approaches to account for confounding in IPD from patients treated for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Two antibiotic classes were evaluated, fluoroquinolones—considered the cornerstone of effective MDR-TB treatment—and macrolides, which are known to be safe, yet are ineffective <italic>in vitro</italic>. The primary outcome was treatment success against treatment failure, relapse or death. Effect estimates were obtained using multivariable and propensity-score based approaches.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were used in 28 included studies, within which 6,612 patients received a fluoroquinolone and 723 patients did not. Macrolides were used in 15 included studies, within which 459 patients received this class of antibiotics and 3,670 did not. Both standard multivariable regression and propensity score-based methods resulted in similar effect estimates for early and late generation fluoroquinolones, while macrolide antibiotics use was associated with reduced treatment success.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this individual patient data meta-analysis, standard multivariable and propensity-score based methods of adjusting for individual patient covariates for observational studies yielded produced similar effect estimates. Even when adjustment is made for potential confounding, interpretation of adjusted estimates must still consider the potential for residual bias.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the absence of randomized clinical trials, data from non-experimental observational studies may provide the only data to evaluate complex medical interventions. Data from these observational studies can be pooled to provide an estimate of effect that may be more precise than that obtained by a single study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>However traditional aggregate data meta-analyses, especially of observational studies, have limited capacity to adequately account for factors which confound the association between treatment and outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref003">3</xref>]. In contrast, individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis incorporates individual patient characteristics in the analysis, permitting adjustment for the same set of covariates across multiple studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Traditionally, multivariable regression is used to account for differences in measured covariates between subjects. However, this method may not fully adjust for confounding by indication occurring if the health status of patients affects treatment allocation. Alternative analytic approaches based upon propensity scores have been proposed that may provide more precise estimates of the treatment effect in observational studies in which confounding by indication may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref006">6</xref>]. Defined as the predicted probability (propensity) of being given treatment, this method can incorporate the measured covariates of individuals in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref008">8</xref>]. Propensity score-based analytic methods have been widely used in individual studies. However, this method has not yet been operationalized for IPD meta-analyses.</p>
<p>Recommended combination antibiotic therapy for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) includes at least five antibiotics, and is given for at least 18 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref009">9</xref>]. Current international treatment recommendations are based entirely on analysis of observational studies, as there have been no randomized phase 3 trials of MDR-TB treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref010">10</xref>]. Consequently, the selection of treatment of MDR-TB treatment is particularly challenging, with little evidence to guide decision-making. Medical treatment for MDR-TB is highly individualized, with clinicians selecting drug regimens based upon the severity of disease, antibiotic resistance patterns of the causative bacteria and their own local clinical experience. As a result, the baseline patient characteristics are likely to strongly influence treatment allocation.</p>
<p>Here we apply a number of methods to adjust for confounding by indication using a large IPD dataset of patients treated with combination antibiotic therapy for MDR-TB. In order to better evaluate how effective our analytic methods were in controlling confounding we selected two antibiotic classes believed to have very different efficacy in TB treatment: fluoroquinolone (FQN) and macrolide antibiotics.</p>
<p>Randomized trials have shown that FQN antibiotics are effective in the treatment of drug susceptible TB, as a part of combination antibiotic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref013">13</xref>]. Given that its mechanism is the same regardless of the resistance to most other antibiotics, FQNs are also considered effective in treating MDR-TB—with just 17% of patients with MDR-TB worldwide having FQN resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref014">14</xref>]. As a result, FQNs have become well-established as the cornerstone of MDR-TB treatment in national [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref016">16</xref>] and international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>As a counterpoint, the macrolide class of antibiotics is inactive against M. <italic>tuberculosis in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref018">18</xref>] with inconsistent evidence supporting their clinical effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref017">17</xref>]. Consequently, macrolides are considered a “Group 5” antibiotic, recommended only for subjects with advanced drug resistance and few treatment options.</p>
<p>Drawing upon these two contrasting antibiotics of differing effectiveness, we aimed to explore confounding by indication in the context of IPD meta-analysis.</p>

<title>Description of Individual Patient Data Set</title>
<p>Study methods are reported according to PRISMA criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151724.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Data for this individual patient data meta-analysis were collected from 31 observational studies, published after 1970, selected from three prior meta-analyses evaluating MDR-TB treatment, in preparation for an expert committee revising the World Health Organization (WHO) MDR-TB treatment guidelines (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151724.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151724.g002">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref021">21</xref>]. The method of contacting authors, collecting and extracting data, individual study characteristics and outcomes for each individual study have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref019">19</xref>]. Data were evaluated completeness, and additional information sought if required. Additional criteria for including studies were: the study authors could be contacted and were willing to share their data, the cohort included at least 25 subjects and the outcome of treatment success was reported. All included studies were retrospective or prospective observational studies, and therefore of low quality. The quality of included studies is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151724.s002">S2 Table</xref>. No problems with data integrity were identified. Only patients with microbiologically confirmed MDR-TB were included. Individual patients with extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB, defined as MDR-TB plus resistance to any FQN and at least one second-line injectable antibiotic), only extrapulmonary TB or missing treatment information were excluded. Individual subject data included demographic characteristics, HIV status, the extent of disease, history of prior treatment, phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and treatment regimen. Extensive disease was defined as pulmonary TB with positive sputum smear and / or cavitation on chest radiograph. Studies where the selected antibiotic class was not used were excluded from the analyses of that class. For FQNs the comparison was between group F and group NF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151724.g001">Fig 1</xref>), and for macrolides between group M and group NM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151724.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The main analyses assessed the association of either FQN antibiotics or macrolide antibiotics with treatment success (cure or treatment completion) against a combined primary outcome of treatment failure, relapse or death. A secondary comparison was success vs. fail or relapse (without death) for each drug class. Loss to follow-up was excluded as an outcome from both comparisons. Patients taking the antibiotic of interest were described as ‘exposed’, and those not taking the antibiotic as ‘unexposed’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Description of the Exposure</title>
<p>We hypothesized that after adequately controlling for confounding, the adjusted effect estimates should show a positive association between FQN use and the primary outcome, while there should be no evidence of an association for macrolide antibiotics.</p>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Fluoroquinolone antibiotics</title>
<p>Until recently, later generation (newer) FQNs were substantially more expensive and may have been reserved for patients with more severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref023">23</xref>] or those failing first-line MDR-TB therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref024">24</xref>]. Consequently, confounding by indication may attenuate the apparent effectiveness of later generation FQNs. For this reason, separate analyses of the two classes of FQN antibiotics were performed, comprising either (a) later generation FQN antibiotics (including moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin) against no FQN use, or (b) earlier generation FQN antibiotic (ofloxacin) against no FQN use. Patients taking ciprofloxacin (an earlier generation FQN) were excluded from the analyses, since it is considered largely ineffective in the clinical treatment of TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref025">25</xref>], having only a minimal effect <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref026">26</xref>], and hence no longer recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Macrolide antibiotics</title>
<p>The separate comparison was performed between a separate class of antibiotics, macrolides, and those taking no macrolides. As highlighted above, we did not expect macrolides to truly make patients better. At worst they are clinically ineffective, and not harmful, given that the drug class has an excellent safety record. Hence, there is no reason <italic>a priori</italic> to expect patient outcomes to be adversely affected by this class of antibiotics. Treatment outcomes with and without macrolide antibiotics were examined independently of whether FQN antibiotics were also used.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>Analytical Approaches</title>
<p>We evaluated different methods to control confounding for each of the three antibiotic groups (earlier generation FQNs, later generation FQNs or macrolides), and treatment success for MDR-TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref021">21</xref>]. Effects were estimated using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) (i.e. random effects logistic regression models) estimated via adaptive quadrature (QUAD).</p>
<p>To identify the most important potential confounders in our dataset, we constructed a Directed Acyclic Graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151724.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Analytic methods used to account for confounding included traditional multivariable methods and four different methods of adjustment using the propensity score: regression adjustment for propensity score quintiles or for the propensity score, propensity score-based matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).</p>

<p>In contrast to regression-based models, which give a conditional (unit specific) effect estimate, propensity score based models can estimate the marginal (population-average) effect of an intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref027">27</xref>]. A propensity score is the probability of allocation to treatment given the measured covariates (6). If the dichotomous outcome variable Z represents treatment, and <bold><italic>X</italic></bold> is the vector of available baseline pre-treatment covariates, then the propensity score is defined as the conditional probability of being treated, given the measured covariates Pr(Z = 1 | <bold><italic>X</italic></bold>). Propensity scores for each individual were estimated using logistic regression (Proc Logistic, SAS v9.3) (21), including the covariates that were available across all datasets. (22) These included baseline clinical characteristics (age, extent of disease, prior TB history, prior MDR-TB history and HIV status) and treatment factors (total duration of therapy and number of drugs in the intensive phase). Propensity score model specification was evaluated based on the comparison of covariates between matched subjects.</p>
<p>To estimate the associations between the antibiotics of interest and the outcomes, the following analytic approaches were taken:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><underline>i) Crude analysis</underline></p>
<p>An unadjusted mixed logistic regression was estimated, allowing intercepts and the effect of the antibiotic to vary across studies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><underline>ii) Multivariable logistic regression</underline></p>
<p>A multivariable mixed logistic regression was performed including covariates chosen to account for likely causal relationships between potential confounders, with study and the effect of the antibiotic as random effects.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><underline>iii) Conditional analysis using propensity score</underline></p>
<p>The conditional propensity score model applied a GLMM with propensity score as a continuous variable, with study and the effect of the antibiotic as a random effect.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><underline>iv) Stratification by propensity score quintile</underline></p>
<p>Patients were ranked according to propensity score, and stratified into propensity score quintiles, an approach that has been estimated to remove 90% of bias in measured covariates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref028">28</xref>]. Stratified analysis was performed using a GLMM with study and the effect of the antibiotic as a random effect.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><underline>v) Inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score</underline></p>
<p>In an inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) model, individual observations in the regression were weighted by the reciprocal of the predicted probability of being in the treatment group (derived from the propensity score), normalized to the sample mean. Analysis was performed using a GLMM with study and the effect of the antibiotic as random effect, using normalized weights based upon the propensity score, adjusting for chosen covariates to account for potential confounders.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><underline>vi) Matching within and vii) matching across studies using propensity score</underline></p>
<p>Patients receiving the drug of interest (exposed) were matched with patients that did not receive this drug (unexposed) according to their propensity scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref029">29</xref>]. Two matching approaches were explored: 1) matching was restricted to within individual studies; and 2) matches to could be made across all studies, with the propensity score being calculated within or across studies, respectively. Matching was performed using three alternate approaches: one-to-one matching without replacement, one-to-one matching with replacement or (up to) four-to-one matching.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Each matching algorithm used nearest neighbor matching to identify pairs of treated and untreated subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref030">30</xref>], whose propensity scores differed by no more than a specified amount (the caliper distance) which was fixed at 0.2 times the standard deviation of the logit of propensity score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref031">31</xref>]. For matching with replacement, exposed subjects matched to a specified patient were returned to the pool of unexposed subjects and were eligible for subsequent selection. Treatment outcomes between groups were evaluated using a GLMM, with study, treatment and match as random effects, propensity score as a model covariate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Optimal matching was defined as the strategy that achieved the closest covariate balance. This was calculated as the standardized difference of the covariates and of the logit of the propensity score between exposed and unexposed groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref034">34</xref>], defined according to published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Small differences in the average values of covariates between intervention and control groups after propensity score matching (&lt;10%) implied an adequate balance had been achieved between the measured characteristics of matched subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>When a model did not converge, effects were estimated via penalized quasi likelihood (Proc Glimmix, SAS v9.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref036">36</xref>]. Patients were clustered at the level of the study and intercepts and slopes of estimates of effect were allowed to vary across studies. The precision and size of effect estimates for FQNs and macrolides, expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, were compared. We assumed missing observations were missing at random, with missing values of included covariates imputed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.</p>

<p>In all models, if a hierarchical model could not be fitted, a fixed effects model was used. All analyses were performed in SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>

<p>FQN antibiotics were used by one patient or more in 28 of the 31 observational studies for which data was available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151724.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Among these studies, 6,612 patients received any FQN and 723 did not. Among those taking quinolones, 6,007 (90.8%) received an earlier generation FQN and 748 (11.3%) received a later generation FQN, including 148 who received both classes of drugs. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151724.t001">Table 1</xref>, patients taking FQNs were slightly younger, less likely to have disease with lung cavitation, had lower rates of advanced drug resistance, and received a longer total duration of therapy.</p>

<title>Propensity score matching</title>
<p>Propensity scores could not be calculated within studies where outcomes or treatment allocation was homogenous (that is, the same outcome occurred in all patients in that study). Hence, 18 studies could be included for FQN analyses with matching within studies, and 15 studies included for macrolide analyses with matching within studies. Optimal covariate matching was achieved using one-to-one matching of subjects for propensity scores allocated across studies with replacement, based upon standardized difference for the propensity score and for individual covariates. Using this method, the standardized differences between the logit of the propensity scores between treated and untreated groups was less than 1% for all antibiotics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151724.t003">Table 3</xref>).

<title>Outcomes of Macrolide Antibiotic Treatment</title>
<p>Applying the same analytic strategies to macrolide antibiotics, the odds ratio was consistently less than one for all analytic methods, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151724.t002">Table 2</xref>. The effect estimate was closest to the null using the method of propensity score matching across studies with replacement (OR 0.7, 95% CI: 0.4, 1.1).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151724.t007">Table 7</xref> compares the effect estimates produced using each analytic approach. Matching within studies produced generally smaller effect estimates than other multivariable approaches. Matching with replacement resulted in effect estimates that were closer to the null for matched analyses of FQN antibiotics (with propensity score allocated within or across studies) than for multivariable approaches. This was also observed for macrolide antibiotics, when matching within macrolide studies. However, for matching across macrolide studies, there was no substantial change in effect estimate when replacement was used. Stratification by propensity score quintiles found that odds ratios were similar across strata (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151724.t008">Table 8</xref>).</p>

<p>The overall quality assessment for the primary and secondary measures was ‘very low’ according to GRADE criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref038">38</xref>], on account of moderate to serious inconsistency between study outcomes and a serious risk of bias as all included data were from observational studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151724.s002">S2 Table</xref>). A total of 6.3% of covariate values were imputed for the fluoroquinolone analyses, and 6.1% of covariate values were imputed for the macrolide analyses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Meta-analysis of IPD from multiple observational studies can provide the best available source of evidence for an intervention, in the absence of randomized controlled trials, if the included data are representative of all available studies. However, analytic approaches must appropriately address bias due to confounding. In our meta-analysis of 31 observational studies of antibiotic therapy for MDR-TB, we accounted for confounding using a number of different analytic strategies that incorporated individual patient covariates, for two different drug classes. Propensity score matching achieved adequate covariate balance between exposed and unexposed individuals—the closest when one to one propensity score matching with replacement was used. Other propensity-score based approaches yielded more conservative effect estimates than using a traditional multivariable approach.</p>
<p>The importance of confounding by indication in observational studies is well-recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref007">7</xref>]. However, it is often difficult to determine the optimal adjustment approach without knowledge of the unbiased effect estimate (i.e. the ‘truth’). In our study, substantial differences were seen between the baseline covariates of individual patients in exposed and unexposed groups for both drug classes tested, prior to adjustment. This supports the importance of adjustment of confounding by indication in these studies. Most analytic approaches generally brought the effect estimate closer to the null, in comparison to the unadjusted analysis.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with the presence of confounding by indication, an important source of bias which must be considered when interpreting observational studies. Furthermore, the propensity score-based methods gave outcomes that were broadly consistent with laboratory studies and published randomized trials of FQNs in drug susceptible TB. Our findings also aligned with current consensus guidelines for the treatment of both FQNs and macrolides.</p>
<p>Our findings do not support our initial hypothesis that later generation FQNs would be given more often in more advanced disease. The degree of improvement in covariate balance achieved using propensity score matching, as represented by the logit of the predicted propensity score, was similar for both classes of FQN antibiotics. However, analysis of early generation FQNs produced consistently lower estimates of effect than later generation FQNs, in line with expert opinion, and clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref039">39</xref>]. Confidence intervals (CIs) for new generation FQNs were wider than for early generation FQNs, on account of the smaller number of patients taking this treatment.</p>
<p>For those taking macrolide antibiotics, which are considered to be safe clinically, yet ineffective in the laboratory setting, treatment outcomes were consistently worse for exposed than for unexposed individuals. This would be consistent with confounding by indication, since we do not expect macrolides—a widely used class of drug that is well-tolerated—to truly worsen outcomes. Traditional multivariable approaches did not fully correct for this potential bias. We found that propensity score methods did improve covariate balance, bringing the effect estimate closer to the null. Residual confounding is a more likely explanation than drug toxicity, in light of the favorable safety profile of macrolide antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref040">40</xref>], however the latter cannot be excluded. This suggests that while propensity score matching can correct for some confounding by indication, interpretation of the outcome must allow for possible residual bias, if confounding by indication is substantial.</p>
<p>This study has potential clinical implications. First, our findings indicate that macrolides have limited benefit treatment of MDR-TB. This is in keeping with current WHO guidelines that assign the drugs to ‘Group 5’–i.e. those drugs of unproven effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref009">9</xref>]. Second, most analytic approaches yielded a similar benefit for both early and late generation FQNs. This suggests that ofloxacin should be retained as an effective treatment option for MDR-TB patients. Furthermore, a high mortality was seen among those without FQNs. Together, these findings support the continuing use of FQN antibiotics as a part of standard MDR-TB therapy.</p>
<p>A potential limitation in this study was the absence of data for other clinically important covariates, which may influence treatment allocation or outcomes. While our models incorporated all relevant covariates for which data was available, it is possible other unmeasured confounders were unavailable in the combined individual patient dataset—leading to residual confounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref008">8</xref>]. Additionally, treatment group assignment was not allowed to vary over time in our model, despite the possibility that individualized regimens may be adjusted several times during the course of treatment. Additional confounding by indication by time-varying covariates may be introduced, as subsequent treatment decisions reflect changes in baseline characteristics. This limitation is challenging to overcome in pooled individual patient datasets, where only variables that are common to all studies can be analyzed. Of course, randomized studies would best address this concern, since on average balance will be achieved in measured and unmeasured characteristics. However, as no randomized trials of MDR-TB therapies have been published to date, IPD meta-analysis remains the best available source of data from which causal inference may be drawn.</p>
<p>We have applied a number of alternative statistical approaches to our dataset, however the ‘optimal’ statistical method remains unclear. Propensity score matching across studies with replacement achieved the closest covariate balance, leading to effect estimates that were closer to the null. This may indicate that residual confounding was of a greater magnitude when the other matching strategies were employed. However, as the true effect of the drugs is unknown this cannot be verified. A next step in evaluating the analytic approaches to IPD will be to perform simulation using precisely defined datasets with known bias. In particular, the effect of propensity-score based adjustment in the presence of varying degrees of unmeasured confounding needs to be explored further. Simulated datasets can be designed such that a ‘true’ treatment effect is known under a variety of conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0151724.ref041">41</xref>], allowing the effect of different approaches to be explored. In addition, application of these methods within the context of future randomized clinical studies, where unmeasured confounding is unlikely, may also be used to test how propensity score-based methods influence effect estimates in a clinical context.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this individual patient data meta-analysis, different methods of adjusting for individual patient covariates for observational studies yielded comparable results. Our analyses produced treatment effects that were generally reliable in direction and magnitude. This consistency is reassuring, and suggests that either multivariable or propensity score based methods could be used to account for measured confounding in this population. IPD meta-analysis offer considerable advantages, in accounting for confounding by indication more effectively than conventional ‘two step’ meta-analytic approaches. Wherever possible, a number of alternative methods to reduce bias should be used in evaluation of IPD meta-analysis of observational studies. However, when these methods are used, interpretation of adjusted estimates must still consider the potential for residual bias. Further simulation studies are warranted in order to explore the effect of residual confounding the estimates obtained with these analytic methods.</p>
