        <p>Perinatal hypoxia-ischemia is a major cause of acute mortality in newborns and cognitive and motor impairments in children. Cerebral hypoxia-ischemia leads to excitotoxicity and necrotic and apoptotic cell death, in which mitochondria play a major role. Increased resistance against major damage can be achieved by preconditioning triggered by subtle insults. CO, a toxic molecule that is also generated endogenously, may have a role in preconditioning as low doses can protect against inflammation and apoptosis. In this study, the role of CO-induced preconditioning on neurons was addressed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The effect of 1 h of CO treatment on neuronal death (plasmatic membrane permeabilization and chromatin condensation) and bcl-2 expression was studied in cerebellar granule cells undergoing to glutamate-induced apoptosis. CO's role was studied <italic>in vivo</italic> in the Rice-Vannucci model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (common carotid artery ligature +75 min at 8% oxygen). Apoptotic cells, assessed by Nissl staining were counted with a stereological approach and cleaved caspase 3-positive profiles in the hippocampus were assessed. Apoptotic hallmarks were analyzed in hippocampal extracts by Western Blot. CO inhibited excitotoxicity-induced cell death and increased Bcl-2 mRNA in primary cultures of neurons. <italic>In vivo</italic>, CO prevented hypoxia-ischemia induced apoptosis in the hippocampus, limited cytochrome c released from mitochondria and reduced activation of caspase-3. Still, Bcl-2 protein levels were higher in hippocampus of CO pre-treated rat pups. Our results show that CO preconditioning elicits a molecular cascade that limits neuronal apoptosis. This could represent an innovative therapeutic strategy for high-risk cerebral hypoxia-ischemia patients, in particular neonates.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) remains a major cause of acute mortality in newborns and of cognitive and motor impairments in children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Vannucci1">[1]</xref>. Cerebral damage results from oxygen and tissue energy depletion that lead to: acidosis, inflammation, glutamate excitotoxicity, cell death and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Vannucci2">[2]</xref>. Cerebral hypoxia-ischemia induces distinct types of cell death: within the ischemic <italic>core</italic>, rapid cell death occurs mainly as necrosis; while in the <italic>penumbra</italic>, the region around the ischemic core, delayed apoptotic cell death takes place hours and days after the insult, contributing to secondary damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Taylor1">[3]</xref>. In the developing brain, apoptosis also plays a homeostatic role, and many pro-apoptotic factors are normally up-regulated during early stages of maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Tsujimoto1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Galluzzi1">[5]</xref>. Therefore, apoptosis is closely related to the injury response after hypoxia-ischemia in the immature brain of newborn infants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Carloni1">[6]</xref>. Mitochondria play a major role in death of mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Kroemer1">[7]</xref>. During the apoptotic process and upon mitochondrial membrane permeability, several biochemical molecules confined to the inter-membrane space are released to the cytosol thus activating proteases and nucleases. For example, cytochrome c released from mitochondria interacts with apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) and caspase-9 to form the apoptosome that activates caspase-3 leading to cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Galluzzi2">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Currently, hypothermia is the only treatment used clinically for minimizing cerebral damage after perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, but it has limited efficiency and its use has also limitations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Gunn1">[9]</xref>. Other therapies, which either can be used alone or in combination with hypothermia, are therefore needed. Preconditioning (PC) induction consists of an insult that does not cause damage, but triggers a protective state (tolerance) that increase cellular resistance against a subsequent and more severe challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Kirino1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Alkan1">[11]</xref>. PC can induce an <italic>early</italic> response (minutes or hours) or a <italic>late</italic> response within days including <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Gidday1">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, clinical studies with patients suffering from transient ischemic attacks (TIA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Dirnagl1">[13]</xref> and animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Gidday1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Dirnagl2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-StenzelPoore1">[15]</xref> have suggested that cerebral tolerance induced by a PC state is an efficient strategy to protect brain tissue against HI. Thus, preconditioning processes are promising alternatives for therapy in patients at high risk of suffering HI. Indeed, perinatal HI may eventually be predicted based on known risk factors associated with previous ischemic episodes including intrauterine fetal distress and hypoxic-ischemic insults during birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Heazell1">[16]</xref>; Bonifacio et al. 2011). Also, PC-based therapies could be useful for neonates going through major heart surgery with associated risks of global cerebral ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Kirino1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Dirnagl1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Bonifacio1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is commonly known to be toxic. This is due to its high affinity for haem-proteins, which can compromise oxygen delivery to tissues (carboxy-haemglobin) or can decrease oxidative phosphorylation at the cellular level by binding to cytochrome c oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Ahlstrom1">[18]</xref>. CO is an endogenous molecule generated by haem-oxygenase (HO) activity along with the production of free iron and biliverdin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Motterlini1">[19]</xref>. Low doses of exogenous CO are cytoprotective against inflammation and apoptosis, in particular following cardiovascular incidents, organ rejection and autoimmune disease in several models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Motterlini1">[19]</xref>. Also, in rat retinal ganglion cells, inhalation of 250 ppm of CO protected against ischemia-reperfusion injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Biermann1">[20]</xref>. In the central nervous system (CNS), low amounts of CO limit neuroinflammation in a model of multiple sclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Chora1">[21]</xref> and induced vasodilation, presenting cytoprotective effects in the cerebral circulation in a model of epileptic seizures in newborn piglets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Zimmermann1">[22]</xref>. CO treatment also decreased infarct volume and brain damage in adult models of transient and permanent focal cerebral ischemia when the animals were exposed to CO immediately after middle cerebral artery occlusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Zeynalov1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Wang1">[24]</xref>. Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms involved in CO-induced neuroprotection are still not fully understood. In primary cultures of cerebellar neurons, CO triggers preconditioning and prevents apoptosis by ROS signaling and modulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, nitric oxide synthase and mitochondrial ATP dependent potassium channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Vieira1">[25]</xref>. Likewise, in primary cultures of astrocytes, CO inhibits apoptosis by directly targeting mitochondria and preventing their membrane permeabilization, which is also dependent on ROS and protein glutathionylation signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Queiroga1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Since preconditioning emerges as a promising strategy to limit brain damage following perinatal ischemia, we have examined the ability of CO to induce preconditioning and to limit apoptosis in the hippocampus in the present study. Pre-treatment of rat pups with CO prevented hippocampal cell death <italic>via</italic>: an increase on Bcl-2 expression, a decrease on cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria into cytosol and an inhibition of caspase-3 activation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use CO preconditioning to prevent hypoxia-ischemia-induced neuronal death in the developing brain.</p>

          <p>Primary cerebellar granule cells were prepared as described by Schousboe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Schousboe1">[27]</xref> from Wistar rats purchased from Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical (Lisboa, Portugal). Briefly, cells were isolated from postnatal day 7(P7) rat cerebella, after mild trypsinization followed by trituration in a DNase solution containing soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were suspended (1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) and cultured in BME basal medium containing 12 mM glucose, 7.3 µM p-Aminobenzoic acid, 4 µg/L insulin, 2 mM glutamine, 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-streptomycin solution and 10% (vol/vol) FBS. Cells were cultured in 24- and 96-well poly-D-lysine coated plates and maintained in humidified atmosphere of 7% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. To prevent glia proliferation, cytosine arabinoside (20 µM) was added 48 h after seeding. The experiments were performed on 1-week-old cerebellar granule neuronal culture. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate.</p>

          <p>Fresh stock solutions of CO gas were prepared each day and sealed. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was saturated by bubbling 100% of CO gas for 30 minutes to produce a 10<sup>−3</sup> M stock solution. The concentration of CO in solution was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the conversion of deoxymyoglobin to carbon monoxymyoglobin, as described by Motterlini (Motterlini 2002).</p>

          <p>Neuronal cells were cultured on poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips. Neuronal apoptosis was induced immediately after the end of CO exposure with 10 to 30 µM of glutamate over a 24 h period to mimic excitotoxicity, which is a consequence of cerebral ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Vieira1">[25]</xref>. For inhibition of cell death, cerebellar granule cells were treated with 10 µM CO for 1 h prior to glutamate addition. Neurons were stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 µM, Sigma) and Propidium Iodide (PI, 1 µM, Molecular Probes, USA) followed by quantitative assessment of chromatin condensation and cell viability, respectively. Cells were observed on a Leica DMRB microscope using a filter with a bandpass of 340–380 nm (UV).</p>

          <p>P4–P7 (postnatal day 4 to postnatal day 7) Wistar rat pups (n = 74, Janvier, France) weighing on average 27 (±1,4) and 35 g (±1,5) respectively were used. Great differences in pup's weight are due to the fast rate of growing at this period of life. All animal experimental procedures were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the European Community Council Directive 86/609/EEC (November 24, 1986), authorization 17/2010-B (June 30, 2010) by Italian Ministry of Health and University of Turin institutional guidelines on animal welfare (law 116/92 on Care and Protection of Living Animals Undergoing Experimental or Other Scientific Procedures). The protocol was approved by Turin University Bioethical Committee. Animals were given <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water and kept on 12h:12h light/dark cycle. Pup's sex was not taken into account, and male and female pups were used randomly for introducing variability in the study and for being more representative of relevant patient populations. All efforts were made to minimize suffering and limit the number of animals used.</p>

          <p>To test whether CO prevented HI-induced neurodegeneration, and to ensure that CO administration did not cause toxicity, animals were randomly assigned to four experimental groups: CONTROL group (sham surgery without hypoxia exposure, <italic>n = 22</italic>), CO+SHAM group (CO exposure prior to sham surgery without hypoxia exposure, <italic>n = 16</italic>), HI group (hypoxia-ischemia, <italic>n = 17</italic>) and CO+HI group (CO exposure prior to HI, <italic>n = 19</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042632-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Animals were randomly assigned to each group through computer-generated (Excel) randomization schedules before performing any experimental procedure. During the HI procedure and CO exposure pups in all experiment groups were kept separate from their mother the equal period of time. Rats were sacrificed 6 and 24 hours after HI onset. All subsequent procedures were done by researchers who were blinded to the experimental groups.</p>

          <p>To define ischemic boundaries and precisely identify apoptotic profiles, serial sections were stained with cresyl violet. For immunohistochemistry, sections were immersed in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS), then incubated overnight in antibodies against cleaved-caspase 3 (1∶200, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, US), S100β (1∶1000, Sigma-Aldrich) or Ki67 (1∶400, Novocastra, Newcastle, UK) at 4°C; primary antibodies were prepared in 10% NDS solution. For Ki67 immunohistochemistry, sections were initially heated in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 3 minutes at 800 W using a microwave oven prior to primary antibody incubation to enhance antigen retrieval. Cy2- or Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1∶200 and 1∶400 respectively, 2 h at room temperature, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, USA) were used to visualize binding of primary antibodies; cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich). Control tissue was processed as above with non-immune serum instead of the primary antibody. Immunoreacted sections were examined with Nikon 90i epifluorescence microscope by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups. Co-localization was determined on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with argon 488 nm, helium–neon 543 nm, and helium–neon 633 mn lasers.

          <title>Stereological counts in the hippocampus</title>
          <p>Cresyl violet-stained sections were analysed with 100× oil-immersion objective for stereological estimation of apoptotic profiles. Sections were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a motorized stage controller; they were photographed with a CCD camera (OptronicsMicrofire, Goleta, CA, USA). Analyses were done by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups. We used the optical fractionator method for stereological estimates of apoptotic profiles in the hippocampal formation; the volume of hippocampus was calculated according to the Cavalieri's principle (Neurolucida 8.0 User's Guide—Document Version NL0108-08.10 Microbrightfield Inc., 1988–2008.); all analyses were done with use of StereoInvestigator (Microbrightfield, Williston, VT, USA). Series were 300 µm spaced; the first section of each series was dorsal to the hippocampal white matter; subsequent collected sections were equidistant from this reference slice; each series consisted of 9 sections. The procedure yields a series of systematically random sections (a requirement for the optical fractionator methods, Lyster et al 2005; West et al 1991). Stereological sampling was done according to Fitting (Fitting et al., 2008). An initial pilot study optimized the sampling scheme. The coefficient of sampling error (CE) was calculated to determine the appropriate number and size of disector counting frames. When considering 9 sections per case, a sampling grid of 400×400 µm, with a 25×25 µm counting frame and a disector height of 20 µm (disector volume = 12500 µm<sup>3</sup>) was chosen; the CE varied between 0.01 and 0.1. To avoid oversampling, two guard zones were set on top and bottom of sections, each corresponding to 10% of the focally measured section thickness. Only neurons bearing morphological changes strongly suggestive for apoptosis, namely cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and visible apoptotic bodies were considered dying cells and counted. The estimated total (T) number of objects (i.e., apoptotic profiles) was finally calculated in accordance to the following formula, as previously described by Fitting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Fitting1">[36]</xref><disp-formula id="pone.0042632.e001"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0042632.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where ΣQ is the number of objects counted in the disectors, t is the section thickness, h is the height of disector probe, asf is the ratio between counting frames area and grid step along x and y axis, and ssf is the section sampling fraction and was set to 1/6. To avoid bias due to asymmetrical cutting, the total estimated number of objects was then normalized to the sampled volume and density values are presented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042632.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

          <p>The apoptotic hall-markers: (i) Bcl-2 expression, (ii) release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and (iii) caspase activation, were assessed in hippocampus isolated 6 and 24 h after the insult. Rat pups were first anesthetized then decapitated, the hippocampus dissected and stored at −80°C until analysis; tissue was triturated manually with Potter Elvehjem in lysis buffer (15 mMTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 320 mM sucrose, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% protease inhibitor, 3 mM EDTA-K, 30 µg/mL CsA).

Protein content (from total extract or mitochondrial fraction) was determined by BCA assay (Pierce, Illinois). Proteins (20–40 µg) were separated on SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide), transferred to PVDF membranes, blocked in 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (containing 0.1% of Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Equal amounts of protein were confirmed by the internal control assessment of ß-actin. The following primary antibodies were used overnight at 4°C: anti-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1∶5000); anti-cytochrome c (Abcam, 1∶2000); anti-active caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, 1∶5000); anti ß-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1∶5000); all were diluted in blocking solution. Blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Bioscience, UK) after incubation with HRP-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare, UK, 1∶5000) for 1 hour at RT. The area and intensity of bands were quantified by densitometry analysis (GraphPad Prism 4), and were normalized to the positive control (100%).

CO pre-treatment lead to an increased expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 at 6 and 24 h in both hemispheres compared to the HI group. At 24 h, Bcl-2 expression among CO pre-treated pups was also higher than control pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042632-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).

Therefore, CO appears to trigger tissue preconditioning and to stimulate cell survival, by changing gene expression, such as bcl-2. Cytochrome c levels in mitochondria-enriched fraction of hippocampus of the HI group were lower at 6 h than at 24 h after the insult relative to controls.

Thus, CO prevented cytochrome c release from mitochondria, which can limit apoptosome formation and caspase-3 activation. Indeed, caspase-3 activation was less pronounced in IL hippocampal extracts from CO+HI group than from HI group at 6 and 24 h, while caspase-3 activation was similar in CL CO+HI and HI groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042632-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

      <p>Two complementary approaches were applied to demonstrate the neuroprotective role of carbon monoxide: <italic>in vitro</italic> excitoxicity induction in primary culture of rat cerebellar neurons and an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of perinatal ischemia in rat pups. In primary neuronal cultures, 1 h of CO pre-treatment had a positive outcome on the survival of neurons against excitotoxic-induced cell death and increased expression of the anti-apoptotic gene <italic>bcl-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042632-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Likewise, prior exposure to CO significantly reduced the number of apoptotic profiles in the hippocampus (by 64%) 24 h following hypoxia-ischemia in rat pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042632-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Apoptotic factors are up-regulated in early stages of brain development and play a major role in brain damage following perinatal ischemia because apoptosis is a key cellular process during CNS development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Hagberg1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Ge1">[40]</xref>. Therefore, apoptotic hallmarks were assessed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, CO pre-treatment improved the cellular anti-apoptotic machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042632-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042632-g005">5</xref>). In accordance with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data, increased Bcl-2 expression was found in hippocampal extracts from CO-treated pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042632-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Furthermore, increase in Bcl-2 expression activates many anti-apoptotic pathways and indicates that late preconditioning might be involved in CO neuroprotection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Ness1">[41]</xref>. Accordingly, previous studies have reported that protein synthesis is required for CO-conferred neuroprotection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Vieira1">[25]</xref> and mitochondrial biogenesis stimulation is also involved in CO's apoptosis inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Almeida1">[35]</xref>. Thus, CO cytoprotection might be related to late preconditioning induction, although further studies are necessary. Nevertheless, early preconditioning responses cannot be excluded from CO's mode of action, since ROS signaling is involved in CO-induced cytoprotection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Motterlini1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Queiroga1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Queiroga2">[42]</xref>, which presents new hypotheses for further studies based on cerebral cell anti-oxidant defense.</p>
      <p>In hippocampus, higher cytochrome c levels in mitochondria were found with CO pre-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042632-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). This indicates a reduced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which can be related to the reported direct action of CO on mitochondrial membrane permeabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Queiroga1">[26]</xref>. Still, the increased cytochrome c sequestration in the mitochondria contributes to the lower levels of caspase-3 activation found in hippocampus from CO pre-treated pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042632-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Furthermore, in hippocampal CA2, CA3 and DG regions, activated caspase-3 positive cell populations decreased when pups were exposed to CO before the hypoxic-ischemic insult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042632-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). An active role of CO in cerebral apoptosis prevention <italic>in vivo</italic> has been suggested by other authors: (i) HO-1 knockout mice exhibit a larger volume of tissue damage following injection of NMDA compared to wild type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Ahmad1">[43]</xref>, and (ii) Zeynalov and colleagues report that low doses of exogenous CO protect against transient or permanent focal ischemia in adult mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Zeynalov1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Wang1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Perinatal HI can be partially predicted based on the presence of several risk factors: signals of distress during intrauterine life and hypoxic-ischemic insults at birth (Bonifacio et al. 2011). Also, preterm newborns represent a high-risk population for brain injury due to HI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Arpino1">[44]</xref>. Therefore, preconditioning-based strategies can become potential therapies for perinatal HI, and CO is a promising candidate. Other preconditioning-based strategies have also been developed for perinatal cerebral ischemia. In piglets, 3 h of exposure to 8% oxygen prior to hypoxia/ischemia insult induced neuroprotection via up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial factor (VEGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Ara1">[45]</xref>. Similarly, in adult mice, preconditioning by exposure to hypoxia and isoflurane presented a neuroprotective effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-McAuliffe1">[46]</xref>. In an experimental model of HI similar to ours (left carotid artery ligation and 90 minutes of 8% O<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen has shown to be neuroprotective by blocking apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Cai1">[47]</xref>. Finally, lithium pre-treatment prevented apoptotic and autophagic neuronal cell death in the hippocampus following neonatal HI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Li1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>CO may be a useful therapeutic adjunct. In fact, other inhalation therapies have been introduced in clinics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Robinson1">[49]</xref>, to reduce toxicity resulting from the metabolization of administered drugs, since drug extraction occurs by exhalation. The therapeutic application of nitric oxide (NO) as vasodilator in several disease models and also in injured lungs of premature and newborn babies is now widely accepted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Bloch1">[50]</xref>. NO is chemically similar to CO. However, unlike CO, NO reacts rapidly with molecular oxygen and produces peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>−</sup>), which is highly reactive. Likewise, noble gases have also been studied for medical applications, especially xenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Sanders1">[51]</xref>. Recently, Ryang and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Ryang1">[52]</xref> described the efficacy of argon in protecting rat brains in a model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Taken all together, potential CO-inhaled based therapy has the added value of integrating two critical advantages: it is chemically inert compared to NO and is an endogenous molecule compared to noble gases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Bonifacio1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To overcome a possible systemic CO toxic effect, the use of CO-releasing molecules (CORM's) has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Motterlini2">[53]</xref>. These small organic and organometallic compounds are able to deliver CO in a timely and tissue-specific manner. This permits a significant reduction in carboxyhaemoglobin formation and toxicity, which opens novel windows of opportunity for clinical applications. The biological activities of CORMs include cardioprotection in isolated perfused rat heart, protection in acute hepatic reperfusion injury in rats, endothelial cells protection during cold preservation, and injury impairment in the case of HI injury during kidney transplantation, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Motterlini1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Stein1">[54]</xref>. Very recently, CORM-3 was shown to modulate the inflammatory response and to reduce brain damage in an adult rat model of hemorrhagic stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042632-Yabluchanskiy1">[55]</xref>, indicating that CORM-3 can cross the blood brain barrier.</p>
      <p>Altogether, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches have demonstrated that CO initiates a cascade of events that prevents neuronal apoptosis: (i) increase of Bcl-2 expression, (ii) prevention of cytochrome c release from mitochondria, (iii) inhibition of caspase-3 activation and (iv) decrease of chromatin condensation. CO administration induced late preconditioning and limited hippocampal neuronal cell death following cerebral perinatal ischemia. In conclusion, the biological neuroprotective role of CO, coupled with the possibility of using CORMs, opens avenues of further research and potential applications of CO-based therapies in cerebral ischemic models. Moreover, this innovative approach takes advantage of an endogenous molecule (CO) and intracellular pathways (preconditioning) for limiting neuronal cell death.</p>
