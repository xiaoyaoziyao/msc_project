<title>Background</title>
<p>The prediction of breast cancer intrinsic subtypes has been introduced as a valuable strategy to determine patient diagnosis and prognosis, and therapy response. The PAM50 method, based on the expression levels of 50 genes, uses a single sample predictor model to assign subtype labels to samples. Intrinsic errors reported within this assay demonstrate the challenge of identifying and understanding the breast cancer groups. In this study, we aim to: a) identify novel biomarkers for subtype individuation by exploring the competence of a newly proposed method named CM1 score, and b) apply an ensemble learning, as opposed to the use of a single classifier, for sample subtype assignment. The overarching objective is to improve class prediction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods and Findings</title>
<p>The microarray transcriptome data sets used in this study are: the METABRIC breast cancer data recorded for over 2000 patients, and the public integrated source from ROCK database with 1570 samples. We first computed the CM1 score to identify the probes with highly discriminative patterns of expression across samples of each intrinsic subtype. We further assessed the ability of 42 selected probes on assigning correct subtype labels using 24 different classifiers from the Weka software suite. For comparison, the same method was applied on the list of 50 genes from the PAM50 method.</p>

<sec id="sec003">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The CM1 score portrayed 30 novel biomarkers for predicting breast cancer subtypes, with the confirmation of the role of 12 well-established genes. Intrinsic subtypes assigned using the CM1 list and the ensemble of classifiers are more consistent and homogeneous than the original PAM50 labels. The new subtypes show accurate distributions of current clinical markers ER, PR and HER2, and survival curves in the METABRIC and ROCK data sets. Remarkably, the paradoxical attribution of the original labels reinforces the limitations of employing a single sample classifiers to predict breast cancer intrinsic subtypes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breast cancer has been perceived as several distinct diseases characterised by intrinsic aberrations, heterogeneous behaviour and divergent clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref001">1</xref>]. The classification of breast cancer in discernible molecular subtypes has motivated translational researchers in the past decades towards the design of patient prognosis and the development of tailored treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref002">2</xref>]. In this scenario, the analysis of breast tumours using microarray data has significantly improved the disease taxonomy and the discovery of new biomarkers for implementation in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref006">6</xref>]. In the early 2000s, five intrinsic subtypes were proposed: <italic>luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, normal-like</italic> and <italic>basal-like</italic> breast tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref008">8</xref>]. Following this initial molecular taxonomy, further sub-classifications of breast cancer in distinct entities have been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The transcriptomic patterns observed across subtypes has given us insight into the molecular complexity and inherent alterations in tumour cells modelling the breast cancer heterogeneity and unpredicted outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref013">13</xref>]. Strikingly, intrinsic gene lists have been explored to reliably assign breast tumour samples into formal molecular subtypes, survival rate and treatment outline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref018">18</xref>]. Recently, Parker and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref016">16</xref>] proposed a list of 50 genes that together with the Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM) classification algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref019">19</xref>] aimed at identifying subtypes and enlarging the prognostic information with high potential for validation in clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref021">21</xref>]. The resulting technique, called the PAM50 method, has been widely applied to categorize tumours into one of the five classical intrinsic subtypes.</p>
<p>Although independent cohorts attempted to identify molecular subtypes, the chosen microarray-based Single Sample Predictor (SSP) model revealed unreliable assignments and modest agreement between studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref022">22</xref>]. In fact, the perceived inability of some analytical methods to deal with the challenges of processing high-dimensional data, in addition to the difficulties on validating independent/unpaired technologies may limit the precise characterisation of the subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref024">24</xref>]. Therefore, novel methods are urgently needed in order to provide better tumour stratification and accurate biomarkers identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref026">26</xref>]. In this scenario, the high quality of the microarray gene expression data set processed by the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref027">27</xref>], with over 2000 samples, offers a unique opportunity to refine and expand the list of transcripts that best discriminate intrinsic subtypes. A precise classification of breast tumours, consequently, would lead to improvements in the valuation of the disease, currently guided by oestrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PR) status, and HER2 amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>In this report, we focus on the use of a ranking feature method based on the newly proposed CM1 score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref029">29</xref>] to identify probe sets that appear naturally from the METABRIC breast cancer data set. For doing so, we use the entire set of 48803 probes as an alternative to the selection from pre-existing literature as performed by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref016">16</xref>]. Moreover, the quality of the probes for predicting subtypes is carefully appraised in the METABRIC data set (Illumina BeadArray) and further validated in different studies (Affymetrix GeneChip) accessed through the Research Online Cancer Knowledgebase (ROCK) interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref030">30</xref>]. However, instead of relying on a single method to assign sample subtype, as suggested by Parker et al. (2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref016">16</xref>] with the PAM50 method, we explore an ensemble learning. Our analysis is based on the performance of a large set of classification models from the Weka software suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref031">31</xref>]; a technique previously recommended by Ravetti and Moscato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref032">32</xref>]. The classifiers are used in combination with the list of probes selected using CM1 score and, alternatively, with the 50 genes from the PAM50 commercial assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref016">16</xref>]. We also compute several statistical measures to determine the power of both lists on predicting breast cancer subtypes. Ultimately, we correlate the study outcomes within current clinical information and survival analysis.</p>

<title>Data sets description</title>
<p>The METABRIC microarray data set used in this study is hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and deposited in the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/</ext-link>, under accession number EGAS00000000083. It consists of transcriptomic information (cDNA microarrays profiling) processed on the Illumina HT-12 v3 platform (Illumina_Human_WG-v3), as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref027">27</xref>]. The log<sub>2</sub>-normalised gene expression values of primary tumours were divided into two subsets by METABRIC: <italic>discovery</italic> (997 samples) and <italic>validation</italic> (989 samples), which were respectively used as <italic>training</italic> and <italic>test</italic> sets in our experiments. The original study collected and analysed data under the approval of the ethics Institutional Review Board (details in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref027">27</xref>]). The use of this data for research was also approved by the Human Ethics Research Committee (HREC) of The University of Newcastle, Australia, (approval number: H-2013–0277).</p>
<p>The second data set is publicly available in ROCK online portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref030">30</xref>] at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://rock.icr.ac.uk/">http://rock.icr.ac.uk/</ext-link>, under data source access GSE47561. This source integrates ten data studies (GSE2034, GSE11121, GSE20194, GSE1456, GSE2603, GSE6532, GSE20437, E-TABM-185, GSE7390, GSE5847) performed on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array (HG-U133A) platform. The matrix contains log2 RMA re-normalised gene expression data in a unique comprehensive report of 1570 samples. Thus, the GSE47561 data set was used as a second validation set to test our method.</p>
<p>In brief, both METABRIC and ROCK data sets have information on patients’ long-term clinical and pathological outcomes, including the sample assignment into intrinsic subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, normal-like, and basal-like) according to the PAM50 method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref016">16</xref>]. The METABRIC data set has a more comprehensive description of patient clinical features, whereas the ROCK data set presents no standardized information across the ten different studies.</p>

<title>Study Design and Computing Resources</title>
<p>In this study, we propose a systematic approach that aims at improving breast cancer subtype prediction. The systematic approach is built based on feature selection and data mining concepts. We first compute the CM1 score—using the microarray mRNA expression values—to rank the whole set of probes based on their discriminative power across breast cancer subtypes. We then select the top 10 probes that best represent each intrinsic subtype. The quality of this selection is assessed using a set of classifiers from the Weka software suite with the METABRIC and ROCK data sets, followed by the statistical analysis. The process flow is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0129711.g001">Fig 1</xref>, and further explained in the remainder of this section.</p>

<title>The step-by-step process.</title>
<p>The image shows the method steps based on <italic>CM1 score</italic> and <italic>ensemble learning</italic>. The <italic>METABRIC discovery set</italic> is used to compute the <italic>CM1 score</italic>, based on the <italic>original labels</italic> previously assigned with the PAM50 method. This step has an output of 42 discriminative probes selected, the <italic>CM1 list</italic>. The following step involve the sample subtype classification based on a <italic>10-fold cross-validation</italic>. Samples in the METABRIC discovery set are considered to train 24 classifiers using the CM1 list and, alternatively, the <italic>PAM50 list</italic>. The samples are partitioned into ten folds; then a model is built using 90% of samples, which is used to predict the labels of the remaining 10%. After the ten turns are finished, the level of association between the predicted and original METABRIC labels is computed using several <italic>statistics</italic>. In the <italic>training-test setting</italic>, labels of samples in the <italic>METABRIC validation set</italic> and <italic>ROCK set</italic> are predicted with the models built in the discovery. Statistics measurements are again computed to assess the model performance on predicting breast cancer subtypes. In both classification steps, the new labels are attributed based on the consensus of the majority of the classifiers. Finally, the results or new labels are compared against the <italic>clinical data</italic>, the current markers ER, PR and HER2, and survival curves.</p>

<title>Selection of biomarkers using the CM1 score</title>
<p>The CM1 score is a supervised univariate method used to measure the difference in expression levels of samples in two different classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref029">29</xref>]. In this study, it is used as a ranking feature to select a subset of highly discriminative probes for each breast cancer intrinsic subtype. Let <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> be a partition of a set of samples into two classes, with <italic>X</italic> the <italic>class of interest</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> the <italic>remaining classes</italic>.

<p>To define the most discriminative probes for each breast cancer subtype (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, normal-like and basal-like), we computed the CM1 score for each of 48803 probes taking the subtype of interest and the remaining ones. This results in 5 lists of 48803 CM1 scores.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that Parker et al. (2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref016">16</xref>] were able to define the five breast cancer classes based on 50 genes, for each subtype we chose the 10 most important probes (5 with the greatest positive CM1 score values—indicating up-regulated probes relative to the other subtypes –, and 5 with the smallest negative values – representing down-regulation). This set is referred to as the <italic>balanced top ten</italic> in this paper. Collecting the balanced top ten lists of all subtypes leads to a new set of 42 unique Illumina probes, meaning that 8 probes appear in multiple subtypes. This list is hereafter called the <italic>CM1 list</italic>.</p>

<title>Assessment of the quality of the CM1 list based on ensemble learning</title>
<p>The quality of the CM1 list for distinguishing subtypes was assessed using a list of well-known classifiers available in the Weka data mining software suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref031">31</xref>]. It uses different types of classifiers such as bayesian, functions, lazy, meta, rule-based and decision trees. Each classifier was trained with a subset of the data comprising all samples in the METABRIC discovery set and the 42 probes in the CM1 list using both 10-fold cross-validation and training-test setting. In the 10-fold cross-validation, the samples are first partitioned into ten folds; then a model is built using 90% of samples, which is thereafter used to predict the labels of the remaining 10%. After the ten turns are finished, the level of association between the predicted and original METABRIC labels is computed using Cramer’s V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref033">33</xref>]. In the training-test setting, labels of samples in the METABRIC validation set and ROCK data are predicted using models built with the samples in the <italic>discovery set</italic>. The new labels were attributed based on the consensus of the majority of the classifiers (i.e. more than 50% percent), and whenever such condition was not achieved samples were marked as inconsistent (INC).</p>
<p>A similar approach was performed with the PAM50 list to serve as baseline for comparing the results obtained with the 42 probes from the CM1 list. The 50 genes identified by Parker et al. (2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref016">16</xref>] were mapped to Illumina probes by Curtis et al. (2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref027">27</xref>], following strict criteria. Only genes and corresponding probe with perfect annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref034">34</xref>] on the Illumina HT-12 v3 BeadChip were considered. Probes containing SNPs, multiple targets or mismatches, or lying in repeat-masked regions were discarded. Finally, a total of 48 probes corresponding to genes in the PAM50 list were selected to conduct the classification experiments as described for the CM1 list. For Affymetrics HG-U133A, the CM1 and PAM50 lists were mapped according to ‘genefu’ R package, using Entrez Gene ID as reference. For instance, the 42 probes from the CM1 list matched 33 probes, whereas the 48 from PAM50 list paired 43 probes in the Affymetrix platform. In case of multiple mappings the probe with the most variation was selected according to the ‘genefu’ instructions. Before testing the classifiers in ROCK data set, the Affymetrix and Illumina expression levels were min-max normalised.</p>

<title>Using the CM1 list to differentiate the five intrinsic breast cancer subtypes</title>
<p>The CM1 score was applied to rank the set of 48803 probes for each of the five subtypes in the METABRIC discovery data set (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0129711.s003">S1 Table</xref>). It is important to remark that this method used the original PAM50 subtypes attributed to samples in the METABRIC discovery set. The purpose of doing so is to provide a better molecular characterisation of each class using the wealth of the METABRIC transcriptomic data, besides improving the breast cancer subtype prediction. The probes with the top five negative and top five positive CM1 scores were selected for each subtype. Here, we aimed at obtaining 50 probes that appear naturally from a rich and unique data set. We would then be able to compare such a list with the list of 50 genes embedded in the PAM50 method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref016">16</xref>]—the PAM50 list.

<title>The ensemble of classifiers reveal high levels of agreement between CM1 and PAM50 lists</title>
<p>After applying the ensemble learning, several statistical measures were computed as referred in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec005">Materials and Methods</xref>. The main purpose of the statistics is to determine the performance of the 24 classification methods from the Weka software suite. In other words, we investigate the consistency of intrinsic subtype labels attributed by the majority of classifiers having as input either the CM1 or PAM50 lists. The quality of both lists was estimated according to the Cramer’s V statistic and the Average Sensitivity. Additionally, we computed the popular interrater reliability metric Fleiss’ kappa to establish the consensus of sample labelling across different classifiers. This metric was used to gauge the agreement among classifiers trained with CM1 and PAM50 lists against the original labels in the data sets, and between the labels assigned by the majority of classifiers using both lists. Ultimately, we applied the Adjusted Rand Index to quantify the agreement between pairs of samples that are either in the same class or in different classes according to both lists.</p>
<sec id="sec020">
<title>Average Cramer’s V statistic and Average Sensitivity to measure the performance of individual classifiers</title>
<p>We determined the performance of the ensemble learning (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0129711.s004">S2 Table</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0129711.s005">S3 Table</xref>) with two measures: Cramer’s V statistic and Average Sensitivity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0129711.t003">Table 3</xref>). Cramer’s V is used to measure the strength of association among variables in the row and column, given a contingency table (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0129711.t004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0129711.t005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0129711.t006">6</xref>). The rows represent the original PAM50 labels and the columns the subtypes assigned by the majority of the classifiers in the ensemble. For instance, Cramer’s V statistic showed an average association between original and predicted subtypes of 0.73±0.06 and 0.63±0.04 in the METABRIC discovery and validation sets respectively with the CM1 list; and 0.75±0.06 and 0.64±0.04 with PAM50 list. Expanding the validation process using the ROCK test set, Cramer’s V ranged from 0.57±0.06 with the CM1, and 0.58±0.05 using PAM50 list.</p>

<p>The Average Sensitivity statistic was used to characterize the average proportion of accurately labelled samples in each subtype. Considering the analysis with CM1 list, the measure was 0.76±0.06 in the METABRIC discovery set and 0.64±0.04 in the validation set; and with PAM50 list was 0.78±0.07 and 0.65±0.05, respectively. Likewise, the average sensitivity calculated for the ROCK test set was 0.67±0.07 using the CM1 and 0.69±0.08 with PAM50 list. A complete table containing the performance of all individual classification methods is available in the (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0129711.s004">S2 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0129711.s005">S3 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>Fleiss’ kappa was computed to assess the reliability of agreement between two raters, as displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0129711.t007">Table 7</xref>. We initially compared the agreement <italic>Among classifiers</italic> which indicates the overall performance of classifiers alone.

<title>The use of an ensemble learning with the CM1 list improves the subtype distribution in the METABRIC and ROCK data sets</title>
<p>The number of samples in each original PAM50 subtype is markedly different across the METABRIC sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0129711.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In the discovery set, there is a clear abundance of luminal A and B subtypes, precisely 73.62% of all samples. In contrast, the proportion of luminals in the validation set is only 48.14%. The ratio of luminal A to luminal B samples changed from 1.74 in the discovery to 1.14 in the validation set. However, when the CM1 or PAM50 lists are used in conjunction with the ensemble of classifiers, samples in the discovery and validation sets are more homogeneously distributed. The percentage of samples in the discovery set labelled as luminal A and B using CM1 and PAM50 lists are 73.53% and 73.72%, respectively. These proportions match the original number (73.62%). On the other hand, in the validation set the CM1 and PAM50 lists assigned a total of 64% and 63.19% luminal samples, against the 48.14% previously mentioned. The distribution of subtypes also become more similar to the discovery set. Likewise, ROCK test set also changed the pattern of class distribution after the performance of the ensemble of classifiers. The differences in class distributions might not be attributed to the randomisation procedure used by the studies as the performance of the ensemble of classifiers with both lists reconcile the distribution of subtypes.</p>

<p>We summarize the similarities and differences in subtypes distribution (graphically displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0129711.g005">Fig 5</xref>) by computing the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref225">225</xref>]. This is a true metric of distance between probability distributions. Its plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0129711.g006">Fig 6</xref> shows the similarity between all possible pairs of data sets based on their distribution of subtype labels (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0129711.s006">S4 Table</xref>). It can be observed that the original labels are the most divergent ones, especially in the METABRIC validation and ROCK test sets. The high similarity of samples distribution among subtypes based on the assignments with CM1 or PAM50 lists is evident. Such similarity was not expected for the ROCK set as the ensemble of classifiers was trained with METABRIC discovery (Illumina platform data) and tested in the ROCK set (Affymetrix platform data). The limited number of probes matching Illumina and Affymetrix in both lists (as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec005">Materials and Methods</xref>) seems not to affect the performance of the ensemble learning. Yet the divergences in the original class distributions might not be attributed to the randomisation procedure used by the consortium. These results point out to the relative strength and robustness of a set of classifiers compared to single methods to predict breast cancer subtype labels. They also indicate that there is an issue to be considered by researchers when using the original PAM50 labels from the METABRIC study for analysing data and building predictive models.</p>

<title>Breast cancer intrinsic subtypes show different clinical markers distribution and survival curves</title>
<p>Given the heterogeneity among breast cancer patients and the intricate assignment of PAM50 labels in the original METABRIC data set, we further investigated whether significant differences exist in the analysis of current clinical markers (ER, PR and HER2). Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0129711.g007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0129711.g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0129711.g009">9</xref> show, respectively, the distribution of the ER, PR and <italic>HER2</italic> across intrinsic subtypes in the METABRIC discovery and validation sets, considering the original PAM50 labels and the labels assigned by ensemble of classifiers using CM1 and PAM50 lists. The new subtype labelling markedly improves the status of the clinical markers in the METABRIC data set. For instance, the ER marker distribution across subtypes shows an important decrease in the number of HER2-enriched and basal-like samples that are ER-positive according to the original PAM50 labels. The PR marker, likewise, varies the distribution when predicted labels based on the ensemble of classifiers using either CM1 and PAM50 list are compared with the original labels. <italic>HER2</italic> amplification has a particular behaviour across all subtypes. Under the new subtype labels, the distribution of the three clinical markers becomes more consistent with what is expected according to the literature for each class: luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+, <italic>HER2</italic>−); luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, <italic>HER2</italic>±); HER2-enriched (ER−, PR− and <italic>HER2</italic>+); and basal-like (ER−, PR−, <italic>HER2</italic>−) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref226">226</xref>].</p>

<p>Subsequently, we illustrate the survival curves for all breast cancer subtypes using Cox proportional hazards model, as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec005">Materials and Methods</xref>. The curves were plotted based on the original PAM50 labels and those assigned by the majority of classifiers. For generating the survival curves, we included the most relevant clinical variables as covariates: grade, size, age at diagnosis, number of lymph nodes positive, and ER status (immunohistochemistry) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref027">27</xref>]. This analysis revealed different curves in the METABRIC discovery and validation sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0129711.g010">Fig 10</xref>). For instance, luminal B and basal-like subtypes show a similar pattern across data sets. Luminal A, HER2-enriched and normal-like, on the other hand, have a more consistent survival pattern when the CM1 and PAM50 lists are used in conjunction with the ensemble learning. Taken as a whole, the results of this section support the increased robustness of labels assigned by the ensemble of classifiers with the CM1 or PAM50 lists, and point out to inconsistencies in the original subtype assignment in the METABRIC study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we exposed the power of the CM1 list for improving the breast cancer subtype prediction in the METABRIC and ROCK data sets. The CM1 score portrayed 30 novel genes as potential biomarkers, along with 12 well-established markers shared between CM1 and PAM50 lists. The 42 biomarkers have a great potential to differentiate breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. Among them, <italic>AGR3, HPN, ANKRD30A, AURKB, PROM1, VTCN1, CRYAB, CDK1, CDKN3, SERPINA3, SOX11, TRPV6, CLCA2, MUCL1, COL11A1, DARC, TFF3, IGF2BP3, IL33, SUSD3, PSAT1</italic>, and <italic>GABRP</italic> are reported in different studies associated with breast cancer; however not in the context of subtype differentiation. Noteworthy, the CM1 list revealed a set of probes for which little literature exists in relation to breast cancer subtypes: <italic>CDCA5, CCL15, COL17A1, GLYATL2, ROPN1</italic>, LINC00993 and C6orf211. Their expression levels vary across different subtypes, and are yet a new avenue to be explored. We also emphasize the 12 common genes (<italic>CEP55, ESR1, FOXA1, FOXC1, KRT17, MAPT, MELK, MMP11, NAT1, SFRP1, UBE2C</italic>, and <italic>UBE2T</italic>) due to their important role for breast cancer disease and intrinsic subtyping.</p>
<p>Within the application of an ensemble of classifiers, CM1 and PAM50 lists showed concordant predictive power for disease subtyping. In fact, there was an <italic>almost perfect agreement</italic> between the labellings obtained with the majority of classifiers using both lists; however different from the original labels. In this study, we want to highlight the weakness of relying in a single method to assign subtypes labels, as opposed to the power and robustness of an ensemble learning. We therefore discourage label assignments based on a single classifier and also suggests a thorough review of those intrinsic subtypes given the importance of such data sets to breast cancer research. The results indicate that there is an issue to be considered by researchers when using the original PAM50 labels for analysing data. The use of incorrect labels would lead to a plethora of misguided and misleading results by other investigators that use METABRIC or ROCK data sets.</p>
<p>In spite of luminals sharing the same origin and large molecular commonalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref227">227</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref228">228</xref>], the ensemble of classifiers accurately predicted luminal samples in the METABRIC data set, and showed some ambiguity on assigning the subtype A or B for a small number of samples, specially in the ROCK data set. This may be a consequence of the reduced number of probes matching across Illumina and Affymetrix platforms. HER2-enriched notably improved label consistency in the ROCK data. Furthermore, the normal-like tumours received more often contradictory and inaccurate subtype labelling among both data sets. The poor overall outcome for this subtype is supported by the discussion that normal-like is an artefact of sample processing with high contamination of normal breast tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref229">229</xref>]; however, still crucial to be elucidated. Ultimately, the basal-like subtype maintained the classification with a unique profile, markedly divergent from other subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref230">230</xref>]; even though this group has recently been partitioned into new fundamental classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0129711.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Overall, the new intrinsic subtype labels based on the CM1 list and ensemble learning revealed more accurate distributions of clinical markers (ER, PR and HER2) and survival curves, when compared to the original PAM50 labels in the METABRIC cohort and ROCK test set. Interestingly, the CM1 list shows <italic>ESR1</italic> (ER) among the 42 probes, but brings other independent genes that are also relevant for overall predictions. Robust data sets like METABRIC have contributed to the understanding of breast cancer disease in terms of its molecular complexity and intrinsic alterations. The main limitations of the research in the field, nevertheless, is the uncertainty in the exact classification of intrinsic subtypes; over and above the discovery of molecular signatures and standard clinical biomarkers. Under consideration, a consistent taxonomy needs yet to be established prior to implementation in clinical practice. Additional research involving the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and epigenome, will lastly portray a true landscape of subtypes and contribute to breast cancer management.</p>

<p>Table describing the performance of each classifier on the METABRIC discovery and validation sets, and ROCK test set using the PAM50 list. It shows the percentage of correctly, incorrectly and not classified samples, Fleiss Kappa index, Cramer’s V, Average Sensitivity, and other values for classification. The 24 classifiers from the Weka software suite are also listed. The labels predicted by each classifier for all samples using CM1 list are defined as: 1—luminal A, 2—luminal B, 3—HER2-enriched, 4—normal-like, 5—basal-like. Count of predicted labels was obtained with the consensus of the majority of classifiers.</p>

<title>The agreement between sample labelling with Fleiss’ Kappa measure and the Jensen-Shannon divergence of two probability distributions.</title>
<p>Table containing the Fleiss’ Kappa agreement of labels for the METABRIC discovery and validation sets, and ROCK test set. It shows the overall agreement <italic>Among classifiers</italic> using CM1 and PAM50 lists, as well as the agreement for each subtype. The <italic>predicted—original</italic> are described in the table and contain the agreement between the mostly predicted and initial labels of samples; whereas the <italic>CM1—PAM50</italic> show agreement between labels assigned by the majority of classifiers using CM1 and PAM50 lists. The file also has the Jensen-Shannon divergence between two probability distributions. Numbers represent the similarity between subtypes distribution for METABRIC discovery and validation sets, and ROCK test set. The similarity is measured using the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence.</p>
