In termites, the soldier caste display distinctive defense behaviors, such as aggressively attacking enemies with well-developed mandibles, while the other castes retreat into the colony without exhibiting any aggressive response. It is thus likely that some form of soldier-specific neuronal modification exists in termites. In this study, the authors compared the brain (cerebral ganglion) and the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG) of soldiers and pseudergates (workers) in the damp-wood termite, <italic>Hodotermopsis sjostedti</italic>. The size of the SOG was significantly larger in soldiers than in pseudergates, but no difference in brain size was apparent between castes. Furthermore, mandibular nerves were thicker in soldiers than in pseudergates. Retrograde staining revealed that the somata sizes of the mandibular motor neurons (MdMNs) in soldiers were more than twice as large as those of pseudergates. The enlargement of MdMNs was also observed in individuals treated with a juvenile hormone analogue (JHA), indicating that MdMNs become enlarged in response to juvenile hormone (JH) action during soldier differentiation. This enlargement is likely to have two functions: a behavioral function in which soldier termites will be able to defend more effectively through relatively faster and stronger mandibular movements, and a developmental function that associates with the development of soldier-specific mandibular muscle morphogenesis in termite head. The soldier-specific enlargement of mandibular motor neurons was observed in all examined species in five termite families that have different mechanisms of defense, suggesting that such neuronal modification was already present in the common ancestor of termites and is significant for soldier function.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by Grant-in-Aid for the Scientific Research (Nos. 15687001, 18047002, and 18370007) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Social insects are characterized by highly organized social behavior, which is facilitated by an elaborate caste system. Colony members are differentiated into various castes, which all contribute to the fitness of the colony through the division of labor. Different castes exhibit a variety of morphological and behavioral characteristics that facilitate specific tasks in the division of labor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Wilson1">[1]</xref>. In addition to immature individuals (larvae), termite colonies are composed of reproductive, worker and soldier castes. In instances when the colony is being threatened or damaged, such in the event of invasion by predators, workers escape deep into the colony and exhibit building behavior while soldiers employ specific defensive behaviors related to attacking their enemy aggressively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Stuart1">[2]</xref>. Soldiers position themselves scattered about the nest, or they may patrol the nest surface antennating or attacking. There are numerous interspecific differences in the methods used by soldiers to attack; they may bite or “snap” with their mandibles, discharge defensive chemical secretions from their frontal glands, or plug the nest with their heads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Stuart1">[2]</xref>. One common feature of all soldiers, however, is that they are characteristically aggressive and exhibit specific defense behaviors, which suggests that the specific control of these soldier-specific defense behaviors occurs in the nervous systems of soldiers.</p><p>Generally, the central nervous system (CNS) of insects consists of a brain (cerebral ganglion), a suboesophageal ganglion (SOG), three thoracic ganglia, and abdominal ganglia that are joined from the anterior to posterior of the body by two major connective nerves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Gillott1">[3]</xref>. The brain plays an important role in integrating behavior, while the SOG controls the salivary ducts, certain muscles of the head-thorax junction, and the mouthparts, including mandibles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Snodgrass1">[4]</xref>, which are one of the distinguishing characteristics of soldier morphology.</p><p>Comparison of the CNS between castes provides important clues for understanding the types of nervous system specialization in social insects that are responsible for caste-specific behavior. Recent studies have demonstrated that certain regions of hymenopteran brains are modified and that this affects behavioral differentiation in these holometabolous insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Farris1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Harano1">[11]</xref>. It was found that the mushroom body changed according to the age or foraging experience of honeybees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Farris1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-ODonnell1">[6]</xref>. The macroglomerulus of the antennal lobes are enlarged in large-bodied workers of the leaf-cutting ant, involved in the detection of the trail pheromone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Kleineidam1">[7]</xref>. Other studies on hymenopterans suggest that the presence of the queen, mating experience, or age could also influence the concentration of biogenic amines or the expression of their receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Sasaki1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Harano1">[11]</xref>. However, few studies have elucidated the mechanism underlying behavioral differentiation in hemimetabolous social insects such as termites, aphids, and thrips that have independently acquired eusociality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Crespi1">[12]</xref>. To understand the general mechanisms underlying the elements of social behavior shared by social insects, increased knowledge of the nervous systems of hemimetabolous social insects is required. Caste-specific anatomical differences in size and allometry have been reported for the nervous systems of certain termite species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Richard1">[13]</xref>, however, most of the information collected to date consists of fragmentary descriptions.</p><p>To further elaborate on soldier-specific modifications of the central nervous system, the authors undertook anatomical and histological examinations of the brains and SOGs of termites. The focal species was a damp-wood termite, <italic>Hodotermopsis sjostedti</italic> (Family Termopsidae; Order Isoptera), which have “biting-type” soldiers. This species was selected because they have large bodies and are thus well suited to anatomical examinations. In addition, “biting-type” soldier are considered to represent the evolutionarily ancestral condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Weesner1">[14]</xref>. After they hatch, larvae undergo six molts before becoming pseudergates, which function as workers. Pseudergates can subsequently differentiate into either soldiers or alates, although many remain pseudergates by repeating stationary molts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Miura1">[15]</xref>. Individuals that enter the alate line become nymphs first, before molting into alates, while individuals in the soldier line become soldiers through presoldiers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Miura2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Miura3">[17]</xref>. It has been widely reported that juvenile hormone (JH) plays an important role in termite soldier differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Lscher1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Nijhout1">[20]</xref>. In <italic>H. sjostedti</italic>, soldier differentiation can be induced by applying a juvenile hormone analogue (JHA). To demonstrate how the CNS is modified during soldier determination, a method employing this hormonal control was used in this study. It was shown that there was a distinct nervous specialization accompanying the soldier differentiation in <italic>H. sjostedti</italic>, and that this phenomenon was common in all termite species so far examined.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Morphometry of brain and SOG</title><p>While morphometric analyses showed that SOGs of the soldiers were significantly larger than those of the pseudergates (Length p&lt;0.001, Width p&lt;0.001; Student's-T test), no detectable difference in brain (cerebral ganglion) size was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002617-g001">Fig. 1A–E</xref>).

Termites are hemimetabolous social insects with soldiers, workers (pseudergates) and alates. Comparisons of the nervous systems of soldiers and workers showed that soldiers have larger SOGs which process sensory information from the mouthparts and control their motion. The MdMNs in the SOG were observed to become enlarged during soldier differentiation and this feature was common to all of the termite lineages examined. The present study is the first report of neural modification in social insects, including social hymenopterans, in which motor neurons are morphologically altered during caste differentiation.</p><p>The soldiers of <italic>H. sjostedti</italic> have a well defined defensive behavior that involves turning their head to face intruders or predators, opening their mandibles, and then closing them quickly, while moving their bodies forward then backward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Stuart1">[2]</xref>. The termite soldiers have markedly larger heads than pseudergates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Koshikawa1">[26]</xref>, which implies that soldiers have more developed mandibular muscles than pseudergates. When soldiers attack intruders, these developed muscles (most of which are closer muscles) will be contracted repeatedly through the action of neurotransmitters, which are diffused from synaptic vesicles found at the end plates of motor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Hodgkin1">[27]</xref>. This suggests that the relatively thicker muscles of soldiers require relatively more neurotransmitters. Consequently, the MdMNs of soldiers with their larger somata would likely produce more neurotransmitters for the contraction of mandibular muscles. Given that soldiers have thicker nerve roots innervating the mandibular muscles compared to pseudergates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002617-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>), and because neurons with large somata tend to have large axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Clamann1">[28]</xref>, the MdMNs of soldiers should be concurrent with thick axons. Larger axon trunks tend to increase conduction velocity because of the decrease in electric resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Hodgkin1">[27]</xref>, and several examples have been reported in which neurons with thick axons have high pulse conduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Selverston1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Zucker1">[30]</xref>. These neurons elicit fast and strong muscle movements, such as crayfish motor giant neurons (MoGs) that elicit tail-flip escape behavior. Similarly, the enlargement of MdMNs contributes to fast and strong mandibular movements of soldier defense behavior. We uniquely demonstrated that the MdMNs of soldiers and pseudergates elicit the contraction of developmentally identical muscles, however, only MdMNs of soldiers exhibit an increase in size and morphological changes during postembryonic development.</p><p>Furthermore, the developmental significance of MdMN enlargement may be considerable; MdMN enlargement occurs prior to the presoldier molt and it is possible that the larger neurons play a functional role in soldier differentiation. In the case of metamorphosis of holometabolous insects, it is known that the reconstruction of adult muscles (cf. thoracic muscles) requires the presence of certain motor neuron secretions innervating the muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Fernandes1">[31]</xref>. Similarly, in the course of soldier differentiation in termites, the muscles in the head capsule are first degenerated before presoldier molt and then reconstructed to produce thicker muscles after soldier molt (data not shown). Therefore, there is a possibility that the enlargement of MdMNs contributes to muscle reconstruction during the morphogenesis associated with soldier differentiation.</p><p>Koshikawa et al. showed that the application of JHA induced soldier-specific morphogenesis, such as the enlargement of head and mandibles in <italic>H. sjostedti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Koshikawa1">[26]</xref>, and extensive research has been conducted to date to show that JHAs induce soldier morphs in both lower and higher termite species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Noirot1">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, their findings suggest that a high JH titer is effective for soldier differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Noirot1">[32]</xref>. The present study revealed that the application of JHA induced the enlargement of MdMNs indicating and that neuronal modification is also likely to be associated with a high JH titer. There are two possible explanations of the direct or indirect relationships: JH affects MdMNs hormonally, or due to other mediators like the muscle growth. The fact that neuronal enlargement preceded presoldier molting suggests that a high JH titer affects the relatively early stages of nervous modification as well as morphogenesis. Associated with soldier morphogenesis, behavioral changes may also be induced by JHA application. Previous studies have demonstrated that JH titer is involved in modulating various insect nervous systems (cf. in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Williams1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Williams2">[34]</xref> and <italic>Apis melifera</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Schulz1">[35]</xref>). Similarly, in termites, a high JH titer may also modify other neuronal systems involved with aggressiveness or decision-making.</p><p>Given that all Isopteran families have soldiers, the soldier caste is considered to be an acquired condition of the common termite ancestor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Noirot2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Eggleton1">[37]</xref>. In this study, the observed enlargement of MdMNs in soldiers was conserved in the representative species of all the major isopteran families examined, indicating that evidence of JH-dependent MdMN enlargement is likely to be important for soldier differentiation. This finding also suggests that, in addition to soldier aggression, this soldier-specific MdMN enlargement was only acquired once in the common ancestor of the taxa examined. Interestingly, the enlargement of motor neurons was not only observed in mandibulate soldiers, but also in nasute soldiers, which attack enemies with substances secreted from their frontal glands. It is known that nasute soldiers use their mandibular closer muscles to contract the frontal glands when they discharge defense secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Noirot3">[38]</xref>. As in this report, the MdMNs of nasute soldiers occur as both partly enlarged and reduced in size. The partly enlarged MdMNs are thought to control the contraction of the frontal gland during defensive behavior and the latter may be used to close their small mandibles, although this still needs to be demonstrated. The finding that MdMNs of minor workers had MdMNs of intermediate size suggests that the nasute soldiers have enlarged neurons associated with defense behavior but degenerate MdMNs for the other neurons. In conclusion, despite the variety morphs and defensive mechanisms, the enlarged MdMNs are conserved in all termite species and are considered to be important for soldier evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Insects</title><p><italic>Hodotermopsis sjostedti</italic> (Family Termopsidae) is distributed throughout the Satsunan Islands of the Kagoshima Prefecture in southern Japan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Matsumoto1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002617-Maekawa1">[40]</xref>.

The SOG length was defined as the distance from the rostral to the distal edges of the ganglion, and SOG width as the distance along the transversal axis between both edges of the ganglion. The brain width was defined as the distance between basal parts of both optic nerves of the brain, and the brain length as the distance between rostral-end of the brain to the basal part of the antennal lobe.
