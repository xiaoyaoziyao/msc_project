<abstract>
<p>Feathers are arranged in a precise pattern in avian skin. They first arise during development in a row along the dorsal midline, with rows of new feather buds added sequentially in a spreading wave. We show that the patterning of feathers relies on coupled fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling together with mesenchymal cell movement, acting in a coordinated reaction-diffusion-taxis system. This periodic patterning system is partly mechanochemical, with mechanical-chemical integration occurring through a positive feedback loop centred on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation, mechanically compressing the epidermis to rapidly intensify <italic>FGF20</italic> expression. The travelling wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of Ectodysplasin A (EDA), which initiates the expression of <italic>FGF20</italic>. The EDA wave spreads across a mesenchymal cell density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchymal cells required to begin to form a feather bud. These waves, and the precise arrangement of feather primordia, are lost in the flightless emu and ostrich, though via different developmental routes. The ostrich retains the tract arrangement characteristic of birds in general but lays down feather primordia without a wave, akin to the process of hair follicle formation in mammalian embryos. The embryonic emu skin lacks sufficient cells to enact feather formation, causing failure of tract formation, and instead the entire skin gains feather primordia through a later process. This work shows that a reaction-diffusion-taxis system, integrated with mechanical processes, generates the feather array. In flighted birds, the key role of the EDA/Ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) pathway in vertebrate skin patterning has been recast to activate this process in a quasi-1-dimensional manner, imposing highly ordered pattern formation.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="toc">
<p>The highly accurate positioning of feathers in bird embryos is achieved through a spreading wave of the signal EDA, which triggers dense mesenchyme to begin feather patterning. Flightless birds have a more random feather distribution resulting from loss of interaction of the EDA wave with areas of high cell density.</p>

<p>Feathers are a defining feature of birds. In flighted birds, the feathers are arranged in a highly ordered pattern that arises during embryonic development. Feather rudiments are produced in rows, with these rows appearing one after another in a spreading wave. We show that the formation of highly regular feather patterns depends on this wave of formation, with the row-by-row progression triggered by a spreading wave of the signal Ectodysplasin A (EDA). The EDA signal cooperates with a spreading wave of cellular density to spark the formation of regularly spaced cell aggregates, each of which serves as the precursor to a feather. The EDA wave and the cell density wave are themselves independent of feather formation, as they can be detected travelling across the embryonic skin even when feather formation is impaired. In the flightless birds examined these waves are missing and a highly ordered feather pattern is not produced. However, the manner of wave loss differs in different species, with ostrich embryos lacking the wave of EDA, whereas the emu lacks sufficient skin cells at the appropriate developmental stage to make precisely organised feather rudiments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Feathers evolved before birds but today are their primary diagnostic character. Feathers are arranged in clusters called tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref001">1</xref>], apparent as well-defined feather-bearing areas of skin at specific body sites. Each tract is a contiguous set of feathers initially laid out with a regular spacing between neighbouring feathers. This typically results in every feather within the developing tract having six nearest neighbours arranged about it, the entire pattern forming a lattice of hexagons. Such a hexagonal arrangement of neighbours is the most efficient packing of a 2-dimensional space, arising through the closest possible positioning of elements when each projects a circular inhibitory influence preventing the placing of new elements nearby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The skin is a composite tissue, with its epithelium, the epidermis, attached to the underlying mesenchyme, the dermis. The epithelium arises from the embryonic ectoderm, whereas the dermis has distinct embryonic sources depending on anatomical location. Intercellular junctions fix epidermal cells together to form a sheet, limiting their independent movement, whereas the individual cells of the dermis are free to move through the matrix that they secrete. In the embryonic skin, the initiation of feather formation begins with the condensation of dermal mesenchymal cells beneath an epidermal placode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Both structures are identifiable by the tighter packing of their cells and the alteration of expression of a suite of genes. This combined structure, the feather primordium, then grows into a filament within a follicle, branches internally, and produces a down feather by hatch. In the chicken embryo, the process of laying out the periodic arrangement of feathers begins at precisely stereotyped anatomical sites at embryonic day (E)6.5, laying down a row of feathers as the initiation of each tract. New rows are added progressively in parallel to existing ones such that a wave of feather formation sweeps laterally across the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). These spreading waves terminate before colliding, yielding embryonic tracts containing hexagonal arrays of feather primordia and bare spaces between the tracts. In the chicken, these spaces remain largely unfeathered, but in other species they can become filled with small down feathers.</p>

<p>Prior to the appearance of the dermal mesenchymal cell condensates that represent the rudiment of individual feathers, the prospective feather tracts are identifiable by their high mesenchymal cell density, contrasting with the lower cell density of the future unfeathered skin. Both epithelium and mesenchyme are essential for periodic patterning and feather primordium formation, and this process fails to initiate if either tissue is maintained in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref004">4</xref>]. Separations and recombinations of epithelium and mesenchyme from different skin regions have shown that low-cell-density mesenchyme is not capable of supporting feather development, whereas high-density mesenchyme undergoes feather formation together with an overlying epidermis taken from any embryonic site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The rapid emergence of a regular repeating pattern of feather rudiments has long served as a model for epithelial-mesenchymal self-organisation in development and has attracted much experimental and theoretical effort to define its mechanistic basis. By distorting skin shape and area, Davidson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref011">11</xref>] showed that the positions of feathers are not predetermined during embryonic development and that the underlying patterning mechanism does not rely on a mechanism for counting of feather rows, as the number of rows formed is dependent upon skin area. Among the theories proposed to explain skin pattern formation, one set focuses on the potential for cell behaviour to enact pattern formation directly, particularly through physical means such as traction via construction of and migration along a collagen lattice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref015">15</xref>]. Shyer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref016">16</xref>] have coupled such ideas with molecular events by presenting evidence that local contraction of skin arising from mesenchymal tension initiates feather primordium formation through a mechanically triggered stimulation of epidermal β-catenin activity. In general, these ideas centre on motile cell behaviour directly driving tissue patterning, without recourse to a template of altered cell states with differential gene expression.</p>
<p>An alternative set of theories to explain periodic patterning suggests that interacting intercellular signals first define the pattern that will form and that this pattern template then alters cell behaviour locally to enact morphological change. Such Turing or reaction-diffusion systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref020">20</xref>] rely on patterned gene expression as an intermediate stage in pattern formation, distinct from the direct cell aggregation systems produced by mesenchymal cell movement, traction, or compression. In these template-directed systems, cells attain information on their relative locations using diffusible signals, defining activated and nonactivated regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref021">21</xref>]. This requires that cell movement over the time course of pattern definition be limited so that cells acquire information on their relative position and thus appropriate differentiation route relative to the states of nearby and distant cells, without such information being scrambled through rapid changes in cell location.</p>
<p>Alongside the proposal of these overarching patterning mechanisms, molecular approaches have identified several regulators of feather development. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) class of extracellular signals have been identified as inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref024">24</xref>] and WNT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref025">25</xref>] and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref029">29</xref>] as stimulators of feather primordium formation. The activity of the extracellular signal Ectodysplasin A (EDA) and EDA receptor (EDAR) have been found to be crucial for hair follicle, tooth, and scale formation in fish, lizards, and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref031">31</xref>]. In chicken, targeted experiments found that locally forced stimulation of the EDAR pathway can induce formation of extra feather buds at the margins of expanding tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref032">32</xref>]. No loss-of-function mutation affecting a component of the EDAR pathway has been identified in birds.</p>
<p>More recently, understanding of the genetic basis of natural variation in feather patterning has further supported the defining role of the BMP and FGF pathways in this process. The Naked neck trait, which is characterised by reduced feathering on the body and an absence of feathers on the neck, was found to be caused by a regulatory mutation leading to increased <italic>BMP12</italic> production in the embryonic skin. In this study, simulations of a reaction-diffusion signalling process, with BMPs acting as inhibitor, were sufficient to interpret the experimentally induced pattern changes observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>The scaleless mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref034">34</xref>] lacks feathers and foot scales because of a developmental failure of mesenchymal condensate and epidermal placode formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref039">39</xref>]. The trait is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>FGF20</italic>, a gene expressed strictly in the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref029">29</xref>], agreeing with older literature showing that the defect in scaleless mutant skin lies in the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref036">36</xref>]. This mutant line has been used extensively to study the interactions between embryonic dermis and epidermis, and a wealth of results obtained underscore a critical role for the epithelium in the initiation of feather development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the integration of intercellular signalling, mesenchymal cell movement and density, and mechanical processes in driving feather pattern formation. We identify EDA/EDAR signalling as the critical signal driving the wave of patterning and spreading across and interacting with a gradient of mesenchymal cell density. These waves are lost, though in different ways, in the flightless ostrich and emu, leading to loss of precise hexagonal periodicity of their feather arrangements.</p>

<title>An integrated cell signalling, cell aggregation, and mechanical process breaks symmetry to achieve periodic patterning of feathers</title>
<p>We first aimed to determine the mechanism underlying the local spatial patterning of feathers. Based on genetic evidence for their importance in feather patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref033">33</xref>], we began by investigating the relationship between FGFs and BMPs, and their control of cell aggregation, in developing chicken dorsal skin. To define the role of FGF, we treated skin explant cultures with FGF9 (a member of the FGF9/16/20 subfamily with more stable activity than FGF20) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref043">43</xref>] to assess its effect on cell behaviour and feather patterning. We used embryonic skin from the CAG-GFP transgenic line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref044">44</xref>], which expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in all cells, to reveal feather primordia as sites of high cell density. Skin explants were cultured and imaged after perturbation of FGF signalling. Treatment of explants with FGF protein yielded differing results depending on the protein’s spatial availability. Local exposure via delivery from an FGF-soaked bead resulted in mesenchymal cell aggregation at the FGF source and disruption to the endogenous condensate pattern, whereas ubiquitous exposure through FGF incorporation into the culture medium inhibited all primordium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Inhibition of FGF signalling, via treatment of explants with SU5402, further demonstrated the importance of FGF signalling in condensate formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). These findings suggest that FGF protein acts as a chemoattractant inducing mesenchymal cell clustering at its local sources, but ubiquitous exposure blinds cells to endogenous sources. Consistent with a requirement for cell movement in feather condensate formation, Latrunculin A, an inhibitor of actin polymerisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref045">45</xref>] and thus cell movement, also suppresses feather pattern formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Application of BMP4 or other BMP family members reduced the number of feather primordium rows formed in cultured explants in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s001">S1C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of BMP signalling using LDN193189 resulted in broad areas of skin assuming primordium identity, with loss of the interprimordium interval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s001">S1E Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s001">S1F Fig</xref>). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis detected suppression of <italic>FGF20</italic> expression after 5 hours of BMP4 treatment, whereas inhibition of BMP signalling led to rapid elevation of <italic>FGF20</italic> levels, showing that BMP rapidly negatively regulates <italic>FGF20</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Cotreatment of explants with FGF-soaked beads and ubiquitous BMP4 inhibited endogenous primordium formation but did not prevent cell aggregation at applied FGF protein sources (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s001">S1G Fig</xref>). Thus, BMP signalling inhibits FGF production but does not abolish cell coalescence at FGF sources.</p>
<p>At the core of periodic patterning systems based on intercellular signalling is the phenomenon of self-activation coupled to lateral inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref021">21</xref>]. If FGF and BMP interactions constitute such a system in feather patterning, then FGF signals should stimulate BMP expression. However, we were unable to detect activation of expression of BMP family members (<italic>BMP2</italic>/<italic>4</italic>/<italic>7</italic>) after FGF treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), suggesting that these genes are not regulated directly by FGF stimulation. Thus, considering FGF and BMP interactions, we are unable to construct a simple reaction-diffusion system capable of producing a periodic pattern de novo in chicken skin.</p>
<p>We next explored the potential for the process of local cell condensation itself to induce expression of patterning genes. We observed induction of <italic>BMP4</italic> and <italic>FGF20</italic> expression at sites of cell aggregation induced by applied FGF beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Coadministration of Latrunculin A, to suppress cell movement and thus aggregation, prevented induction of gene expression, demonstrating that cell aggregation, rather than simple exposure to FGF, underlies induction of <italic>BMP4</italic> and <italic>FGF20</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Thus, cell aggregation is both controlled by and stimulates production of these signals required for periodic pattern formation.</p>
<p>Shyer and colleagues recently reported that contraction of embryonic chicken skin, achieved by culturing the skin without a support, is driven by mesenchymal tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref016">16</xref>]. Such contraction causes rapid displacement of β-catenin protein (encoded by the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> gene) from epithelial cell junctions and permits nuclear entry of this protein, mimicking the effect of canonical WNT signalling. We assessed whether tissue contraction as performed by Shyer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref016">16</xref>] might lead to activation of <italic>FGF20</italic> expression by culturing chicken skin either unattached and thus free to contract or pinned to filters and thus under tension, and assessing subsequent changes in <italic>FGF20</italic> expression. At both time points assessed (2 and 4 hours), <italic>FGF20</italic> expression was markedly elevated in the contracted tissue, supporting a role for cell aggregation in rapid activation of <italic>FGF20</italic> production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). No other genes that we analysed (<italic>AXIN2</italic>, <italic>BMP2</italic>, <italic>BMP4</italic>, <italic>EDA</italic>, and <italic>EDAR</italic>) were observed to alter expression in these conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s002">S2B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>These results point to the operation of an integrated reaction-diffusion-taxis system in feather patterning. If such a system underlies patterning, then the appearance of cell aggregates should neither precede nor follow local changes in gene expression, but both features should emerge synchronously. To assess the relative timing of formation of mesenchymal cell aggregates and the activation of feather primordium gene expression, we assessed both cell distribution and gene expression in the same cultured skin samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s001">S1H Fig</xref>). Detection of marker genes that are specific for or excluded from feather primordia (<italic>CTNNB1</italic>, <italic>AXIN2</italic>, <italic>EDAR</italic>, <italic>EDA</italic>, <italic>FGF20</italic>, and <italic>BMP4</italic>) in CAG-GFP embryonic skin revealed that changes in gene expression occurred simultaneously with changes in mesenchymal cell density. Time-lapse imaging of feather pattern formation in the CAG-GFP skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s020">S1 Video</xref>) shows the appearance and resolution of unstable intermediates. In fixed skin specimens, shapes consistent with such unstable intermediate condensations also show overlapping gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s001">S1H Fig</xref>) highlighting the tight temporal coincidence of these two phenomena. This indicates that the formation of the feather periodic pattern does not arise from a strict reaction-diffusion prepatterning system or a pure mesenchymal cell motility-led system but has key features of both. These observations contrast with observations made during mouse primary hair follicle formation, in which periodic foci of gene expression are observed prior to mesenchymal cell condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>From these experimental results, we developed a model of the molecular and cellular interactions involved in feather pattern formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1J</xref>). In this model, local epithelial FGF stimulates mesenchymal cell aggregation. The localised aggregation of mesenchymal cells activates both the expression of <italic>BMP4</italic> and amplifies epithelial <italic>FGF20</italic> production. BMP proteins diffuse and inhibit FGF production through transcriptional suppression of <italic>FGF20</italic>. The regulation of cell aggregation by BMP’s suppression of FGF production, together with the local depletion of mesenchymal cells from the regions surrounding the aggregates, results in the formation of discrete and characteristically spaced feather primordia. Such a structure of interactions, incorporating aspects of both reaction-diffusion and mesenchymal condensation into a hybrid reaction-diffusion-taxis model, is capable of breaking symmetry to produce a periodic pattern de novo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

<title>High feather-pattern fidelity is achieved by patterning in a wave</title>
<p>At the ideal packing density, periodic patterns tend to form a hexagonal lattice. In silico modelling using only the interactions described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g001">Fig 1J</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref047">47</xref>] did not replicate the chicken skin pattern but instead produced a dappled pattern rather than an evenly hexagonal array. Only when this patterning system is driven by a travelling wave of activation are the spatiotemporal progression of sequential row insertion and a uniformly hexagonal patterning outcome observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>We tested in embryonic skin the importance of a wave of patterning in producing a hexagonal arrangement by imposing a transient block on patterning. We noted that inhibition of cell movement, and thus primordium formation, in developing explants via Latrunculin A treatment is reversed once the chemical is removed. E6.5 skin explants cultured with a 24-hour Latrunculin A treatment followed by another 24 hours under control conditions displayed irregular primordium arrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), consistent with the absence of a patterning wave resulting from the temporary block on cell movement.</p>
<p>To quantify pattern fidelity, defined as the tendency of the lattice of feather primordia to attain a hexagonal arrangement, images of cultured explants were masked and individual primordia were used as seeds to construct a Voronoi diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The distribution of number of neighbours of the Voronoi cells gives a measure of the hexagonality of the experimentally observed patterns. Approximately 75% and 50% of the Voronoi cells in control skin samples and Latrunculin A–paused explants, respectively, exhibited six neighbours, demonstrating a decrease in pattern fidelity in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). These results are consistent with the presence of a pattern-triggering wave spreading across the skin, such that when the Latrunculin block is removed, patterning does not reinitiate at the midline but occurs essentially simultaneously across the entire tract.</p>

<title>An expanding wave of EDA interacts with a receding wave of β-catenin/EDAR to trigger <italic>FGF20</italic> expression</title>
<p>The nature of the wave that triggers feather patterning has been elusive since the first descriptions of sequential feather row appearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref050">50</xref>]. Initiation of feather primordia was reported by Shyer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref016">16</xref>] to rely on local tissue compression, which was mimicked experimentally by permitting the skin to contract by culturing without a supporting substrate. We assessed whether such local compaction might serve to initiate patterning of the dorsal tract by preparing skin cultures in which a strip of skin parallel to and displaced from the midline was free of the underlying support. This strip was compressed, while the remainder of the skin, including the midline, was pinned taut to a filter to prevent generalised compression. In this condition, we observed an unaltered initiation site and timing of patterning, starting as normal at the midline and expanding symmetrically across the control and experimentally compressed sides of skin at the same rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This indicates that feather pattern initiation and its spread from the midline does not rely on heterogeneities in tissue compression.</p>
<p>Based on the mechanistic model defined above, the first step of feather primordium formation is a mild chemotaxis to a source of FGF. We thus reasoned that the key activity of the pattern-triggering wave should be capable of stimulating <italic>FGF20</italic> production, which is often detected in a faint streak ahead of and parallel to the most recently formed feather rows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). The expression or activity of the triggering factor should also expand across the skin coincident with the spread of the feather patterning process. Thus, we began by identifying molecules able to induce <italic>FGF20</italic> expression. Canonical WNT/β-catenin activation and EDA/EDAR signalling have been reported to induce <italic>FGF20</italic> expression in mouse skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref051">51</xref>]. We found that stimulation of each of these pathways, with CHIR99021 or recombinant chicken EDA protein (Fc-chEDA1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref052">52</xref>] respectively, rapidly induced <italic>FGF20</italic> expression in embryonic chicken skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). We also found that stimulation of WNT/β-catenin activity induced <italic>EDAR</italic> expression in cultured skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). In situ hybridisation revealed that <italic>EDA</italic> is expressed as an expanding wave in dorsal skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In contrast, <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>EDAR</italic> expression are first present in a block of skin defining the presumptive tract, and their expression is then maintained in the feather primordia but lost from the interprimordium space as feather rows are laid down. Thus, in the skin, there is a moving front of loss of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>EDAR</italic> expression, starting at the midline and receding towards both sides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref039">39</xref>], as the <italic>EDA</italic> expression wave advances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Spreading of <italic>EDA</italic> expression coincident with patterning is also observed in the other anatomical tracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). Expansion of <italic>EDA</italic> expression and regression of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> expression across the skin is observed in <italic>FGF20</italic><sup><italic>sc/sc</italic></sup> mutant embryos, which define tracts at the molecular level but fail to undergo subsequent specification of feather primordia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref039">39</xref>]. This demonstrates that neither FGF20 function nor primordium formation is required for the propagation of these waves. Simultaneous detection of <italic>EDA</italic> and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> by double whole-mount in situ hybridisation shows that primordium formation is closely associated with the leading edge of <italic>EDA</italic> expression and the lagging edge of the regressing <italic>CTNNB1</italic> wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

<title>The EDA wave triggers periodic pattern formation and controls tract expansion</title>
<p>Having shown that a wave of EDA induces <italic>FGF20</italic> expression and is coincident with the onset of periodic patterning, we assessed the functional effects of EDA on feather primordium formation. Specifically, we predicted that if EDA is the limiting factor for triggering pattern formation, then generalised application of EDA should expand the periodically patterned region. Conversely, suppression of endogenous EDA function should restrict pattern expansion. We tested this by treating skin explants with modulators of EDA/EDAR signalling and measuring the width of the periodically patterned region. Ubiquitous stimulation of EDA/EDAR signalling, using recombinant EDA-A1 for 24 hours, almost doubled the width of <italic>FGF20</italic> patterned skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that limited EDA availability normally restricts pattern formation. The converse experiment, that of inhibiting EDA/EDAR signalling with the anti-EDA function–blocking antibody Ecto-D2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref052">52</xref>], narrowed the patterned area compared to control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3G</xref>), further supporting a key role for endogenous EDA in defining patterning wave expansion. Suppression of BMP signalling, which is required for periodic patterning, did not produce such an effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), demonstrating that activation of feather patterning potential—rather than simple suppression of BMP activity—is required to drive the advance of the primordium wave.</p>
<p>To test the role of the EDA wave on feather wave progression in an intact and growing embryo, we introduced the blocking antibody Ecto-D2 into the circulation of E5.5 chicken embryos and continued incubation to day E8.5. Such systemic treatment with Ecto-D2 is capable in mouse of inducing an ectodermal dysplasia phenotype that matches that of <italic>EDA</italic> gene mutation in exposed embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref052">52</xref>]. In chicken embryos, this blockade of EDA/EDAR signalling permitted feather patterning but restricted the width of the feather pattern in all tracts as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), agreeing with the results from skin culture experiments. This treatment also abolished the formation of scleral papillae of the eye, similar to but more severe than the effect of the <italic>FGF20</italic><sup><italic>sc</italic></sup> mutation on these structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). The feather primordia generated under conditions of EDA suppression failed to develop fully, yielding largely naked skin by incubation days E11.5 and E13.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s008">S8A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s008">S8B Fig</xref>) and indicating an ongoing need for EDA/EDAR signalling during feather outgrowth. Although placodes and condensates are formed in conditions of EDA suppression, at E8.5 their expression of <italic>FGF20</italic> is not polarised normally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s008">S8C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s008">S8D Fig</xref>), and this may lead to a failure of their morphogenesis and disappearance over the following days.

<title>A cell density wave precedes the EDA wave to produce the feather patterning field</title>
<p>These findings show that EDA availability controls the spatiotemporal wave of periodic patterning in avian skin but that this signal is neither absolutely necessary nor absolutely sufficient for this process. Thus, a second factor, independent of EDA, must be both limiting for and sufficient to initiate periodic patterning. Based on the long-recognised importance of cell density in feather development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref010">10</xref>], we considered mesenchymal cell density as a candidate for this second factor limiting competence to undergo periodic patterning. To characterise mesenchymal cell density at different stages of skin development, we counted cells on sectioned embryos, finding a medial-lateral decreasing gradient of cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Quantification of cell density across the presumptive tracts of developing <italic>FGF20</italic><sup><italic>sc/sc</italic></sup> embryos lacking mesenchymal condensates, and so used to avoid the distortion of mesenchymal distribution by cell recruitment to forming condensates, shows that this medial-high cell density gradient is maintained throughout the period of patterning, even as total mesenchymal cell density increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Thus, the EDA wave travels across a dynamic gradient of mesenchymal cell density as it triggers feather formation.</p>

<p>To trace the cell density dynamics involved in the emergence of periodic pattern on the dorsal tract, we performed time-lapse imaging of cultured embryonic skin from the CAG-GFP transgenic line. Time-lapse imaging of skin begun with tissue collected at E6.5 shows a stripe of high cell density along the dorsal midline. Over the following 70 hours, cells rearrange to produce an ordered periodic pattern with the breaking up of this stripe into a row of spots, followed by bilateral additions of pairs of rows of feather primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). During this process, extensive changes in cell density and dynamic relocation of cell aggregates are apparent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s020">S1 Video</xref>).</p>
<p>To represent cell density across the skin over time in a 2-dimensional form, we plotted GFP signal intensity as a kymograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Each frame from the time-lapse series is depicted as a single line, with red indicating high and blue indicating low cell density. This depiction compresses the 2-dimensional information of each original frame into a line that depicts cell density relative to the left-right axis of the original image, with the compression removing anterior-posterior information. The y-axis on the kymograph is produced by stacking these frames to show the progression of cell density over time. This plot shows the initial midline stripe of high cell density, soon followed by the emergence of two broad lateral regions of high cell density between 10 and 25 hours, after which the addition of the first lateral feather primordium rows occurs from 25 hours. Progressive addition of rows is apparent as the emergence of additional vertical red stripes, though ongoing cell depletion from interprimordium intervals leads to a reduction in overall fluorescence for the most mature (i.e., central) rows.</p>
<p>To track general cell motility, we plotted a velocity kymograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g004">Fig 4E</xref>) showing for each pair of frames compressed along their y-axes the change in cell density (i.e., the change in GFP signal intensity) occurring across the time course of imaging, with blue indicating leftward movement and red indicating rightward movement. Thus, meeting points of red and blue, where red is to the left of blue, show the sites of cell accumulation. This plot shows a generalised movement of cells towards the midline at early stages of patterning, even before the first periodic condensates become apparent there. This widespread midline movement is followed by progressively more lateral local clustering at later stages to form the distinct feather rows. We used streamlines calculated from a particle image velocimetry (PIV)-based velocity field averaged over 10 consecutive frames to better represent cell behaviours during specific phases of dorsal tract patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g004">Fig 4F</xref>), here maintaining the x-axis (left-right) and y-axis (anterior-posterior) of the original skin images. This shows the initial generalised flow of cells towards the midline (time 5:10–6:50), followed by periodic patterning of condensates on the midline (11:50–13:30) and then cell condensation laterally to form the next rows of feather condensates (36:50–38:30).</p>
<p>To assess the extent to which these observations reflect cellular events specifically in the mesenchymal component of the skin, we visualised mesenchymal cells by transplanting somites from the newly developed tdTomato (TPZ) transgenic line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s040">S1 Supporting Methods</xref>) into a CAG-GFP host embryo. Four days after somite transplantation, we collected the chimeric skin at day E6.5 for time-lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s010">S10A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s010">S10B Fig</xref>). In this condition, the somite derivatives, which are entirely mesenchymal in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref055">55</xref>], will on one side of the embryo produce red fluorescent signal, whereas the host cells, including the overlying ectoderm, will be green. Computational analyses of time-lapse imaging of skin explants prepared from host-GFP/mesenchyme graft–tdTomato chimeras show the same cell behaviours as observed in entirely CAG-GFP skin, demonstrating that the key behaviours observed arise from mesenchymal cell dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s010">S10C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s021">S2 Video</xref>). Together, these investigations show that the process of dorsal tract patterning involves an initial movement of mesenchymal cells towards the midline, followed by laterally expanding dense dermis and rapid cell density changes to generate a periodic condensate array.</p>

<p>We assessed the mesenchymal cell density at which patterning occurs in different EDA signalling regimens by making incisions directly adjacent to the <italic>FGF20-</italic>defined margin of the patterned region of EDA modulated explants and quantifying the mesenchymal cell density within the first 100 μm lateral to the pattern margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Application of soluble EDA, which led to expansion of the patterned region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), permitted patterning at a lower mesenchymal cell density than normal (at the lateral pattern margins 66 cells/100 μm versus 49 cells/100 μm after 24 hours in culture) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Conversely, suppression of EDA function permitted patterning after 48 hours in culture only where a density of 98 cells/100 μm was attained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), restricting patterning to a narrow strip at the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Thus, EDA signalling lowers the mesenchymal cell density at which the dermis becomes permissive to periodic pattern formation.</p>
<p>To test whether EDA signalling sets the critical mesenchymal cell density quorum independently of skin location, we assessed the effects of combined modulation of both cell density and EDA function. As before, suppression of either cell proliferation or of EDA function individually reduced the width of the patterned region of the skin. Combined suppression of cell density and EDA function yielded a still greater reduction of the periodically patterned region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g005">Fig 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g005">Fig 5F</xref>), showing that a high cell density, rather than any other means of circumventing EDA activity, is required for medial skin patterning in conditions of EDA suppression. Simulations of the patterning process involving a priming wave, representing EDA, and including a mesenchymal cell density gradient show that such behaviour is expected of the network upon suppression of cell density, suppression of EDA, or the enhanced effect of suppressing both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g005">Fig 5G</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s041">S2 Supporting Methods</xref>). Thus, mesenchymal cell density has a defining effect on determining whether periodic patterning occurs or not, with EDA setting the minimum density of mesenchymal cells required to undergo pattern formation.</p>

<title>Continual movement of individual mesenchymal cells occurs in loose and dense dermis prior to and during condensate formation</title>
<p>Having defined a requirement for a mesenchymal quorum in feather patterning and its relationship to EDA, we assessed cell behaviour in dense and loose dermis. We aimed to determine the mode of cell accumulation at condensates and whether differences in cell behaviour might account for the requirement for a minimal mesenchymal density to initiate periodic patterning. To track single cells and quantify their behaviour, we employed embryos of the Chameleon transgenic chicken line. This line carries an array of fluorescent protein encoding genes, one of which is selected for expression upon Cre-mediated recombination at the transgene locus ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref056">56</xref>] and Saunders and colleagues in preparation). We treated cultured Chameleon transgenic skin with a cell-permeable TAT-Cre to sparsely label cells, applying the reagent to the mesenchymal side of the dissected skin. This results in stochastic labelling of scattered cells with different colours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).

<p>We collected time-lapse confocal images of cells in such sparsely labelled skin during patterning in culture, permitting the tracking of individual cells. We observed that cells in all parts of the skin move, with cells in the epidermis moving in a highly coherent manner, as predicted based on their physical attachment to one another in a sheet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s022">S3 Video</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s012">S12A Fig</xref>). We analysed cell behaviour by confocal layer, finding that the more superficial layers, which are epithelial, undergo coordinated cell movement, whereas the deeper layers of mesenchyme have cells undergoing random and uncoordinated movement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s012">S12A Fig</xref>). However, we detected very little movement upward or downward at any skin depth, with most cells remaining in the same confocal layer throughout and thus moving in parallel with the plane of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s012">S12B Fig</xref>). The net movement for individual mesenchymal cells over the course of imaging occurs almost entirely towards the midline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s012">S12C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>By measuring individual mesenchymal cell behaviours over the entire time course of imaging, we found that cells in dense and loose dermis move, though somewhat more rapidly in the lateral, loose dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g006">Fig 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s023">S4 Video</xref>). This may result from freer movement of cells where there are fewer cell–cell interactions. Thus, the failure of patterning in loose dermis is not a result of impaired cell movement, nor is it due to an inability to respond to FGF sources, as FGF beads are readily capable of inducing cell aggregation in both dense and loose dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). By tracking cells specifically prior to and during the formation of condensates, we observe that before the formation of a new primordium row, cells move medially; but to form the condensates themselves, movement is predominantly along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Throughout this process, there is remarkably constant migration speed and straightness (persistence), though the midline-directed cell movement occurring before condensate formation displays the greatest persistence of all classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s013">S13A and S13B Fig</xref>). Individual condensates are thus formed by the FGF-guided accretion of cells that move constantly with approximately the same velocity and persistence.</p>
<p>The skin’s mesenchymal cells display extensive and dynamic projections when they are both outside and within condensates, and this morphology does not differ between low- and high- cell-density mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s013">S13C Fig</xref>). We used the MacGreen reporter line, which expresses GFP specifically in macrophages under control of <italic>CSF1R</italic> regulatory elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref060">60</xref>], to detect macrophages in embryonic chicken skin. These cells are distinct from other mesenchymal cells in size of cell body and characteristics of the projections, confirming that we are not inadvertently tracking this cell population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s013">S13D Fig</xref>). Together, this approach shows that in morphology and movement, mesenchymal cells in dense and loose regions display very similar observable behaviours. Thus, the high-cell-density dependence for feather development more likely rests on a need for rapid mesenchymal cell condensation and stabilisation of <italic>FGF20</italic> expression than on distinct individual cell phenotypes in dense and loose mesenchyme.</p>

<title>Loss of feather patterning waves in flightless birds</title>
<p>We find that the skin of chicken, duck, ostrich, and emu embryos have pronounced differences in their feather arrangements. The two flighted species, chicken (of which wild ancestors and light domestic breeds can fly, though this ability is lost in some breeds because of increased body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref061">61</xref>]) and duck, display a highly regular feather arrangement, whereas the two flightless species have a much less regular pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Voronoi tessellation analysis shows that flightless species have a pattern of lower hexagonality than the flighted species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Whereas the flighted species form their feather pattern through a medial-lateral travelling wave, in the flightless ostrich and emu sequential feather primordium formation is absent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s014">S14 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Prior to patterning, both flighted and flightless (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s014">S14 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s015">S15 Fig</xref>) species define the presumptive dorsal tracts, denoted by <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>EDA</italic> expression, but the flightless species lack the spreading wave of <italic>EDA</italic> expression during the period of feather patterning. Rather than patterning in a wave, the ostrich embryonic skin undergoes sporadic patterning within the <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-defined dorsal tract in regions where mesenchymal cells attain a high density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s014">S14A Fig</xref>). This ultimately produces a set of tracts that can be mapped onto those present in the chicken anatomy, though with some fusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s014">S14A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s016">S16 Fig</xref>). Indeed, the flighted Chilean tinamou (<italic>Nothoprocta perdicaria</italic>), a ratite related to ostrich and more closely to emu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref063">63</xref>], has tracts in the same arrangement as chicken, indicating that this arrangement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s017">S17 Fig</xref>) is ancestral to all extant birds. In the emu, in contrast, the first signs of feather formation occur late in development, at E17, after loss of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> expression from the presumptive tract. These feather primordia appear outside the characteristic tract locations, beginning instead on the flanks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), which are prominent intertract regions in chicken and ostrich. Sequential double in situ hybridisation to detect <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>EDA</italic> in emu embryos shows the feather primordia forming specifically in <italic>EDA</italic>-negative skin regions, lateral to the presumptive dorsal tract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s018">S18A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess whether the absence of feather formation in the emu presumptive dorsal tract is of mesenchymal or epithelial origin, we performed reciprocal epidermal-dermal recombinations between chicken and emu embryonic skin. A combination of chicken epidermis with emu dermis did not produce feather primordia. In the reciprocal recombination, however, emu epidermis can undergo rapid primordium formation in conjunction with chicken dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Use of CAG-GFP transgenic chicken skin allowed tracking of the chicken and emu components of the skin composites in sectioned tissue, confirming the emu origin of epidermis undergoing feather formation when combined with chicken tract dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Therefore, the evolutionary loss of emu feather tract patterning in the dorsal skin is a result of a mesenchymal defect, with the emu epidermis being competent to participate in feather development.</p>

<p>To determine the nature of the mesenchymal defect that abolishes tract patterning in emu, we compared the status of the developing dorsal mesenchyme in chicken and emu embryos. TWIST1/2 staining in developing chicken and emu dorsal skin revealed a profound delay in the densification of the dermis in the presumptive emu tract compared to chicken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g008">Fig 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s018">S18B Fig</xref>). Quantification of mesenchymal cell density at these stages shows that the population of the dorsal skin with mesenchyme is limited in emu embryos, which develop a dermis displaying a uniformly low mesenchymal cell density when compared to chicken embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g008">Fig 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). In earlier-stage embryos, cell proliferation was observed in the dermomyotomal lip of both Hamburger Hamilton stage (HH)21 chicken and emu embryos, as determined by immunodetection of phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s018">S18C Fig</xref>), suggesting that delayed dermis densification in emu is not due to the lack of production of mesenchymal cell progenitors but rather due to a failure of cell ingression towards the dorsal midline during emu development. These observations suggest that in emu, the failure to develop a sufficient mesenchymal density at the appropriate time in development underlies the failure of tract patterning by desynchronising the cellular and molecular influences required to act coordinately in the generation of a patterned feather array.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of theoretical mechanisms to explain the spontaneous emergence of periodicity in biological systems have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref064">64</xref>]. The operation of Turing or reaction-diffusion systems based only on intercellular signalling has been supported with several lines of experimental evidence and argument in diverse organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref066">66</xref>]. In mammalian skin, Glover and colleagues provided evidence that a pure reaction-diffusion system, with no reliance on cell movement, normally patterns the primary hair follicles. However, under conditions of altered FGF and BMP signalling, this mechanism can be replaced by a pure mesenchymal cell self-organisation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref046">46</xref>]. Our present work uncovers a distinct process normally operating in avian skin, in which elements of both reaction-diffusion and cell movement–based patterning systems are integrated into a unified periodicity-generating mechanism.</p>
<p>This feather periodic patterning system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g009">Fig 9</xref>) relies on epithelial FGF to attract mesenchymal cells to form an aggregate, explaining why the absence of <italic>FGF20</italic> in the scaleless mutant leads to a failure of feather primordium formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref029">29</xref>] and demonstrating a defining role for the epidermis in avian skin patterning. The resulting focal clustering of mesenchymal cells reinforces and intensifies epithelial <italic>FGF20</italic> expression, likely through a mechanical triggering of epidermal β-catenin activity via local epidermal compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref016">16</xref>]. This form of positive feedback on FGF20 represents an integration point between Turing/reaction-diffusion and mechanical systems in biological pattern formation, a coupling shown in broad terms to yield robust periodic patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref067">67</xref>]. Aggregation of cells is coupled with production of BMP by the mesenchymal condensate, inhibiting <italic>FGF20</italic> production and limiting condensate expansion. Mesenchymal cells move continually, and our observations of this process do not support a suggestion of preferred migration along a sparse lattice of collagen fibres to guide mesenchymal condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref068">68</xref>].</p>

<p>(A) A competent epidermis overlies a mesenchyme displaying high mesenchymal cell density on the midline (dense dermis) and gradually decreasing to the sides (loose dermis). (B) A travelling wave of EDA signalling stimulates the epidermal production of FGF20, which induces chemotaxis of mesenchymal cells and thus formation of a dermal condensate. As the condensate forms, <italic>FGF20</italic> expression is further stimulated, thereby reinforcing production of this attractant. The clustering of cells also stimulates the production and secretion of BMP to inhibit <italic>FGF20</italic> production, limiting the size of the incipient primordium and preventing fusions between neighbouring primordia. Meanwhile, the previously loose dermis increases in density to reach the threshold density that permits condensate formation. (C) As the EDA signalling wave sweeps across the skin, the reaction-diffusion-taxis system is repeated until the wave terminates at the edge of the tracts.

<p>This set of interactions is sufficient to break symmetry and produce a periodic pattern only if mesenchymal cells attain a critical density. The requirement for initially weak and ephemeral sources of FGF20 to be sustained and amplified by successful recruitment of mesenchymal cells can explain the cell-density dependence of feather development, without a need for any distinct individual cellular phenotype in dense compared to loose mesenchyme. Such a density effect emerging from a population of cells enacting the same individual behaviours should be seen as distinct from quorum sensing, in which cells sense their collective density and alter their state accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref069">69</xref>]. Rather, although we cannot rule out the possible existence of cell phenotypic differences between individual cells in dense and loose mesenchyme, we do not observe such differences, and they may not need to be invoked to understand the transition from loose dermis to a stable array of cell condensates. Events that could be characterised as community effects or quorum sensing may occur later in feather development, however, as development of each condensate progresses and the cells within alter their fate. The formation of condensates in our model is fundamentally determined through biased cell movement in a mesenchymal cell population with a density above a critical threshold. This criticality is a trait shared with another recent model, driven by cell adhesion, that was proposed for chondrogenesis during avian limb patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref070">70</xref>].</p>
<p>The extracellular signal EDA serves to trigger periodic patterning by lowering the threshold of mesenchymal density required for condensate formation. This is achieved through induction of a transient stripe of FGF20 production where the advancing EDA wave meets the receding β-catenin/EDAR wave. This initially low FGF20 induction serves to begin mesenchymal cell aggregation along the stripe, initiating the cycle of mesenchymal aggregation, which leads to increased epidermal <italic>FGF20</italic> expression and in turn to enhanced mesenchymal attraction. As this process begins, it immediately becomes influenced by the periodic patterning rules defined above and by the effects of the preceding feather primordium row’s inhibition through BMP production and local cell depletion. Together, these influences define the location of condensates in each new row based on the inhibitory template of the previous one, ensuring that the condensates in each new row are placed out of register with the previous row. Repeated iterations of this process produce a hexagonally patterned array, though this may be altered by later growth. Certain aspects of tooth development show parallels to this process of feather formation. In the mouse embryo, the teeth form in sequence along the jaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref071">71</xref>], similar to the sequential formation of feathers along the midline row. A relationship between the primary row of teeth and successive replacement rows is observed in the fish dentition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref072">72</xref>]. However, the ongoing formation of these replacement teeth in fish appears to be regulated locally rather than through general activation of an entire patterning field by morphogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref073">73</xref>], as we report in the avian skin. The position of successive teeth is thus associated with the position of the preceding tooth and its final placement not entirely dictated by inhibitory influences.</p>
<p>The spatiotemporal role of EDA in defining the zone in which periodic patterning may initiate is distinct from its described role in other vertebrates. Spontaneous mutations in genes encoding EDA pathway components are known in a range of species of mammals, fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref030">30</xref>], and in a lizard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref031">31</xref>]. In each of these species, EDA activity has been shown to be required for hair or scale development but not for patterning in a wave. Thus, in birds, EDA is recast to a spatiotemporal role that it does not appear to play in other vertebrates, to define when and where patterning should occur in a quasi-1-dimensional manner. The loss of an EDA wave in the ostrich embryo leads to approximately 2-dimensional patterning and a reduction in the hexagonal packing of feathers. The correlation between a functional capacity for flight and the anatomical regularity of feather arrangement that we identify suggests that a highly regular feather pattern is of benefit in flight, perhaps related to aerodynamic efficiency or increased bilateral symmetry. In flightless birds, then, relaxed selection on the arrangement of the plumage has led to the loss of the cellular and molecular waves required for such high-fidelity pattern formation. In the emu, the EDA wave’s guidance of patterning is also lost, but the presumptive feather tracts are still defined molecularly by expression of <italic>EDA</italic> and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g007">Fig 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s014">S14B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). However, a remarkably low mesenchymal cell density in emu occurs because of a lack of dermatome-derived cell movement towards the midline, resulting in failure of tract patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g008">Fig 8C, 8D, 8E and 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s014">S14B Fig</xref>). The late-arising feathers in the emu embryo are smaller than the tract feather primordia of other species, being instead of the same size as the late-forming duck secondary down feathers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s019">S19 Fig</xref>), and first emerge well outside the presumptive tracts.</p>
<p>As the flighted tinamou has the same tract layout as chicken, this basic arrangement of tracts is likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of all living birds. Modifications to this specific layout are present in different species, typically related to the width of the tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref074">74</xref>], though tract fusion occurs in some species, such as the ostriches reported here. That ostrich and emu have lost the high degree of order of their feather arrangement through different developmental routes agrees with phylogenetic studies indicating that these species have undergone losses of flight independently of one another, rather than from a flightless common ancestor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000132.ref063">63</xref>]. Thus, either the cellular or the molecular aspects of the feather waves can be altered in the course of evolutionary history, to similar ends.</p>
<p>The structure of the skin, that of a uniform epithelial sheet interacting with underlying mesenchyme of significantly varying cell density, is common to many vertebrate organs. Such epithelial-mesenchymal organs—including the gut, kidney, lung, mammary and salivary glands, and parts of the skeleton during its development—tend to have repeating anatomical units, whether containing discrete elements such as intestinal villi or as a coherent periodic structure such as the epithelial tree of lung or kidney. This composite tissue structure lends itself to either the operation of Turing/reaction-diffusion mechanisms, dominated by relatively stationary epithelial cells, or to cell motility–driven organisation dominated by the mesenchyme. In avian skin, we report a hybrid of these conceptual systems, a reaction-diffusion-taxis mechanism integrated with mechanical processes. These local patterning interactions are triggered within the broad field of the skin by the passing of a travelling EDA wave, imposing the construction of a precise hexagonal lattice of feather primordia.</p>

<title>Explant compression culture</title>
<p>Rectangular segments (1 mm wide) were excised from triangular nitrocellulose filters (Millipore), leaving a thin strip of filter to connect the two parts. Dissected E6.5 TPZ dorsal skin explants were mounted to these prepared filters with the dorsal midline directly parallel to the excised section of the filter. Skin was placed across the excised gap and cultured for 2 hours under standard conditions to allow for the adherence of the explant to the filter. A cut was then made perpendicular to the excised section of the filter on the “free-floating” side of the culture (explant is untouched by the cut), separating the two parts of the filter. The “free floating” side of the culture was then manually compressed by narrowing the filter-excised gap.

<title>Individual cell tracking</title>
<p>Dorsal skin explants were prepared from transgenic Chameleon E6 chicken embryos and placed onto a nitrocellulose filter. TAT-CRE (62.5 units; Millipore) diluted in phenol red–free DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) to a final volume of 100 μl was delivered under the dermis. Explants were cultured in a 6-well plate containing 500 μl of phenol red–free medium supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 2 hours at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Explants were submerged in a total of 2 ml of supplemented phenol red–free medium and cultured for 20 hours. Recombination was confirmed via fluorescence microscopy prior to time-lapse confocal imaging using the Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope. Images were taken every 15 minutes over a period of 24 hours using the red and green channels. Data were processed using ZenBlue2012 software (Zeiss) followed by cell-tracking analysis (Brownian motion) using IMARIS software.</p>
<p>Automatic cell tracking was performed using Fiji. The cell diameters were estimated for each slice and each signal (green, red) separately. For preprocessing, the images were converted to 8-bit. Salt-and-pepper noise was removed with a median filter (3-pixel kernel). Cell motion analysis was performed for each slice and each signal separately. For each analysis, an image sequence with a spot and track overlay (fast backward tracks and uniform colouring) was saved. Exported files from TrackMate include track and spot statistics. The statistics for the two processed channels of each slice were combined. For time points with missing spots, the positions were interpolated using the mean of the preceding and following time point.</p>
<p>To measure individual cell behaviour specifically in loose dermis or primordium rows before and during condensate formation, manual cell tracking was performed using the Manual Tracking tool in the Fiji distribution version of ImageJ. Maximum-intensity Z-projection of time-lapse images of only the uppermost dermal layer from TAT-Cre-induced Chameleon skin explants were cropped and separated into two regions, loose dermis and primordium row–forming (225-μm-wide blocks). The first row lateral to the primary midline row was designated the row-forming region, whereas loose dermis was the skin region that never experienced condensate formation throughout the imaging period (determined from the Nuclear Blue signal at the end of the time lapse). Three independent skin samples were analysed. Tracking periods were 10 hours before and during primordium formation. Only cells that were tracked for the full duration of each period were included in the analysis.</p>

The dermis from one species was placed onto a nitrocellulose filter, and the epidermis from the other species was stretched across the dermis and pinned to the filter. Recombinants were cultured in a 6-well plate with 500 μl of standard medium for 2 hours at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and then submerged in a total of 2.5 ml of standard medium and cultured for a maximum of 6 days.

<p>For determination of dermal cell density threshold permissive to feather patterning, <italic>FGF20</italic> expression was detected in control, Fc-chEDA1-treated, and Ecto-D2-treated skin explants by in situ hybridisation. An incision was made on each explant at the margin of the <italic>FGF20</italic>-expressing regions of the dorsal tract using a razor blade. Samples were processed for paraffin sectioning, and sections were dewaxed in xylene followed by rehydration through an ethanol series into water.

<title>Pattern analyses</title>
<p>Measurements of the width of the patterning region were performed on cultured skin explants or whole-mount embryos that were subjected to in situ hybridisation for <italic>FGF20</italic> detection. The pattern-generating region of the dorsal tract on the explants was defined by <italic>FGF20</italic> expression. Three measurements of the width of the <italic>FGF20</italic> pattern were made for each skin and averaged, with a minimum of three skins per treatment.</p>
<p>For pattern fidelity analysis, explant or whole-mount samples processed for <italic>CTNNB1</italic> detection through in situ hybridisation were imaged. Primordia from the dorsal tracts were outlined and given a binary mask, for which a 1 indicated the location of the primordium and a 0 indicated the interprimordium region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The centroid of each primordium was then extracted, and a Voronoi diagram was constructed from the point cloud data. The Voronoi diagram partitions the plane into regions based on the distance to the primordium centroids. Specifically, a primordium’s defined region consists of all spatial points closer to its centroid than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram has the property that the boundary cells are anomalous, with infinite (or exceedingly large) area. In order to remove such artefacts, we removed the most external primordium centroids from consideration within the data until the area of all Voronoi cells was less than three standard deviations from the mean. In practice, this eliminated only the anomalous cells. Once the appropriate cells had been chosen, statistics were autonomously extracted regarding the number of nearest neighbours of each primordium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000132.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000132.s017">S17B Fig</xref>). Specifically, if the primordia were perfectly aligned on a (nonsquare) grid, each placode would have six neighbours (and four neighbours in the singular case of a square grid). Thus, the spread and range away from six neighbours illustrates the variability in the pattern fidelity. Namely, a higher percentage of primordia with six neighbours implies a more regular placode pattern.</p>

<title>Skin compression does not initiate the wave of feather primordium formation.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic of experimental approach. Skin explants were placed with the midline parallel to the edge of a gap in the underlying filter support. This creates a culture condition in which slightly more than one-half of the skin is attached to a filter substrate, and the remainder of the presumptive tract is unattached. (B) E6.5 skin explants prepared from tdTomato transgenic chicken embryos cultured for 2 hours over nitrocellulose filters with an excised section (dotted white line). (B’) After 2 hours in culture, the explant was compressed by physical manipulation of the nitrocellulose filter (indicated by the change of shape in the dotted white line). (C) Over 48 hours of observation, the endogenous travelling wave of primordium formation, initiating at the midline, sweeps symmetrically across both compressed and taut sides of the skin. Scale bar: 1 mm. E, embryonic day.</p>
