<title>Characteristics of DIRS-1 Mediated Knock-Downs</title>
<p>We have previously shown that the most abundant <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> retroelement DIRS-1 is suppressed by RNAi mechanisms. Here we provide evidence that both inverted terminal repeats have strong promoter activity and that bidirectional expression apparently generates a substrate for Dicer. A cassette containing the inverted terminal repeats and a fragment of a gene of interest was sufficient to activate the RNAi response, resulting in the generation of ~21 nt siRNAs, a reduction of mRNA and protein expression of the respective endogene. Surprisingly, no transitivity was observed on the endogene. This was in contrast to previous observations, where endogenous siRNAs caused spreading on an artificial transgene. Knock-down was successful on seven target genes that we examined. In three cases a phenotypic analysis proved the efficiency of the approach. One of the target genes was apparently essential because no knock-out could be obtained; the RNAi mediated knock-down, however, resulted in a very slow growing culture indicating a still viable reduction of gene expression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Advantages of the DIRS-1–RNAi System</title>
<p>The knock-down system required a short DNA fragment (~400 bp) of the target gene as an initial trigger. Further siRNAs were generated by RdRPs since we have shown some siRNAs with a 5’-triphosphate group. Extrachromosomal vectors facilitate the procedure and allowed for molecular and phenotypic analysis within one week. The system provides an efficient and rapid method to reduce protein levels including those of essential genes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> is a model organism to study diverse aspects of cell biology, developmental biology, signal transduction and gene expression. A major advantage is the relatively easy tractability of the organism for genetic manipulations.</p>
<p>DIRS–1 represents the most abundant retrotransposable element in the model organism <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It belongs to the group of tyrosine recombinase (YR)-encoding elements that use a YR instead of an integrase for integration into the host genome. This group is characterized by a unique structure composed of three open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by inverted terminal repeats (ITR). ORF1 encodes a putative GAG protein while the second ORF contains the YR. ORF3 is composed of a reverse transcriptase (RT), a RNase H (RH), and a methyltransferase domain (MT) [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
<p>The ITRs, are not absolutely identical and the right ITRs contain a 27 bp extension [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. ITRs usually bear numerous functions for gene expression: enhancer motifs, promoter activity, transcription initiation sites, transcription terminator, and polyadenylation signal [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The 5`-ITR acts as an RNA Polymerase II promoter while the 3`-ITR harbours a transcription termination site and a polyadenylation signal (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]).</p>
<p>However, the ITRs of the DIRS–1 retroelement are believed to serve as promoters in both directions, the left ITR for sense transcription and the right ITR for full length antisense transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] as well as for the previously reported stress induced antisense transcript E1 [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Bidirectional transcription may lead to the formation of a duplex RNA which could be the origin of endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNA) to silence the retrotransposon DIRS–1 on the posttranscriptional level. This is supported by the fact that most siRNAs in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> are derived from DIRS–1 [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and that the loss of DIRS–1 siRNAs results in the accumulation of DIRS–1 transcripts and the expression of DIRS–1 encoded proteins [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>We here investigated if bidirectional transcription from the ITRs was sufficient to mediate an RNAi response and could eventually be used for gene knock-downs.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to generate knock-out mutants in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> by homologous recombination [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, there are numerous essential genes like protein kinases (e.g. casK), cofilins (cofA) or WASP proteins (wasA) for which knock-outs could not be obtained because of their lethal phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, the laboratory strains AX3 and AX4 carry a large duplication on chromosome 2 [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and other duplications of 15 kb and more have been reported in the genome [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Disruptions of genes in these regions are therefore not easy to obtain. Furthermore, knock-out attempts have been reported to sometimes result in a knocked-out copy and a duplicated intact copy of the gene [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, gene deletions or disruptions are sometimes laborious.</p>
<p>Knock-down strategies that may circumvent these problems have previously been reported using antisense [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or hairpin constructs [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Driving sense and antisense RNA from opposing promoters has also been employed with variable and mostly unsatisfactory results. For unknown reasons, knock-downs show different efficiency depending on the target and the strategy. Therefore multiple approaches may be required to obtain successful silencing. Since the retrotransposon DIRS–1 was so efficiently silenced <italic>in vivo</italic> by RNAi we developed an easy to use knock-down system based on the features of DIRS–1. This system was functional for all the genes we have tested.</p>

As shown in <xref rid="pone.0131271.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> this was indeed the case: the mRNA levels were strongly reduced and GFP expression was barely detectable in wild type cells (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B and 2E</xref>).

<p>We recently demonstrated that AgnA is essential for proper DIRS–1 siRNA generation and silencing of the retrotransposon [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As expected, only minor amounts of siRNAs were observed for GFP and DIRS–1 likewise in agnA- cells and gene silencing was reduced for the GFP reporter construct (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B, 2C and 2E</xref>). We detected two sense as well as two antisense gfp transcripts in agnA- cell lines and to a lower extent in the wild type cells. Relative to gfp mRNA terminated by the commonly used actin8 terminator these transcripts seemed to be larger, probably due to different polyadenylation sites within the ITRs (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Furthermore GFP was detectable by Western blot analysis in agnA- cells but not in the wild type background (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>It should be noted, that in the agnA- strain, RNAi mediated gene silencing was not completely abolished (see minor amounts of residual siRNAs in <xref rid="pone.0131271.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Furthermore, opposing promoters may reduce transcript levels by transcriptional interference (see <xref rid="sec024" ref-type="sec">discussion</xref>). For comparison, we inserted the GFP coding region between two opposing actin15 promoters (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Even though silencing was observed, it was much weaker than with using the ITRs. Sense as well as antisense transcripts accumulate to relatively high level (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) but there were only marginal amounts of siRNAs detectable (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Apparently, the complementary transcripts do not efficiently form a Dicer substrate for generating siRNAs thus resulting in the accumulation of GFP protein in wild type cells (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Different combinations of ITRs and actin15 promoters to the left and the right of GFP showed various amounts of sense and antisense transcripts in agreement with the observation that the ITRs are stronger promoters than actin15. Silencing was always much less pronounced than with the combination of left and right ITR (data not shown).</p>

<p>Northern blots revealed that siRNAs, which were not detectable in the wild type, were generated from all constructs (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, data not shown for mhcA).

<title>4. siRNAs show reduced or no transitivity <italic>in trans</italic></title>
<p>To examine if the trigger derived siRNAs could mediate spreading, i.e. RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity, on the endogenous target gene, we examined siRNAs on sequences flanking the trigger region. These would be derived from transitivity along the target gene in 5’ or 3’ direction as we have previously shown [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>While siRNAs were readily detected by probes to the very end of the trigger (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>), no secondary siRNAs were observed either in 3’ or in 5’ direction (data not shown).

<title>5. Secondary siRNAs are generated on targets <italic>in cis</italic> as well as <italic>in trans</italic></title>
<p>To examine the nature of siRNAs, we estimated the amount of RNAs with a 5’-monophosphate and a 5’-triphosphate. A 5’-triphosphate can only be generated at the beginning of an RdRP product. Terminator 5'-phosphate-dependent exonuclease (5'exo) is a 5’ to 3’ exonuclease which is essentially blocked by a triphosphate end. We have used two assay conditions suggested by the manufacturer: buffer A which represents the standard protocol and buffer B which is milder and avoids rare degradation of RNAs containing a 5’-triphosphate. <xref rid="pone.0131271.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> shows that the ribosomal 5.8S RNA was completely degraded in buffer A while residual amounts were left with buffer B. siRNAs of the <italic>cis</italic> target (GFP) were strongly reduced but not completely lost with buffer A suggesting that the remaining siRNAs were secondary and contain a 5’-triphosphate. For the <italic>trans</italic> target (abpA) it appears that the relative amount of secondary siRNAs was even higher. tRNAs are not digested by 5'exo and probing for tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> served as a control. We conclude that secondary siRNAs are generated in both cases but they do not display transitivity on the endogene <italic>in trans</italic>. Due to the different activities in buffers A and B we cannot reliably determine the relative amounts of siRNAs with a 5’-triphosphate but can only state their existence.</p>

<title>7. Knock-downs by RNAi cause the expected phenotypes</title>
<p>It was now of interest to see if the reduction of protein levels was sufficient to display knock-down phenotypes.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Though it was expected that the DIRS–1 ITRs both have promoter activity, we now provide experimental evidence that these relatively short sequence elements promote transcription significantly stronger than the commonly used actin15 promoter. DIRS–1 ITRs may thus be used as an alternative, especially when strong expression is desired.</p>
<p>Based on these strong opposing promoters of a genetic element that is naturally silenced by RNAi, we have established a convenient gene silencing system in extrachromosomal vectors which is easier to use and apparently more reliable than the previously described antisense and hairpin constructs [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We have tested seven genes and find RNAi effects on all of them: the generation of siRNAs, reduction on the mRNA and the protein level and expected phenotypes and combinations of all of the above wherever it was examined. Reasons for the good functionality may be the almost equal strength of the two ITR promoter activities but probably some additional intrinsic features of the ITR sequences that may attract the RNAi machinery. For example, minor amounts of endogenous siRNAs complementary to the ITRs are found <italic>in vivo</italic> under special conditions [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since the trigger transcripts most likely extend into the ITRs they may be targets for this special minor class of endogenous siRNAs and possibly facilitate assembly of the Dicer complex. This may explain why similar trigger constructs with opposing actin15 promoters or actin15 and V18 promoters [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] did not result in significant endogene silencing.</p>
<p>In general, the generation of siRNAs caused a reduction in mRNA and protein levels. However, the amounts of siRNAs, mRNA and protein expression levels were not clearly correlated. We have previously shown that the amount of siRNAs (probably secondary siRNAs) depends on the presence and most likely the abundance of target transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, expression levels of the target genes (<xref rid="pone.0131271.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) as derived from DictyExpress [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], however, did not correlate well with the abundance of siRNAs. We rather assume that structural features of trigger transcripts facilitate or inhibit dsRNA formation [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and that secondary structures of the target transcripts influence the accessibility for siRNAs.</p>
<p>For the detection of siRNAs we have used oligonucleotides very close to the ends of the trigger sequence and more towards the center. Hybridization signals were different, reflecting the unequal distribution of siRNAs along a target RNA [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This was most obvious for abpA siRNAs (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Nevertheless, the relative amounts of siRNAs for a given target were similar when compared with other targets, indicating that intrinsic features make a good or a bad RNAi target.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the reduction of mRNA abundance was usually more pronounced than the reduction on the protein level. This makes it unlikely that siRNAs have an additional effect on translation. It rather seems that the loss of mRNA maybe partially compensated by an enhancement of translation. Our findings are in contrast to experiments by Wiegand et al. with hairpin constructs against a transgene (ß–galactosidase) where only translational repression was observed [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. They correspond, however, to our previous data with a hairpin construct against discoidin and a hairpin construct against ß–galactosidase where silencing occurred on the level of mRNA stability [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It should be noted that the construct against ß–galactosidase that was used by Wiegand and co-workers, differed in length and position from the one used in our previous study.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that AgnA is essential for the generation of (secondary) siRNAs and that RNAi mediated gene silencing is largely abolished when agnA is disrupted [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It was therefore surprising that expression of a GFP gene flanked by the ITRs was relatively low in the agnA- strain when compared to GFP driven by the actin15 promoter. As expected, GFP siRNAs were barely detectable in this strain. Though transcripts in both orientations were detected, antisense was apparently underrepresented. The formation of dsRNA seemed to be less efficient and one may assume that the primary Dicer products were rather unstable. In addition, other mechanisms may reduce the expression levels and thus the generation of siRNAs. These could be transcriptional interference (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) or some other interaction between the opposing promoters.</p>
<p>Amplification as well as spreading of siRNAs along a target and beyond the trigger is mediated by RNA dependent RNA polymerases and we have previously shown that in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> RrpC is required for the generation of the majority of siRNAs. These secondary siRNAs start out with a 5’-triphosphate when the RdRP works independent of a siRNA primer. Depending on the processivity of the RdRP (which is not known in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>), multiple siRNAs can be diced from one RdRP product but only the first of these secondary siRNAs has a 5’-triphosphate. Secondary siRNAs were also generated from the ITR GFP constructs demonstrating that they not necessarily mediate spreading. Based on a rough estimate comparing total siRNAs, primary siRNAs (as they are found in agnA- strains) and siRNAs with a 5’-triphosphate, one may assume that the RdRP has a higher processivity than observed in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and more secondary siRNAs are Dicer products (<xref rid="pone.0131271.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>). Fire’s group has found that essentially all transitive siRNAs carry a 5’-triphosphate and are thus single 21mers produced by RdRPs. Due to experimental limitations of our assay system, an exact quantification of siRNAs with 5’-triphosphate is, however, not reliable.</p>

<title>Model for gene silencing by natural and transgene derived siRNAs.</title>
<p>(A) The endogenous DIRS–1 sequences are transcribed in both directions and generate dsRNAs (grey) which are cleaved by Dicer to ~21 nt siRNAs. siRNAs recruit RrpC in a AgnA-dependent manner. The resulting dsRNA which may be synthesised primer dependent or primer independent in 5’ and 3’ direction is processed to secondary siRNAs. Primer independent siRNAs carry a 5’-triphosphate. Argonaute proteins (probably AgnA) silence DIRS–1 by mRNA destabilisation [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. (B) A transgene fusion of GFP and a DIRS-1 ORF is targeted by endogenous DIRS-1 siRNAs <italic>in trans</italic>. These may be primary or secondary siRNAs. They recruit the RdRP RrpC, which produces primer dependent and primer independent secondary siRNAs in 5’ and 3’ direction. Consequently, siRNAs matching adjacent sequences (here GFP) are generated. Silencing occurs on the level of mRNA destabilisation. DIRS–1 sequences are colour coded grey, GFP sequences green. Secondary siRNAs have a 5’-triphosphate or a monophosphate when they are Dicer products from longer dsRNAs or primer dependent. (C) siRNAs are generated from a bidirectionally transcribed trigger transgene. They can target the trigger transcripts <italic>in cis</italic> and complementary sequences on mRNAs of the corresponding endogene. They produce secondary siRNAs either from the trigger only or from both the target and the trigger transcript. If transgene derived siRNAs can only recruit RdRPs <italic>in cis</italic>, i.e. on the transgene itself, this could explain the lack of spreading along the mRNA of the endogene. Trigger sequences are colour coded grey, flanking sequences of the corresponding endogene blue.</p>

<p>In a different system using endogenous siRNAs to target tagged genes, spreading was observed at least up to 300 nts in 5’ and 3’ direction [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

<p>One may assume that secondary siRNAs are only generated on the <italic>cis</italic> sequence, i.e. on the sequence they are derived from. On the other hand, secondary, transitive siRNAs are readily found on fusion constructs, which are silenced by endogenous siRNAs derived from a different locus. Thus, transgene derived siRNAs were less efficient for transitivity on an endogene than endogenous siRNAs on a transgene [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We have so far no explanation for the different effects of siRNAs from different origins and no indication for differential modification that may distinguish between the species. In both cases we detect 5’-monophosphates and triphosphates and preliminary data (Boesler, unpublished) indicate that there is no 2’-O-methylation at all in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> siRNAs. This unexpected difference is depicted in the model in <xref rid="pone.0131271.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>.</p>
<p>Gene knock-downs by antisense (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]) and by hairpin constructs (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]) have previously been described. The system presented here may have several advantages. The construction of knock-down vectors is easier than that of hairpin constructs and involves only one PCR and one cloning step. Transformation with extrachromosomal vectors is rapid. At least with integrating plasmids we have previously seen various, mostly lower efficiencies and could e.g. not obtain a corA knock-down with an antisense or a hairpin construct in wild type cells [<xref rid="pone.0131271.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
<p>We have not subcloned the transformants and may therefore underestimate the knock-down effect that can be obtained in single clones.</p>
<p>Using cDNA or genomic libraries in the ITR vector may provide an efficient system to screen for knock-down mutants.</p>
<p>Since DIRS–1 like elements are wide spread in various organisms, it will be of interest to see if the DIRS–1 derived knock-down system may also be applicable in these.</p>
