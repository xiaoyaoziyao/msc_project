<abstract>
<p>Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused in most cases by mutations in the <italic>NPC1</italic> gene. NPC1-deficiency is characterized by late endosomal accumulation of cholesterol, impaired cholesterol homeostasis, and a broad range of other cellular abnormalities. Although neuronal abnormalities and glial activation are observed in nearly all areas of the brain, the most severe consequence of NPC1-deficiency is a near complete loss of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. The link between cholesterol trafficking and NPC pathogenesis is not yet clear; however, increased oxidative stress in symptomatic NPC disease, increases in mitochondrial cholesterol, and alterations in autophagy/mitophagy suggest that mitochondria play a role in NPC disease pathology. Alterations in mitochondrial function affect energy and neurotransmitter metabolism, and are particularly harmful to the central nervous system. To investigate early metabolic alterations that could affect NPC disease progression, we performed metabolomics analyses of different brain regions from age-matched wildtype and <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice at pre-symptomatic, early symptomatic and late stage disease by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy. Metabolic profiling revealed markedly increased lactate and decreased acetate/acetyl-CoA levels in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum and cerebral cortex at all ages. Protein and gene expression analyses indicated a pre-symptomatic deficiency in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, and an upregulation of glycolytic gene expression at the early symptomatic stage. We also observed a pre-symptomatic increase in several indicators of oxidative stress and antioxidant response systems in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum. Our findings suggest that energy metabolism and oxidative stress may present additional therapeutic targets in NPC disease, especially if intervention can be started at an early stage of the disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease is a fatal, autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused in 95% of cases by mutations in the <italic>NPC1</italic> gene and in the remaining cases by mutations in <italic>NPC2</italic>. NPC1 is a late endo/lysosomal protein that interacts with NPC2 in the lysosome lumen to mediate cholesterol egress from endosomes to plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Wang1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Vance1">[3]</xref>. The loss of either NPC1 or NPC2 leads to the endo/lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, an impaired cholesterol homeostatic response and a wide range of other cellular abnormalities, such as decreased oxysterol production, alterations in calcium homeostasis and autophagy, increased oxidative stress and inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Ory1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cologna1">[9]</xref>. The most severe consequences of NPC1-deficiency are a progressive loss of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum and widespread neuronal abnormalities. Other common characteristics of NPC1-deficient brain include altered synaptic transmission, glial activation, neuroinflammation, and dysmyelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Walkley1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-German1">[13]</xref>. In the periphery, increased total cholesterol levels cause hepatosplenomegaly and liver dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Xie1">[14]</xref>. Neuronal cholesterol accumulation begins at early, pre-symptomatic stages of the disease, and mobilization of endosomal cholesterol <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> can prevent many of the cellular abnormalities and symptoms of NPC disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Reid1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Rosenbaum2">[19]</xref>. Although the defect in cholesterol trafficking causes many, if not all, cellular abnormalities observed in NPC disease, relatively little is known about the cellular mechanisms leading to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration.</p>
    <p>Endosomal cholesterol is transported to mitochondria even in the absence of functional NPC1, and the endosomal cholesterol accumulation can lead to increased cholesterol levels in mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Kennedy1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Charman1">[21]</xref>. Increased levels of mitochondrial cholesterol may lead to lower ATP production and a greater sensitivity of these mitochondria to oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Yu1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Fernandez1">[23]</xref>. In human embryonic stem cell-derived NPC1-deficient neurons, defective mitophagy led to accumulation of depolarized, fragmented mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Ordonez1">[24]</xref>. Several reports of increased oxidative stress in NPC1-deficiency further implicate mitochondria in NPC disease pathology. For instance, NPC patients have increased serum levels of oxidative stress markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Fu1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Porter1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Jiang1">[26]</xref>, and oxidative tissue damage was observed in the liver and cerebellum of late symptomatic NPC1-deficient mice together with a gene expression profile indicative of increased oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cologna1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Vazquez2">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>The brain is particularly sensitive to alterations in mitochondrial integrity or function due to its high energy requirement and reliance on oxidative metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Shulman1">[28]</xref>. Most neurodegenerative diseases are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and primary mitochondrial defects commonly manifest in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-DiMauro1">[29]</xref>. The compartmentation of pathways between neurons and astrocytes and the close connection between energy metabolism and neurotransmitter balance further increase the complexity of brain metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Kreft1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Serres1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we have used an unbiased metabolomics approach to investigate changes in brain energy metabolism beginning at pre-symptomatic stages of NPC disease. Metabolites were measured by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy in the cerebella, cerebral cortices and hippocampi of BALB/cNctr-Npc1<sup>m1N</sup>/J mice, a well-characterized murine model of NPC disease with a null mutation in <italic>Npc1</italic>. Homozygous <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are asymptomatic at birth, but develop progressive ataxia, tremors and hindlimb dystonia around 5 – 6 weeks of age, and have an average lifespan of approximately 12 weeks of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Voikar1">[33]</xref>. The pathological changes in the brain of these mice at different stages of the disease have been described in some detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Walkley1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Voikar1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Morris1">[36]</xref>. Protein and mRNA expression analyses of key metabolic proteins gave further insight into mitochondrial changes and into the roles of neurons and astrocytes in NPC1-deficient cerebellum. Our results revealed significant pre-symptomatic alterations in glucose and pyruvate metabolism, as well as an activation of stress-related pathways in NPC1-deficient brain. Further investigations will be required to determine whether the identified pathways could present additional targets for therapeutic intervention to alleviate the symptoms of NPC disease.</p>

<p>Snap-frozen tissue was homogenized in ice-cold HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet 40), with freshly added protease inhibitors (5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 50 µM PMSF and 1 µM pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mM ortho-vanadate and 1 mM sodium fluoride) using a motor-driven pestle fitting into a microcentrifuge tube in a metal cooling block, followed by slow trituration through a syringe fitted with a 26 gauge needle. Protein content was determined by a bicinchoninic acid-based photometric assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Brain homogenates were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes.

<title>ATP generation by isolated mitochondria</title>
<p>Cerebella, cerebral cortices and hippocampi were dissected from 3- or 7-week old wildtype and <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and homogenized together in cold mitochondria isolation buffer (220 mM mannitol, 7 mM sucrose, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, fatty acid free) and protease inhibitors. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation. ATP production was detected by the luciferase-luciferin method as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-VivesBauza1">[42]</xref>. Briefly, mitochondria (100 or 50 µg) were incubated with energy substrates (1 mM pyruvate/1 mM malate or 5 mM succinate), ATP detection buffer (40 µM luciferin, 1/3000 luciferase (Biotium)) and ADP (300 µM) in Tris buffer (150 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA, 10 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) at 37°C. Luminescence was measured with a FLUOStar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies) for 20 readings at 1 s integration time. The rate of ATP generation was calculated as the luminescence increase during the measurement period of 20 s as luminescence (a.u.) per second per cell protein, and expressed as a percent of the average of wildtype samples of the same experiment. Addition of NaN<sub>3</sub> (10 mM), rotenone (2 µg/ml), or antimycin A (50 µg/ml) reduced the luminescence increase during the measuring period to undetectable levels even in the presence of energy substrates (not shown). To verify mitochondrial polarization, an aliquot of each mitochondrial preparation was incubated with 2 µM nonyl acridine orange (Biotium, Hayward, CA) for 30 min at 37°C, washed, and analyzed for fluorescence at 488/520 nm excitation/emission.</p>

<title>Metabolomic differences between wildtype and <italic>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brain regions in early stages of NPC disease</title>
<p>To determine whether loss of NPC1 has consequences for energy metabolism in the brain, we first performed an unbiased metabolomics analysis of aqueous extracts of cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex tissue of wildtype and <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy. Brain tissue was analyzed at 3, 4, 5, and 7 weeks of age, representing pre-symptomatic (3 and 4 weeks), early symptomatic (5 weeks) and late stage (7 weeks) disease. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows a sample <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of an aqueous extract of wildtype cerebellum. Spectra for all samples were normalized to unit sum and mean-centred prior to multivariate exploratory analysis via projection pursuit (PPEDA).

PCA employs linear combinations of the original variables of high-dimensional data to obtain new, fewer variables (termed principal components; PC) that account for the most variance, i.e., the most information, in the original data. Typically, only a few PCs are sufficient for a good representation of the data.

<title>Increased lactate and decreased acetate/acetyl-CoA levels in the cerebellum of 3-week old <italic>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice</title>
<p>The scores plots alone can only show whether wildtype and <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain regions differed in their overall metabolic profile, but they do not yield information about particular metabolites. On the other hand, the levels of specific metabolites could be different between the genotypes without causing a significant difference in the overall metabolic profile analyzed by PCA. We therefore deconvolved and integrated all spectra and determined the peak areas for all metabolites that were clearly distinguishable in the spectra. The peak areas were standardized to the total peak area to reflect the relative levels of energy metabolites in the aqueous extract. The most striking differences between wildtype and <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain extracts were found in lactate and acetate/acetyl-CoA, which are the products of pyruvate reduction in anaerobic glycolysis and of oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate during aerobic glycolysis, respectively. The resonance frequencies of the CH<sub>3</sub>-group of acetate and acetyl-CoA overlap near 1.92 ppm, and can therefore not be distinguished in the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g001">Fig 1</xref>). Lactate levels were significantly higher in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum and cerebral cortex compared to wildtype, and increased with disease progression in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082685.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, acetate/acetyl-CoA levels were markedly decreased in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex of <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice aged 3 or 7 weeks.

Alanine, which is catabolized to pyruvate by transamination, was increased in the cerebellum of 7-week old <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Our metabolomics analysis also revealed a decrease in the levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 5 and 7 weeks of age and in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebral cortex at 7 weeks of age, while glutamate levels were not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082685.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Hippocampal <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> samples showed a slight decrease in GABA levels at 3 weeks and an increase in glutamate levels at 5 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082685.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, the neurotransmitter balance appeared to be shifted towards increased excitatory or decreased inhibitory neurotransmission in all brain regions analyzed. The resonance frequencies of glutamine and glutamate largely overlap, except for a region between 2.04 to 2.07 ppm that corresponds mostly to glutamate. Peaks in this region were integrated for quantification of glutamate, and regions with overlapping resonance frequencies were quantified as the sum of glutamate and glutamine (Glu + Gln). There were no differences between genotypes in these peak ranges, suggesting that glutamine levels were not altered in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of the known Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum of older <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, the levels of the neuron-derived metabolite N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were not different between genotypes, with only a non-significant (p = 0.08) decrease in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 7 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref>). The levels of the osmolytes taurine and myo-inositol were slightly decreased in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 5 and 3 weeks of age, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref>). The lack of alterations in myo-inositol content at more advanced stages of the disease was somewhat surprising, since the levels of the glia-derived myo-inositol commonly increase during glial activation and/or proliferation. Creatine levels remained unaltered in all samples (not shown). All brain areas of <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice 3 weeks of age and older showed a striking decrease in their levels of choline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref>), which plays a key role in brain development as an important precursor of one-carbon metabolism and phospholipid synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Zeisel1">[49]</xref>.</p>

<title>Alterations in glucose and pyruvate metabolism in <italic>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cerebellum</title>
<p>The increased lactate levels suggested that anaerobic glycolysis was increased in the <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brains, while the decrease in acetate/acetyl-CoA levels pointed to a decrease in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for oxidative metabolism of glucose. Given that there is limited fatty acid oxidation in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Yang1">[50]</xref>, the majority of acetyl-CoA found in the brain is derived from pyruvate. To investigate potential alterations in glucose metabolism in NPC1-deficient brain tissue, we first measured mRNA expression levels of several key enzymes of glycolysis in wildtype and <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum by qPCR. A schematic overview of glycolysis and its enzymes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3A</xref>. The main rate-determining step of glycolysis is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase-1 (<italic>Pfk</italic>). At 3 weeks of age, we found no differences in the mRNA levels of two of the three PFK1 isoforms (<italic>Pfkl</italic> and <italic>Pfkp</italic>), and decreased mRNA levels of the <italic>Pfkm</italic> isoform in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, at 5 weeks of age, mRNA levels of all three isoforms of PFK1 were markedly increased in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3B</xref>), suggesting that at this stage of the disease, glycolysis is upregulated on the gene expression level. In contrast, the mRNA levels of hexokinase 1 (<italic>Hxk1</italic>) and pyruvate kinase type M (<italic>Pkm</italic>), which catalyze the two additional exergonic, highly regulated steps of glycolysis, were unchanged in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at either 3 or 5 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3C and D</xref>). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>G6pd</italic>), which catalyzes the rate-limiting entrance of glucose-6-phosphate into the pentose-phosphate pathway, appeared decreased in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3 weeks of age, but this decrease was not significant (p = 0.07; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3E</xref>). To gain insight into the relative contributions of neurons and astrocytes, we measured mRNA levels of enolase, which is expressed in different isoforms in the two cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Lovatt1">[51]</xref>. While mRNA levels of astrocytic alpha-enolase (<italic>Eno1</italic>) were increased in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum as early as 3 weeks of age, mRNA levels of neuron-specific enolase (<italic>Eno2</italic>) were unaltered at early stages of the disease and decreased in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 7 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3F and G</xref>). In addition, mRNA levels of the mostly astrocytic isoform of lactate dehydrogenase (<italic>Ldha</italic>), which catalyzes the production of lactate in the last step of anaerobic glycolysis, were significantly increased in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 5 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3H</xref>), in line with the increased lactate levels observed by NMR-spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref>). Together, these findings indicated differences in the transcriptional regulation of glucose metabolism, and a possible upregulation of glycolysis at the early symptomatic stage of the disease, in particular in astrocytes.</p>

<title>Decreased oxidative metabolism of pyruvate in <italic>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cerebellum</title>
<p>Pyruvate derived from glycolysis can enter several different pathways, including the reversible transamination with alanine or the reduction to lactate. Pyruvate is also transported into mitochondria, where it can undergo carboxylation to oxaloacetate or oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA, which can itself be further oxidized in the citric acid cycle (schematic overview shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The increased lactate to acetate/acetyl-CoA ratio observed by NMR spectroscopy in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain at all ages suggested that mitochondrial oxidative metabolism of pyruvate was decreased, and that the cytosolic reduction of pyruvate to lactate was increased to supply NAD<sup>+</sup> for glycolysis.</p>

<p>To investigate potential alterations in the mitochondrial metabolism of pyruvate in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum, we measured the mRNA levels of several key enzymes of pyruvate metabolism and of the malate aspartate transporter Aralar 1, which is part of a mitochondrial shuttle for the indirect transfer of NAD<sup>+</sup> into the cytosol. The oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex PDH in the mitochondrial matrix. Expression analysis of PDH showed lower mRNA levels of the <italic>Pdha</italic> subunit in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Moreover, immunoblot analysis revealed a decrease in the total levels of PDH in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 5 weeks of age, and an increase in the levels of phosphorylated PDH at 3 and 5 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5C</xref>). PDH is inhibited by phosphorylation; therefore, these findings strongly suggested a decrease in the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, in line with the decreased acetate/acetyl-CoA levels observed by NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref>). The increased mRNA levels of PDH kinases 1 and 2 in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 5 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5D and E</xref>; <italic>Pdk1</italic> and <italic>Pdk2</italic>) suggested a longer-term increase in PDH phosphorylation on the gene expression level in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at this age. Given that PDK1 and PDK2 are more prevalent in neurons and astrocytes, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Halim1">[54]</xref>, these alterations in PDH likely occurred in both cell types. Cerebellar mRNA levels of pyruvate carboxylase (<italic>Pcx</italic>), which converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate only in astrocytes, were increased in 3- and 5-week old <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5F</xref>), while mRNA levels of cytosolic malic enzyme (<italic>Me1</italic>), which catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and malate mainly in the direction of pyruvate synthesis, were decreased in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Mitochondrial malic enzyme 2 (<italic>Me2</italic>) mRNA levels were also decreased in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5H</xref>), while mRNA levels of the mainly neuronal, mitochondrial malic enzyme 3 (<italic>Me3</italic>) and the malate aspartate shuttle aralar (<italic>Aralar1</italic>) were unchanged, except at 7 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5I and J</xref>).

<p>Together, these findings demonstrated that alterations in cerebellar glucose metabolism (upregulation of <italic>Eno1</italic> and <italic>Pcx</italic> mRNA, higher PKM2 protein, decreased <italic>Pdha</italic>, <italic>Me1</italic> and <italic>Me2</italic> mRNA levels, increased lactate and decreased acetate/acetyl-CoA levels) developed early in NPC disease, and could already be detected in 3-week old, pre-symptomatic <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.

<title>Mitochondrial alterations in <italic>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brain</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether the upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and the increased lactate production in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum were a response to decreased mitochondrial abundance and/or mitochondrial defects, either of which would lower glucose oxidation and decrease mitochondrial ATP production. A key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), which interacts with a variety of transcription factors involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function to increase mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1α mRNA (<italic>Ppargc1a</italic>) levels were not altered in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3 weeks, but were markedly increased compared to wildtype at 5 weeks of age, and decreased at 7 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6A</xref>), suggesting that at 5 weeks of age, the cellular response to increase mitochondrial biogenesis was activated in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum. We therefore determined the levels of a mitochondrial marker protein, the voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC1), and levels of mitochondrial DNA as measures for mitochondrial abundance. While VDAC1 protein levels remained unaltered throughout disease progression, mitochondrial DNA levels were substantially decreased in the cerebella of 5-week old <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6B and C</xref>), suggesting a loss of normal mitochondria even though <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> mRNA levels were increased. Additional alterations in mitochondria were seen in a decrease in mRNA levels of the mitochondria-encoded subunit 2 of cytochrome c oxidase (<italic>Mtco2</italic>) and a marked increase of mRNA levels of uncoupling protein 2 (<italic>Ucp2</italic>) in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at all ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6D and E</xref>).

<p>To investigate whether oxidative phosphorylation may be impaired in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain, we measured ATP production by mitochondria isolated from wildtype and <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain at 3 and 7 weeks of age. Mitochondrial polarization was verified with acridine orange staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6F</xref>). In the presence of pyruvate and malate as energy substrates, mitochondria isolated from <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain at 3 weeks produced less ATP than mitochondria from wildtype brain, in line with a decrease in PDH activity and impaired oxidative phosphorylation in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain. On the other hand, in the presence of succinate, ATP generation was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6G</xref>), which may suggest that most components of the electron transport chain remained relatively unaffected in mitochondria from <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain. Interestingly, mitochondria isolated from wildtype and <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain at 7 weeks of age showed no differences in ATP generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6H</xref>). While we cannot explain why isolated mitochondria from <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain at later stages of the disease appear to be normal in this assay, the findings reflect the lack of differences between genotypes at 7 weeks of age in most of our metabolic gene expression analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">5</xref>). It is important to note, however, that assays using isolated mitochondria cannot fully reflect mitochondrial function in the brain. Isolation procedures and the assay environment strongly influence the measurements, and alterations in mitochondrial function in the brain are not necessarily recapitulated by isolated mitochondria.</p>
<p>To further investigate energy homeostasis in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum, we determined the levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) by immunoblotting. A drastic loss of oxidative phosphorylation capacity would be expected to have a significant impact on energy homeostasis and likely lead to phosphorylation and activation of AMPK. However, levels of phosphorylated AMPK were unchanged in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3, 4, and 5 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6I</xref>), suggesting that there was no significant overall energy deficiency, possibly due to increased glycolytic ATP production.</p>

<p>Next, we measured mRNA levels of several transcription factors or known target genes associated with stress responses.

However, <italic>Hif1α</italic> mRNA levels were not different between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g007">Fig 7B</xref>), and we were unable to reliably detect HIF-1α by immunoblotting in either wildtype or <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain homogenates. In contrast, mRNA levels of the nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2, <italic>Nfe2l2</italic>), which is a key element of a protective response to oxidative stress, and of one of its target genes, heme oxygenase 1 (HO1, <italic>Hmox1</italic>), were markedly higher in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum beginning at 3 weeks of age, and increased with disease progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g007">Fig 7C and D</xref>). The early activation of antioxidant responses was also apparent in the increased mRNA levels of superoxide dismutase 1 (<italic>Sod1</italic>) and the increased protein levels of superoxide dismutase 2 (MnSOD) in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> compared to wildtype cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g007">Fig 7E and F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have investigated brain energy metabolism in a mouse model of NPC disease. Using an unbiased metabolomics strategy and targeted gene expression analyses of wildtype and <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain tissue, we found i) significant alterations in glucose and pyruvate metabolism that suggested a pre-symptomatic decrease in the oxidative metabolism of glucose, and a compensatory increase in glycolysis with disease progression, and ii) a pre-symptomatic activation of astrocytic antioxidant response systems, which suggests that oxidative stress plays a key role early in NPC disease pathogenesis. A graphic overview of the gene expression changes found in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3 and 5 weeks of age is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g008">Figure 8</xref>.</p>

<title>Glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation in <italic>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cerebellum</title>
<p>The most striking alterations found in our metabolomics analysis were an increase in lactate and a decrease in acetate/acetyl-CoA levels in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum and cerebral cortex as early as 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref>). The decrease in acetate/acetyl-CoA pointed to an impaired oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for further oxidation in the citric acid cycle. High lactate levels are often indicative of increased anaerobic glycolysis due to hypoxia or mitochondrial dysfunction, and have been observed in brain and cerebrospinal fluid in cerebral ischemia, during physiological aging, and in certain models of neurodegenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Huntington disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Brouns1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Tsang1">[63]</xref>. In addition, lactate levels can increase transiently with increased neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Barros1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Dienel1">[66]</xref>.</p>
<p>The increased mRNA levels of <italic>Ldha</italic>, <italic>Eno1</italic>, and <italic>Pfk</italic> isoforms and the higher PFK1 protein levels observed in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 5 weeks of age indicated that glycolysis was upregulated and contributed to the higher lactate levels in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain at this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g004">4</xref>). Similarly, published microarray data from <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse liver show increased expression of several glycolytic enzymes, including <italic>Pfk</italic> and <italic>Ldh</italic> isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cluzeau1">[67]</xref>. Given that <italic>Ldha</italic> and <italic>Eno1</italic> are predominantly expressed in glia, which are also the main glycolytic cell type and the main source of lactate in normal brain, the increased expression of these isoforms suggested an increase in glycolysis in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes. The increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake into primary <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g004">Fig 4D</xref>) suggested that glycolysis can also increase in neurons in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain. Whereas in astrocytes, increased glycolysis may serve to provide lactate and other energy substrates to neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Belanger1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Wyss1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Schousboe1">[69]</xref>, an upregulation of neuronal glycolysis can have detrimental effects by limiting the availability of glucose for the pentose phosphate pathway and thus for synthesis of NADPH and regeneration of glutathione <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-HerreroMendez1">[70]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although lactate levels were increased at all stages of NPC disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref>), the upregulation of glycolysis in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum, at least on gene and protein expression level, appeared to occur during progression to the early symptomatic stage rather than pre-symptomatically. Thus, at 3 weeks of age, only <italic>Eno1</italic> mRNA levels were increased while <italic>Pfkm</italic> mRNA levels were even slightly decreased in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3</xref>). With progression from early symptomatic to late stage NPC disease, glycolytic gene expression in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum appeared to normalize, even though lactate levels remained elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3</xref>). A recent proteomics study using the same <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice found decreased levels of glycolytic PKM1/2 and PFK-M in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 1 and 3 weeks of age respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cologna2">[71]</xref>, in agreement with our findings at 3 weeks. However, whereas our results suggest that glycolysis increases in the early stages of NPC disease, these authors concluded that glycolysis was generally downregulated in NPC disease, based on their findings of decreased levels of glycolytic triosephosphate isomerase in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 5 weeks of age, and of decreased deoxyglucose uptake in cultured primary fibroblasts from human NPC patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cologna2">[71]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> measurements of brain glucose uptake by 2-Deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography have shown glucose hypometabolism in one patient with adult onset NPC disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Battisti1">[72]</xref>, whereas two other case reports of NPC patients examined with the same technique found unaltered or increased glucose metabolism in the cerebellum and hypometabolism only in the cerebral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Kumar1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Huang1">[74]</xref>. Clearly, NPC1-deficiency alters glucose metabolism in a complex manner that is highly dependent on the stage of the disease and on the brain region examined. Further investigations by <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements of metabolic flux or by neuroimaging approaches are needed to clarify the role of glycolytic activity in the NPC1-deficient brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-deGraaf1">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Rothman1">[76]</xref>.</p>
<p>We also observed an increase in the levels of the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g004">Fig 4C</xref>) in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum. PKM2 is commonly expressed in embryonic and cancer tissue, and, in contrast to PKM1, it is under complex allosteric regulation to control the flux of glycolytic intermediates into biosynthetic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Gupta1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Gui1">[78]</xref>. The consequences of increased PKM2 levels in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum are unclear, but expression of an embryonic isozyme may point to disturbances in cell cycle or differentiation. Similarly, higher mRNA levels of the embryonic aldolase B have been found in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> murine liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cluzeau1">[67]</xref>.</p>
<p>The increased lactate and decreased acetate/acetyl-CoA levels in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3 weeks of age without a clear upregulation of glycolysis at this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">3</xref>) suggested that pyruvate metabolism was affected by NPC1-deficiency. Alterations in pyruvate metabolism were apparent in the markedly increased <italic>Pcx</italic> and decreased <italic>Pdha</italic>, <italic>Me1</italic> and <italic>Me2</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5</xref>). The strong trend to increased inhibitory phosphorylation of PDH in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3 weeks of age, the significantly increased phosphorylated PDH and the decreased total PDH protein in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 5 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5</xref>) further indicated that an impaired oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA contributed to the high lactate and low acetate/acetyl-CoA levels in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum. Impaired PDH activity could also contribute to the decreased ATP generation in the presence of pyruvate/malate that we observed in assays with mitochondria isolated from <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain at 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6</xref>). In a previous study, Cologna et al. also found significantly decreased PDH protein levels and a strong trend to increased pyruvate levels in the cerebella of 1-week old <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cologna2">[71]</xref>. Other reports have shown decreased mRNA expression of PDH isoforms in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at a late stage of the disease, as well as in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Vazquez2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cluzeau1">[67]</xref>. Moreover, increased mRNA levels of different PDH Kinase isoforms have been reported for liver samples from <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice aged 1 week and older, and for NPC1-deficient fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cluzeau1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Reddy1">[79]</xref>. Thus, a decline in PDH activity seems to be an early and persistent consequence of NPC1-deficiency in many cell types. Our finding that both <italic>Pdk1</italic> and <italic>Pdk2</italic> mRNA levels were increased in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5</xref>) suggested that PDH phosphorylation increased in both neurons and astrocytes, since neurons express PDK1, and PDK2 is predominantly present in astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Halim1">[54]</xref>. The upregulation of astrocytic <italic>Pcx</italic> in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3 weeks of age and concomitant downregulation of <italic>Me1</italic> and <italic>Me2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">Fig 5</xref>) may serve to counteract a build-up of pyruvate and the subsequent feedback inhibition of glycolysis, as has been described in other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Pongratz1">[80]</xref>.</p>
<p>The brain is highly sensitive to a decrease in PDH activity because of its strong reliance on the oxidative metabolism of glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Shulman1">[28]</xref>. Congenital PDH deficiencies manifest with neurological symptoms such as ataxia and seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Prasad1">[81]</xref>, and decreases in PDH activity are also observed in Alzheimer disease and physiological aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Stacpoole1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Zhou1">[83]</xref>. In astrocytes, PDH activity is normally kept low by high basal phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Halim1">[54]</xref>, and pyruvate is diverted into lactate formation and anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Hassel1">[84]</xref>. In neurons, however, maintenance of dephosphorylated, active PDH is essential to achieve the most energy-efficient complete oxidation of glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Halim1">[54]</xref>. Impaired oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate also prevents the use of lactate or alanine as energy substrates, leaving increased glycolysis or oxidation of glutamine as the main alternative energy sources. Thus, a decrease in PDH activity could lead to impaired energy generation and/or to metabolic adaptations with possible consequences for neuronal redox status and neurotransmitter metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Bolanos1">[85]</xref>. In addition, differences in neurotransmitter metabolism can also contribute to alterations in energy metabolism. Increased neuronal activity increases the neuronal energy requirement to maintain the membrane potential, and is commonly coupled to increased astrocytic lactate production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Barros1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Stobart1">[65]</xref>. If the imbalance in neurotransmitter levels and in particular the decrease in inhibitory GABA that was observed in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 5 and 7 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g002">Fig 2</xref>) led to changes in neuronal activity, it could thus contribute to the increase in lactate production at later stages of the disease. On the other hand, in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hippocampus, GABA levels were decreased at 3 weeks of age without a concomitant increase in lactate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082685.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Moreover, a variety of homeostatic synaptic scaling mechanisms can stabilize overall neuronal firing through compensatory downregulation of excitatory activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Turrigiano1">[86]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Pozo1">[88]</xref>.</p>
<p>Other factors could also contribute to impaired mitochondrial energy generation in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain. Our findings of decreased <italic>Mtco2</italic> mRNA and increased <italic>Ucp2</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at all ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6</xref>) could indicate defects in cytochrome c oxidase/complex IV, and possibly increased uncoupling of the electron transport chain, even though the role of UCP2 in the brain is not quite clear. Cologna et al. found decreased ATP synthase levels in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 1 week of age, but no changes in ATP synthase levels at 3 weeks of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cologna2">[71]</xref>. Using isolated brain mitochondria from 3-week old <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we found a decrease in ATP production with pyruvate and malate as energy substrates, but no differences in the presence of succinate. Even with the caveat that assays in isolated mitochondria are limited by their artificial environment, these findings suggest that impaired oxidative metabolism of pyruvate may be more prominent than electron transport chain deficiencies.</p>
<p>In several other neurodegenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, deficiencies in mitochondrial ATP production are associated with increased phosphorylation and activation of AMPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Ramamurthy1">[89]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Mochel1">[93]</xref>. However, we observed no significant alterations in the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in cerebellum from 3-, 4- or 5-week old <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6</xref>), suggesting that any deficiencies in oxidative phosphorylation in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum were mild enough to be offset by compensatory metabolic adaptations. Such compensatory mechanisms could include the upregulation of <italic>Pcx</italic> in astrocytes in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 3 weeks of age and the upregulation of glycolytic gene expression (PFK, <italic>Pfk, Ldha</italic>) at 5 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3</xref> - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">5</xref>), which could serve to counteract pyruvate build-up and energy deficits during the early symptomatic stage of NPC disease. Moreover, a proteomics analysis showed increased ATP synthase levels in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 5 weeks of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cologna2">[71]</xref>. Our finding of increased mRNA levels of PGC-1α, a transcriptional coactivator for mitochondrial biogenesis, in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at 5 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6</xref>) suggested a compensatory upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, however, the lower levels of mitochondrial DNA observed in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum at the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6</xref>) indicated a decreased mitochondrial number or mitochondrial defects. A possible explanation for this seeming contradiction may come from recent work by Ordonez et al. showing an accumulation of depolarized, dysfunctional mitochondria due to defective mitophagy in NPC1-deficient human embryonic stem-cell derived neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Ordonez1">[24]</xref>. We speculate that with progression to late stage NPC disease, compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. Thus, at 7 weeks of age, PGC-1α mRNA levels in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6</xref>) and metabolic gene expression appeared mostly unaltered or decreased due to neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g005">5</xref>; <italic>Eno2, Aralar1</italic>). The lack of significant defects in ATP generation by mitochondria isolated from the brains of 7-week old <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (this study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082685-g006">Fig 6</xref>), but decreased ATP generation by mitochondria isolated from brain homogenates of 9-week old <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice observed by Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Yu1">[22]</xref>, also indicate a progressive deterioration of mitochondrial quality.</p>

However, whereas our findings strongly suggest a role for oxidative stress early during NPC disease pathogenesis, a previous study by Cluzeau et al. had concluded that oxidative stress was a late occurrence in NPC disease, based on microarray data of liver taken from <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice between the ages of 1 and 11 weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cluzeau1">[67]</xref>. In that study, pathway maps related to oxidative stress showed significant alterations in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> liver only at 11 weeks of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cluzeau1">[67]</xref>. Even if the difference to our results may in part be due to methodological differences, the much later onset of oxidative stress in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> liver compared to brain seems to suggest that in NPC disease, the cerebellum may be exposed to greater oxidative stress or be more sensitive to oxidative stress than the liver. Differences in the susceptibility to oxidative stress between mitochondria from liver and brain have been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Santos1">[96]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Navarro1">[97]</xref>. A recent study investigated the effects of supplementing <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine beginning at 4 or 6 weeks of age, and noted a modest reduction in oxidative stress markers and a slight improvement in certain aspects of the NPC disease phenotype in the N-acetylcysteine-treated animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Fu2">[98]</xref>. Our findings indicate that oxidative stress in the <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum increases before the onset of overt neurological symptoms, and suggest that early antioxidant treatment may be beneficial in NPC disease.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction form a vicious cycle observed in many neurodegenerative disorders, where alterations in the electron transport chain and in oxidative phosphorylation lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn promote further mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction through oxidative modification and accelerated degradation of glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Butterfield1">[99]</xref>. Interestingly, PDH appears to be highly sensitive to oxidative modification, as seen following cerebral ischemia or in acutely respiring yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Butterfield1">[99]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Cabiscol1">[101]</xref>. JNK activation by oxidative stress can also decrease PDH activity. Thus, in cortical neurons, activated JNK translocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane and initiates a phosphorylation cascade that results in inhibitory PDH phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Zhou1">[83]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Zhou2">[102]</xref>. In addition, JNK activation can increase PDK1 transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-LopezBergami1">[103]</xref>.</p>
<p>The initial cause of a deterioration in mitochondrial quality in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain is unclear. One possibility is that impaired mitophagy leads to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria that produce more ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Karbowski1">[104]</xref>. Several groups, including ours, have also shown that cholesterol trafficking defects in NPC1-deficient cells can lead to an increase of cholesterol in mitochondria, which in turn may affect their function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Kennedy1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Fernandez1">[23]</xref>. An upregulation of glycolysis in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neurons and/or decreased ME1 activity may further increase oxidative stress by decreasing NADPH synthesis for glutathione regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-HerreroMendez1">[70]</xref>. Initial increases in oxidative stress or initial metabolic alterations can thus cause further changes in energy metabolism and increase oxidative damage in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain, leading to a cascade of subsequent adaptations as seen in many neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Our study also provides further evidence that both neurons and astrocytes are affected by NPC1-deficiency, which is in agreement with previous reports of early microglial and astrocyte activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-German1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Baudry1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Pressey1">[105]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Suzuki1">[106]</xref>. However, the observed pre-symptomatic metabolic alterations in astrocytes also raise questions as to the role of astrocytes in NPC pathology. On one hand, studies using chimeric mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Ko1">[107]</xref>, mice with cell-type specific deletion of NPC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Elrick1">[108]</xref> or with cell-type specific expression of NPC1 in an NPC1-null background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Lopez1">[109]</xref> have clearly demonstrated a neuron-inherent, glia-independent mechanism of Purkinje cell death in NPC1-deficient cerebellum. Moreover, depletion or expression of NPC1 in astrocytes alone neither caused nor rescued the NPC neurological phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Elrick1">[108]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Lopez1">[109]</xref>, with the exception of one report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Zhang1">[110]</xref>. On the other hand, given the close interdependence of neurons and astrocytes, it seems unlikely that astrocytes could show such striking and early metabolic alterations, and yet have no impact on NPC disease progression. Our findings cannot resolve this quandary; however, they clearly show that many of the alterations in <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes can be neuroprotective, including the activation of Nrf2 and upregulation of <italic>Hmox1</italic> (HO1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Vargas1">[111]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Shih1">[114]</xref>. Nrf2 activity increases astrocytic synthesis and secretion of glutathione <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Vargas1">[111]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Johnson1">[112]</xref>, which, after hydrolysis, generates cysteine and glycine for neuronal glutathione synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Vargas1">[111]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Johnson1">[112]</xref>. HO-1 also plays a mostly cytoprotective role, but it can also exacerbate neuronal and astrocytic injury after prolonged increased expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Song1">[115]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0082685-Schipper1">[116]</xref>, possibly contributing to the further deterioration seen at late stage NPC disease. For the development of additional therapeutic intervention strategies aimed at energy metabolism, it will be important to determine in more detail where and when different metabolic alterations develop, and whether these changes are potentially neuroprotective or part of the neuronal decline. Moreover, the significant alterations we observed prior to onset of symptoms once again underline the importance of early diagnosis and intervention.</p>
