        <p>To be the fittest is central to proliferation in evolutionary games. Individuals
                    thus adopt the strategies of better performing players in the hope of successful
                    reproduction. In structured populations the array of those that are eligible to
                    act as strategy sources is bounded to the immediate neighbors of each
                    individual. But which one of these strategy sources should potentially be
                    copied? Previous research dealt with this question either by selecting the
                    fittest or by selecting one player uniformly at random. Here we introduce a
                    parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that interpolates between these two extreme options.
                    Setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> equal to zero returns the random selection of the
                    opponent, while positive <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> favor the fitter
                    players. In addition, we divide the population into two groups. Players from
                    group <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> select their opponents as dictated by the parameter
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while players from group
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> do so randomly irrespective of
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We denote the fraction of players contained in groups
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. The
                    two parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> allow us to analyze in detail how aspirations in the
                    context of the prisoner's dilemma game influence the evolution of
                    cooperation. We find that for sufficiently positive values of
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> there exist a robust intermediate
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for which cooperation thrives best. The robustness of
                    this observation is tested against different levels of uncertainty in the
                    strategy adoption process <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and for different
                    interaction networks. We also provide complete phase diagrams depicting the
                    dependence of the impact of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and contrast the
                    validity of our conclusions by means of an alternative model where individual
                    aspiration levels are subject to evolution as well. Our study indicates that
                    heterogeneity in aspirations may be key for the sustainability of cooperation in
                    structured populations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Understanding the evolution of cooperation among selfish individuals in human and
                animal societies remains a grand challenge across disciplines. Evolutionary games
                are employed frequently as the theoretical framework of choice in order to interpret
                the emergence and survival of cooperative behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Hofbauer1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Szab1">[6]</xref>. The prisoner's dilemma game,
                in particular, has attracted considerable interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Nowak2">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Szolnoki1">[11]</xref> as the essential yet
                minimalist example of a social dilemma. In the original two-person one-shot game the
                two players have two strategies to choose from (cooperation and defection), and
                their payoffs depend on the simultaneous decision of both. If they choose to
                cooperate they will receive the highest collective payoff, which will be shared
                equally among them. Mutual defection, on the other hand, yields the lowest
                collective payoff. Yet to defect is tempting because it yields a higher individual
                payoff regardless of the opponent's decision. It is thus frequently so that
                both players choose not to cooperate, thus procreating the inevitable social
                dilemma. In reality, however, interactions may be repeated and the reputation of
                players compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Milinski1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Fehr1">[13]</xref>. Additionally, individuals may alter with whom they
                interact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-VanSegbroeck1">[14]</xref>, and different behaviors may be expressed when
                participants in a social interaction occupy different roles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-MaynardSmith2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Marshall1">[18]</xref>. Such and
                similar considerations have been very successful in elucidating why the unadorned
                scenario of total defection is often at odds with reality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Milinski2">[19]</xref>, where it is clear that both
                humans and animals cooperate to achieve what would be impossible by means of
                isolated efforts. Mechanisms supporting cooperation identified thus far include kin
                selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Hamilton1">[20]</xref>
                as well as many others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Szab1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Nowak3">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Perc1">[23]</xref>, and there is progress in place aimed at unifying some of
                these approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Lehmann1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Marshall2">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Probably the most vibrant of all in recent years have been advances building on the
                seminal paper by Nowak and May <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Nowak4">[26]</xref>, who showed that spatial structure may sustain
                cooperation without the aid of additional mechanisms or strategic complexity.
                Although in part anticipated by Hamilton's comments on viscous populations
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Hamilton1">[20]</xref>, it was
                fascinating to discover that structured populations, including complex and social
                networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Albert1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Boccaletti1">[29]</xref>, provide an optimal
                playground for the pursuit of cooperation. Notably, a simple rule for the evolution
                of cooperation on graphs and social networks is that natural selection favors
                cooperation if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the benefit of the
                altruistic act, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is its cost, while <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the average number
                of neighbors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Ohtsuki1">[30]</xref>. This is similar to Hamilton's rule stating that
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> should be larger than the coefficient of genetic relatedness
                between individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Hamilton1">[20]</xref>. In fact, on graphs and social networks the evolution of
                altruism can thus be fully explained by the inclusive fitness theory since the
                population is structured such that interactions are between genetic relatives on
                average <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Marshall2">[25]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Lehmann2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Grafen1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>According to the “best takes all” rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Nowak5">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Nowak6">[34]</xref> players are allowed to adopt the
                strategy of one of their neighbors, provided its payoff is higher than that from the
                other neighbors as well as from the player aspiring to improve by changing its
                strategy. Based on this relatively simple setup, it was shown that on a square
                lattice cooperators form compact clusters and so protect themselves against being
                exploited by defectors. The “best takes all” strategy adoption rule is,
                however, just one of the many possible alternatives that were considered in the
                past. Other examples include the birth-death and imitation rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Ohtsuki2">[35]</xref>, the
                proportional imitation rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Schlag1">[36]</xref>, the reinforcement learning adoption rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Wang1">[37]</xref>, or the
                Fermi-function based strategy adoption rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Szab3">[38]</xref>. The latter received substantial
                attention, particularly in the physics community, for its compatibility with the
                Monte Carlo simulation procedure and the straightforward adjustment of the level of
                uncertainty governing the strategy adoptions <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, with this
                rule the potential donor of the new strategy is selected uniformly at random from
                all the neighbors. This is somewhat untrue to what can be observed in reality, where
                in fact individuals typically aspire to their most successful neighbors rather than
                just somebody random. In this sense the “best takes all” rule seems more
                appropriate, although it fails to account for errors in judgment, uncertainty,
                external factors, and other disturbances that may vitally affect how we evaluate and
                see our co-players. Here we therefore propose a simple tunable function that
                interpolates between the “best takes all” and the random selection of a
                neighbor in a smooth fashion by means of a single parameter
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this sense the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> acts as an aspiration
                parameter, determining to what degree neighbors with a higher payoff will be
                considered more likely as potential strategy sources than other (randomly selected)
                neighbors.</p>
      <p>Aiming to further disentangle the role of aspirations, we also consider two types of
                players, denoted by type <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. While players of type
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> conform to the aspirations imposed by the value of the
                aspiration parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, type
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> players choose whom to potentially copy uniformly at random
                irrespective of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We denote the fraction of type
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> players by
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. This
                additional division of players into two groups is motivated by the overwhelming
                evidence indicating that heterogeneity, almost irrespective of its origin, promotes
                cooperative actions. Most notably associated with this statement are complex
                networks, including small-world networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Abramson1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Chen1">[41]</xref>, random regular graphs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Hauert1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Vukov1">[42]</xref>, scale-free
                networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Santos1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Perc2">[48]</xref>, as well as adaptive and growing networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Zimmermann1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Wu1">[56]</xref>. Furthermore, we
                follow the work by McNamara <italic>et al.</italic> on the coevolution of choosiness
                and cooperation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-McNamara1">[57]</xref>, in particular by omitting the separation of the
                population on two types of players and introducing the heterogeneity by means of
                normally distributed individual aspiration levels that are then also subject to
                evolution.</p>
      <p>At present, we thus investigate how aspirations on an individual level affect the
                evolution of cooperation. Having something to aspire to is crucial for progress and
                betterment. But how high should we set our goals? Should our role models be only
                overachievers and sports heroes, or is it perhaps better to aspire to achieving
                somewhat more modest goals? Here we address these questions in the context of the
                evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game and determine just how strong and how
                widespread aspirations should be for cooperation to thrive best. As we will show, a
                strong drive to excellence in the majority of the population may in fact act
                detrimental on the evolution of cooperation, while on the other hand, properly
                spread and heterogeneous aspirations may be just the key to fully eliminating the
                defectors. We will show that this holds irrespective of the structure of the
                underlying interaction network, as well as irrespective of the level of uncertainty
                by strategy adoptions <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In addition, the
                presented results will be contrasted with the output of a simple coevolutionary
                model, where individual aspirations will also be subject to evolution by means of
                natural selection. We will conclude that appropriately tuned aspirations may be seen
                as a universally applicable promoter of cooperation, which will hopefully inspire
                new studies along this line of research.</p>

                in the prisoner's dilemma die out. This is directly related to Hamilton's
                rule stating that natural selection favors cooperation if

                outcome of the prisoner's dilemma game.</p>
      <p>It is instructive to first examine characteristic snapshots of the square lattice for
                different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and

                aspiration to the fittest promotes cooperation, although the details of this claim
                depend somewhat on the value of the aspiration parameter
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For small values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> it is best if all the

                potential strategy sources uniformly at random. This can be deduced from the top
                three panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015117-g001">Fig. 1</xref> if
                compared from left to right. For large <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, however, it is best

                half chooses their role models randomly. This can be observed if one compares the
                bottom three panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015117-g001">Fig. 1</xref>
                with one another, although the difference in the overall density of cooperators
                (depicted green and blue) between the middle and the right panel is fairly small.
                Finally, the role of the aspiration parameter is more clear cut since larger

As tentatively
                deduced from the lower three snapshots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015117-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, it can also be observed that for high

                Conversely, for low <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the fraction of

      <p>Aiming to generalize the validity of our results, we present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015117-g003">Fig. 3</xref> the fraction of cooperators

                small-world network (right). The goal is to test to what extend above conclusions
                hold also on interaction networks other than the square lattice, in particular such
                that are more complex and spatially heterogenous. If comparing the obtained results
                with those presented in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015117-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, it seems save to conclude that they are
                to a very large degree qualitatively identical. Some differences nevertheless can be
                observed. The first is that what constitutes a high <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> limit is a bit higher
                on complex networks than on the regular lattice. Note that for
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the optimal fraction of type <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> players is practically

Even for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the bell-shaped
                dependence on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is far less pronounced than on the square lattice, and the
                optimal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (the peak of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is closer to
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The second difference
                is, looking relatively to the starting point at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, that the promotion of
                cooperation due to positive <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is somewhat less prolific. This is, however, not that
                surprising since complex networks in general promote cooperation already on their
                own <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Szab1">[6]</xref>, and thus
                secondary promotive mechanisms may therefore become less expressed. Aside from these
                fairly mild differences though, we can conclude that heterogenous aspirations do
                promote cooperation irrespective of the underlying interaction network, and that the
                details of the promotive effect are largely universal and predictable.</p>

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Vukov1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Perc3">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Traulsen1">[62]</xref>, and thus
                care needs to be exercised. The safest and most accurate way to approach the problem
                is by means of phase diagrams. Since we have two additional parameters
                        (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) against which we want
                to test the impact of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we determined full
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> phase diagrams for six characteristic combinations of

                Obtained results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015117-g004">Fig.
                    4</xref>. Notably, the phase diagram presented in the top left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015117-g004">Fig. 4</xref> is well-known, implying the
                existence of an optimal level of uncertainty for the evolution of cooperation, as
                was previously reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Vukov1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Perc3">[59]</xref>. In particular, note that the
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> transition line is bell shaped, indicating that
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the optimal temperature at which cooperators are able to
                survive at the highest value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Importantly though,
                this phenomenon can only be observed on interaction topologies lacking overlapping
                triangles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Szab4">[63]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Szolnoki6">[64]</xref>.
                Interestingly, increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (top row) to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (bottom row)
                completely eradicates (as do interaction networks incorporating overlapping
                triangles) the existence of an optimal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and in fact
                qualitatively reverses the dependence. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> transition line has an
                inverted bell-shaped outlay, indicating the existence of the worst rather than an
                optimal temperature <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the evolution of
                cooperation. The qualitative changes are less profound if
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is kept constant at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (top row) and
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases (from left to right). Still, however, the
                bell-shaped outlay of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> transition gives way
                to a monotonically increasing curve, saturating only for high
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These qualitative changes in the phase diagrams imply that
                increasing the aspiration parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or the fraction of
                players abiding to it (type <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) effectively alters
                the interaction network. While the square lattice obviously lacks overlapping
                triangles and thus enables the observation of an optimal
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for small enough values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (or a combination thereof, as is the case in the top left
                panels), trimming the likelihood of who will act as a strategy source and how many
                players will actually aspire to their fittest neighbors seems to effectively enhance
                linkage among essentially disconnected triplets and thus precludes the same
                observation. It is instructive to note that a similar phenomenon was observed
                recently in public goods games, where the joint membership in large groups was also
                found to alter the effective interaction network and thus the impact of uncertainly
                on the evolution of cooperation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Szolnoki6">[64]</xref>.</p>

                        qualitatively different and very much dependent on the particularities
                        players' aspirations. Note that in all the bottom panels there exist an
                        intermediate value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for which

                        be concluded that, while the aspiration based promotion of cooperation is

                        of phase transition are very much affected, which can be attributed to an
                        effective alterations of the interaction network due to preferred strategy

      <p>In terms of the facilitation of cooperation, however, it can be concluded that the

By comparing the

                conclusions were stated already upon the inspection of results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015117-g002">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015117-g003">3</xref>, and with this we now affirm that not only is
                the promotion of cooperation via heterogeneous aspirations robust against
                differences in the interaction networks, but also against variations in the
                uncertainty by strategy adoptions.</p>
      <p>It remains of interest to elucidate why then cooperative behavior is in fact promoted
                by positive values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To provide answers, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015117-g005">Fig. 5</xref> time courses of
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e227" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for different characteristic combination of the two main
                parameters that we have used throughout this work. What should attract the attention
                is the fact that in the most early stages of the evolutionary process (note that
                values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e228" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were recorded also in-between full iteration steps) it
                appears as if defectors would actually fare better than cooperators. This is
                actually what one would expect, given that defectors are, as individuals, more
                successful than cooperators and will thus be chosen more likely as potential
                strategy donors if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e229" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is positive. This
                should in turn amplify their chances of spreading and ultimately result in the
                decimation of cooperators (indeed, only between 20–30% survive). Quite
                surprisingly though, the tide changes fairly fast, and as one can observe from the
                presented time courses, frequently the more so the deeper the initial downfall of
                cooperators. We argue that for positive values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e230" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e231" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> a negative feedback effect occurs, which halts and
                eventually reverts what appears to be a march of defectors toward dominance. Namely,
                in the very early stages of the game defectors are able to plunder very efficiently,
                which quickly results in a state where there are hardly any cooperators left to
                exploit. Consequently, the few remaining clusters of cooperators start recovering
                lost ground against weakened defectors. Crucial thereby is the fact that the
                clusters formed by cooperators are impervious to defector attacks even at high
                values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e232" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> because of the positive selection towards the fittest
                neighbors acting as strategy sources (occurring for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e233" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In a sea of
                cooperators this is practically always another cooperator rather than a defector
                trying to penetrate into the cluster. This newly identified mechanism ultimately
                results in fairly widespread cooperation that goes beyond what can be warranted by
                the spatial reciprocity alone (see <italic>e.g.</italic>

                        temporary downfall of cooperators, which sets in for all depicted

      <p>Finally, it is instructive to examine whether an optimal intermediate value of
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e243" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, determining the aspiration level of player

                distributed values. This would imply that natural selection indeed favors
                individuals with a specific aspiration level, which would in turn extend the
                credibility of thus far presented results that were obtained primarily in a top-down
                manner [by optimizing a population-level property (cooperation) by means of an
                appropriate selection of parameters determining the aspiration level of
                individuals]. For this purpose we omit the division of the population on
                players of type <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e245" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e246" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and initially assign
                to every player a value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e247" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that is drawn randomly
                from a Gaussian distribution with a given mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e248" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and standard deviation

Then if player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e250" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> adopts the strategy

                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e253" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for
                details). Results obtained with this alternative coevolutionary model are presented
                in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015117-g006">Fig. 6</xref>. It can be observed
                that the initial Gaussian distribution sharpens fast around an intermediate value of
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e254" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which then gradually becomes more and more frequent in the
                population as the natural selection spontaneously eliminates the less favorable
                values that warrant a lower individual fitness. The final state is a population
                where virtually all players have an identical aspiration level
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e255" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and accordingly, the outcome in terms of the stationary
                density of cooperators is equal to that obtained with the original model having
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e256" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e257" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this sense the
                preceding results are validated and their generality extended by means of a
                bottom-up approach entailing a spontaneous coevolution towards an intermediate
                individually optimal aspiration level. We note, however, that with this simple
                coevolutionary model the result that heterogeneous aspirations promote cooperation
                is not exactly reproduced. Further studies on more sophisticated models
                incorporating coevolving aspirations are required to arrive spontaneously at a
                heterogeneous distribution of individual aspiration levels. Inspirations for this
                can be found in the recent review on coevolutionary games <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Perc1">[23]</xref>, and we are looking forward to
                further developments in this direction.</p>

      <p>We have shown that heterogenous aspiration to the fittest, <italic>i.e.</italic> the
                propensity of designating the most successful neighbor as being the role model, may
                be seen as a universally applicable promoter of cooperation that works on different
                interaction networks and under different levels of stochasticity. For low and
                moderate values of the aspiration parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e275" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cooperation thrives
                best if the total population abides to aspiring to the fittest. For large values of
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e276" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, however, it is best if only approximately half of the
                players persuasively attempt to copy their most successful neighbors while the rest
                chooses their opponents uniformly at random. The optimal evolution of cooperation
                thus requires fine-tuning of both, the density of players that are prone to aspiring
                to the fittest, as well as the aspiration parameter that determines how fit a
                neighbor actually must be in order to be considered as the potential source of the
                new strategy. In addition, by studying an alternative model where individual
                aspiration levels were also subject to evolution, we have shown that an intermediate
                value of the aspiration level emerges spontaneously through natural selection, thus
                supplementing the main results by means of a coevolutionary approach.</p>
      <p>Notably, the extensions of the prisoner's dilemma game we have considered here
                seem very reasonable and are in fact easily justifiable with realistic examples. For
                example, it is a fact that people will, in general, much more likely follow a
                successful individual than somebody who is just struggling to get by. Under certain
                adverse circumstances, like in a state of rebelion or in revolutionary times,
                however, it is also possible that individuals will be inspired to copy their less
                successful partners or those that seem to do more harm than good. In many ways it
                seems that the ones who are satisfied with just picking somebody randomly to aspire
                to are the ones that are most difficult to come by. In this sense the rather
                frequently adopted random selection of a neighbor, retrieved in our case if
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e277" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (or equivalently <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e278" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), seems in many ways
                like the least probable alternative. In this sense it is interesting to note that
                our aspiring to the fittest becomes identical to the frequently adopted, especially
                in the early seminal works on games on grids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Nowak4">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Nowak5">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-Nowak6">[34]</xref>, “best takes all”

                the “best takes all” limit, and thus a direct comparison with the
                seminal works is somewhat circumstantial, we find here that the intermediate regions
                of heterogenous aspirations offer fascinating new insights into the evolution of
                cooperation, and we hope that this work will inspire future studies, especially in
                terms of understanding the emergence of successful leaders in societies via a

      <p>As the interaction network, we use either a regular <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e293" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> square lattice, the

                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e297" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e298" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. This
                division of players is performed uniformly at random irrespective of their initial
                strategies and remains unchanged during the simulations. According to established
                procedures, each player is initially also designated either as a cooperator
                        (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e299" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) or defector (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e300" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) with equal
                probability. The game is iterated forward in accordance with the sequential
                simulation procedure comprising the following elementary steps. First, player
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e301" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> acquires its payoff <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e302" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by playing the game
                with all its neighbors. Next, we evaluate in the same way the payoffs of all the
                neighbors of player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e303" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and subsequently
                select one neighbor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e304" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> via the
                        probability<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e305" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
      <p>where the sum runs over all the neighbors of player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e306" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Importantly,
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e307" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the so-called selection or aspiration parameter that
                depends on the type of player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e308" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> according
                        to<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e309" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula></p>
      <p>Evidently, if the aspiration parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e310" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> then irrespective of
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e311" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (density of type <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e312" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> players) the most
                frequently adopted situation is recovered where player
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e313" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is chosen uniformly at random from all the neighbors of
                player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e314" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e315" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e316" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, however, Eqs. (1) and (2) introduce a preference in all
                players of type <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e317" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (but not in players of type <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e318" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to copy the strategy
                of those neighbors who have a high fitness, or equivalently, a high payoff

      <p>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e326" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the amplitude of noise or its inverse

                step involves all players <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e330" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> having a chance to
                adopt a strategy from one of their neighbors once.</p>
      <p>An alternative model, allowing for individual <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e331" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values to be subject
                to evolution as well, entails omitting the division of the population on two types
                of players and assigning to every individual an initial
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e332" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value that is drown randomly from a Gaussian distribution
                having mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e333" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and standard deviation <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e334" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as was done recently
                in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0015117-McNamara1">[57]</xref>, for
                example. Subsequently, if player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e335" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> adopts the strategy
                from player <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e336" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> following the identical procedure as described above for the
                original model, then the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e337" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> changes to that of
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e338" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as well. The key question that we aim to answer with this
                model is whether a specific aspiration level is indeed optimal for an individual to
                prosper, and if yes, does the selection pressure favor it spontaneously.
                Essentially, we are interested in the distribution of
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e339" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values after the stationary fraction of strategies in the
                population is reached. A link with the original model can be established by
                considering in this case <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e340" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to equal one and
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e341" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
      <p>Results of computer simulations were obtained on populations comprising
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e342" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e343" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> individuals, whereby
                the fraction of cooperators <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015117.e344" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was determined within

                discarded. Moreover, since the heterogeneous preferential selection of neighbors may
                introduce additional disturbances, final results were averaged over up to
