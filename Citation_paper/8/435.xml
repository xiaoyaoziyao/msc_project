        <p>Within functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the use of the traditional general linear model (GLM) based analysis methods is often restricted to strictly controlled research setups requiring a parametric activation model. Instead, Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) method is based on voxel-wise correlation between the time series of the subjects, which makes it completely non-parametric and thus suitable for naturalistic stimulus paradigms such as movie watching. In this study, we compared an ISC based analysis results with those of a GLM based in five distinct controlled research setups. We used International Consortium for Brain Mapping functional reference battery (FRB) fMRI data available from the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging image data archive. The selected data included measurements from 37 right-handed subjects, who all had performed the same five tasks from FRB. The GLM was expected to locate activations accurately in FRB data and thus provide good grounds for investigating relationship between ISC and stimulus induced fMRI activation. The statistical maps of ISC and GLM were compared with two measures. The first measure was the Pearson's correlation between the non-thresholded ISC test-statistics and absolute values of the GLM Z-statistics. The average correlation value over five tasks was 0.74. The second was the Dice index between the activation regions of the methods. The average Dice value over the tasks and three threshold levels was 0.73. The results of this study indicated how the data driven ISC analysis found the same foci as the model-based GLM analysis. The agreement of the results is highly interesting, because ISC is applicable in situations where GLM is not suitable, for example, when analyzing data from a naturalistic stimuli experiment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis method provides an opportunity for the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis under naturalistic research paradigms. In these paradigms, the stimuli are designed to be closer to normal everyday life than in conventional research paradigms. The used stimuli can be, for example, a movie or a 3D video game <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Spiers1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One of the major benefits of the ISC analysis is that it can be used to locate activations without <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the temporal composition of processes contributing to the neuronal activation. In the ISC analysis, the hemodynamic activity of a subject is used to quantify the hemodynamic activity of another subject by calculating the correlation coefficient between the corresponding fMRI time series of the subjects. Inferences about the locations of activations are solely based on the similarities in hemodynamic responses across the subjects. Instead, a massively univariate stimulus-model-based analysis in fMRI predominantly relies on the theory of general linear models that provide a framework of analyzing subjects fMRI responses with respect to the model of the known and fixed stimulus type, typically appearing as the columns of the design (or predictor) matrix in the GLM. This often restricts the application of these GLM-based analyses to strictly controlled research setups as the parametric model for the BOLD signal changes related to the activation have to be defined <italic>a priori</italic>. The major difference between ISC and GLM based analyses is that the former is completely non-parametric in the sense it does not require any parametric form for the stimulus time-course while the latter requires a model for the stimulus time course. We note that there is a direct connection between the statistical analysis of a slope parameter in a simple regression, i.e., a simplified version of a single subject GLM-based analysis and a correlation coefficient. In what follows, we will use the terms ISC and GLM analysis rather loosely, referring to the major difference explained above rather than to the technical details of computations and statistics involved.</p>
      <p>Hasson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hasson1">[2]</xref> introduced the concept of ISC in fMRI and demonstrated that a simple movie stimulus produced significant correlations between the voxel-wise fMRI time series of the subjects, especially in visual and auditory cortices. Since then ISC analysis has been applied to investigate speech comprehension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Wilson1">[3]</xref>, auditory abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hejnar1">[4]</xref>, memory encoding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hasson2">[5]</xref> and brain functions during movie watching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hasson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Jskelinen1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hasson3">[8]</xref>. In a particular relation to this work, Kauppi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Kauppi1">[9]</xref> developed a new ISC based method by adding an option to compute the frequency specific ISC and designed novel non-parametric resampling tests to make inferences about ISCs. Resampling tests were designed, since the data was not guaranteed to be uncorrelated as Heijnar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hejnar1">[4]</xref> had earlier noted. Significant ISCs were found in visual and auditory areas in line with earlier neurocinematics studies and additionally in pre-frontal cortical areas when studying low frequency bands.</p>
      <p>One of the main questions concerning the ISC analysis is how to interpret correlations between subjects. Because the ISC measures the similarity of subjects' Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses during the same stimulus, a high ISC does not directly imply a high degree of task (or stimulus) related activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hejnar1">[4]</xref>. However, it has been shown by comparing intracranial single-unit and local field potential recordings of epilepsy patients and fMRI of healthy subjects experiencing the same movie stimulus that the correlated firing rate in a local population of neurons correlates with the BOLD response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Mukamel1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Nir1">[11]</xref>). Further, Hanson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hanson1">[12]</xref> argued that if there are correlations between individual subjects, who all experience the same stimuli, most of the correlated activations should be caused by the stimuli and so it might be possible to find the activity patterns of the brain even in complex situations.</p>
      <p>A parametric GLM-based analysis is a standard method for detecting task-related activations in fMRI. Therefore, a potential way to investigate whether an ISC analysis method can locate activated brain regions due to stimulus presentation is to compare the results of the ISC analysis with those of the GLM analysis for the same fMRI data.</p>
      <p>In this case, the data must be acquired under strictly controlled experimental setting so that the GLM analysis can be performed reliably. Previously, Heijnar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hejnar1">[4]</xref> studied ISCs of 20 subjects with the fMRI data acquired during the auditory oddball task and compared the results with those of the GLM. Multi-subject ISC maps were thresholded empirically, as it was noted that statistical thresholds cannot be obtained using standard statistical approaches due to dependencies between the correlations. The comparison was limited to the visual analysis of the activation maps. The conclusion was that the ISC analysis could find the same activation foci as GLM but ISC also found foci which were not visible in the model-based results.</p>
      <p>Also in this work, we compare the ISC analysis results with those of the model-based GLM method to investigate the accuracy of the non model-based ISC analysis method detecting activated brain regions. We considerably extend the study of Hejnar et al. by incorporating more tasks and subjects to the comparative analysis. Moreover, we evaluate the similarity of the analysis results quantitatively and use a resampling-based method to obtain statistical thresholds for the ISC brain maps. It is important to use automatic thresholding scheme instead of a manual threshold selection to avoid a possible user-dependent bias in the comparison.</p>
      <p>We use the GLM as a reference method in the comparison since it is a standard data analysis tool for locating brain activations in fMRI. The key difference between ISC and GLM methods is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g001">Figure 1</xref>. ISC analysis combines voxel-wise correlations between several subject pairs in a fully non-parametric way to a single multi-subject statistical measure. Instead, GLM first compares voxel-wise the fMRI time series of each individual with a predefined model of the hemodynamic activity and then combines the results to a single multi-subject statistic. It is obvious that unlike the ISC method, where the model is not needed, GLM is not easily applicable to analyzing fMRI datasets acquired under complex stimuli for which the construction of the parametric model is far too difficult. Thus, it is necessary to use fMRI datasets which are acquired under strictly controlled experimental settings in order to carry out reliable validation, where the parametric model is guaranteed to succeed extremely well and this way provide the ground-truth for the non-parametric study.</p>

        <title>ICBM functional reference battery data</title>
        <p>For this study, we used fMRI data from the measurements with Functional Reference Battery tasks developed by the International Consortium for Human Brain Mapping (ICBM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Mazziotta1">[13]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ICBM/Downloads/Downloads_FRB.shtml" xlink:type="simple">http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ICBM/Downloads/Downloads_FRB.shtml</ext-link>) The data was obtained from ICBM database in the Image Data Archieve (IDA) of the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ICBM" xlink:type="simple">http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ICBM</ext-link>). The ICBM project (Principal Investigator John Mazziotta, M.D., University of California, Los Angeles) is supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and BioEngineering. ICBM is the result of efforts of co-investigators from UCLA, Montreal Neurologic Institute, University of Texas at San Antonio, and the Institute of Medicine, Juelich/Heinrich Heine University - Germany.</p>
        <p>The selected data included measurements from 37 healthy right-handed subjects (19 men and 18 women; average age was 28.2 years from the range of 20–36 years), who had all performed the five selected tasks from FRB. The functional data was collected with a 3 Tesla Siemens Allegra fMRI scanner and the anatomical T1 weighted MRI data with an 1.5 Tesla Siemens Sonata scanner. The TR/TE times for the functional data were 4 s/32 ms, flip angle 90 degree, pixel spacing 2 mm and slice thickness 2 mm. The parameters for the anatomical T1 data were 1.1 s/4.38 ms, 15 degree, 1 mm and 1 mm, correspondingly.</p>
        <p>Similarly to Bellec et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Bellec1">[14]</xref>, we restricted the age range of the subjects to 20–38 years. In the database, this resulted to 41 right-handed subjects who had fMRI measurements from all five different FRB tasks: auditory naming (AN), external ordering (EO), hand imitation (HA), oculomotor (OM) and verbal generation (VG). The image data was pre-screened before analysis to ensure high quality of the data. According to pre-screening, fMRI data from four subjects were discarded because of a poor data quality for at least one task in the battery.</p>
        <sec id="s2a1">
          <title>FRB tasks</title>
          <p>The detailed task definitions of the functional reference battery are included in the FRB software package and they are next explained briefly here. All the five FRB task designs had the same block-structure in their implementations and they consisted of consecutive ‘off’ and ‘on’ blocks. There were 12 blocks per run (6 ‘off-on’) and 3 volumes at the beginning of the run to wait for magnetisation stabilisation. The blocks lasted 28 s so that ‘off-on’ phases lasted totally 56 s. This created finally 5 min 48 s duration for the whole experiment where there were 12 blocks (six ‘off’ and six ‘on’ blocks) for each run with 7 volumes in each block.</p>
          <p>In every task, the ‘off’ block instruction was the same: the subjects had to respond with the left mouse button press every time they saw an arrow pointing to the left. The different ‘on’ blocks were defined separately for each task.</p>
          <p>In the first task, AN, subjects were instructed to listen to the description of an object from a sound file and then think their answer silently to the description. The stimulus had first 2 s of silence, then 1.5 s of description and finally again 2 s of silence. This is a language task with an auditory input modality and the FRB definition noted that auditory cortex should be activated here (in addition to language areas).</p>
          <p>In the EO task, which is a working memory task, the subjects were presented with four abstract design stimuli followed by a fifth stimulus and required to recall whether the final abstract design was among the four presented previously. The designs were visible for 450 ms and the screen was blank 50 ms between the designs. The subjects responded via a button press whether the final stimulus was among the four previously shown. This test was repeated five times during each ‘on’ block.</p>
          <p>In the HA task subjects were instructed to imitate the presented hand configuration with their right hand. The example hand configurations were presented to them with pictures on the screen. Each hand position was presented for 3.5 s. This is a task requiring higher order motor coordination and motor planning and in the FRB description, it was noted that this task should activate the frontal and parietal areas.</p>
          <p>In the OM task subjects were watching an image including a central cross in the middle surrounded by 10 black boxes. Subjects were instructed to concentrate on the central cross and saccade to the surrounding box if it changed white for a moment. After this, they should have returned their gaze immediately to the central cross. In each ‘on’ block there were 20 fixation trials and 20 target trials. There were four fixations of each of the following durations: 800 ms, 1000 ms, 1200 ms, 1400 ms, and 1600. These were randomized and each were followed by a 200 ms target trial. This way the task was supposed to activate the visual system and the occipital lobe.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the VG task, the images of certain objects were shown to the subjects on the screen and subjects were instructed to generate a verb associated to the object silently in their mind without saying it aloud. During the ‘on’ blocks, line drawings were presented for 0.5 s. This task is a language task with visual input and was noted to activate the language and visual areas.</p>

          <title>Pre-processing</title>
          <p>Pre-processing and the GLM part of statistical analysis were performed by using the program FSL (version 4.1.6) [Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), Oxford University, Oxford, U.K.] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Smith1">[15]</xref>. The data processing in FEAT (version 5.98) was done in three phases. First, motion correction was performed using the FSL's MCFLIRT by maximizing the correlation ratio between each time point and the middle volume, using linear interpolation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Jenkinson1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Jenkinson2">[17]</xref>. Second, the Brain extraction tool (BET) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Smith2">[18]</xref> was applied to to extract the brain volume from functional data. Finally, the images were temporally high-pass filtered with a cutoff period of 60 s and the spatial smoothing was applied with a Gaussian kernel with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 5 mm. The original data had 87 volumes with three stabilization volumes, which were discarded from the analysis. The brain extraction from the anatomical T1 images was also performed by BET, but this was done manually for each T1-weighted image separately from the FEAT procedure as the parameters of BET required individual tuning.</p>
          <p>The image registration was performed in two phases using FSL Linear Registration Tool (FLIRT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Jenkinson1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Jenkinson2">[17]</xref>. First, the skull-stripped functional images were aligned (6 degrees of freedom, full search) to the skull-stripped high-resolution T1-weighted image of the same subject, and then the results were aligned to the standard (brain only) ICBM-152 template (12 degrees of freedom, full search).</p>

          <title>General Linear Model with FEAT</title>
          <p>After preprocessing, the GLM was performed at the single subject level with the FSL (FEAT, fMRI Expert Analysis Tool) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Beckmann1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Woolrich1">[20]</xref>. Most of the processing options were chosen according to the defaults of FEAT. The model was defined for 84 volumes where each block had the length of seven volumes. The length of the block in volumes was computed from the timing of the tasks and the scanning parameters (28 s divided by 4 s). The boxcar model was designed with the three-column format of FEAT. In this format it was possible to define separately for every block the current value of the model (one for each ‘on’ block), starting point in time from the beginning of experiment, and duration of the current block from the starting point. Then, the model was convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) (a single <inline-formula id="pone.0041196.e006"><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041196.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-function modeling: phase 0 s, standard deviation 3 s, mean lag 6 s) along to its temporal derivative. Finally, the same default high pass filtering as applied to experimental data (with a cutoff of 60 s) was applied to the model. The analysis itself was performed with the FILM prewhitening procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Woolrich2">[21]</xref>.</p>

          <p>The ISC analysis was performed using ISCtoolbox for Matlab by Kauppi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Kauppi1">[9]</xref> ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://code.google.com/p/isc-toolbox/" xlink:type="simple">http://code.google.com/p/isc-toolbox/</ext-link>). This implementation can perform the ISC analysis over the specific frequency bands of the time series and threshold the results via voxel-wise resampling with the selected significance level. In this study, the analysis was performed only across the full frequency band.</p>
          <p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Kauppi1">[9]</xref>, the ISC is defined as a multi-subject similarity measure as follows. First, Pearson's correlation coefficient is calculated voxel-wise between every pair of subjects as:</p>

          <p>The statistical inference with this measure is complicated by the dependency of 666 correlation coefficients. To account for this problem a fully non-parametric voxel-wise resampling test is implemented in the ISC toolbox. This test accounts for temporal correlations inherent to fMRI data (for details of the test, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Kauppi1">[9]</xref>). Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Kauppi1">[9]</xref>, we approximated resampling distribution with 1,000,000 realizations and corrected the resulting p-values using an FDR-based multiple comparison correction with independence or positive dependence assumption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Benjamini1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Genovese1">[23]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Simulated Data</title>
        <p>In order to obtain quantitative validation results against a known ground truth, we generated four sets of simulated imaging data with different noise levels mimicking the real data which was used in the study. Each set contained 37 simulated functional images in the standard ICBM-152 space. Each voxel in these images was either activated or not activated. Activation regions were selected according to the binarized GLM analysis results of AN task with the threshold level of q<inline-formula id="pone.0041196.e038"><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041196.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.05. A hemodynamic signal was included in the timeseries of the voxels in the activated regions. The signal was selected to be exactly the same which was used as a model in the GLM analysis, i.e., a boxcar convolved with a canonical HRF. Finally, pink 1 f noise generated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Smith3">[24]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Example_Synthesis_1_F_Noise.html" xlink:type="simple">https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Example_Synthesis_1_F_Noise.html</ext-link>) was added to every timeseries in the volume. The power of the noise was 100, 200, 500 and 1000 times stronger than the power of the included hemodynamic signal resulting to signal to noise ratios (SNR) of 0.01, 0.005, 0.002 and 0.0001. The areas outside the activated regions contained only the noise signal. The simulation procedure was exactly the same for every 37 simulated images, that is, we ignored the anatomical and effect size variations between subjects.</p>
        <p>The pink noise was chosen in the simulations due to empirical evidence that fMRI noise time-series contains 1 f-like noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Zarahn1">[25]</xref>.

The sums were computed over the whole volumes (M = 91×109×91 = 902629 voxels).</p>
        <p>The resulting Dice index values vary between 0–1, where 1 denotes the exact similarity and 0 denotes no overlap. To further ease the interpretation of Dice indices, we can utilize the relationship between the Dice index and Kappa coefficient. Zijdenbos et al. showed that under certain assumptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Zijdenbos1">[27]</xref>, which are valid here, the Dice index is (asymptotically) equal to Kappa coefficient. According to Landis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Landis1">[28]</xref> the Kappa coefficient values can be divided into six categories: less than 0, “No agreement”; 0–0.2, “Slight agreement”; 0.2–0.4, “Fair agreement”; 0.4–0.6, “Moderate agreement”; 0.6–0.8, “Substantial agreement”; 0.8–1.0, “Almost perfect agreement”. These categories are ad-hoc, but widely used. The relationship between Dice index and Kappa coefficient is further described by Finch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Finch1">[29]</xref>. Dice index was chosen instead of Kappa, because it is better suited to for our purposes since it ignores the non-activated regions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Zijdenbos1">[27]</xref> for more details) and it is widely used as the performance index in the evaluation of medical image segmentation algorithms.</p>

      <p>The Dice index, Eq. (4), between binary maps resulted in the average value of 0.73 across the tasks and the thresholds. The average Dice index values across the three thresholds for the specific tasks ranged from 0.65 to 0.81. The average over the tasks varied from 0.72 to 0.74 depending on the threshold. The results are presented in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041196-t003">Table 3</xref>. When comparing these with the Kappa categories discussed earlier, the similarity of the thresholded statistical maps of ISC and GLM had a moderate (0.4–0.6, 3 values), substantial (0.6–0.8, 9 values) or almost perfect (0.8–1.0, 3 values) agreement. Most of the Dice indices were at the level of substantial agreement. The Dice index values of the VG task were most stable across the thresholds (0.77, 0.81, 0.77), whereas the corresponding values of the EO task were most variable (0.76, 0.66, 0.56). With the tasks AN, HA, and OM, the values of the Dice indices with the two tightest threshold levels were close to each other but the values were notably lower with the most liberal level. These results indicated that the q = 0.05 level might be too liberal for this kind of study. The correlation and Dice index results are visualized together in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g002">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

          <p>The bars show the correlation measure between ISC and GLM and the lines present the Dice index values from different significance levels. The continuous black line presents the average over the Dice values within the current task. The HA task has higher correlation measure than other tasks and a high Dice index value. The EO task has the lowest correlation measure and the Dice index is also lower and varies the most with the thresholds. This suggests that a high correlation measure predicts a high Dice index value. We note that the values used as the basis for this figure are of higher numerical precision than those reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041196-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041196-t003">3</xref>.</p>

      <p>With the AN task, both methods detected activations in auditory cortex, visual cortex, and cingulate gyrus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This was as expected based on the FRB task definition and comparison to the previous fMRI studies with the AN task through a meta-analysis tool Pubbrain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pubbrain.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.pubbrain.org</ext-link>). With the EO task, the activations according to both methods were in lateral occipital cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and supplementary motor cortex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As we expected, these results were highly similar to the detected activations of the healthy control subjects in the study of Hamilton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hamilton1">[30]</xref> which studied the same EO task as we were using here. With the HA task, there were activations in multiple parietal areas and inferior frontal gyrus and cingulate gyrus in the frontal lobe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These were as expected (the FRB description noted that this task should activate at least frontal and parietal areas). With the HA task, ISC (but not GLM) detected activation in precuneous cortex. The activation remained visible even with the tightest threshold presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g006">Figure 6</xref>. Based on a review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Cavanna1">[31]</xref>, it seems plausible that the precuneous is active during the hand imitation task. With the OM task, there were activations present at precentral gyrus, occipital pole, supplementary motor cortex and lateral occipital cortex (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041196.s005">Figure S5</xref> of Supplement). These were as expected as the FRB description noted that the task should activate the visual system and the occipital lobe. With the VG task, activations at inferior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, temporal occipital fusiform cortex, lingual gyrus, occipital pole, lateral occipital cortex and supplementary motor cortex were detected (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041196.s007">Figure S7</xref> of Supplement). These were as expected as the FRB definition noted that the task should activate language and visual areas.</p>
      <p>Two general trends were noticeable from the overlay images. First, with the EO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and VG tasks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041196.s007">Figure S7</xref> of Supplement), the ISC analysis was generally more conservative than the GLM analysis for detecting activation areas, because the number of voxels detected only by GLM (blue) was high and common areas (red) were surrounded by these (blue) areas. Second, with the tasks AN, HA and OM, ISC tended to find more activated voxels than the GLM when the most liberal threshold (q<inline-formula id="pone.0041196.e081"><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041196.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.05) was used. Thus, GLM analysis was more conservative of the two methods. However, the situation was reversed when the most tightest threshold (q<inline-formula id="pone.0041196.e082"><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041196.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.001) was used, i.e., ISC analysis became more conservative than the GLM analysis. This is also visible in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g007">Figure 7</xref>, which presents the voxels that were consistently detected as activated up by one method and not the other method for the AN task.

This was done because it was expected that both high negative (de-activations) and high positive (activations) <inline-formula id="pone.0041196.e085"><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041196.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-values relate to high positive <inline-formula id="pone.0041196.e086"><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041196.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values. To validate this hypothesis, we computed the correlation between signed <inline-formula id="pone.0041196.e087"><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041196.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-values and <inline-formula id="pone.0041196.e088"><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041196.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-values. In that case, the correlation measures dropped to 0.50, 0.53, 0.74, 0.70 and 0.57 for AN, EO, HA, OM and VG tasks, respectively. By comparing these values to the values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041196-t002">Table 2</xref>, we can see that the decrease was larger with the low correlation tasks (0.19 (AN), 0.16(EO) and 0.18 (VG)) and smaller with high correlation tasks (0.10 (HA), 0.06(OM)).</p>
      <p>With the simulated data, the Dice indices between the activations detected (either by ISC or GLM) and the ground truth are presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g008">Figure 8</xref> for different noise and thresholding levels. Average Dice index was 0.76 for ISC and 0.81 for GLM. The non-parametric ISC method detected simulated activations very accurately when the SNR was 0.002 or greater. Only with the highest noise level and especially with the most conservative thresholding level, the accuracy of ISC was poor (Dice index below 0.4) as it failed to detect the truly activated voxels. The lower Dice indices for GLM with the two lowest levels of noise were due to enlargening of the activation regions due to filtering. In other words, the GLM-based analysis was too sensitive in this highly idealized setting. Overall, we consider that the performance of the two methods was similar at the three lowest noise levels and only at the highest noise level the advantages of using stimulus model derived information as in GLM became clearly apparent.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have compared activations detected by two different fMRI data analysis methods: a standard model-based GLM method and a non-parametric ISC method. The major difference between these two flavours of analyses is that the the former requires a model for the stimulus time course while the latter is completely non-parametric in the sense it does not require any parametric form for the stimulus time-course. This means that the ISC can be used to analyze fMRI data acquired from the experiments of complex multi-dimensional stimuli, e.g., a movie. The used datasets were deliberately chosen so that they were optimized for the GLM type analysis to maximize the accuracy of the GLM analysis. The data was acquired from the ICBM research database, which contains fMRI acquisitions during highly standardized FRB stimuli. The data was pre-processed and separately analyzed with GLM (FSL) and ISC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Kauppi1">[9]</xref>. The Pearson's correlation was computed between corresponding statistics of ISC and GLM. The statistical maps from both methods were thresholded while accounting for the multiple comparisons based on FDR. The resulting binarized thresholded maps were compared by computing Dice index between them.</p>
      <p>The correlations between GLM and ISC statistics validated the original assumption of the similarity of the measures used to quantify the activations. The average correlation value over all five tasks was 0.74, which can be considered as a high correlation. The average Dice-index over all five tasks varied between 0.72 and 0.74 depending on the task. As noted earlier, nine of the 15 Dice values were classified as substantial agreement (0.6–0.8) and three of the 15 as almost perfect agreement according to a widely used Landis and Koch categorization. Not surprisingly, the tasks with the highest Pearson's correlations featured the highest (and the most stable) Dice index values.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the activations detected by ISC matched well with the activations detected by GLM. The activation maps presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g006">6</xref> illustrate that ISC method was slightly more conservative than GLM method especially at the most conservative thresholding level q<inline-formula id="pone.0041196.e089"><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041196.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.001 presented in the figures. The development is easiest to see from the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g003">Figure 3</xref> where all threshold levels are present (See also the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041196.s005">Figures S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041196.s007">S7</xref> of Supplement). In most of these cases, the area of common activation (in red) was surrounded by GLM only activation area (in blue) indicating that ISC had found the same overall activation location as GLM method. This result is promising from the fMRI data analysis point of view under naturalistic paradigms, because it suggests that the nonparametric ISC method can locate true sources of BOLD signal activity well and yet it is not susceptible to spurious findings, easily leading to overinterpretation of the results.</p>
      <p>The variation in the correlation measure (range 0.69–0.83) and Dice index (range 0.54–0.86) could have resulted from the differences in the nature of the behavioral tasks. Especially, the EO task had lower correlation value and Dice index than other tasks, probably because it is the most complex task in FRB designed to activate working memory. Surprisingly, the Dice and correlation measures of the AN and the VG tasks were different although the tasks are similar.</p>
      <p>The simulation study demonstrated that the ISC could in principle accurately detect activations even when the signal to noise ratio was as low as 0.002. The lower Dice index values of GLM than those of ISC with the simulated databases with low noise levels (SNR 0.01 and 0.005) could be largely attributed to the spatial smoothing applied to the data before analysis. (With higher noise levels, the leakage of the activation to the voxels surrounding the true activation region by smoothing became harder to detect and thus GLM detected more accurately true activation areas.) As the FWHM of the smoothing kernel was the same for both methods this indicates ISC was more conservative (or less sensitive) than GLM. This phenomenon was observed also with experimental data - albeit to a lesser extent. As the simulation model was idealized and greatly simplified ignoring all between-subject variability, the results with simulated data should be interpreted with caution expecially regarding the exact noise levels that ISC could tolerate.</p>
      <p>In this study, we used a relatively large database of 37 subjects. One interesting topic for future research would be to test comprehensively how the number of subjects affects the ISC analysis and what is the minimum number of subjects for the ISC analysis. Some results in this direction were presented by Hanson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hanson1">[12]</xref> who demonstrated (but did not quantify) the stability of Roy's largest root statistic based ISC analysis after six or more subjects with a video stimulus of length of 156 s. However, for example, the reproducibility of ISC across subject samples remains an almost untouched research topic. Another slightly unusual aspect of the data is rather long TR of 4 seconds. It is difficult to speculate what effects this would have to the results of the method comparison as the two methods might react differently to the shortening of repetition time. However, it is important to note that recent ISC applications have typically used shorter TRs from 1.5 to 2 seconds.</p>
      <p>Certain methodological choices warrant commenting. The GLM was used as the reference method because it is the standard method for analyzing fMRI studies acquired under a strictly controlled stimulus. The particular implementation of the multi-subject GLM (FSL's FLAME using MCMC) was selected because it is widely used and properly evaluated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Smith1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Woolrich1">[20]</xref>. In particular, a computationally heavy MCMC approach was selected due to its accuracy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Woolrich1">[20]</xref>. Obviously, activations detected by GLM cannot be considered as ground truth and we therefore verified that our GLM analysis results to matched to the prior expectations based on fMRI literature. This was done by comparing our analysis results with the information available through a meta-analysis tool Pubbrain. In the GLM-based fMRI analysis, it is often recommendable and more typical to apply a family-wise error rate based multiple comparisons correction (either in voxel or cluster level) instead of a more liberal FDR-based criterion adopted by us (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Logan1">[32]</xref> for a comparison of different multiple comparison options in fMRI). We adopted it, since FDR is a natural choice for ISC analysis and it is essential to compare detected activations at the same significance level. Indeed, as can be noted based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g003">Figure 3</xref>, especially the FDR level q<inline-formula id="pone.0041196.e090"><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041196.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.05 was liberal (technically, we could expect 5% of the activated voxels to be false positives) and some of the activations were likely to be due to imaging artefacts. In visual inspection, both ISC and GLM seemed to detect activations that could be suspected to be artefactual at the most liberal thresholding level while at the most conservative thresholding level activations that could be easily labeled as artefactual were almost non-existent.</p>
      <p>Obviously, there are also methodological choices related to the ISC analysis although the methodological literature about ISC is scarce compared to that of the model-based GLM analysis. The first choice is that of the test statistic, in this work given in Eq. 2. Alternatives to this statistic include average of Z-transformed correlation coefficients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Wilson1">[3]</xref>, Roy's largest root <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hanson1">[12]</xref>, and average correlation coefficient between subjects response time-course and an averaged response time course <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Lerner1">[33]</xref>. In the latter, the order of the averaging and normalization to unit variance is reversed compared to our test statistic leading to a different (but related) test-statistic. Our preference of the test statistic selected in this work relate to its easy interpretation in the simple case that the true correlation between all subjects' time series has an equal value (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Kauppi1">[9]</xref>). However, we speculate that the choice of test statistic is not critical unless the number of subjects or time-points is much smaller than here and, in particular, the qualitative results of this work do not rely on a particular choice of test statistic. The second, we think more critical, choice is that of the thresholding procedure. The important question here is if the hypothesis testing relying on parametric models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Wilson1">[3]</xref>) could replace more computationally heavy resampling procedures (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Lerner1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Kauppi1">[9]</xref>, and this work). In this work, we have experimentally shown that a time-domain resampling test produces inference results comparable to model-based activation detection. Further work is required to identify the most optimal thresholding scheme.</p>
      <p>An interesting detail can be observed by studying activations detected only by ISC colored in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041196-g007">Figure 7</xref>. These activations detected by solely by ISC included voxels from Posterior and Anterior cingulate cortex and Precuneus as well as Occipital lobe. Similar patterns of activations detected solely by ISC can also be found by inspecting the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041196.s010">Figures S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041196.s011">S11</xref> in the Supplement. These areas are suspected to overlap with the default mode network in several studies, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Raichle1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Calhoun1">[36]</xref>. In a wider scope, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hasson3">[8]</xref> suggested that that naturalistic stimulation may provide a complementary tool to the resting state protocol for studying the default mode network.</p>
      <p>Both the ISC- and GLM-based statistics presented here focus on shared responses across subjects while allowing some intersubject variablity in the models via mixed effects modelling (GLM) or how the hypothesis testing is performed (ISC). This seems to be a reasonable assumption in the tasks presented here, but under other kind of experiments intersubject variability can be considerably higher and harder to model due to individual differences in information processing. The investigation of these differences requires the use of more sensitive methods which take better into account the variability across subjects. For instance, clustering approach presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Kauppi2">[37]</xref> preserves the entire structure of the intersubject correlation matrices, making it a suitable method for investigating differences and similarities in brain responses in data-driven manner even for a large group of subjects simultaneously. Another approach was presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041196-Hasson4">[38]</xref>, where individual differences were investigated by comparing the results of group-level ISC analysis and intra-subject correlation analysis computed across repeated presentations.</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that the ISC analysis can be used to find the same activation areas as the stimulus model-based GLM analysis when the parametric form of the stimulus is known. The motivation for this study is that ISC-based methods do not require the model of the stimulus time course and therefore they can be used in many research settings where the parametric modeling of the stimulus is not applicable. For example, movies provide an interesting form of a more naturalistic stimulus that is impossible to model completely and where the applicability of the parametric model based methods for activation detection is therefore limited.</p>
