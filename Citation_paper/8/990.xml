<title>Background</title>
<p>Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) are mild diuretics, hence not widely used in fluid overloaded states. They are however the treatment of choice for certain non-kidney conditions. Thiazides, specific inhibitors of Na-Cl cotransport (NCC), are mild agents and the most widely used diuretics in the world for control of mild hypertension.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Hypothesis</title>
<p>In addition to inhibiting the salt reabsorption in the proximal tubule, CAIs down-regulate pendrin, therefore leaving NCC as the major salt absorbing transporter in the distal nephron, and hence allowing for massive diuresis by the inhibitors of NCC in the setting of increased delivery of salt from the proximal tubule.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Experimental Protocols and Results</title>
<p>Daily treatment of rats with acetazolamide (ACTZ), a known CAI, for 10 days caused mild diuresis whereas daily treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for 4 days caused hardly any diuresis. However, treatment of rats that were pretreated with ACTZ for 6 days with a combination of ACTZ plus HCTZ for 4 additional days increased the urine output by greater than 2 fold (p&lt;0.001, n = 5) compared to ACTZ-treated animals. Sodium excretion increased by 80% in the ACTZ plus HCTZ group and animals developed significant volume depletion, metabolic alkalosis and pre-renal failure. Molecular studies demonstrated ∼75% reduction in pendrin expression by ACTZ. The increased urine output in ACTZ/HCTZ treated rats was associated with a significant reduction in urine osmolality and reduced membrane localization of AQP-2 (aquaporin2).</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These results indicate that ACTZ down-regulates pendrin expression and leaves NCC as the major salt absorbing transporter in the distal nephron in the setting of increased delivery of salt from the proximal tubule. Despite being considered mild agents individually, we propose that the combination of ACTZ and HCTZ is a powerful diuretic regimen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kidney plays an essential role in vascular volume homeostasis through the reabsorption of filtered sodium, chloride and water in various nephron segments. The proximal tubule reabsorbs around 60% while the thick ascending limb reabsorbs almost 30% of filtered load of NaCl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Aronson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Ecelbarger1">[6]</xref>. The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) reabsorbs approximately 7–9% of the filtered salt and the remaining fraction is reabsorbed in the connecting tubule (CNT) and the collecting duct (CD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Hebert1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Wall1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>The apical Na-Cl co-transporter (NCC) is the main salt absorbing transporter in the DCT and is specifically inhibited by thiazide derivatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Hebert1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Ellison1">[8]</xref>. The Cl<sup>−</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> exchanger pendrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Soleimani1">[10]</xref> works in tandem with the epithelial sodium channel ENaC and in part with the sodium dependent Cl<sup>−</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub> exchanger (NDCBE) to mediate salt reabsorption in CNT and CCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Wall1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Eladari1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Carbonic anhydrases play important roles in acid base transport in the proximal tubule and the collecting duct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Purkerson1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Alper1">[13]</xref>. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity in the proximal tubule by acetazolamide blocks the apical Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger activity and decreases sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Purkerson1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Schwartz1">[14]</xref>. Short-term (1 or 2 weeks) inhibition of carbonic anhydrases causes significant remodeling of cellular profile in the collecting duct, with a specific reduction in B-intercalated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Bagnis1">[15]</xref>. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are regularly used for the treatment of elevated intracranial pressure in pseudotumor cerebri and increased intraocular pressure in glaucoma by reducing the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and aqueous humor, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Friedman1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Toris1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is the most widely used diuretic in the world for the treatment of mild and moderate hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Messerli1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Ko1">[19]</xref>. Despite being a specific inhibitor of NCC in the DCT hydrochlorothiazide causes a very mild diuretic response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Messerli1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Uchida1">[20]</xref>. This observation is in agreement with studies indicating that NCC deletion in mouse causes very little salt wasting under basal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Schultheis1">[21]</xref>. A recent study by our laboratory tested the hypothesis that NCC and pendrin, which are located in close proximity of each other in the distal nephron, compensate for loss of the other under basal conditions thereby masking the role that each plays in salt reabsorption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Soleimani2">[22]</xref>. Toward this goal, pendrin and the NaCl co-transporter (NCC) double-knockout mice were generated, which showed significant salt and fluid wasting along with volume depletion and pre-renal failure under baseline conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Soleimani2">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that carbonic anhydrase inhibition by ACTZ down-regulates pendrin, therefore leaving NCC as the only major salt absorbing transporter in the distal nephron. As such, we postulate that the addition of HCTZ, which inhibits NCC, should cause profound diuresis, subsequent to the inactivation of pendrin and NCC in the face of increased delivery of salt from proximal tubule. The results presented in this manuscript support this hypothesis. We propose that patients that are treated with ACTZ for pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) or other non-kidney conditions, such as glaucoma, should avoid taking HCTZ for hypertension due to profound diuretic effect of the combination therapy.</p>

<title>Effect of ACTZ, HCTZ or ACTZ plus HCTZ on kidney function parameters</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g001"><bold>Figure 1a</bold></xref> (top panel) examines the effect of ACTZ and HCTZ, alone or in combination on kidney function parameters. Daily treatment with ACTZ causes moderate diuresis in rats, with urine output increasing from 11.5 to ∼24 ml/day (data shown for day 10 of ACTZ treatment; p&lt;0.05, n = 5). Daily injection with HCTZ alone for 4 days caused a very mild diuresis, with urine output increasing from a baseline of 11.0 to 13.7 ml/day on day 4 of treatment (data shown for day 4 of HCTZ treatment; p&gt;0.05, n = 5). However, in rats that were primed with ACTZ for 6 days, daily treatment with HCTZ and ACTZ for 4 additional days increased the urine output from 25 to 59 ml/day on the final day of HCTZ/ACTZ co-administration (data shown for day 4 of HCTZ/ACTZ co-treatment, p&lt;0.001, n = 5). Corrected for body weights the urine outputs are 54.3+/−4.4, 66.6+/−8.50, 105.8+/−9.8 and 242.8+/−28.62 ml/kg/day for control, ACTZ, HCTZ and ACTZ/HCTZ treated groups, respectively, with ACTZ/HCTZ treated rats showing significant differences with the 3 other groups (p&lt;0.004 vs. all three other groups, n = 5 in each group). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g001"><bold>Figure 1b</bold></xref> shows urine osmolality measurements in experimental groups and indicates that while HCTZ treatment for 4 days had no significant effect on urine osmolality, ACTZ-treated rats showed a reduction in their urine osmolality after 6 and 10 days of treatment (p&lt;0.05 vs. vehicle; n = 5/group). The highest reduction in urine osmolality, however, belonged to ACTZ/HCTZ-treated group (p&lt;0.01 vs. vehicle and &lt;0.05 vs. ACTZ alone; n = 5/group).</p>

<p>Rats (n = 5/group) treated with vehicle (10 days), ACTZ (10 days), HCTZ (4 days) and pretreatment with ACTZ (6 days) followed by treatment with ACTZ/HCTZ for 4 days (10 days total) were subjected to balanced studies. <bold>a.

<p>The greater than 2 fold increase in urine output by HCTZ/ACTZ group compared to HCTZ treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>) warranted the examination of time matched control vs. ACTZ alone. Toward this end, the effect ACTZ, alone or in combination with HCTZ, on urine output was determined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g001">Fig. 1c and d</xref>, co-treatment with HCTZ and ACTZ for 4 days in ACTZ-pretreated animals significantly increased urine output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g001"><bold>Fig. 1c</bold></xref>) and water intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g001"><bold>Fig. 1d</bold></xref>). The continuation of ACTZ treatment alone for 10 days did not increase the urine output beyond that of the 6 days of ACTZ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g001"><bold>Fig. 1c</bold></xref>).</p>

However, ACTZ-primed animals that were co-treated with ACTZ and HCTZ for 4 additional days showed a significant reduction in body weight compared to animals treated with ACTZ alone for the same duration. Treatment with HCTZ alone for 4 days did not adversely affect the weight gain compared to vehicle-treated rats (both groups showed normal daily weight gain of 4–4.7 g). Food intake in ACTZ/HCTZ treated group was comparable to that of ACTZ-treated group (0.72+/−0.03 vs. 0.75+/−0.02 g food/gram body weight/day, p&gt;0.05), indicating that the weight loss in ACTZ/HCTZ-treated group reflected the loss of fluid through kidneys.</p>

<title>Effect of acetazolamide and hydrochlorothiazide on vascular volume status.</title>
<p>Rats (n = 5/group) treated with vehicle (10 days), ACTZ (10 days), HCTZ (4 days), and pretreatment with ACTZ (6 days) and then treated with ACTZ/HCTZ for 4 days (10 days total) were subjected to balanced studies. Urinary sodium levels were determined for urine samples collected on the final day of the study for each group. Animals were euthanized. Blood samples and kidneys and were collected from each animal. Serum samples were analyzed for blood urea nitrogen. <bold>a. Body weights.</bold> Daily weight monitoring in animals before and after the initiation of ACTZ treatment with or without HCTZ indicates that rats treated with ACTZ plus HCTZ lost weight compared to rats on ACTZ alone. ACTZ treated animals (no HCTZ) showed comparable body weight gain to vehicle treated animals (Results). <bold>b. Salt excretion.</bold> Sodium excretion was ∼1.45 mEq/24 hrs in vehicle treated, 1.9 mEq/24 hrs in ACTZ and 2.6 mEq/24 hrs in ACTZ + HCTZ-treated groups. * indicates significant difference (see text for more information). <bold>c. Expression of renin in kidneys of Vehicle-, HCTZ-, ACTZ- and ACTZ/HCTZ-treated animals.</bold> The mRNA expression and protein levels of renin (left and right panels) were measured by Northern Hybridization and Western Blot in kidneys of control and animals that were treated with ACTZ, HCTZ or ACTZ plus HCTZ. Results shown are representative of 2 separate studies examining 4 different rats from each treatment group. <bold>d. BUN levels in Vehicle-, HCTZ-, ACTZ- and ACTZ/HCTZ-treated animals.</bold> BUN concentration levels were measured in animals treated with ACTZ, HCTZ or both. <bold>e. Systemic acid base parameters.</bold> Animals treated with ACTZ + HCTZ have significantly elevated arterial blood bicarbonate levels and pH compared to other experimental groups.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g002"><bold>Figure 2b</bold></xref> depicts urine sodium concentration in various experimental groups and indicates that sodium excretion increased by 37% in ACTZ treated and by 80% in ACTZ/HCTZ treated animals compared to the control group. HCTZ treatment had no significant effect on sodium excretion.</p>
<p>To determine whether increased salt excretion and fluid loss causes volume depletion, the expression of renin in kidneys of experimental groups was measured. Northern and western blot analyses indicate that compared to other treatment groups the ACTZ/HCTZ treated animals had the highest expression levels of renin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g002"><bold>Figure 2c</bold></xref><bold>, top and bottom panels</bold>).</p>
<p>To ascertain the effect of vascular volume depletion on kidney function, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were measured in animals from the 4 treatment groups (n = 5/group). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g002"><bold>Figure 2d</bold></xref> indicates that BUN levels of ACTZ-treated rats are slightly increased compared to that of vehicle-treated animals. The ACTZ/HCTZ-treated rats showed a significant increase in their BUN levels compared to ACTZ- and vehicle-treated rats, consistent with pre-renal failure. Serum creatinine levels also increased significantly in ACTZ/HCTZ-treated group compared to other experimental groups.</p>
<p>Arterial blood gas analysis indicates that HCTZ, ACTZ and vehicle treated animals had similar acid base profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g002"><bold>Figure 2e</bold></xref>).

<title>Regulation of AQP2 in response to ACTZ/HCTZ treatment</title>
<p>The significant increase in urine output of ACTZ/HCTZ treated groups was associated with a reciprocal reduction in urine osmolality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>) despite the fact that these animals are volume depleted, as shown by increased expression of kidney renin and elevation of BUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>). The impaired urine concentration in the context of volume depletion is a surprising findings and points to impaired water reabsorption (reflecting compromised AQP2 expression and/or function). In the next series of experiments we examined the expression of AQP2 in control and ACTZ/HCTZ-treated animals. Accordingly, the abundance of AQP2, <sup>Ser256</sup>p-AQP2 and <sup>Ser261</sup>p-AQP2 were assessed.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The use of diuretics in fluid overloaded states is determined by their strength, mechanism of action and possible side effects. Loop diuretics, which inhibit the apical Na-K-2Cl co-transporter (NKCC2) in the thick limb, are powerful natriuretic agents but have numerous side effects, including severe hypokalemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Lifton1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Hebert1">[7]</xref>. Thiazides are the most widely used diuretic for mild hypertension and as a combination therapy for moderate hypertension [18). They have also been used in conjunction with loop diuretics for treatment of severe fluid overload <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Messerli1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Reyes1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors are known to inhibit the sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule through the inhibition of CA-2 and CA-4 and impair the collecting duct acid secretion, which is predominantly mediated via H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in A-intercalated cells, through the inhibition of CA-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Eladari1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Schwartz1">[14]</xref>. They are considered mild diuretics and therefore not commonly used for the treatment of fluid overloaded states. Mice deficient in CA-2 show a significant reduction in the number of intercalated cells, along with the down-regulation of pendrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Sun1">[24]</xref>. These results are in agreement with our studies in rats treated with acetazolamide, and indicate the importance of CA-2 in the development and remodeling of intercalated cells.</p>
<p>Recently, we demonstrated that the simultaneous knockout of pendrin and NCC genes in mice causes massive salt wasting and volume depletion, despite the fact that deficiency of either pendrin or NCC in isolation does not result in any noticeable salt wasting under basal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Soleimani2">[22]</xref>. Given the up-regulation of pendrin in kidneys of NCC KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Vallet1">[26]</xref>, these results indicate that pendrin plays an important role in compensatory salt absorption in kidneys of NCC KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Soleimani2">[22]</xref>. The results of the current investigation extend the latter observations and demonstrate that as a result of pendrin down-regulation subsequent to carbonic anhydrase inhibition, NCC becomes the major salt absorbing transporter in the distal nephron in the setting of increased delivery of salt from proximal tubule.</p>
<p>Additionally, the urine osmolality is reduced while the renin expression is elevated in HCTZ/ACTZ treated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g002">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g003">3</xref>). These observations suggest that the water salvage mechanism in the kidneys of animals treated with ACTZ/HCTZ is severely impaired. Our results suggest that the inability to conserve water in ACTZ/HCTZ treated animals in the face of dehydration is primarily due to reduced expression of AQP2 and its diminished surface expression as evidenced by a decrease in the abundance of <sup>Ser256</sup>p-AQP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Our recent studies in pendrin/NCC double KO mice show remarkable phenotypic similarity to the current HCTZ/ACTZ-treated rats with respect to their impaired ability to concentrate the urine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Zahedi1">[27]</xref>. In those studies we demonstrate that pendrin/NCC dKO mice have nephrogenic DI and decreased <sup>Ser256</sup>p-AQP2 levels in medullary collecting ducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Zahedi1">[27]</xref>. Taken together, these studies indicate that severe salt wasting might induce signaling (i.e. through PGE2 receptor) that counteracts the effect of V2 receptor activation and differentially affects AQP2 phosphorylation. Whether the impairment in ADH effect in ACTZ/HCTZ-treated rats might be in part due to the presence of metabolic alkalosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Zalyapin1">[28]</xref> remains speculative.</p>
<p>Aside from being mild diuretics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide are the treatment of choice for certain non-kidney conditions. These include glaucoma, pseudotumor cerebri (increased intracranial pressure, IIP), and mountain sickness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Friedman1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Toris1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Leaf1">[25]</xref>. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure by reducing the production of vitreous humor and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Friedman1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Toris1">[17]</xref>. They also improve hypoxia in mountain sickness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Leaf1">[25]</xref>. We propose that patients that are on acetazolamide analogs for non-kidney condition such as IIH or glaucoma should avoid taking thiazide derivatives for hypertension due to the strong possibility of developing massive volume depletion subsequent to profound diuresis and salt wasting. Furthermore, individuals who are on thiazides for the treatment of hypertension should switch to other classes of hypertensive medications if they need to start acetazolamide for prevention of mountain sickness or treatment of glaucoma. The reason for this warning is that these patients usually have normal vascular volume and are not fluid overloaded. As a result, severe diuresis in these patients could cause volume depletion, hypotension and possibly renal failure.</p>
<p>These are the first studies to demonstrate that acetazolamide and hydrochlorothiazide, which are historically known to be mild diuretics, can function as a powerful diuretic regimen when administered together. Preliminary studies from our on-going studies in humans (n = 5) with nephrotic syndrome and preserved kidney function (GFR &gt;60 ml/min) demonstrated that 6 days of pretreatment with acetazolamide followed by 6 days of co-treatment with acetazolamide and hydrochlorothiazide caused more than 5% weight loss and improvement in peripheral edema (P&lt;0.05 vs. before therapy; personal observation), supporting the notion that this combination is a strong and effective diuretic regimen. One has to be cautious with extrapolating from these studies to other models of fluid overload, such as congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>The current studies strongly suggest that the primary reason for mild diuresis by acetazolamide is the compensatory activation of NCC subsequent to increased delivery of salt from the proximal tubule, therefore blunting the expected salt wasting. Equally important to NCC up-regulation in ACTZ-treated rats is the down-regulation of pendrin, which leaves DCT and CCD with little compensatory salt absorbing mechanisms when NCC is inhibited.</p>
<p>The absence of hypokalemia in ACTZ/ACTZ-treated animals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079327-t001">Table 1</xref>), despite severe volume depletion, increased renin/aldosterone pathway and metabolic alkalosis is intriguing. One plausible explanation could be that pendrin works in conjunction with the sodium channel (ENaC) to absorb NaCl, and the inhibition of pendrin would blunt the activity of ENaC, therefore impairing the secretion of potassium via K+ channels in exchange for sodium absorption through ENaC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Horisberger1">[29]</xref>. Alternatively, the down regulation of pendrin by acetazolamide could render the sodium-dependent Cl<sup>−</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> exchanger (NDCBE) inactive in B-intercalated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Eladari1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Leviel1">[30]</xref> which can result in enhanced salt excretion with no potassium wasting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079327-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>One interesting finding in current studies was the presence of metabolic alkalosis in rats co-treated with ACTZ and HCTZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Given the ability of CAs to facilitate bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Purkerson1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Schwartz1">[14]</xref>, the anticipation is that CAIs will cause bicarbonate wasting and result in proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Published reports, however, indicate that rats treated with ACTZ for 7 days or 14 days do not develop proximal RTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Bagnis1">[15]</xref>. The presence of metabolic alkalosis in ACTZ/HCTZ co-treated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) might reflect the impact of pendrin downregulation in the context of volume depletion. Pendrin deficient mice, but not their wild type littermates, develop metabolic alkalosis when subjected to salt-depleted diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Wall2">[31]</xref>, indicating the important role of pendrin-mediated bicarbonate secretion and chloride reabsorption in vascular volume homeostasis and acid base balance during volume depletion. Similarly, it is highly plausible that the downregulation of pendrin in ACTZ/HCTZ co-treated rats might play an important role in the generation of metabolic alkalosis in these animals. Whether the ACTZ-mediated RTA in human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Purkerson1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Schwartz1">[14]</xref> and its absence in rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Bagnis1">[15]</xref> reflect species differences remains speculative.</p>
<p>One of the complications of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is enhanced calcium excretion, which can result in nephrocalcinosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Grieff1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Greenberg1">[33]</xref>. This is the opposite of the effect of HCTZ, which is known to decrease calcium excretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Nijenhuis1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079327-Jang1">[35]</xref>. It is intriguing that rats treated with ACTZ and HCTZ did not show any increment in calcium excretion, indicating that the hypocalciuric effect of HCTZ can offset the hypercalciuric effect of ACTZ.</p>
<p>In conclusion, ACTZ down regulates pendrin, leaving the thiazide sensitive transporter NCC, as the major salt absorbing transporter in the distal nephron in the setting of increased delivery of salt from proximal tubule. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g006"><bold>Figure 6, left panel</bold></xref> is a schematic diagram indicating that the activation of NCC and the downregulation of pendrin in the context of increased delivery of salt from the proximal tubule by acetazolamide (<bold>panel 2</bold>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079327-g006"><bold>Figure 6, right panel</bold></xref>, depicts the impact of hydrochlorothiazide (an inhibitor of NCC) on salt excretion in the presence of acetazolamide.</p>
