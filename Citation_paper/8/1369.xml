<p>The rapid accumulation of biological networks poses new challenges and calls for powerful integrative analysis tools. Most existing methods capable of simultaneously analyzing a large number of networks were primarily designed for unweighted networks, and cannot easily be extended to weighted networks. However, it is known that transforming weighted into unweighted networks by dichotomizing the edges of weighted networks with a threshold generally leads to information loss. We have developed a novel, tensor-based computational framework for mining recurrent heavy subgraphs in a large set of massive weighted networks. Specifically, we formulate the recurrent heavy subgraph identification problem as a heavy 3D subtensor discovery problem with sparse constraints. We describe an effective approach to solving this problem by designing a multi-stage, convex relaxation protocol, and a non-uniform edge sampling technique. We applied our method to 130 co-expression networks, and identified 11,394 recurrent heavy subgraphs, grouped into 2,810 families. We demonstrated that the identified subgraphs represent meaningful biological modules by validating against a large set of compiled biological knowledge bases. We also showed that the likelihood for a heavy subgraph to be meaningful increases significantly with its recurrence in multiple networks, highlighting the importance of the integrative approach to biological network analysis. Moreover, our approach based on weighted graphs detects many patterns that would be overlooked using unweighted graphs. In addition, we identified a large number of modules that occur predominately under specific phenotypes. This analysis resulted in a genome-wide mapping of gene network modules onto the phenome. Finally, by comparing module activities across many datasets, we discovered high-order dynamic cooperativeness in protein complex networks and transcriptional regulatory networks.</p>

<p>To study complex cellular networks, we need to consider their dynamic topologies under many different experimental or physiological conditions. Integrative analysis over large numbers of massive biological networks thus emerges as a new challenge in data mining. Recently, we and others have proposed several algorithms for recurrent pattern mining across many (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) biological networks (with the main focus on unweighted networks). However, thus far no algorithms have been specifically designed to mine recurrent patterns across a large collection of weighted massive networks. In this paper, we propose a computational framework to identify recurrent heavy subgraphs from many weighted large networks. By applying our method to 130 co-expression networks, we identified an atlas of modules that are highly likely to represent functional modules, transcriptional modules, and protein complexes. Many of these modules would be overlooked with unweighted networks analysis. Furthermore, many of the identified modules constituted signatures of specific phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrated that our results facilitate the study of high-order dynamic coordination in protein complex networks and transcriptional regulatory networks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The advancement of high-throughput technology has resulted in the accumulation of a wealth of data on biological networks. Co-expression networks, protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, genetic interaction networks, and transcription regulatory networks are continuously being generated for a wide range of organisms under various conditions. Thanks to this great opportunity, network biology is rapidly emerging as a discipline in its own right <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Barabasi1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Papin1">[2]</xref>. Thus far, most computational methods have focused on the analysis of individual biological networks, but in many cases a single network is insufficient to discover patterns with multiple facets and subtle signals. There is an urgent need for methods supporting the integrative analysis of <bold><italic>multiple</italic></bold> biological networks. The analysis of multiple networks can be classified into two categories: (1) those studying conservations and evolvements of multiple networks between different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Kelley1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Denilou1">[8]</xref>, and (2) those identifying shared network modules or variations of modules across multiple networks of the same species but under different conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Hu1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Pan1">[15]</xref>. The two types of problems face different challenges. Cross-species network comparisons are typically carried out on tens of networks, with the bottleneck being the graph isomorphism problem caused by the possible many-to-many ortholog mapping; while the network comparison within the same species deal with hundreds of networks simultaneously, and their principal challenge is the large search space. In this paper, we will focus on the latter problem.</p>
<p>The analysis of multiple networks from the same species under different conditions has recently been addressed by ourselves and others with a series of heuristic data mining algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Hu1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Mehan1">[14]</xref>. While useful, these methods still face two major limitations. (1) The general strategy of their searching heuristics is a stepwise reduction of the large search space, where each step involves one or more arbitrary cutoffs in addition to the initial cutoff that transforms continuous measurements (e.g. expression correlations) into unweighted edges. The <italic>ad hoc</italic> nature of these cutoffs has been a major criticism directed at this body of work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Hu1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Yan2">[13]</xref>. (2) The cited algorithms cannot be easily extended to weighted networks. Most graph-based approaches to analyzing multiple networks are restricted to unweighted networks, and weighted networks are often perceived as harder to analyze <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Newman1">[16]</xref>. However, weighted networks are obviously more informative than their unweighted counterparts. Transforming weighted networks into unweighted networks by dichotomizing weighted edges with a threshold obviously leads to information loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Serrano1">[17]</xref>, and if there is no reasonable way to choose the threshold, this loss cannot be controlled. This paper presents a new method of analyzing multiple networks that overcomes both of these issues.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a network of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> vertices can be represented as an <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> adjacency matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where each element <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the weight of the edge between vertices <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A number of numerical methods for matrix computation have been elegantly applied to network analysis, for example graph clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Chung1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Ding1">[21]</xref> and pathway analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Alter1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Alter2">[23]</xref>. In light of these successful applications, we propose a tensor-based computational framework capable of analyzing many weighted and unweighted massive networks. Although tensor computation has been applied in the fields of psychometrics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Cattell1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Tucker1">[25]</xref>, image processing and computer vision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-AjaFernndez1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Tao1">[27]</xref>, chemometrics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Smilde1">[28]</xref>, and social network analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Kolda1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Acar1">[30]</xref>, it has been explored only recently in large-scale data mining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Faloutsos1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Mahoney1">[35]</xref> and bioinformatics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Alter3">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Omberg1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Simply put, a tensor is a multi-dimensional array and a matrix is a 2nd-order tensor. Given <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> networks with the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> vertices but different topologies, we can represent the whole system as a 3rd-order tensor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see an example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Each element <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the weight of the edge between vertices <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><sup>th</sup> network. By representing a set of networks in this fashion, we gain access to a wealth of numerical methods – in particular continuous optimization methods. In fact, reformulating discrete problems as continuous optimization problems is a long-standing tradition in graph theory. There have been many successful examples, such as using a Hopfield neural network for the traveling salesman problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Hopfield1">[38]</xref> and applying the Motzkin–Straus theorem to solve the clique-finding problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Motzkin1">[39]</xref>. Moreover, when a graph pattern mining problem is transformed into a continuous optimization problem, it becomes easy to incorporate constraints representing prior knowledge. Finally, advanced continuous optimization techniques require very few <italic>ad hoc</italic> parameters, in contrast with most heuristic graph algorithms.</p>

<title>Illustration of the tensor representation for multiple networks and a recurrent heavy subgraph.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Microarray datasets are modeled as (<bold>B</bold>) a collection of co-expression networks; (<bold>C</bold>) These co-expression networks can be “stacked” together into (<bold>D</bold>) a third-order tensor such that each slice represents the adjacency matrix of one network. The weights of edges in the co-expression networks and their corresponding tensor elements are indicated by the color scale to the right of the figure. In (<bold>D</bold>), after reordering the tensor using the gene and network membership vectors, it becomes clear that the subtensor in the top-left corner of the tensor (formed by genes <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in networks <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) corresponds to a recurrent heavy subgraph.</p>

<p>In this paper, we develop a tensor-based computational framework to identify <italic>recurrent heavy subgraphs</italic> (RHSs) in multiple weighted networks. A <italic>heavy subgraph</italic> (HS) is a subset of heavily interconnected nodes in a single network. We define a RHS as a HS that appears in a subset of multiple networks. The nodes of a RHS are the same in each occurrence, but the edge weights may vary between networks. Although the discovery of heavy subgraphs in a single biological network can reveal functional and transcriptional modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Spirin1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Mao1">[42]</xref>, such results often contain false positives. Extending the search to a RHS is a promising way to enhance signal noise separation. Intuitively, any set of genes forming a RHS in multiple datasets generated under different conditions is more likely to represent a functional and transcriptional module than the genes in a single occurrence of a HS. We will use co-expression networks as examples due to their wide availability, but the tensor method described in this paper is applicable to any type of genome-wide networks.</p>
<p>The concept of a RHS can be explained using the language of tensors, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Given <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> microarray datasets, we model each dataset with a co-expression network. Each node represents one gene, and each edge's weight is the estimated co-expression correlation of the two genes. We then “stack” the collection of co-expression networks into a three-dimensional array such that each slice represents the adjacency matrix of one network. This array is a third-order tensor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with dimensions gene<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>gene<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>network. A RHS intuitively corresponds to a heavy region of the tensor (a heavy subtensor). The RHS can be found by reordering the tensor so that the heaviest subtensor moves toward the top-left corner. The subtensor in the top-left corner can then be expanded outwards from the left-top corner until the RHS reaches its optimal size.</p>
<p>We applied our tensor algorithm to 130 weighted co-expression networks derived from human microarray datasets. We identified an atlas of functional and transcriptional modules and validated them against a large set of biological knowledge bases including Gene Ontology annotations, KEGG pathways, 191 Encode genome-wide ChIP-seq profiles, and 109 Chip-chip datasets. The likelihood for a heavy subgraph to be biologically meaningful increases significantly with its recurrence, highlighting the importance of the integrative approach. Moreover, our approach based on weighted graphs detected many patterns that would have been overlooked if we were analyzing unweighted graphs. In addition, we identified many modules that occur predominately under a specific type of phenotypes. Thus, we were able to create a genome-wide mapping of gene network modules onto the phenome. Finally, based on module activities across multiple datasets, we used a high-order analysis approach to reveal the dynamic cooperativeness in protein complex networks and transcription regulatory networks.</p>

Thus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> measures the “heaviness” of the RHS defined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Discovering recurrent heavy subgraph can be formulated by a discrete combinatorial optimization problem: <italic>among all RHSs of fixed size (</italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><italic> member genes and </italic><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><italic> member networks), we look for the heaviest.</italic> More specifically, this is an integer programming problem of looking for the binary membership vectors <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that jointly maximize <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> under the constraints <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, there are several major drawbacks to this discrete formulation. The first is <italic>parameter dependence:</italic> as with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-heaviest/densest subgraph problems, the size parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are hard for users to provide and control. The second is <italic>high computational complexity:</italic> the task is proved to be NP-hard (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001106.s001">Text S1</xref>) and therefore not solvable in reasonable time even for small datasets. As our own interest is pattern mining in a large set of massive networks, the discrete optimization problem is infeasible.</p>
<p>To address these two drawbacks, we instead solved a continuous optimization problem with the same objective by relaxing integer constraints to continuous constraints. That is, we looked for non-negative real vectors <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that jointly maximize <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This optimization problem is formally expressed as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e059" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a non-negative real space, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are vector norms. These equations define a tensor-based computational framework for the RHS identification problem. By solving Eq. (2), users can easily identify the top-ranking networks (after sorting the tensor by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and top-ranking genes (after sorting each network by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) contributing to the objective function. After rearranging the networks in this manner, the heaviest RHS occupies a corner of the 3D tensor. We then mask this RHS with zeros and optimize Eq. (2) again to search for the next heaviest RHS.</p>
<p>Two major components of the framework described in Eq. (2) remain to be designed: (1) the vector norm constraints (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and (2) a protocol for maximizing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We explain our design choices below.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Vector norm constraints</title>
<p>The choice of vector norms has a significant impact on the outcome of the optimization. The norm of a vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is typically defined in the form <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The symbol <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, called the “<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-vector norm”, refers to this formula for the given value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In general, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> norm leads to sparse solutions where only a few components of the membership vectors are significantly different from zero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Zhang1">[43]</xref>. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> norm generally gives a “smooth” solution where the elements of the optimized vector are approximately equal. Details of these vector norms refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001106.s001">Text S1</xref>.</p>
<p>A RHS is a subset of genes that are heavily connected to each other in as many networks as possible. These requirements can be encoded as follows. (1) <italic>A subset of values in each gene membership vector should be significantly non-zero and close to each other, while the rest are close to zero</italic>. To this end, we consider the mixed norm <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> favors sparse vectors and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> favors uniform vectors, a suitable choice of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> should yield vectors with a few similar, non-zero elements and many elements that are close to zero. In practice, we approximate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with the mixed norm <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. (2) <italic>As many network membership values as possible should be non-zero and close to each other</italic>. As discussed above, this is the typical outcome of optimization using the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> norm. In practice, we approximate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, the vector norms <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are specified as follows,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e091" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>We performed simulation studies to determine suitable values for the parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by applying our tensor method to collections of random weighted networks. In subsets of these networks, we randomly placed RHSs of varying size, occurrence, and heaviness. We then tried different combinations of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and adopted the combination (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) that led to the discovery of the most RHSs.

<title>Optimization by multi-stage convex relaxation</title>
<p>Since the vector norm <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is non-convex, our tensor framework requires an optimization method that can deal with non-convex constraints. While the global optimum of a convex problem can be easily computed, the quality of the optimum discovered for a non-convex problem depends heavily on the numerical procedure. Standard numerical techniques such as gradient descent converge to a local minimum of the solution space, and different procedures often find different local minima. Considering the fact that most sparse constraints are non-convex, it is important to find a theoretically justified numerical procedure.</p>
<p>To design the optimization protocol, we use our previously developed framework known as Multi-Stage Convex Relaxation (MSCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Zhang1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Zhang2">[44]</xref>. MSCR has good numerical properties for non-convex optimization problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Zhang1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Zhang2">[44]</xref>. In this context, concave duality is used to construct a sequence of convex relaxations that give increasingly accurate approximations to the original non-convex problem. We approximate the sparse constraint function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by the convex function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a specific convex function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the concave dual of the function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In practice, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is an effective choice as the convex upperbound of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> contains coefficients that will be automatically generated during the optimization process. After each optimization, the new coefficient vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> yields a convex function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that more closely approximates the original non-convex function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The solution of our tensor formulation Eq. (2) is a stationary point of the following regularized optimization problem:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e116" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are Lagrange multipliers. By exploiting the concave duality of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we can substitute <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, Eq.

<p>We solve Eq. (5) by repeatedly applying the following two steps:</p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item>
<p>First, optimize <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> while holding <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> fixed.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>Second, optimize <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> fixed. This problem has a closed form solution (for details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001106.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>The following box (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pcbi-1001106-box001">Box 1</xref>) presents our two-stage protocol to solve the regularized form of Eq. (2). The procedure can be regarded as a generalization of concave-convex programming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Yuille1">[45]</xref>, which takes <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. By repeatedly refining the parameters in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we can obtain better and better convex relaxations leading to a solution superior to that of the initial convex relaxation with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The initial values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> could be uniform, randomly chosen, or taken from prior knowledge. In practice, by choosing an appropriate solver for Step 1, the complexity of MSCR is linear with respect to the total number of edges in the tensor.</p>

<title>Obtaining multiple recurrent heavy subgraphs</title>
<p>The RHSs can be intuitively obtained by including those genes and networks with large membership values. In practice, a pair of gene and network membership vectors <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e., the solution of Eq.

<p>In particular, the genes and networks are sorted in decreasing order of their membership values in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As illustrated by the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g002">Figure 2A–C</xref>, the more top-ranking genes are included in the RHS, the less networks the RHS recurs in; and vice versa. Such overlapping structure is like a tower as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g002">Figure 2D</xref>. We refer to a group of overlapping RHSs that is obtained from the same pair of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a <italic>RHS family</italic>. To compress the redundant information, we build the representative RHSs for a RHS family as following: (1) if a RHS family contains multiple RHSs, the representatives are its two “extreme” RHSs: the RHS with the minimal number of genes (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and as maximal recurrence as possible, and the RHS with the minimal number of networks (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and as maximal number of genes as possible; (2) if a RHS family has only one RHS, it is the representative RHS.</p>

<title>Non-uniform sampling for fast computation</title>
<p>Even though the MSCR method is efficient, its computation time can still be long for large sets of networks with many edges. In such cases, edge sampling can provide an efficient approximation to many graph problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Tsay1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Achlioptas1">[47]</xref>. From the perspective of matrix or tensor computation, such sampling methods can be also viewed as matrix/tensor sparsification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Arora1">[48]</xref>. As RHS patterns predominately contain edges with large weights, we designed a non-uniform sampling method that preferentially selects edges with large weights. Specifically, each edge <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is sampled with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e162" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are constants that control the number of sampled edges. Note that Eq. (6) <italic>always</italic> samples edges with weights <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It selects an edge of weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> proportional to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> power of the weight.

<p>To correct the bias caused by this sampling method, the weight of each edge is corrected by its relative probability: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The expected weight of the sampled network, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is therefore equal to the weight of the original network. However, in practice, when the adjusted edge weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (but the original edge weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), we enforced it to be <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for avoiding too large edge weights. The overall edge sampling procedure adopts the simple random-sampling based single-pass sparsification procedure introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Arora1">[48]</xref>. Details of the edge sampling procedure is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001106.s001">Text S1</xref>.

<title>Data description and experimental setting</title>
<p>We selected every microarray dataset from NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus that met the following criteria: all samples were of human origin; the dataset had at least 20 samples to guarantee robust estimates of the expression correlations; and the platform was either GPL91 (corresponding to Affymetrix HG-U95A), GPL96 (Affymetrix HG-U133A), GPL570 (HG-U133_Plus_2), or GPL571 (HG-U133A_2). We averaged expression values for probe that map to the same gene within a dataset. The 130 datasets that met these criteria on 28 January 2008 were used for the analysis described herein. Details are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zhoulab.usc.edu/tensor/" xlink:type="simple">http://zhoulab.usc.edu/tensor/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>We applied our methods to these 130 microarray datasets. Each microarray dataset is modeled as a co-expression network wherein each node represents a unique gene and each edge weight represents the strength of co-expression of two genes. To determine the weights, we first compute the expression correlation between two genes as the leave-one-out Pearson correlation coefficient estimate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Zhou1">[49]</xref>. The resulting correlation estimate is conservative and sensitive to similarities in the expression patterns, yet robust to single experimental outliers. To make the correlation estimates comparable across datasets, we then applied Fisher's z transform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Anderson1">[50]</xref>. Given a correlation estimate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, Fisher's transformation score is calculated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Because we observed the distributions of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-scores to vary from dataset to dataset, we standardized the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-scores to enforce zero mean and unit variance in each dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Xu1">[11]</xref>. Then, the “normalized” correlations <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are obtained by inverting the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-score. Finally, the absolute value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is used as the edge weight of co-expression networks.

<title>Recurrent heavy subgraphs are likely to represent functional modules, protein complexes, and transcriptional modules</title>
<p>After applying our method to 130 microarray datasets generated under various experimental conditions, we identified 11,394 RHSs.

The average size of these patterns is 8.5 genes, and the average recurrence is 10.1 networks. The identified RHSs can be organized into 2,810 families with 4,327 representative RHSs, which we refer to in the following analysis. To assess the statistical significance of the identified RHSs, we applied our method to 130 random networks (each of which is generated from one of the 130 weighted networks by the edge randomization method) to identify RHSs with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e190" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genes, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e191" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> networks and “heaviness” <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e192" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We repeated this process 100 times. None of RHSs were identified in any of the 100 times. When the minimum recurrence is 4 and other criteria remain unchanged, only 3 RHSs were found (Detail is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001106.s001">Text S1</xref>).

<title>Functional module analysis</title>
<p>We evaluated the functional homogeneity of genes in an RHS using Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway information. For each RHS, we tested its enrichment for specific Gene Ontology (GO) biological process terms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Ashburner1">[51]</xref>.

We found that 39.9% of the representative RHSs were functionally homogenous in this sense. In an ensemble of randomly generated RHSs having the same size distribution as our RHSs, only 1.2% of them were functionally homogenous. The functionally homogenous RHSs cover a wide range of biological processes: translational elongation, mitosis, cell cycle, RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, histone modification, chromosome localization, spindle checkpoint, posttranscriptional regulation, protein folding, etc. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, not only RHSs with higher heaviness, but also those with high recurrences, are more likely to be functionally homogenous. For example, 40%/71%/90%/98% of patterns with 5/10/20/30 recurrences are functionally homogenous, as opposed to 4.30% of patterns with a single occurrence. This strong dependence highlights the importance of pursuing integrative analysis of <italic>multiple</italic> networks.</p>

Similarly, 39%/64%/78%/92% of patterns with 5/10/20/30 recurrences are functionally homogenous respectively, as opposed to 5.26% of patterns with a single occurrence.</p>
<p>It is important to note that our approach based on weighted networks discovers many patterns that would be overlooked if were using unweighted networks. For example, suppose we applied a commonly used expression correlation cutoff of 0.6 to dichotomize the edges, and a subnetwork density threshold of 0.6. In this case, 55.9% of our discovered RHSs are not discovered. To further avoid parameter biases in the comparison, we assess the functional homogeneity of the top-ranking <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> modules from both weighted and unweighted network analysis. The modules can be ranked by either their recurrences or their heaviness. In both ranking preferences, the weighted graph approach identifies a significantly higher percentage (up to 20%) of functionally homogenous modules than the unweighted graph approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g004">Figure 4</xref>), demonstrating the power and importance of weighted graph analysis.</p>

However, if the member genes of a RHS are highly enriched in the targets for any regulatory factor, then that factor is likely to actively regulate the RHS under the given experimental conditions. In this case we consider the RHS module to be “transcriptional homogenous”.

The percentage of transcription homogenous modules increases rapidly with heaviness and recurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

<title>Discovery of phenotype-specific modules</title>
<p>Our microarray data collection covers a wide range of phenotypic conditions, especially most of all, many different types of cancers (cancers accounts for 46% of the datasets). If an RHS is activated repeatedly <italic>only</italic> under one type of phenotypic condition, then it is likely to contribute specifically to the molecular basis of the phenotype. It is known that phenotypes are determined not only by genes, but also by the underlying structure of genetic networks. While traditional genetic studies have sought to associate single genes with a particular phenotypic trait, identifying phenotype-specific network modules has been a challenge of network biology. Below we show that a large number of the RHSs identified by our method are indeed phenotype-specific.</p>
<p>First, we determined the phenotypic context of a microarray dataset by mapping the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of its PubMed record to UMLS concepts. We used the MetaMap Transfer tool provided by the UMLS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Butte1">[55]</xref> for this purpose. UMLS is the largest available compendium of biomedical vocabularies, spanning approximately one million interrelated concepts. It includes diseases, treatments, and phenotypic concepts at several levels of resolution (molecules, cells, tissues, and whole organisms). We annotated each microarray dataset with matching UMLS concepts and all of their ancestor concepts. For each RHS, we evaluated phenotype specificity by computing the hypergeometric enrichment of specific UMLS concepts present in those datasets where the RHS occurs. If the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e215" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e216" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we consider the RHS module is significantly phenotype-specific. 5.62% of RHSs show phenotype-specific activation patterns, compared to 0.14% of randomly generated RHSs. The most frequently enriched phenotype concepts are related to cancer. For example, the most prevalent concepts are “Leukemia, Myelocytic, Acute” (enriched in 1.8% of modules) and “Neoplasms, Neuroepithelial” (1.3%). Among non-cancer concepts, the most frequent are “Respiratory Tract Diseases” (enriched in 0.2% of modules), “Bone Marrow Diseases” (0.2%) and “Lung diseases” (0.1%). Below we illustrate two examples of phenotype-specific modules.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g007">Figure 7A</xref> shows a 7-gene module (<italic>CCNB1</italic>, <italic>POLE2</italic>, <italic>CDC2</italic>, <italic>PTTG1</italic>, <italic>RNASEH2A</italic>, <italic>CDKN3</italic>, <italic>MCM4</italic>) that is active in 21 datasets. Twelve of the 21 datasets are related to cancer, and three relate to the study of Glioma (GDS1975, GDS1815, GDS1962) (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e217" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value = 0.075).

<title>High-order cooperativity and regulation in protein complex networks and transcription regulatory networks</title>
<p>The discovery of RHS modules spanning a variety of experimental or disease conditions enabled us to investigate high-order coordination among those modules. We applied our previously proposed <italic>second-order analysis</italic> to study cooperativity among the protein complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Zhou1">[49]</xref>. We define the first-order expression analysis as the extraction of patterns from one microarray data set, and the second-order expression analysis as a study of the correlated occurrences of those patterns (e.g. heavy subgraph recurrence) across multiple data sets. Here, for each identified RHS, we constructed a vector of length <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e221" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> storing its heaviness factors in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> data sets. This vector is a profile of the module's first-order average expression correlations, and can be interpreted as the activity profile of the module in different datasets. To quantify the cooperativity between two modules, we calculated the correlation between their first-order expression correlation profiles. It is defined as the <italic>second-order expression correlation</italic> of the two modules.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows a cooperativity map of all protein complexes represented by the RHSs that have high (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) second-order correlations with at least one other protein complexes. The most striking feature of this map is a large and very heavily interconnected subnetwork of 32 complexes, all involved in the cell cycle. Within this subnetwork, 17 complexes (including <italic>CDC2</italic>_Complex, <italic>CCNB2_CDC2</italic>_Complex, <italic>CDK4</italic>_Complex, Chromosomal_Passenger_Complex, and Emerin_Complex_24) form a tight core wherein each complex has strong second-order correlations (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001106.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.95) with all others in the core. This structure highlights the strict transcription regulation of cell cycle processes. Two other prominent dense subnetworks contain protein complexes involved in the respiratory chain and those in translation (e.g. the ribosomal complex, the <italic>NOP56</italic> associated pre-RNA complex, and the <italic>TRBP</italic> complex associated with miRNA dicing). Another loosely coupled subnetwork contains protein complexes mainly involved in transcription and post-transcriptional modification, including the participating members of <italic>CDC5L</italic> complex (pre-mRNA splicing), <italic>CF IIAm</italic> complex (pre-mRNA cleavage), <italic>SNF2h</italic>-cohesion-NuRD complex (chromatin remodeling), DA complex (transcription activation), and the large drosha complex (primary miRNA processing), revealing the tight coupling between transcription and post-transcriptional processes. Numerous protein complexes (e.g. <italic>CEN</italic> complex, <italic>FIB</italic>-associated complex, and <italic>CCT</italic> complex) connect these dominant subnetworks or supercomplexes into an integrated network. Thus, our approach not only provides a comprehensive catalogue of modules that are likely to represent protein complexes, but also the very first systematic view of how protein complexes dynamically coordinate to carry out major cellular functions. That is, by integrating data generated under a variety of conditions, we have gained a glimpse into the activity organization chart of the proteome.</p>

<p>The same principle can be applied to uncover the cooperativity among the transcription modules, thereby reconstructing transcriptional networks. The RHS discovery resulted in an atlas of transcription modules activated under different conditions. Each transcription module can be regulated by one or more transcription factors. Intuitively, if two transcription modules form or do not form two co-expression clusters always under the same set of conditions (that is, in the same data sets), it in fact suggests that their respective transcription factors are active or inactive simultaneously. The cooperativity between two sets of transcription factors can again be quantified using second-order expression correlation, since the the activity of a transcription factor can be assessed by the tightness of co-expression among the genes it regulates, i.e., the first-order profiles of the corresponding RHS module. We focus on the 57 transcription factors with enriched targets in our modules. Among these TFs, we identified 25 TF pairs, each of which regulate two distinct modules with second-order correlations greater than 0.7. We traced the potential sources of cooperativity in these pairs using genome-wide TF binding data and protein-protein interaction data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Breitkreutz1">[61]</xref>. Given two modules controlled respectively by transcription factors TF1 and TF2, which for simplicity are assumed to be individuals instead of sets of transcription factors, there are at least three types of possible direct causes of cooperativity between TF1 and TF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g009">Figure 9A</xref>): the expressions of TF1 and TF2 are activated by a common transcription factor TF3 (a type I transcription network), or TF1 activates the expression of TF2 (a type II transcription network), or TF1 and TF2 interact at the protein level (a type III transcription network). In the special case where a module pair shares the majority of common genes, the cooperativity between TF1 and TF2 is known to be combinatorial control. Note that these three types of transcription networks are certainly only a few of the many possibilities.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three types of possible transcription networks that could explain a second-order correlation between two transcriptional modules. Given two modules controlled by two transcription factors, TF1 and TF2, respectively, the coactivation of the two modules implies cooperativity between TF1 and TF2.

<p>We identified 33 transcription networks, among which 10 networks are of Type I, 19 are of Type II, and 4 are of Type III. These transcription networks interconnect to form a partial cellular regulatory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Four networks are involved in the cell cycle: the Type I network involving <italic>SREBP1</italic> and <italic>TAF1</italic>/<italic>E2F4</italic>, the two Type II networks involving <italic>STAT1</italic> and <italic>E2F4</italic> as well as <italic>SP1</italic> and <italic>NFYA</italic>, and the Type III network involving <italic>ELF1</italic> and <italic>SP1</italic>. The roles of these networks are supported by the independent evidence of cooperative roles of those transcription factors reported in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Miard1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Takahashi1">[65]</xref>. Other transcription networks participate in translational elongation, rRNA processing, RNA splicing, DNA replication, DNA packaging, electron transport, etc. Notably, our reconstructed transcriptional regulatory network includes 35 modules that represent protein complexes, which provides a mechanistic explanation for the correlated activities of those protein complexes, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g008">Figure 8</xref>. For example, cooperativity between the chromosome passenger complex <italic>CPC</italic> and the <italic>MCM</italic> complex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001106-g009">Figure 9B</xref>) can be attributed to the Type II networks between their regulators <italic>E2F4</italic> and <italic>NFY</italic>. This is consistent with previous evidences on the synergistic activities between the two transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Nicols1">[66]</xref>. Strikingly, the protein complexes in the ribosome that participate in the translational elongation are regulated by a network of intertwined transcription networks. This highlights the regulatory complexity of the translation process, an impressive feat given that the TFs used in this study represent only a very small fraction of the TF repertoire.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have developed a novel tensor-based approach to identify recurrent heavy subgraphs in many massive weighted networks. This is the first method suitable for pattern discovery in large databases of many weighted biological networks. We applied the method to 130 co-expression networks, and identified a large number of functional and transcriptional modules. We show that the likelihood for a heavy subgraph to be meaningful increases significantly with its recurrence in multiple networks, highlighting the importance of the integrative approach for network analysis. By analyzing databases of networks derived from a wide range of experimental conditions, we can also study the high-order dynamic coordination of modules, a task that can be hardly addressed using only a single network. In addition, the phenotype information associated with gene expression datasets provides opportunities to perform systematic genotype-phenotype mapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Mehan1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001106-Xu2">[67]</xref>. Among our identified modules, many have been shown to be phenotype-specific. While weighted networks are often perceived as harder to analyze than their unweighted counterparts, we show that many patterns are overlooked if using the unweighted networks. Although currently unweighted networks (protein-protein interaction network, genetic interaction network, and metabolic network, etc.) still dominate biological studies, rapidly evolving genomics technology will soon be able to provide quantitative assessments of those interactions, thus resulting in accumulated weighted networks. Our method is well positioned to respond to the emerging challenges of network biology.</p>
