<p>Loss of mitochondrial function is a fundamental determinant of cell injury and death. In heart cells under metabolic stress, we have previously described how the abrupt collapse or oscillation of the mitochondrial energy state is synchronized across the mitochondrial network by local interactions dependent upon reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we develop a mathematical model of ROS-induced ROS release (RIRR) based on reaction-diffusion (RD-RIRR) in one- and two-dimensional mitochondrial networks. The nodes of the RD-RIRR network are comprised of models of individual mitochondria that include a mechanism of ROS-dependent oscillation based on the interplay between ROS production, transport, and scavenging; and incorporating the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. Local mitochondrial interaction is mediated by superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>) diffusion and the O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>-dependent activation of an inner membrane anion channel (IMAC). In a 2D network composed of 500 mitochondria, model simulations reveal ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization waves similar to those observed when isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes are subjected to a localized laser-flash or antioxidant depletion. The sensitivity of the propagation rate of the depolarization wave to <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> diffusion, production, and scavenging in the reaction-diffusion model is similar to that observed experimentally. In addition, we present novel experimental evidence, obtained in permeabilized cardiomyocytes, confirming that ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization is mediated specifically by O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>. The present work demonstrates that the observed emergent macroscopic properties of the mitochondrial network can be reproduced in a reaction-diffusion model of RIRR. Moreover, the findings have uncovered a novel aspect of the synchronization mechanism, which is that clusters of mitochondria that are oscillating can entrain mitochondria that would otherwise display stable dynamics. The work identifies the fundamental mechanisms leading from the failure of individual organelles to the whole cell, thus it has important implications for understanding cell death during the progression of heart disease.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cardiac cell injury and death is a key component of cardiac diseases such as heart failure or myocardial infarction, thus it is important to understand the earliest steps leading up to irreversible cell damage. Mitochondria are the organelles responsible for generating the energy required to keep the cell running, yet they are particularly vulnerable to damage by toxic byproducts of metabolism, which include reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS wreak havoc on cellular functions by attacking proteins, lipids and DNA, so the cardiac cell has evolved sophisticated defenses to remove them. The work we present in this paper using a computer model of the mitochondrial network describes how ROS generated inside the cell can spread from one mitochondrion to the next in a positive feedback process known as ROS-induced ROS release. Understanding this process will help us to find ways to intervene in this catastrophic mechanism to prevent loss of cell function and the associated cardiac arrhythmias and contractile problems leading to sudden cardiac death.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The spatial and temporal organization of the mitochondrial network is crucial for understanding its function in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon2">[2]</xref>. Complex spatiotemporal factors not only contribute to physiological signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon3">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Saks1">[6]</xref>, but determine the fate of the cell under stress. In heart cells, we have previously studied how the lattice-like packing arrangement of the mitochondrial network lends itself to propagation of bioenergetic signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Romashko1">[7]</xref> and to synchronization of self-organized oscillations in ROS, redox potential, and mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>) in response to pathological stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon4">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon6">[10]</xref>. Moreover, the scaling of instability of the mitochondrial network to the whole-cell and whole-organ levels has been shown to underlie the electrophysiological and contractile dysfunction associated with cardiac disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Akar1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Zhou1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Only recently have we begun to understand the mechanisms responsible for stable, unstable, and oscillatory modes of mitochondrial bioenergetics, by combining experiments with mathematical model development. In studies of isolated cardiomyocytes subjected to localized oxidative stress, we elucidated the role of ROS in triggering autonomous synchronized oscillations of mitochondrial energetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon4">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon5">[9]</xref>. An emergent low frequency (0.01Hz), high amplitude, limit cycle oscillation of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> was observed that spanned the length and breadth of the cardiomyocyte, but only after a considerable delay following the initial perturbation (local laser flash). We found that the abrupt transition in ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> was preceded by the gradual increase of oxidative stress in the network, more specifically, when ∼60% of the mitochondria accumulated ROS to a threshold level. We referred to the state of the mitochondrial network just before depolarization as the point of “mitochondrial criticality” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon5">[9]</xref>. In the critical state, a small perturbation anywhere in the network can lead to the propagation of a ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization wave. The mechanism of this phenomenon involves a mitochondrial ROS-induced ROS release mechanism (a term originally coined by Zorov et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Zorov1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Zorov2">[15]</xref>), triggering an energy dissipating inner membrane anion channel (IMAC) that is inhibited by mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBZR) ligands, but not by inhibitors of the permeability transition pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon4">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon6">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>A computational model of a ROS-dependent single mitochondrion oscillator was constructed to study the dynamics of the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Cortassa1">[16]</xref> and it could reproduce the main features observed experimentally, including bursts of ROS release to the extramitochondrial space during rapid ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization. Interestingly, in addition to the slow, large amplitude oscillation mode most closely associated with the pathological state, the model displayed a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes, suggesting the possibility that mitochondrial ROS release may be operating under physiological conditions as well. A subsequent study provided experimental evidence to support the idea that the mitochondrial network is organized as a collection of weakly coupled oscillators under physiological conditions that couple more strongly under stress to produce slow, synchronized waves and oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon3">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Because the initial collapse of the mitochondrial network initiates a cascade of events including activation of sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, alteration of the electrical excitability of the cardiomyocyte, and ultimately cardiac arrhythmias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Akar1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Brown1">[17]</xref>, it is important to gain a precise understanding of the mechanisms responsible for signal propagation between mitochondria in the network, in order to find ways to interrupt potentially catastrophic events. Thus, in the present work, we test the proposal that <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> diffusion from one mitochondrion to its nearest neighbors is responsible for the propagation of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization waves and synchronization of oscillation in the mitochondrial network by building one dimensional (1D) and two dimensional (2D) reaction-diffusion models of the mitochondrial network. We show that model simulations closely resemble ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization wave propagation observed in experiments in response to oxidative stress, and remarkably, we find that a few oscillating mitochondria can entrain the entire network into an oscillatory mode even if the majority of the mitochondrial lattice is not in the oscillatory parametric domain. We propose that perturbing a minimal number of mitochondria is sufficient to trigger cell-wide responses through ROS-dependent coupling of mitochondria in the network.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We first simulated the propagation of a wave of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization, as observed in experiments performed with isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes subjected to a localized laser flash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon4">[8]</xref>. In order to determine if <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> diffusion and the RIRR mechanism is able to account for transmission of the wave, we started with the 1D version of the RD-RIRR network model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), with the individual mitochondrial nodes either in the stable or oscillatory parametric domains. The 1D model was employed as a proof of principle, to assess under which conditions a wave of depolarization could be initiated from a stimulus consisting of a mitochondrion generating enough <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> to reach the immediate neighbors at supra-threshold levels. This local <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> diffusion thus elicits the opening of IMAC and the depolarization of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> in the neighboring mitochondrion.</p>

<p>A network consisting of a row of 17 mitochondria was analyzed.

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000657.g003" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>With all the mitochondria in the same parametric space (oscillatory domain), the model was initialized with conditions set such that the central mitochondrion (mito_7) started in a depolarized state (i.e., low ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> and high <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> concentration) while the others were still polarized. In the absence of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> diffusion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>i</sub> diffusion coefficient, <italic>D</italic><sub>O2</sub><sup>.−</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> = 0), all mitochondria oscillated independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g002">Fig. 2A and 2B</xref>). In this case, the initially depolarized mito_7 repolarized at 32.2 s and then continued with limit cycle oscillations. Mitochondria that were polarized at time zero (i.e., mito_1 to 6 and mito_8 to 13) depolarized at 57.8 s and then oscillated independently of their neighbors. All mitochondria displayed the same oscillation period (87 s) as reflected in the changes in membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), the cytoplasmic <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>i</sub>) concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), mitochondrial <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>m</sub>), or NADH (not shown).</p>
<p>With the same parameter settings, the simulation was repeated in the presence of O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>i</sub> diffusion (<italic>D</italic><sub>O2</sub><sup>.−</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> = 4×10<sup>−9</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), which revealed a significantly different pattern of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) and O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>i</sub> oscillations, consistent with propagation of the depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>) and O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>. Upon depolarization of the central mitochondrion (mito_7), there was a short lag (∼10 ms), and then mitochondria 8 through 13 depolarized sequentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization propagated identically in both directions (e.g., from mito_6 to mito_1; results not shown). Notably, both in the model simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g002">Fig. 2E and 2F</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g003">Fig. 3</xref> below) and in experiments performed in isolated cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>), the mitochondrion that depolarized first was the last to repolarize.</p>
<p>In a second set of simulations, we investigated whether oscillation in a single mitochondrion could entrain the rest of the network, even though the target mitochondria were initialized with parameters outside the oscillatory regime. The network consisted of a linear array of 17 mitochondria in which the mitochondrion in the center (mito_9) was initialized with an enhanced rate of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> production by increasing the <italic>shunt</italic> parameter (defined as the fraction of respiration diverted to <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> production) from its baseline value of 0.02 (2%) to 0.14 (14%). As shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), in the absence of O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>i</sub> diffusion, mitochondria behave independently and only mito_9 oscillated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g003">Fig. 3A and 3B</xref>). Coupling mitochondria through O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>i</sub> diffusion (<italic>D</italic><sub>O2</sub><sup>.−</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> = 4×10<sup>−9</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) resulted in entrainment of the oscillatory mode, with mito_9 triggering a depolarization wave which propagates from the center to the ends of the array (mito_17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g003">Fig. 3D</xref> and mito_1; not shown). In agreement with experimental results reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon5">[9]</xref>, repolarization begins from the mitochondrion that depolarized last, that is, it proceeds from mito_17 or mito_1 to the center of the row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Similar results were obtained by simulating a reduction in antioxidant capacity by decreasing <italic>etSOD</italic> (the Cu, Zn SOD concentration) for mito_9 from 2×10<sup>−3</sup> to 1.43×10<sup>−3</sup> mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Entrainment of mitochondrial oscillation in the network depended on the local <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> increase introduced by the perturbation of the mitochondrion in the center of the row (mito_9), which generated periplasmic <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> concentrations (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>i</sub>) that were much higher than the neighboring mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>), as reflected by the high transport rate of O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>i</sub> (<italic>Vt</italic><sub>O2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>i</sub>) from the matrix to the cytoplasm in mito_9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>).

<title>Propagation of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization and <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> in the 2D RD-RIRR mitochondrial network model</title>
<p>The propagation of RIRR was also demonstrated in the 2D mitochondrial network model, which consisted of five hundred (10×50) mitochondria. The parameters of the whole array were initialized to represent a condition of high oxidative stress by increasing the <italic>shunt</italic> parameter to 0.14 to simulate a mitochondrial network at criticality. Approximately 1% (6 out of 500) of the mitochondrial network was induced to undergo depolarization. A local increase in O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>i</sub> concentration and depolarization of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> in this area is evident, similar to previous experiments in which we applied a localized laser flash to a fraction of the mitochondrial network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon4">[8]</xref> (but see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">discussion</xref> for the limitations of this analogy). ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization propagated outward in all directions from the six perturbed mitochondria and then appeared as a longitudinal wave as the edges of the array were encountered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>, left montage). A wave of increased O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup><sub>i</sub> accompanied the ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>, right montage).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present results demonstrate that the observed emergent macroscopic properties of the mitochondrial network can be reproduced in a reaction-diffusion model of RIRR. Moreover, the simulations have uncovered a novel aspect of the synchronization mechanism, which is that clusters of mitochondria that are in the oscillatory domain of the parametric space can entrain mitochondria that would otherwise display stable dynamics.</p>
<p>Propagation of electrical and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals within and between cells in the heart is essential for cardiac function, but less is understood about propagation of signals between organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Vendelin1">[18]</xref>. Several hypothetical mechanisms have been previously suggested to explain how ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization may spread throughout the mitochondrial network of the cardiac myocyte. Amchenkova et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Amchenkova1">[19]</xref> proposed that there may be direct electrical continuity between mitochondria; however, more recent data showing that individual mitochondria or groups of mitochondria can be depolarized with little effect on their immediate neighbors argues against direct coupling. Ichas et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Ichas1">[20]</xref> provided evidence for propagated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mediated ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization that involved the activation of the PTP. A mitochondrial ROS-induced ROS release mechanism was described by Zorov <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Zorov1">[14]</xref> to explain how laser-induced depolarization generates a large burst of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> generation from the electron transport chain upon activation of the PTP, which can occur independently of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<p>In previous work we investigated whether or not the PTP and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> was involved in the mechanism of whole-cell ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon4">[8]</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon7">[21]</xref> for a review). Briefly, several lines of evidence ruled out both the PTP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> as playing a role in the mitochondrial oscillations observed in heart cells. With regard to Ca<sup>2+</sup>: <italic>(i)</italic> the myocytes were studied under quiescent, minimally Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded conditions, and no sarcomere shortening was evident; <italic>(ii)</italic> inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump or mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling did not influence flash-induced mitochondrial oscillations; <italic>(iii)</italic> extensive buffering of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with 1 mM EGTA did not affect flash-induced oscillations. The possible contribution of the PTP was ruled out by the following evidence: <italic>(i)</italic> cyclosporin A did not block the transitions, and <italic>(ii)</italic> small (600 MW) fluorophores were not lost from the mitochondrial matrix upon depolarization. More recently, we have provided extensive evidence showing that IMAC and PTP open sequentially as a function of the glutathione redox status in permeabilized cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon8">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Studies from our laboratory demonstrated that in cardiomyocytes, mitochondrial ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization and redox potential during metabolic stress can be highly synchronized throughout the mitochondrial network, displaying complex behaviors including wave propagation within and between cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Romashko1">[7]</xref> and limit cycle oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Romashko1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon4">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Cortassa1">[16]</xref>. Using highly localized laser excitation of less than 1% of the cellular volume to induce <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> release and ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization, we showed that after several minutes of delay, spatiotemporally synchronized oscillations in ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>, NADH, and GSH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon4">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon5">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Cortassa1">[16]</xref>, spanning the entire mitochondrial network of the cardiomyocyte, can occur. This phenomenon could be prevented or acutely reversed by interrupting mitochondrial <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> generation, increasing antioxidant capacity, or blocking IMAC, and neither Ca<sup>2+</sup> nor PTP opening were involved in this response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon4">[8]</xref>. These responses could be described by a computational model involving RIRR and the activation of IMAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Cortassa1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Employing the RD-RIRR mitochondrial network model, the present work successfully reproduces several experimental observations, including: i) ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> redox wave propagation and its spatial-dependence on <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> diffusion, production, and scavenging, and ii) synchronization of independent mitochondrial oscillators. Interestingly, a new feature was revealed by the 2D model simulation - <italic>entrainment</italic> of mitochondrial ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> oscillation in mitochondria that would otherwise show stable behavior and low <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> production. Finally, another important achievement was the direct confirmation of a key component of the oscillatory mechanism and model, which was the experimental demonstration that <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> itself can induce ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization and mitochondrial <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> accumulation in permeabilized cardiomyocytes. The role of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> was previously inferred from the effects of superoxide dismutase mimetic compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon4">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Reaction-diffusion theory (pioneered by Turing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Turing1">[23]</xref>), as a basis for pattern formation in biological or chemical systems, emphasizes the importance of two components; an autocatalytic reaction producing a local product (mediator), and the transport of this product by diffusion away from the source. This process can give rise to spontaneous symmetry-breaking and the appearance of self-organized spatial patterns including waves and oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon9">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon10">[30]</xref>. With respect to the present model, the reaction consists of the reduction of O<sub>2</sub> to produce ROS (specifically O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>) driven by mitochondrial electron donors (e.g., NADH). The local concentration of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> around the mitochondrion is shaped by several others factors, including buffering by the antioxidant reactions and transport of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> across the mitochondrial membrane. As in many reaction-diffusion systems, the mitochondrial oscillator also displays an inhibitory, or a self-limiting, mechanism; the concentration of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> at the activator site on IMAC decreases during ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization because <italic>i)</italic> the rate of scavenging by SOD increases as <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> accumulates and <italic>ii)</italic> the driving force for <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> production and transport diminishes. Diffusion of the <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> to neighboring mitochondria is shaped by the <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> diffusion coefficient (<italic>D</italic><sub>O2</sub><sup>.−</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) and the amount of the <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> scavenger enzyme, <italic>etSOD</italic>, which consequently determines the rate of propagation of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization through the network. As expected, increasing <italic>etSOD</italic> slowed down the depolarization wave. The rate of propagation of the depolarization wave in the model corresponded to 26 µm s<sup>−1</sup> with low <italic>D</italic><sub>O2</sub><sup>.−</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> (on the order of 10<sup>−14</sup>), which compares well with the experimentally determined 22 µm s<sup>−1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon5">[9]</xref> at 37°C. A restricted diffusion range of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> in cells is consistent with experimental data; however, the actual diffusion coefficient of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> in cells (with antioxidant systems disabled) has not been determined and is likely to be influenced by local reactions with other molecules and molecular crowding around mitochondria, which would decrease the effective volume and increase the viscosity of the medium. This assumption of restricted diffusion is represented by the low <italic>D</italic><sub>O2</sub><sup>.−</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> in the model.</p>
<p>Scaling of local interactions in complex dynamic systems to produce global emergent behavior is common in physical, social, financial and biological networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Sornette1">[31]</xref>. The RD-RIRR model illustrates how local neighbor-neighbor interactions (1–2 µm distance) can lead to long distance spatiotemporal patterns. Mechanistically, in cell-wide mitochondrial oscillations, propagation is mediated by regenerative RIRR between neighboring mitochondria. Our previous work treated the network as a percolation lattice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon5">[9]</xref> and we postulated that near the percolation threshold of the system, any mitochondrion within the spanning cluster (i.e., one which is close to the critical level of ROS accumulation in the matrix) can depolarize, producing a burst of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic>, which diffuses to its neighbor with a particular spatial concentration profile that is a function of the rate of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> scavenging, to elicit a cell-wide response. A suprathreshold level of cytoplasmic <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> must reach the neighboring mitochondrion for the response to be regenerative, eliciting the O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>-mediated opening of IMAC. In the model, the open probability of IMAC increases as a function of O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>, which alters the IMAC conductance versus ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> relationship (see Eq.50 in the Supplementary Materials). The initial IMAC opening leads to a regenerative increase in ROS because the increased energy dissipation accelerates respiration, in turn increasing the number of electrons shunting to O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>, which crosses the inner membrane to further activate IMAC.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the global response is very much dependent on both the arrangement of mitochondria in the network and also the number of mitochondria close to the threshold. Before the first ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization, the balance of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> production to <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> scavenging must approach the threshold of oxidative stress in approximately 60% of the mitochondria, at which point a small perturbation can cause the synchronous collapse (and/or oscillation) of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> in the mitochondrial network. We referred to this vulnerable state as <italic>mitochondrial criticality</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon2">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon5">[9]</xref>. A limitation of this first RD-RIRR model is that it does not entirely reproduce the collective properties of network close to the critical state. For example, when we trigger ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> oscillations by laser flash, the local increase in ROS load on the network is enough to induce a gradual accumulation of oxidative stress throughout the cell, and the bulk of the network gets closer and closer to criticality. The first global wave of depolarization does not usually happen instantaneously after the trigger, but often occurs after several minutes of delay: it presumably originates from a region having a suprathreshold level of ROS to trigger IMAC opening, and neighbors that are also close to the threshold. The phase of initial spreading of the “oxidative load” after laser stimulation is a collective network property that is difficult to represent with this simple reaction-diffusion model (indeed, modeling the behavior of critical systems is a nascent science). At the edge of criticality, depolarization of even a single mitochondrion can evoke collapse of almost the entire network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g010">Fig. 10</xref>, see also Supplemental Materials <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000657.s007">Video S4</xref>). Alternatively, we can induce a critical state of the mitochondrial network by depleting the antioxidant defenses of the cell (globally) with diamide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon6">[10]</xref>). In this condition, we hypothesize that a local increase of ROS above threshold in any part of the 3D network could evoke RIRR. Specifically, the fast synchronized ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization-repolarization cycles and waves are the aspects of the phenomenon that are well-reproduced by the 2D RD-RIRR model. Another limitation of current 1D and 2D models is that in the actual experiments, the <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> can, of course, diffuse both laterally and vertically to other mitochondria, that is, in all 3 dimensions. Presumably, the ROS will have a similar diffusion rate in all directions, although this might depend on the structural organization of the organelles, membranes, and myofilaments. A 3D network would introduce additional triggerable ROS sources above and below the mitochondrion, which could, theoretically, alter the rate of wave propagation. This could be explored in the future by extending the model to three dimensions; however, we do not think that the major conclusions of the study regarding the properties of the excitable system will be substantially different.</p>

<p>The RD-RIRR simulations revealed a novel aspect of RIRR-mediated coupling. A small number of oscillating mitochondria could elicit oscillations in the entire network in both the 1D and 2D models, even though the parameters were set for stable behavior in most of the network (i.e., the percentage of respiration leaking to ROS was below threshold for independent oscillation). This indicates that entrainment by forced oscillation might also occur in the mitochondrial network. In this case, the combined effects of subthreshold ROS release and ROS diffusion from nearby mitochondria exceed the threshold for a regenerative response. This behavior is evident as recruitment of more and more mitochondria into the oscillatory cluster after several cycles of oscillation (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000657-g008">Fig. 8D</xref> and the corresponding movie in the Supplemental Materials, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000657.s006">Video S3</xref>).</p>
<p>While focusing on a specific mechanism of RIRR (i.e., IMAC-mediated), the present findings also provide general theoretical support for mitochondrial communication via RIRR. The RD-RIRR model simulations confirm that <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> diffusion occurring locally between neighboring mitochondria over a distance of a few microns is sufficient for propagation and synchronization of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization over a larger distance. RIRR involving PTP-dependent depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Zorov2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Brady1">[32]</xref> can be readily incorporated into the model in the future; however, at present it is unclear what additional factors besides ROS may be required to evoke this more pronounced, and typically irreversible, cell death event. In our own experiments, we have demonstrated that the IMAC mechanism occurs with mild-to-moderate oxidative stress (by GSH depletion or lower <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> levels) while PTP activation occurs during more severe stress, e.g. with further GSH depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Aon6">[10]</xref>, or, in the present study, at higher <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> concentrations. Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload is also thought to be a requirement for PTP activation as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-DiLisa1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000657-Halestrap1">[34]</xref>. Hence, it is necessary to gain a better understanding of the interplay between the ROS species and the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> load in the activation of the PTP in the intact myocyte before a comprehensive PTP activation model can be constructed.</p>
<p>In summary, we show that the autocatalytic release of <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> and diffusion between mitochondria are the essential components of propagated RIRR between mitochondria in a closely packed array like that found in the cardiomyocyte. The kinetics and emergent spatiotemporal patterns of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> depolarization in the RD-RIRR mitochondrial network are modulated by <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> production, <italic>O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup></italic> scavenging, and diffusion. The highly interdependent nature of the mitochondria as a network of oscillators also suggests that synchronization by forced oscillation may occur when only a part of the network is perturbed.</p>

<p>In order to reduce the computation time, we assume that the cytoplasmic region outside each mitochondrion is homogeneous. We also assume that ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>, ion, and metabolite concentrations are uniform within each mitochondrion. The model was coded in C<sup>++</sup> and run on a desktop computer. The ordinary differential equations (ODEs) were integrated numerically by CVODE, a stiff ODEs solver that uses variable coefficient Adams and BDF methods (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/1230.html" xlink:type="simple">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/1230.html</ext-link>). Of note, the C++ code includes an implementation of L'Hopital's rule to take into account an anomaly in the expression for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter, which becomes indeterminate at 91 mV. L'Hôpital's rule converts the indeterminate form to a determinate one; however, as the change in ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> is so rapid, the exception is rarely invoked because that specific point is seldom reached (the integrator typically “steps over” this point).</p>
