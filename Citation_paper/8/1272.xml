          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The promise of modern personalized medicine is to use molecular and clinical
                        information to better diagnose, manage, and treat disease, on an individual
                        patient basis. These functions are predominantly enabled by molecular
                        signatures, which are computational models for predicting phenotypes and
                        other responses of interest from high-throughput assay data. Data-analytics
                        is a central component of molecular signature development and can jeopardize
                        the entire process if conducted incorrectly. While exploratory data analysis
                        may tolerate suboptimal protocols, clinical-grade molecular signatures are
                        subject to vastly stricter requirements. Closing the gap between standards
                        for exploratory versus clinically successful molecular signatures entails a
                        thorough understanding of possible biases in the data analysis phase and
                        developing strategies to avoid them.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology and Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Using a recently introduced data-analytic protocol as a case study, we
                        provide an in-depth examination of the poorly studied biases of the
                        data-analytic protocols related to signature multiplicity, biomarker
                        redundancy, data preprocessing, and validation of signature reproducibility.
                        The methodology and results presented in this work are aimed at expanding
                        the understanding of these data-analytic biases that affect development of
                        clinically robust molecular signatures.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions and Significance</title>
          <p>Several recommendations follow from the current study. First, all molecular
                        signatures of a phenotype should be extracted to the extent possible, in
                        order to provide comprehensive and accurate grounds for understanding
                        disease pathogenesis. Second, redundant genes should generally be removed
                        from final signatures to facilitate reproducibility and decrease
                        manufacturing costs. Third, data preprocessing procedures should be designed
                        so as not to bias biomarker selection. Finally, molecular signatures
                        developed and applied on different phenotypes and populations of patients
                        should be treated with great caution.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The promise of personalized medicine is to use molecular and clinical information to
                better diagnose, manage, and treat disease on an individual patient basis. These
                functions are predominantly enabled by <italic>molecular signatures</italic> that
                are computational models for predicting phenotypes and other responses of interest
                from high-throughput assay data. Many molecular signatures have been developed to
                date from high-throughput data, and some of them have passed regulatory approval and
                are currently used in clinical practice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Sparano1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Glas1">[2]</xref>. However, data-analytics for
                development of clinically robust molecular signatures is challenging and can
                undermine the entire effort, if it is not conducted correctly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Baggerly1">[3]</xref>. Whereas substantial tolerance
                to suboptimal data-analytic protocols (e.g., not perfectly unbiased, slightly
                underpowered, leading to redundant biomarkers, etc.) exists for exploratory
                research, extra care has to be taken for development of molecular signatures for
                clinical use. <italic>Clinical-grade</italic> molecular signatures are subject to
                vastly more stringent operating quality requirements since such signatures may guide
                life-and-death decisions. Clinical-grade signatures must also satisfy higher
                cost-effectiveness and accessibility requirements. In addition, succumbing to data
                analysis biases can prevent otherwise promising molecular signatures from reaching
                the market by not meeting requirements for the regulatory approval. In short, design
                of data-analytic protocols for development of clinical-grade molecular signatures is
                a very important problem with characteristics distinctively different from those of
                exploratory data-analytics.</p>
      <p>Closing the gap between standards for exploratory versus clinically successful
                molecular signatures entails a thorough understanding of possible biases in the data
                analysis phase and developing strategies to avoid them. Previous research has
                identified several biases of data-analytics for molecular signature development
                which include: using unsupervised methods (e.g., clustering) for development of
                molecular signatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Simon1">[4]</xref>; biasing signature accuracy estimation by conducting
                supervised gene selection both on training and testing data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Simon1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Ambroise1">[5]</xref>; biasing selection of
                biomarkers by inappropriately using clinical covariates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Statnikov1">[6]</xref>; and failing to identify
                predictive signal by using underpowered data-analytic protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Aliferis1">[7]</xref> or conducting
                gene selection for a different phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Statnikov2">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present work we aim to expand the understanding of data-analytic biases that
                critically affect development of clinically robust molecular signatures. As a case
                study, we use a recently introduced data-analytic protocol that led to development
                of a 30-gene âacute respiratory viral responseâ molecular signature for
                distinguishing individuals with symptomatic acute respiratory viral infections from
                uninfected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas1">[9]</xref>. In a preliminary work we briefly mentioned possible
                biases of the prior data-analytic protocol related to estimation of signature
                predictive accuracy, validation of signature in independent data, biomarker
                redundancy, and signature multiplicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Statnikov3">[10]</xref>. Here we provide an in-depth
                technical treatment of these and other biases with an emphasis on what created them
                and how to avoid them in similar future research. We demonstrate our findings using
                three datasets that have been recently used for development of molecular signatures
                of infectious diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Ramilo1">[12]</xref>. The conclusions of the present study extend well beyond
                the development of gene expression-based molecular signature of acute respiratory
                viral infections; the results readily generalize to other protocols, phenotypes, and
                assay platforms.</p>

        <p>As the main dataset for development of molecular signatures in this work we used
                    the microarray gene expression dataset of Zaas <italic>et al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas1">[9]</xref> that was
                    downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number
                    GSE17156. This dataset contained 113 normalized gene expression profiles of
                    peripheral blood samples collected from subjects at two time points: (i) prior
                    to inoculation with one of three respiratory viruses (HRV, RSV and influenza A)
                    and (ii) at the peak time of symptoms. The pre-inoculation samples are referred
                    to as <italic>baseline</italic> or <italic>unexposed</italic> samples. The
                    post-inoculation samples are referred to as <italic>peak time</italic> or
                        <italic>exposed</italic>. One of the 113 samples (GSM429232) did not have a
                    matching baseline gene expression profile and was excluded from analysis. Thus,
                    the dataset used in this work contained in total 112 gene expression profiles.
                    Their break down by virus type and time of collection (baseline or peak) is

                    generation patient diagnostics and personalized treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Statnikov5">[15]</xref>. Therefore, it is
                    informative not only to show the existence of a single signature for a given
                    phenotype variable, but also to seek all possible maximally predictive
                    signatures that do not contain redundant genes. Such analysis allows to improve
                    discovery of the underlying biological mechanisms by not missing genes that are
                    implicated mechanistically in the disease processes. Furthermore this analysis

        <p>To extract multiple molecular signatures, we apply a recently introduced and
                    provably correct algorithm TIE* that outputs the complete set of maximally

                    TIE* is based on Markov boundary induction which enables probabilistic
                    modeling of multiple signatures and formally connects them with the causal graph

        <p>In this work, we use Generalized Local Learning (abbreviated as GLL; specific

                    algorithm was motivated by its empirical performance in microarray gene
                    expression and other high-throughput data as well as its theoretical properties

        <title>Method for assessing redundancy of genes in a molecular signature</title>
        <p>A gene is considered to be redundant with respect to the phenotype if its removal
                    from the molecular signature does not decrease the signature's predictive
                    accuracy. Thus, in principle, redundancy can be assessed using so-called wrapper
                    algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Kohavi1">[26]</xref>. However, wrapping techniques are prone to
                    overfitting due to a very large number of comparisons, and in small-sample
                    settings they can falsely conclude that different sets of biomarkers have the
                    same predictive accuracy when in reality they do not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Aliferis2">[23]</xref>. Thus we test the
                    redundancy of genes using a more conservative approach with the following two
                    steps. First, we find genes that do not carry any association with the phenotype
                    conditioned on another gene from the signature using Fisher's Z-test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Anderson1">[27]</xref> at

                    such genes, we do not readily exclude them from the molecular signature but do
                    so only if their removal does not lead to decrease in predictive accuracy of the
                    signature (as measured by the area under ROC curve and compared using
                    statistical test of Delong <italic>et al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-DeLong1">[28]</xref>). The

                    training data only. The resulting non-redundant signature is subsequently
                    validated in an independent data and its predictive accuracy is compared to the

                    which different preprocessing methods may bias gene selection. Under the
                    assumption that the null hypothesis holds in the data and if a preprocessing
                    method does not bias gene selection, we would expect none of the genes to be
                    selected as significantly associated with the phenotype. However, since we are
                    simulating the null hypothesis by permuting the phenotype variable in a real
                    dataset where expression of different genes may not be independent of others and
                    where small sample effects may be present, a small number of genes may be deemed
                    significantly associated with the phenotype even under an unbiased preprocessing
                    method. Because such effects are expected to be minimal when no preprocessing is
                    performed, we use it as a baseline against which all other preprocessing methods
                    can be evaluated. If after some preprocessing, the number of significantly
                    associated genes increases relative to no preprocessing, this signals that the
                    applied preprocessing method may bias gene selection by potentially increasing
                    the number of false positives.</p>

        <p>We consider six different data preprocessing methods that are applied in the
                    current study after the standard microarray data normalization by RMA. The first
                    method establishes a baseline and consists of no preprocessing. The second
                    method was used in the protocol of Zaas <italic>et al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas1">[9]</xref> and consists
                    of centering the data by subtracting the grand mean from the entire gene
                    expression dataset. The third method standardizes each gene expression variable
                    to have zero mean and standard deviation of one. The fourth method rescales each
                    gene expression variable to lie in the interval [0,1]. These four
                    methods are commonly used in gene expression analysis and are unsupervised in a
                    sense that they do not take into account the phenotype information, and thus are
                    unlikely to introduce gene selection biases.</p>
        <p>The fifth preprocessing method considered here was implemented in the
                    supplementary software of Zaas <italic>et al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas1">[9]</xref> and was
                    aimed at correcting differences between gene expression profiles of the
                    uninfected subjects from different experimental cohorts (i.e., HRV, RSV and
                    Influenza A). This correction was performed using all subjects within each
                    cohort by first computing the mean gene expression profile of the uninfected
                    subjects within the cohort and then subtracting this mean profile from all gene
                    expression profiles (i.e., infected and uninfected) in the cohort. The key
                    assumptions underlying this preprocessing method are that all uninfected
                    subjects should have similar gene expression profiles and that the observed
                    differences are entirely due to the so-called âbatching effectâ
                    arising from technical variation when assaying biological samples. An
                    illustration of the effects of this preprocessing method is given in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020662.s009">Text
                    S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>The sixth preprocessing method considered here is ComBat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Johnson1">[34]</xref>, which also aims to
                    alleviate the influence of batch effects on the analysis of gene expression data
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Leek1">[35]</xref>. ComBat
                    relies on two assumptions: (i) that all uninfected subjects should have similar
                    gene expression profiles and (ii) that batch effects affect gene expression
                    measurements in a similar way across many genes. In ComBat, batch effects are
                    first modeled as additive (i.e., location) and multiplicative (i.e., scale)
                    components of the observed gene expression levels for each gene. These estimates
                    are then updated in a Bayesian framework that pools information on batch effect
                    estimates from all the genes in the dataset. We chose ComBat for our evaluation
                    due to this method's computational efficiency and lack of ad-hoc
                    parameters, which makes ComBat appropriate for application in a
                    permutation-based framework. When applying ComBat, the phenotype was supplied as
                    a covariate in addition to the cohort incidence variable. This was done in order
                    to allow ComBat to retain the variation in gene expression profiles that was due
                    to biological responses to pathogens.</p>

        <p>Evaluation of data-analytic protocols in real data is challenging due to absence
                    of a biological gold standard describing true interactions between genes and the
                    phenotype. For this reason and in order to illustrate in a controlled

                    from the protocol of Zaas <italic>et al.</italic>

                    to evaluate the considered data-analytic protocol in terms of its effectiveness
                    in extracting the complete set of relationships between genes and the phenotype.
                    Identification of these relationships is essential for constructing a
                    comprehensive view of the underlying biological process.</p>
        <p>When applied to <italic>TIED</italic>, factor analysis-based method extracted
                    only a single signature containing 30 genes, 4 of which were causally relevant

                    were irrelevant and without association with the phenotype. (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020662.s001">Figure S1</xref>

                    that are causally directly related to the phenotype. In contrast, TIE*

                        (<italic>MX1</italic>). A panviral signature constructed on the basis of the
                    20 remaining non-redundant genes achieved the same predictive accuracy (1.0 AUC)
                    in the independent validation data of Ramilo <italic>et al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Ramilo1">[12]</xref> as the
                    original signature.</p>
        <p>It should be noted, however, that redundancy is not always equivalent to
                    biological irrelevance of the genes, but only implies that the redundant genes
                    do not carry any additional predictive information about the phenotype beyond
                    what's conveyed by the non-redundant genes. While presence of redundant
                    genes in a signature could potentially worsen its reproducibility and would
                    surely increase its manufacturing costs, in some cases it may be desirable to
                    explicitly engineer redundancy into a molecular signature in order to improve
                    its robustness for a specific phenotype. We would argue, however, that such
                    redundancy should arise from a careful methodological design rather than being
                    an unintended consequence of applying a certain data analytic technique.</p>

                    resulted in an average of 55.6 genes being deemed significant with standard

        <p>We note that these results were obtained in simulated conditions of no biological
                    signal in the data. A study of behavior of the considered batch correction
                    methods under the alternative hypothesis of presence of a biologically
                    meaningful signal remains an open research direction that would have to rely on
                    biological validation of genes selected on preprocessed data. Preliminary
                    results reported here suggest that the two batch correction methods may
                    potentially lead to an increase in the number of false positives in the output
                    of statistical methods for gene selection. We hypothesize that the increased
                    number of statistically significant genes came as a result of decreases in
                    within-group variance in expression of genes in the infected and uninfected
                    groups of subjects after correcting for batch effects. When not offset by a
                    comparable decrease in differences between the groups' mean gene expression
                    profiles, this decrease in variance may cause an appearance of statistically
                    significant associations between the phenotype and genes that were not
                    significantly differentially expressed before data preprocessing. We further
                    illustrate this behavior in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020662.s002">Figure S2</xref> that shows distributions of
                    variance of gene expression in the original (i.e., non-permuted) infected and
                    uninfected subjects as well as differences between mean expression of genes in
                    the two groups of subjects before and after preprocessing by the supplementary
                    software of Zaas <italic>et al.</italic> As made evident by <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020662.s002">Figure S2</xref>,
                    preprocessing reduced within-group variances of gene expression while leaving
                    differences between group means largely unchanged. Data preprocessing by ComBat
                    had a very similar effect and the corresponding histograms are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020662.s003">Figure

        <p>A specific example illustrating the above effects of preprocessing in the
                    original (non-permuted) data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020662-g001">Figure 1</xref>. As can be seen in that figure,
                    within-class variances decreased roughly five-fold for gene
                        <italic>RIBC2</italic> as a result of batch correction using the
                    supplementary software of Zaas <italic>et al</italic>. Consequently, the p-value

                    and the panviral phenotype. Although the two classes of gene expression profiles

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas1">[9]</xref>. We applied
                    a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test with FDR 0.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Benjamini2">[33]</xref> to identify genes
                    statistically significantly associated with the panviral phenotype, either
                    before or after preprocessing. While only 1,759 genes were significantly
                    associated with the phenotype in the original data, the number of significant
                    genes in the preprocessed data was four times higher, amounting to 7,347 genes
                    when the data was preprocessed using the supplementary software of Zaas
                        <italic>et al.</italic> and 7,557 genes when using ComBat. Notably, all
                    genes that were significantly associated with the phenotype before preprocessing
                    remained significant after preprocessing. Therefore, none of the genes lost
                    their association and 5,588 (5,798 for ComBat) genes gained association with the
                    phenotype as a result of preprocessing.</p>
        <p>These findings indicate that special care has to be taken when applying
                    preprocessing methods for gene expression analysis. Batch effect correction
                    methods may be appropriate for application in cases when significant biological
                    differences between samples can be ruled out. However, the cohort recruitment
                    protocol of Zaas <italic>et al.</italic> does not allow such biological
                    differences to be ruled out without additional validation. According to Zaas
                        <italic>et al.</italic>, the HRV cohort was recruited through an active
                    screening protocol at the University of Virginia, so these subjects may be a
                    younger, healthier group mostly composed of college students, and are more
                    likely to be middle to upper-middle class. The RSV cohort was recruited and
                    infected through Retroscreen Virology, London, a company that specializes in
                    clinical trials on viruses. It is likely that the ages of the subjects are more
                    diverse than the HRV cohort, and perhaps the racial make-up is more diverse as
                    well since London has a more ethnically diverse population than Charlottesville,
                    Virginia. The influenza cohort was recruited and infected through Retroscreen
                    Virology, Brentwood, UK. Brentwood is 20 miles outside of London, a suburban
                    setting. It is likely that volunteers are more diverse in age and less racially
                    diverse than the London (RSV) cohort.</p>
        <p>Given the above stated observations on the effects of batch correction methods
                    and due to a lack of information regarding the causes of differences between the

                    HRV, RSV, or influenza A. In an attempt to demonstrate specificity of this
                    molecular signature to viral infections, Zaas <italic>et al.</italic> applied
                    this signature for classification of subjects with bacterial and viral
                    (Influenza A) infections in the data of Ramilo <italic>et al.</italic>

                    reported a predictive accuracy of roughly 0.94 AUC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas1">[9]</xref>. This interesting result
                    raises the following question that we address below: Why a molecular signature
                    developed for one task (<italic>differentiating between uninfected subjects and
                        subjects with viral infections</italic>) was successful in performing
                    another task (<italic>differentiating between subjects with bacterial and viral

                    the molecular signature (classifier) of Zaas <italic>et al.</italic> This

                    (healthy) whereas subjects to the right of the line would be classified as
                    virally infected. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020662-g002">Figure 2</xref>
                    also demonstrates that the same molecular signature can incidentally be used to
                    accurately differentiate between subjects with bacterial and viral infections
                    from the dataset of Ramilo <italic>et al.</italic>, thus confirming the finding
                    of Zaas <italic>et al.</italic> However, this result is due to a lucky choice of
                    genes in the molecular signature of Zaas <italic>et al.</italic> that was either
                    helped by redundant genes for the viral phenotype (recall that only 20 gene
                    probes were non-redundant) and/or could have been informed by other criteria and
                    procedures not reported in the original publication. When we substituted factor
                    analysis-based gene selection in the protocol of Zaas <italic>et al.</italic>
                    with GLL, which by design yields only non-redundant genes for the viral
                    phenotype, predictive accuracy for the bacterial vs. viral classification task
                    was reduced to 0.60 AUC. This indicates that the finding of Zaas <italic>et
                        al.</italic> is method-dependent. Moreover, the following subsection shows
                    that the methodology employed by Zaas <italic>et al.</italic> for evaluating the
                    specificity of their molecular signature to viral infections does not generalize

        <p>These results demonstrate that molecular signatures developed for one phenotype
                    and population of subjects and applied to another phenotype and/or population
                    are highly problematic. There is no reason to undertake this risk when one can
                    apply supervised techniques to data for the <italic>same</italic> phenotype and
                    population of subjects. Specifically, in case of performing classification of
                    virally and bacterially infected subjects, one would need to develop a new
                    molecular signature using gene expression profiles of patients with viral and
                    bacterial infections. Although this recommendation may seem obvious, current
                    practices in clinical research suggest otherwise. For instance, extrapolation of
                    results obtained using animal models to humans has been a de-facto methodology
                    underlying much of translational clinical and biomedical research. However,
                    animal models are often not representative of the effects an intervention may

                    when applications of a model in a different organism or phenotype cannot be
                    justified biologically, data-analytic protocols should be applied to construct

                    microarray gene expression dataset that was used for development of molecular

                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas1">[9]</xref>. Note
                    that since the Candidemia dataset was collected from a different organism than
                    the acute respiratory viral response dataset and because Candidemia is a
                    drastically different disease than respiratory infections, we do not draw
                    comparisons between genes comprising molecular signatures of Candidemia and
                    genes comprising molecular signatures of the panviral phenotype discussed
                    earlier. In what follows, we only compare molecular signatures developed in the
                    Candidemia dataset.</p>
        <p>By employing factor analysis, the original study showed the existence of a single

                    healthy controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas2">[11]</xref>. Using the TIE* algorithm, we identified 2,922
                    novel non-redundant and maximally predictive signatures of Candidemia in the
                    same set of training samples. On average, each novel signature contained 14
                    genes, and together all signatures spanned over 65 distinct genes. The average
                    phenotype classification performance of these signatures in the testing set of
                    samples was 0.996 AUC with a standard deviation of 0.01 AUC. Notably, 2,513 (or
                    86%) of the signatures discovered by TIE* achieved
                    AUCâ=â1.0. The complete list of molecular signatures
                    discovered by TIE* and the genes comprising those signatures can be found in
                        <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020662.s008">Dataset

                    were no genes in common between the Candidemia signature of Zaas <italic>et
                        al.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas2">[11]</xref> and
                    multiple signatures indentified by TIE*.</p>
        <p>We have further assessed redundancy within the 82-gene signature and found 79
                    redundant and only 3 non-redundant gene probes: 1449453_at
                        (<italic>Bst1</italic>), 1424254_at (<italic>Ifitm1</italic>), 1421304_at
                        (<italic>Klra2</italic>). A molecular signature developed on the basis of
                    these three non-redundant genes achieved predictive accuracy of 1.0 AUC in the
                    independent validation data, which is the same as the accuracy of the original
                    82-gene signature.</p>
        <p>Next, we observed that the effects of batch correction methods on gene selection
                    extend beyond the acute respiratory viral infections dataset and that such
                    preprocessing also biases gene selection in the Candidemia dataset. In this
                    case, there were two experimental batches corresponding to samples from the
                        <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> cohorts,
                    respectively. Each batch contained samples from infected and uninfected mice.
                    The phenotype variable differentiated between infected and uninfected samples.
                    Experiments conducted under the null hypothesis of no association between the
                    genes and the phenotype produced results consistent with the ones obtained in
                    the acute respiratory viral infections dataset. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0020662-t004">Table 4</xref>, the average number
                    of significantly associated genes under no preprocessing, centering,
                    standardization and [0,1] scaling was 82.6 with standard error 6.407
                    over 10,000 permutations. The number of significantly associated genes increased
                    to an average of 221.8 with standard error 10.98 when preprocessing from the
                    supplementary software of Zaas <italic>et al.</italic> was applied. Similarly,
                    preprocessing by ComBat resulted in 253.2 (standard error 11.743) significant

                    produced 11,256 genes that were significantly associated with the phenotype
                    differentiating between bacterially infected and uninfected samples. However,
                    the same experiment in the data after preprocessing resulted in 13,590
                    significantly associated genes when using the supplementary software of Zaas
                        <italic>et al.</italic> and 13,850 genes after preprocessing with ComBat.
                    Similarly to the results obtained in the acute respiratory viral infections
                    dataset, none of the genes in the Candidemia dataset lost their association and
                    2,334 and 2,594 genes gained association with the phenotype as a result of
                    preprocessing with the two batch correction methods.</p>

                    indistinguishable from that of a signature with no predictive power (0.5 AUC).
                    In addition, the study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas2">[11]</xref> has reported the ability to accurately classify the

        <title>Conclusion and operational recommendations</title>
        <p>The science and technology of molecular signatures is positioned to play a
                    crucial role in the advancement of personalized medicine and clinical
                    diagnostics. Data-analytics is a central component of molecular signature
                    development. On the basis of many recent meta-analyses and re-analyses of prior
                    experiments it becomes evident that biased data analytics are emerging as a
                    major obstacle for progress in personalized medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Baggerly1">[3]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Aliferis1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Ntzani1">[40]</xref>. Improving
                    data-analytics for development of clinical-grade molecular signatures requires
                    detailed understanding of the data analysis biases and development of strategies
                    to avoid them. In this work, we presented a case study evaluating a
                    data-analytic protocol that has recently led to development of an important
                    30-gene signature of acute respiratory viral infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas1">[9]</xref> and also informed the
                    development of the 82-gene signature of Candidemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Zaas2">[11]</xref>. Conclusions of this study,
                    however, are not specific to the analysis of acute respiratory viral infections
                    and generalize to other domains as was made evident by validation of our results
                    in additional data. Below we summarize our key findings and operational
                    recommendations to data analysts based on empirical results reported in this
                    paper.</p>
        <p>First, we showed the existence of many different and equally accurate molecular
                    signatures of the phenotypes. Therefore, in order to obtain comprehensive and
                    accurate grounds for understanding pathogenesis, data-analytic protocols should
                    extract, to the extent possible, <italic>all</italic> molecular signatures of a
                    phenotype rather than focusing on an arbitrarily chosen <italic>single</italic>
                    signature. Whenever possible, analysis that separates statistical instability
                    from intrinsic information equivalency should be undertaken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020662-Statnikov5">[15]</xref>. Second,
                    our results demonstrate the presence of redundant genes in prior molecular
                    signatures and highlight the need for routine assessment of molecular signatures
                    for redundancy with respect to the phenotype. Generally, if some genes are found
                    to be redundant, they can be excluded from the molecular signature, because such
                    genes do not contribute additional predictive information about the phenotype
                    and have the potential to worsen signature reproducibility and increase its
                    manufacturing costs. In certain cases, however, it may be necessary to
                    explicitly engineer redundancy into a molecular signature in order to improve
                    its robustness for a specific phenotype. Such redundancy should arise from a
                    careful methodological design rather than being an unintended consequence of
                    applying a certain data analytic technique. Third, we showed that data
                    preprocessing may bias gene selection. It is therefore necessary to assess the
                    effects of any preprocessing and other steps of data-analytic protocols on
                    selection of genes. Furthermore, subsequent analyses should not assume that the
                    same preprocessing would be appropriate in a different setting. Finally,
                    molecular signatures should be developed and applied to the same phenotype and
                    population of subjects. Failure to do so may result in spurious findings and
                    non-reproducible data-analytic protocols, as was demonstrated in the present
                    study. The methodology and results presented in this work combined with
                    previously established bias avoidance strategies aim to further advance the
                    process of development of clinically successful molecular signatures by
                    improving the associated data-analytic protocols.</p>
