          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Although it is known that RNA interference (RNAi) targeting viral genes protects experimental animals, such as mice, from the challenge of Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), it has not been previously investigated whether shRNAs targeting FMDV in transgenic dairy cattle or primary transgenic bovine epithelium cells will confer resistance against FMDV challenge.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Principal Finding</title>
          <p>Here we constructed three recombinant lentiviral vectors containing shRNA against VP2 (RNAi-VP2), VP3 (RNAi-VP3), or VP4 (RNAi-VP4) of FMDV, and found that all of them strongly suppressed the transient expression of a FLAG-tagged viral gene fusion protein in 293T cells. In BHK-21 cells, RNAi-VP4 was found to be more potent in inhibition of viral replication than the others with over 98% inhibition of viral replication. Therefore, recombinant lentiviral vector RNAi-VP4 was transfected into bovine fetal fibroblast cells to generate transgenic nuclear donor cells. With subsequent somatic cell cloning, we generated forty transgenic blastocysts, and then transferred them to 20 synchronized recipient cows. Three transgenic bovine fetuses were obtained after pregnant period of 4 months, and integration into chromosome in cloned fetuses was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The primary tongue epithelium cells of transgenic fetuses were isolated and inoculated with 100 TCID<sub>50</sub> of FMDV, and it was observed that shRNA significantly suppressed viral RNA synthesis and inhibited over 91% of viral replication after inoculation of FMDV for 48 h.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>RNAi-VP4 targeting viral VP4 gene appears to prevent primary epithelium cells of transgenic bovine fetus from FMDV infection, and it could be a candidate shRNA used for cultivation of transgenic cattle against FMDV.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a severe, clinically acute, vesicular disease of cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle, swine, and sheep, as well as more than 70 species of wild animals, its outbreaks have occurred in every livestock-containing region of the world with the exception of New Zealand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Grubman1">[1]</xref>. Although FMD does not result in high mortality in adult animals, the disease has debilitating effects, including weight loss, decrease in milk production, and loss of draught power, resulting in a loss in productivity for a considerable time. However, mortality can be high in young animals, where the virus can affect the heart. In addition, cattle, sheep, and goats can become carriers, and cattle can harbor virus for up to 2 to 3 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Brooksby1">[2]</xref>. The etiological agent of FMD is foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which is the type species of the <italic>Aphthovirus</italic> genus of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family. The presence of seven serotypes and multiple subtypes and variants has added to the difficulty of laboratory diagnosis and control of FMD. The rise of new variants is inevitably caused by continued circulation of the virus in the field and the quasispecies nature of the RNA genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Domingo1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Haydon1">[4]</xref>. Therefore, FMD is on the A list of infectious diseases of animals of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) and has been recognized as the most important constraint to international trade in animals and animal products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Leforban1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The introduction of the killed FMD vaccine has been extremely successful in reducing the number of disease outbreaks in many parts of the world where the disease is enzootic. However, there are a number of concerns and limitations with its use in emergency control programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Grubman1">[1]</xref>. For example, the antigenic variation within FMDV makes viruses easily escape from the host immune systems. Furthermore, vaccination may induce immunologic pressure within the population that could result in the emergence of a new variant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Grubman1">[1]</xref>. In addition, vaccines are serotype specific, there are no cross protective reaction among different serotypes. Moreover, the signs of FMD can appear as early as 2 days post exposure, however, current vaccines do not induce a protective response until 7 days post vaccination. Thus, early protection is required in the event of an FMD outbreak in a disease-free country to prevent virus amplification and disease spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-delosSantos1">[6]</xref>. Targeting virus using RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the possible alternative strategies for FMDV control because it is a rapid and effective antiviral approach, which can be used as an emergency for suspected cases, including persistently infected or susceptible animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Kim1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) can be designed to hybridize a particular viral mRNA to promote its degradation, thus serving as an effective antiviral approach to protect either plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Waterhouse1">[8]</xref> or animal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Bitko1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Gitlin1">[10]</xref> from viruses. This approach is a highly specific tool to down-regulate gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Leonard1">[11]</xref> and has been extensively utilized to inhibit FMDV <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-delosSantos1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Chen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Chen2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Cong1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Joyappa1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Kahana1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Liu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Lv1">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing FMDV targeting shRNA was much more resistant to viral infection, as evidenced by minor abnormal pathology, as compared to the control mice after challenge with FMDV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Wang1">[19]</xref>. However, little has been published regarding function of shRNA targeting FMDV for the prevention and control of FMD in transgenic cattle.</p>
      <p>In fact, transgenic farm animals have been developed and showed disease resistance. For example, expression of lysostaphin in mammary gland combated mastitis and protected transgenic cattle from mammary gland challenges by Staphylococcus aureus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Donovan1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Kerr1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Wall1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible to address disease problems in agriculturally important species using transgenic technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Kerr1">[21]</xref>, and genetic engineering can provide a viable tool for enhancing resistance to disease and improve the well-being of livestock.</p>
      <p>In this study, RNAi targeting VP2, VP3, and VP4, respectively, were constructed into Lenti-virus vectors. All shRNAs could silence viral gene in 293 cells and inhibit replication of FMDV in BHK-21 cells. Lenti-RNAi-VP4 vector was transfected into bovine fetal fibroblast cells, and transgenic stable cells were screened and selected as nuclear donor cells for subsequent somatic cell cloning. Three transgenic bovine fetuses expressing this shRNA were obtained, and their primary tongue epithelium cells were used to evaluate shRNA targeting effect against FMDV.</p>

        <p>We generated three lentiviral shRNAs targeting VP2 (Lenti-RNAi-VP2), VP3 (Lenti-RNAi-VP3), and VP4 (Lenti-RNAi-VP4), respectively, and co-transfected each individual construct with pcDNA3-FLAG-VP2, pcDNA3-FLAG-VP3, or pcDNA3-FLAG-VP4, respectively, into 293T cells. Expression of FLAG-VP2, FLAG-VP3, or FLAG-VP4 was determined by Western Blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042356-g001">Figure 1</xref>, shRNAs against viral genes significantly inhibited transient expression of FLAG-VP2, FLAG-VP3, or FLAG-VP4 as compared to the LacZ-control shRNA. RNAi-VP4 almost completely eliminated expression of VP4. These results strongly suggested a direct role of shRNAs in specifically blocking transient expression of viral proteins in 293T cells.</p>

        <p>Finally, we determined if shRNAs protects cells from virus infection. To this end, we determined the viral replications after inoculation of 100 TCID<sub>50</sub> of FMDV. While there is no difference in viral titer among cells expressing three transgenic shRNA (T1, T2, and T3), or among corresponding normal controls (N1, N2, and N3), significance exists when transgenic cells were compared to the normal controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042356-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>It was well-established that RNAi targeting viral genes could protect experimental animals from FMDV challenge, and the protection occurs rapidly and was specific. For example, neck subcutaneous injection of a multiple RNAi plasmid targeting VP1 gene rendered the suckling mice much less susceptible to FMDV serotype O and Asia I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Chen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Cong1">[14]</xref>. Likewise, shRNA targeting 3D gene protected guinea pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Joyappa1">[15]</xref> and swine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Chen2">[13]</xref> from challenge virus. Moreover, an attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis-mediated siRNA targeting 3D gene protected guinea pigs and swine against FMDV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Cong2">[23]</xref>, respectively. Although RNAi has been used as an effective antiviral strategy due to its specific silencing of viral gene expression, thus effectively controlling the severity of FMD infection and spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Chen2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Joyappa1">[15]</xref>, the pivotal issues of RNAi based anti-viral strategy are the delivery and stability of the RNAi reagents with delivery being the major hindence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Perrimon1">[24]</xref>. At the present time, there is no clinical application of RNAi targeting approach in farm. Given the fact that transgenic mice expressing FMDV targeting shRNA became much more resistant to the challenge of FMDV serotype Asia 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Wang1">[19]</xref>, transgenic cloning may be a useful tool for RNAi anti-viral strategy. Currently, no studies of transgenic shRNA function in cloven-hoofed animals have been reported.</p>
      <p>FMDV consists of a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 8.5 kb, the RNA is translated as a single long open reading frame into a long poly-peptide, which is undergone a series of post-translational proteolytic cleavages to generate different viral proteins, so RNAi may be screened based upon its ability to degrade the viral RNA. In fact, VP1, VP4, 3D, 2B, 5′NCR, VPg, or 3′NCR have been previously selected as RNAi target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-delosSantos1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Chen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Chen2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Cong1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Joyappa1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Kahana1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Liu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Lv1">[18]</xref>. If there are conserved regions of viral genes among different serotypes of FMDV, the viral genes could be screen as RNAi targets, so we choose RNAi-VP2, RNAi-VP3, RNAi-VP4 as target site in this study. We observed that shRNA targeting VP2, VP3 or VP4 gene of FMDV could silence expression of viral genes in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042356-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and inhibit over 91%, 94% and 98%, respectively, of viral replication in BHK-21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042356-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We achieved a very high level of inhibition of virus replication, likely due to selection of stable clones in which most cells expressed targeting shRNAs. The transient transfection of RNAi expressing plasmids/siRNA into BHK-21 cells was a common delivery method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-delosSantos1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Chen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Cong1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Kahana1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Liu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Lv1">[18]</xref>, with limitation of transfection efficiency, shRNA/siRNA was not expressed in most cells, resulting in an reduced inhibition of viral replication. In our study, stable BHK-21 cell lines expressing targeting shRNAs were selected via FACS sorting for eGFP, which is co-expressed in H1 Lenti-virus vector. Thus, to evaluate efficiency of any given candidate RNAi, the stable clones should be established in order to achieve a high level of anti-virus activity.</p>
      <p>In this study, we transfected RNAi-VP4 into bovine fetal fibroblasts cells, followed by transfering the transgenic cells into enucleated oocyte cytoplasts, selection of reconstructed embryos were selected based on their expression of eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042356-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and finally transferring the reconstructed embryos to synchronized recipient cows. Since the major focus of our study is to evaluate the efficiency of FMDV shRNA targeting after transgenic delivery, we used 4-month-old fetuses, insteading of adult animals, for the sake of saving time and money. We confirmed shRNA integration into chromosome of cloned fetuses by Southern Blotting and the expression of shRNA by Northern. Since four-month-old transgenic fetuses could not survive in vitro, for FMDV challenge assay, we used primary tongue epithelium cells established from small pieces of the mucosa collected from the tip of bovine tongue. Since the targeting sequence of RNAi-VP4 was conserved among O, A, and Aisa1 serotypes of FMDV, and ASIA1/YS/CHA/05 strain is able to grow well in BHK-21 cells and in primary tongue epithelium cells, we used ASIA1/YS/CHA/05 strain as challenge virus in this study. We found that shRNA expressed in transgenic fetuses could significantly degrade viral RNA after inoculation of FMDV at a titer of 100 TCID<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042356-g005">Figure 5</xref>), and inhibited viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042356-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, primary transgenic bovine fetus tongue epithelium cells became much more resistant to FMDV challenge.</p>
      <p>The most important threat caused by FMDV is the high speed of viral replication, short incubation time, and high contagiousness. Thus, although protective immune responses against FMDV can be efficacious, the rapidity of virus replication and spread can outpace the development of immune defenses and overrun the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Summerfield1">[25]</xref>. Our observation that shRNA inhibited over 91% of viral replication at 48 h after challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042356-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) suggest that RNAi-based virus targeting is useful for transgenic cows to get more time to develop immune defense. Needless to say, whether transgenic cows indeed become resistant to FMDV infection will wait for the future study using adult transgenic cows upon FMDV challenge. In fact, we have so far obtained on six-month old male transgenic dairy cattle (data not shown). The investigations in this area will help to improve the design of transgenic genes and the development of RNAi-based strategies against FMD.</p>
      <p>Due to their high degree of sequence specificity, shRNAs become ineffective in the presence of escape mutations within and outside the targeted regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Westerhout1">[26]</xref>, and effective silencing of a single viral gene does not always translate into antiviral effect due to genetic compensation or redundancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Alkhalil1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Hummler1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Sebat1">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, variations within multiple regions of the quasispecies of FMDV were retrospectively revealed by sequencing of FMDV genes, strategies to inhibit RNA virus multiplication based on the use of siRNAs have to consider the high genetic polymorphism exhibited by this group of virus. Thus, it may be important to use multiplex shRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042356-Li1">[30]</xref> if RNAi is to be developed for therapeutic use. In this study, we used shRNAs targeting of viral genes VP2, VP3, and VP4, and observed a significant inhibition of FMDV. Combination of these shRNAs may be necessary to avoid the evolution of escape variants.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we obtained three transgenic fetuses expressing RNAi-VP4 against FMDV. Study using primary tongue epithelium cells derived from these fetuses reveal that RNAi-VP4 degraded viral RNA and inhibited viral replication. This shRNA merits further investigation for cultivation of transgenic cattle against FMDV.</p>
