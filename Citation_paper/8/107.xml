<abstract>
<p>Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration that accelerates the loss of disc structural and functional integrities is recognized as one of the major factors of chronic back pain. Cardiovascular risk factors, such as deficits of apolipoproteins that elevate the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, are considered critical for the progress of atherosclerosis; notably in the abdominal aorta and its lumbar branching arteries that supply lumbar vertebrae and IVDs. Obstruction of the lumbar arteries by atherosclerosis is presumed to promote lumbar disc degeneration and low back pain. APOE-knockout rabbits have recently been shown to generate hyperlipidemia with increased levels of cholesterol and triglycerides that mimic the symptoms of atherosclerosis in humans. Here, we analysed IVD degeneration in the lumbar spines of ten homozygous APOE-knockout and four wild-type New Zealand White rabbits of matching age to prove accelerated IVD degeneration in APOE-knockout rabbits, since APOE-knockout rabbits could be a beneficial model for therapeutic approaches of degenerative IVD disorders. Experiments were performed using T1/T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, glucose-oxidase assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blot. APOE-knockout lumbar spines showed more advanced IVD degeneration, obstructed lumbar arteries and lower enhancement of contrast agent in IVDs. Moreover, lower concentration of glucose, lower number of viable cells and lower concentrations of aggrecan, collagen II and higher concentration of collagen I were detected in APOE-knockout IVDs (p &lt; 0.0001). APOE-knockout in rabbits could induce structurally deteriorating premature IVD degeneration that mimics the symptoms of accelerated IVD degeneration in humans. APOE-knockout rabbits could be used as beneficial model, as they can bypass the standard surgical interventions that are commonly applied in research animals for the induction of enhanced IVD degeneration. Their parallel use in therapeutic approaches of IVD disorders and atherosclerosis could reduce the number of research animals to be used and contribute to the principles of 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Back pain is a prevalent disorder that affects the majority of adults at some time in their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref001">1</xref>]. Chronic back pain has been described as part of the global burden of disease that causes immense activity limitations on individuals, which has a huge socio-economic impact in health care and disability compensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref003">3</xref>]. Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, which accelerates the loss of disc structural and functional integrities, is recognized as one of the major factors of chronic back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref005">5</xref>]. IVD degeneration is characterized by structural failures that are often accompanied by inflammatory and patho-immunological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref009">9</xref>]. Current treatment modalities are mainly conservative or surgical, and in many cases the therapies are considered insufficient for biological regeneration. In the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration both genetic and environmental factors have been described to play important roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref010">10</xref>]. Among other factors, cardiovascular risk factors such as high levels of serum lipids, low levels of apolipoproteins, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and smoking have been considered to promote the progress of lumbar disc degeneration, herniation and radicular pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref012">12</xref>]. High levels of cholesterol and triglycerides are considered critical for the development of atherosclerosis; and atherosclerosis of the lumbar arteries is presumed to promote lumbar disc degeneration and low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref016">16</xref>]. In a long-term follow-up study involving 4886 office-based civil servants (35–55 years of age), who suffered from back pain, low levels of Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) and high levels of triglycerides were detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref013">13</xref>]. Moreover, in three distinct long-term follow-up studies involving patients with low back pain high levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is an important apolipoprotein of chylomicrons (the ultra-low density lipoprotein, ULDL), VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and LDL. It serves as a ligand for their receptors and is vital for the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) as well as for the transport of cholesterol and other lipids in the blood stream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref017">17</xref>]. Deficiency of APOE or mutation in APOE that inactivates its binding capacity to lipoprotein receptors can cause type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref021">21</xref>]. Type III HLP causes elevated levels of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, due to impaired clearance of chylomicrons, VLDL and LDL remnants, which can promote premature development of atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref023">23</xref>]. Moreover, high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides formatting atherosclerotic plaques have been shown to obstruct the abdominal aorta and its lumbar branching arteries that supply the lumbar vertebrae and IVDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref028">28</xref>]. Formation of atherosclerosis starts at an early adult age and its rapid growth in the abdominal aorta occurs between 44 and 64 years of age, which is coinciding with the emerging and advancing processes of IVD degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Because of their susceptibility to develop atherosclerosis as well as their similarity in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular physiology to that of humans, rabbits have become an increasingly interesting animal model for the study of lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref035">35</xref>]. Recently, using genome editing techniques, APOE-knockout rabbits have been created as a novel rabbit model for the study of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref037">37</xref>]. Compared to wild-type rabbits they showed highly elevated cholesterol and increased triglyceride levels that mimic the symptoms in human cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref036">36</xref>]. Moreover, they showed elevated remnant lipoproteins as well as greater susceptibility to hyperlipidemia with remarkably increased levels of cholesterol and more excessive aortic atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref037">37</xref>]. However, the effect of APOE-knockout on rabbits IVD degeneration has not yet been investigated. Therefore, we determined to examine and compare the intensity of IVD degeneration in the lumbar spines of ten APOE-knockout and four wild-type New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits of matching age. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, quantitative analysis of IVD matrix proteins, assays of glucose concentration and viable disc cell numbers were performed, in order to analyse and evaluate the extent of lumbar disc degeneration in each rabbit. Due to the evidence of more advanced IVD degeneration with obstructed lumbar arteries, reduced cell viability and altered matrix protein composition that mimic the symptoms of enhanced IVD degeneration in humans, APOE-knockout rabbits could serve as a valuable animal model for <italic>in vivo</italic> therapeutic approaches of degenerative IVD disorders. Moreover, APOE-knockout rabbits could circumvent the standard surgical interventions that are frequently applied in research animal models for the induction of enhanced IVD degeneration. In addition, they could be used concurrently for therapeutic researches of IVD disorders and atherosclerosis.</p>

<title>Animals and ethical statement</title>
<p>The Central Laboratory Animal Facility of Medical University Innsbruck and all experimental procedures of the study were complied with the Austrian Animal Experimental Act (BGBI. I Nr. 114/2012). The approvals of the Animal Facility (BMWFW-66.011/0017-II/3b/2014) and the experimental procedures were obtained from the National Committee for Animal Care of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy. This study is specifically approved by the local research ethics committee (Animal Welfare Body of Medical University of Innsbruck: project 11–2015). APOE-knockout rabbits were recently created [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref036">36</xref>] and homozygous APOE-knockout mutants were made available to us. Starting with homozygous APOE-knockout mutants, they were bred by the Central Laboratory Animal Facility of Medical University Innsbruck. Ten APOE-knockout rabbits (5 male, 5 female; mean age 2.0 ± 0.3 years; mean weight 4.5 ± 0.6 kg) and four wild-type NZW rabbits (2 male, 2 female; mean age 2.0 ± 0.1 years; mean weight 4.1 ± 0.4 kg) were used for the study. Each rabbit was single housed in a flat deck cage (5400 cm<sup>2</sup>, Scanbur, Denmark) with an elevated platform. Housing conditions were maintained at 18°C, 50% relative humidity and 12/12 h light/dark cycle. Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) quality of the animals was monitored and confirmed according to FELASA recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref038">38</xref>]. Commercial standard diet (K-H/V223X, Ssniff<sup>®</sup>, Germany) was fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> and fresh tap water was constantly available. Regular health monitoring and an additional health check proir to anesthesia was performed by the responsible veterinarian.</p>

<title>MRI analyses of rabbit lumbar spines</title>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to determine the degeneration grades of the lumbar IVDs and measure the rate of contrast agent enhancement within the discs. Ahead of MRI each rabbit was sedated by intramuscular injection of ketamine (35 mg/kg body weight, Ketasol<sup>®</sup>, aniMEDICA GmbH, Germany) and xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight, Xylasol<sup>®,</sup> aniMEDICA GmbH, Germany). Additionally, a 22-gauge intravenous catheter was placed into a marginal ear vein and a constant infusion of ketamine (130 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg) in 0.9% saline of 100 ml mini-bag (B. Braun GmbH, Germany) was administered at a rate of 0.15 ml/min, which provided sufficient anesthesia for up to 2.5 h. There was a constant video monitoring of the anesthetized animal during MRI analysis. MRI of the lumbar spine was performed using a 3T whole-body MRI scanner (Magnetom Verio, Siemens Healthcare). The rabbit was positioned prone on a 24 channel spine array coil and covered with a flexible 8-channel body array coil. All images were acquired in sagittal orientation. T2-weighted (T2w) images were obtained with a fast-spin-echo (FSE) sequence (T2-FSE) (TR/TE = 3000ms/53ms, echo train length: 12, acquisition matrix: 320x236, rectangular FOV: 140mm x 103mm, number of slices: 13, slice thickness: 2mm, interslice gap: 0.2mm, number of averages: 4, voxel size: 0.44mm x 0.44mm x 2mm). For the quantification of T2 relaxation times a multi-echo spin-echo sequence (TR = 1500ms, number of echoes: 16, first TE = 13.5ms, TE increment: 13.5ms, acquisition matrix: 256 x 163, rectangular FOV: 140mm x 111mm, number of slices: 6, slice thickness: 3mm, interslice gap: 3mm, number of averages: 1, voxel size: 0.7mm x 0.5mm x 3mm) was used. For T1-mapping the dual flip angle method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref039">39</xref>] based on a fast 3D gradient echo sequence (TR/TE = 5.17ms/2.24ms, flip angle 1 = 2°, flip angle 2:14°, acquisition matrix: 256 x 184, rectangular FOV: 160mm x 160mm, number of slices: 20, slice thickness: 3.6mm, interslice gap: 0mm, number of averages: 2, voxel size: 0.9mm x 0.6mm x 3.6mm) was applied. T2- and T1-maps were calculated automatically by the MRI scanner immediately after image acquisition. For dynamic contrast enhanced imaging of the lumbar spine a high resolution T1-weighted (T1w) 3D gradient echo sequence (3G GE) (TR/TE = 8.8ms/3.0ms, flip angle = 15°, acquisition matrix: 256 x 208, rectangular FOV: 140mm x 114mm, number of slices: 64, slice thickness: 0.5mm, interslice gap: 0mm, number of averages: 3, voxel size: 0.5mm x 0.5mm x 0.5mm) was applied. Prior to injection of the contrast agent Gadobutrol (Gadovist, Bayer Vital, Germany) a set of pre contrast images was obtained with the T1w 3D GE and the T1w FSE sequence. Then Gadobutrol was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.3 mmol/kg body weight and the acquisition of the T1w images was repeated every 10 minutes for at least 120 minutes. After image acquisition the recorded images were transferred to an offline workstation. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) together with custom written plugins. The Pfirrmann MRI scoring system was used for grading of lumbar disc degeneration on T2w images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref040">40</xref>]. For the analysis of the dynamic contrast agent enhancement, regions of interests (ROI) were manually outlined on the midline sections of the lumbar discs (L1/L2-L6/S1). Signal intensities were measured and recorded for every time point by averaging over the respective ROI. Contrast agent enhancements were calculated as changes in signal intensities from baseline divided by the baseline signal intensity. Relative signal changes were plotted as a function of time.</p>

<title>Recruitment of intervertebral disc tissues</title>
<p>After completing the MRI scan rabbits were deeply anesthetized by increasing the flow rate of the drip to 0.5 ml/min. Afterwards animals were euthanized by intracardiac administration of concentrated potassium chloride and lumbar discs were immediately harvested. Nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue was carefully separated from anulus fibrosus (AF) tissue on the basis of their macroscopic morphology (identification of the innermost lamellar ring of the AF). To avoid contamination of the NP and AF samples great care was taken to exclude surrounding tissues and blood. NP and AF tissues of each rabbit (L1/L2-L6/S1) were separately pooled and finely minced into small fragments of approximately 2 mm<sup>3</sup>. Fractions of NP and AF tissues from each rabbit were used for different experiments.</p>

<title>More advanced grade of degeneration and lower enhancement of Gadobutrol in lumbar IVDs of APOE-knockout rabbits</title>
<p>The T2-weighted MRI signal characteristics of the lumbar IVDs revealed accelerated disc degeneration in APOE-knockout rabbits as compared to that in the wild-type rabbits. The interobserver reliability agreement for the rating of IVD degeneration with two observers was performed as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref041">41</xref>] and the calculated frequency of disagreements were 0.00% with a reliability coefficient κ = 1.00. Consistent score of disc degeneration grade IV (DDG IV) in APOE-knockout rabbits and DDG II in wild-type rabbits were ascertained. Representative images from two years old wild-type and APOE-knockout rabbits show the respective DDG II and DDG IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The T1-weighted MRI was used to measure the rate of solute enrichment in the lumbar IVDs. Representative images show a series of T1-weighted scans of lumbar discs that illustrate the gradual enhancement of the low molecular weight Gadobutrol after its intravenous administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The relative signal intensity to a given time point (0 to 120 min) was calculated as a change in signal intensity from baseline divided by the baseline signal intensity. The calculated relative signal intensities were plotted as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Slower rate of Gadobutrol enhancement was verified in lumbar discs of APOE-knockout rabbits and in addition to that no clearance of Gadobutrol was observed during the 120-minute period. The wild-type discs appeared to start with clearance of the contrast agent after 60 minutes, while the APOE-knockout discs were still taking it up.</p>

<title>Decreased glucose concentration in IVD tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits</title>
<p>APOE-knockout induced obstruction of Gadobutrol transport to the lumbar IVDs could also obstruct the nutrient transport, such as glucose. Low concentration of glucose as energy source could badly affect the cellular environment within the discs. Using glucose-oxidase assays the glucose concentration in APOE-knockout and wild-type rabbits were detected. The concentration of glucose was measured in serums [μmol/ml] as well as in NP and AF tissues [nmol/mg] of the rabbits. The recorded mean glucose concentration in serum samples of APOE-knockout rabbits [8.21 ± 0.365 μmol/ml] was 15.3% higher than that of the wild-type rabbits [7.12 ± 0.424 μmol/ml] (p &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187564.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

The calculated mean aggrecan concentration levels in NP and AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits amounted to 422 ± 10.7 ng/μg and 25.8 ± 1.43 ng/μg respectively. Compared with the respective mean concentration levels (594 ± 11 ng/μg and 35.1 ± 1.4 ng/μg) in NP and AF tissues of wild-type rabbits, the levels of aggrecan in NP and AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits were reduced by 28.9% and 26.4% respectively (p &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187564.t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Similarly, comparing the mean levels of collagen II (106 ± 3 ng/μg and 160 ± 8.07 ng/μg) in NP and AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits with the mean levels (148 ± 6.02 ng/μg and 250 ± 2.34 ng/μg) in NP and AF tissues of wild-type rabbits, the levels of collagen II in NP and AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits were reduced by 28.3% and 36% respectively (p &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Although the minimum detectable dose of collagen I in the detection system was very low [0.002 ng/μg], collagen I was not detected in NP tissues of both APOE-knockout and wild-type rabbits. However, high concentrations of collagen I were confirmed in AF tissues of APOE-knockout and wild-type rabbits. Related to the mean concentration level of collagen I in AF tissues of wild-type rabbits (543 ± 9.79 ng/μg), its mean concentration level in AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits (647 ± 14.9 ng/μg) was increased by 19.1% (p &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Changed levels of protein concentration in NP and AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits.</title>
<p>The concentration levels of aggrecan, collagen II and collagen I were determined in total protein [ng/μg] that was extracted from NP and AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits (KO-NP and KO-AF) and wild-type rabbits (WT-NP and WT-AF). Decreased concentration levels of aggrecan and collagen II were detected in KO-NP and KO-AF as compared with that in WT-NP and WT-AF; whereas increased level of collagen I was detected in KO-AF as compared with that in WT-AF (p &lt; 0.0001). Collagen I was not detected in both KO-NP and WT-NP. Box plots with whiskers min. to max. show concentrations of aggrecan (Fig 5a), collagen II (Fig 5b) and collagen I (Fig 5c). Three independent ELISA were performed in duplicate for each sample and significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Expression of APOE in intervertebral discs</title>
<p>Previously, the expression of APOE mRNA in several lipoprotein- and non-lipoprotein-producing tissues, such as liver, intestine, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland and brain, were demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref042">42</xref>]. We examined here the expression of APOE in IVD cells of wild-type and APOE-knockout rabbits at mRNA and protein levels by using RT-qPCR and western blot. APOE was detected in the AF cells of wild-type rabbits. The mRNA and protein expression levels were similar in AF cells of all tested wild-type rabbits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). NP cells of wild-type rabbits did not show any expression of APOE. As expected APOE expression was not detected in any of the APOE-knockout rabbits.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Intervertebral disc degeneration affecting the majority of adults is one of the most common causes of chronic back pain with disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref010">10</xref>]. Degenerative changes in IVD emerge as early as the second decade of life, but its exact onset and pace have not been clearly elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref045">45</xref>]. Alongside other causes of IVD degeneration cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerosis have received growing attention as one of the plausible causal factors of IVD degeneration. Associations between multiple cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerosis have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref016">16</xref>]. Moreover, cardiovascular risk factors such as high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, which prompt atherosclerosis, have been presumed to be involved in the obstruction of the abdominal aorta and its lumbar branching arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref029">29</xref>]. Nutrient supply to the lumbar vertebrae and their IVDs takes place through the paired lumbar arteries or the middle sacral artery that originate in the abdominal aorta or aortic bifurcation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref029">29</xref>]. Formations of excessive fatty streaks and fibrous plaques in the bifurcation and around the orifices of the lumbar branching arteries have been previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref025">25</xref>]. Similar to the process of IVD degeneration, atherosclerosis begins to appear early in adult age and its speedy escalation in the abdominal aorta occurs between 44 and 64 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref030">30</xref>]. Atherosclerosis mediated barricade of nutrient supply to IVDs could change the cellular and metabolic environment within the discs. This could promote accelerated IVD degeneration that could be accompanied with premature chronic low back pain. It has been recently shown that APOE-knockout rabbits, mimicking the symptoms of atherosclerosis in humans, have great susceptibility to type III hyperlipoproteinemia with remarkably elevated levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, remnant lipoproteins and massive aortic atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref037">37</xref>]. Since the impact of APOE-knockout on rabbits IVD degeneration has not yet been investigated, we determined to examine and compare disc degeneration in APOE-knockout and wild-type rabbits of matching age.</p>
<p>T2-weighted MRI analysis of the lumbar spines in APOE-knockout rabbits exhibited more advanced disc degeneration grade (DDG IV) as compared with the disc degeneration grade (DDG II) of the wild-type rabbits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). After intravenous injection of the low molecular weight contrast agent Gadobutrol, a series of T1-weighted MRI scans revealed slower enhancement and clearance of Gadobutrol in the IVDs of APOE-knockout rabbits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The slowed enhancement of Gadobutrol could indicate an adversely affected nutrient supply to the IVDs of APOE-knockout rabbits and this obstruction could change the cellular environment within the discs of the APOE-knockout rabbits.</p>
<p>Obstructing the supply of glucose as an energy source could critically affect cell survival and anabolism of extracellular matrix proteins within the discs. Analysis of glucose concentration in IVD tissues of APOE-knockout and wild-type rabbits revealed lower glucose concentration in NP and AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits, although higher glucose concentration was detected in their serum samples. Their mean glucose concentrations were reduced by 48.2% in NP tissues and by 33.5% in AF tissues. Comparing the glucose concentrations of AF tissues with NP tissues in the same rabbit group, averagely 54.0% lower glucose concentration was verified in NP tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits and 36.4% lower glucose concentration in NP tissues of wild-type rabbits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187564.t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The pronounced reduction of glucose concentration in NP tissues could be due to the fact that the glucose supply to NP tissues might be additionally repressed by calcification of the endplate, since nutrient supply to the avascular NP occurs only by diffusion through the endplate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>The number of viable cells and the concentration of extracellular matrix proteins were analysed in IVD tissues of APOE-knockout and wild-type rabbits, as the levels of glucose concentrations could be critical for survival and anabolic activities of IVD cells. Diminished numbers of viable cells were detected in NP and AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits. It was reduced by 39.1% in NP tissues and by 28.8% in AF tissues. In NP tissues of both wild-type and APOE-knockout rabbits reduced numbers of viable cells were detected compared to that in AF tissues of the respective rabbits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The reduced number of viable NP cells could be resulted from the repressed supply of glucose through the endplate, which is the central route of solute exchange between the avascular NP tissue and the surrounding blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref050">50</xref>]. In a previous study, at least two times less diffusion has been presented in the endplate route than in the perianular route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref051">51</xref>]. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> results, which show a tight correlation between the levels of glucose and the number of viable cells, support the results of the previous <italic>in vitro</italic> study, which exhibited the critical effect of glucose deprivation on the maintenance of IVD cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref052">52</xref>]. However, an <italic>in vivo</italic> reduction in glucose concentration could occur combined with reductions in oxygen concentration and pH-value, which could apparently worsen the cellular physiology within the discs.</p>
<p>As anabolism of extracellular matrix proteins within IVDs could be affected by the reduction of glucose concentration and disc cell survival, the concentration levels of the main matrix proteins were analyzed in NP and AF tissues of APOE-knockout and wild-type rabbits. Decreased concentration levels of the core matrix proteins aggrecan and collagen II were detected in NP and AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits. The mean levels of aggrecan were reduced by 28.9% in NP tissues and by 26.4% in AF tissues. Similarly, the mean levels of collagen II were reduced by 28.3% and 36% respectively. Conversely, the mean level of collagen I was increased by 19.1% in AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187564.t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187564.g005">Fig 5</xref>). These altered concentration levels of the major matrix proteins in NP and AF tissues of APOE-knockout rabbits exhibit the characteristic features of structural and functional deterioration of IVDs, which underline the fundamental problem of disc degeneration.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, lumbar IVDs of APOE-knockout rabbits exhibited accelerated degeneration, lower enhancement of Gadobutrol, decreased concentration of glucose, diminished number of viable cells along with altered concentration levels the major matrix proteins aggrecan, collagen II and collagen I. IVD degeneration induced by APOE-knockout in rabbits could be characterized by structural deterioration that mimics the symptoms of advanced grade disc degeneration in humans. Thus, APOE-knockout rabbits could be used as valuable model for <italic>in vivo</italic> therapeutic approaches in degenerative IVD disorders. Moreover, they can bypass the standard surgical interventions, which are frequently applied in research animal for the induction of enhanced disc degeneration. Also, their parallel use in therapeutic approaches of IVD disorders together with atherosclerosis could contribute to the three principles of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement (3Rs) in animal research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref053">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0187564.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
