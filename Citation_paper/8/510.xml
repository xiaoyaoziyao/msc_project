<abstract>
<p>The Turing instability was proposed more than six decades ago as a mechanism leading to spatial patterning, but it has yet to be exploited in a synthetic biology setting. Here we characterize the Turing instability in a specific gene circuit that can be implemented <italic>in vitro</italic> or in populations of clonal cells producing short-range activator N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) and long-range inhibitor hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) gas. Slowing the production rate of the AHL-degrading enzyme, AiiA, generates stable fixed states, limit cycle oscillations and Turing patterns. Further tuning of signaling parameters determines local robustness and controls the range of unstable wavenumbers in the patterning regime. These findings provide a roadmap for optimizing spatial patterns of gene expression based on familiar quorum and gas sensitive <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters. The circuit design and predictions may be useful for (re)programming spatial dynamics in synthetic and natural gene expression systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Self-organization and self-assembly govern the emergent properties of spatial structures from the molecular to the galactic scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref002">2</xref>]. In the nano-to-millimeter range chemical processes coordinate gene expression essential to the spatial organization of biological systems, including populations of microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref006">6</xref>] and developing tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>One mechanism by which ensembles of cells could self-organize is the Turing instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref013">13</xref>] that occurs due to interplay of short-range activation and long-range inhibition. This instability then drives the formation of spatially periodic patterns. The Turing instability has been implicated in morphogenetic processes of amoebae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref014">14</xref>], plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref016">16</xref>], and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref020">20</xref>]. The large number of unknown factors often makes it challenging to elucidate the essential determinants of morphogenesis in biological systems, but the instability has also been directly engineered in low-component chemical reactions (malonic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref021">21</xref>] and platinum surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref022">22</xref>]).</p>
<p>Despite the ubiquity of Turing patterns at the multi-cellular scale, they have yet to be demonstrated in gene expression sytems. This is surprising given the many alternative pattern forming mechanisms found in natural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref006">6</xref>] and engineered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref027">27</xref>] colonies of cells. For example, researchers have created gene circuits to produce stationary ring patterns in growing colonies of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref028">28</xref>]. However, these stationary patterns required colony expansion and very particular initial conditions to form. Hsia <italic>e</italic>t al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref029">29</xref>] have presented a theoretical model of a quenched oscillator circuit with one diffusible element that produces a Turing-like instability. There however, the temporal dynamics never settled to a stable fixed state due to persistent temporal oscillations. Another group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref030">30</xref>] has recently developed a model of Turing pattern circuit using single promoter. However, even with common promoters, the activator and inhibitor genes would result in different production rate functions, especially if the compounds are to have largely differing diffusion rates. The lack of convincing examples raises the question of whether Turing patters can really be produced by genetic circuits.</p>
<p>If it is possible, then Turing patterning of gene expression could be quite useful for basic science and biotechnology applications. These include self-organized spatial sequestration of gene expression and downstream metabolites (as is currently done inside cells to improve yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref031">31</xref>]), spatially-patterned delivery of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref032">32</xref>], reprogrammed morphogenesis of cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref033">33</xref>], filtering of paracrine inputs from adjacent cells in populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref034">34</xref>], and chemical sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref027">27</xref>]. Biosensing applications are particularly promising inasmuch as the Turing instability is inherently capable of amplifying small differences in initial conditions.</p>
<p>Motivated by this, we propose a realistic synthetic gene circuit that implements repressor-activated degradation using activating homoserine lactone and inhibitory peroxide gas, and demonstrate how this system can be switched between stable uniform states, limit cycles, and Turing patterns. We characterize the effects of experimentally relevant parameter changes on the presence and properties of the expected Turing patterns. We conclude by discussing our plans to experimentally implement the circuit and to refine the mathematical model that describes it.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The fixed points, eigenvalues and unstable wavenumbers of the differential equations were computed using the symbolic and variable-precision solvers in Matlab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref035">35</xref>]. Bifurcation analysis was performed using the Matcont continuation package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref036">36</xref>], and analysis of the Turing instability was performed as stated in the text, with a custom Matlab script. Spatio-temporal simulations were performed using custom Fortran code [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref037">37</xref>] using forward Euler with five point discretized Laplacian. Convergence of solutions was validated by simulating successively smaller spatial and temporal step sizes. For most cases we also tested both periodic and no-flux boundary conditions and used dx = 11.5 <italic>μ</italic>m and dt = 10<sup>−5</sup> min.

<title>Turing pattern gene circuit with homoserine lactone and hydrogen peroxide gas</title>
<p>Based on our experience with using quorum-sensing signaling in synthetic circuit design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref027">27</xref>], we decided to use acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) as the short-range activator signal and hydrogen peroxide gas (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) as the long-range inhibitor signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The choice to focus on a pure activator-inhibitor system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref038">38</xref>] (where the activator self-activates and inhibitor self-inhibits) was based on the fact that the AHL quorum sensing system has a native positive feedback, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> does not. Several of the circuit components presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g001">Fig 1</xref> have already been used to construct gene circuits that produced sustained temporal oscillations of fluorescent proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref027">27</xref>]. The synthase LuxI produces AHL, and the Ndh protein generates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. AHL binds with LuxR and activates the p<sub><italic>lux</italic></sub>-like promoters (p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The <italic>luxR</italic> promoter (p<sub>3</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g001">Fig 1</xref>) is constitutive (unregulated). Controlled degradation of AHL is mediated by the AHL-lactonase, AiiA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref039">39</xref>]. The <italic>aiiA</italic> gene can be activated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by putting it under the control of a promoter (p<sub>4</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g001">Fig 1</xref>) such as: p<sub><italic>topA</italic></sub>, which responds to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> via the Fis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref040">40</xref>], or a synthetic promoter containing the ArcAB binding site of p<sub><italic>lux</italic></sub>, which relieves inhibition by transcription factors ArcAB in the presence of the peroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref041">41</xref>]).</p>

<p>Overall, the results indicate that slowing AiiA feedback on AHL degradation can lead to limit cycle oscillations before the onset of Turing patterns. This is consistent with previous studies showing that an increased time delay in a negative feedback signal produces limit cycle oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref047">47</xref>]. It is interesting to note that for the cases shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g002">Fig 2</xref>, the fixed point is already unstable at <italic>k</italic> = 0 (a limit cycle) when undergoing the transition to the Turing instability. This means that the classic notion of Turing patterns arising from a stable fixed point can be extended to include some cases with an unstable point inside a limit cycle.</p>

<title>Controlling Range of Unstable Wavenumbers and Patterning Robustness</title>
<p>We next investigate how additional parameters can be used to experimentally tune spatial patterning in the circuit. In contrast to the single promoter circuit model that was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref030">30</xref>], increasing the cooperativity of transcriptional activation in our model does not appear to increase the parameter space leading to Turing patterns, since an increased rate of activation is not automatically balanced by an increased rate of repression. This however is not a major concern since increasing cooperativity would be challenging to implement in experiments.</p>
<p>A more experimentally tuneable parameter is <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>, affecting the maximal rate of LuxI expression, and experimentally controlled by a regulatable hybrid promoter, plasmid copy number, or the strength of the promoter or ribosome binding site. Covarying this parameter with the AiiA production rate creates basins for stable, Hopf unstable and Turing unstable solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g004">Fig 4a</xref>). For <italic>α</italic><sub>3</sub>&lt;0.16 min.<sup>−1</sup> there is no <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub> that gives rise to Turing patterning. For the parameter space investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g004">Fig 4a</xref>) as <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub> is increased, the range of <italic>α</italic><sub>3</sub> leading to Turing patterning (<italic>α</italic><sub>3</sub>-robustness) also increases. Raising <italic>α</italic><sub>3</sub> also tends to increase <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>-robustness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g004">Fig 4a and 4b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g004">Fig 4b</xref> demonstrates that raising the AiiA production rate expands the range of wavenumbers corresponding to the Turing instability, <italic>Re</italic>(λ(<italic>k</italic>)) &gt; 0 towards higher wavenumbers (shorter wavelengths). Thus, tuning the maximal AiiA production rate to achieve more <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>-robust Turing patterning also results in shorter spatial periods in the resultant pattern.</p>

Both codimension two bifurcation plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g004">Fig 4a and 4c</xref>) show that the Turing regime can be adjacent in parameter space to a regime of limit cycle dynamics (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g002">Fig 2</xref>), but this is not always the case (for example, decreasing <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub> when 0.5 &lt; <italic>α</italic><sub>3</sub> &lt; 3.2, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g004">Fig 4a</xref>).</p>
<p>Together these results show that Turing patterning with this circuit requires an AHL production rate high enough to prevent a stable focus or limit cycle, but not so high as to lose the fixed point through a saddle node bifurcation. Furthermore, it appears that the AiiA production rate is the highest-priority parameter to adjust in order to achieve Turing patterning that is robust to variations in the other experimental parameters. Once inside the Turing unstable regime, both LuxI production rate and the amount of LuxR can be used to tune the range of spatial periods in the solution.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we have demonstrated the possibility of generating Turing patterns using a long-range gas signal that induces degradation of a short-range quorum sensing molecules. The next important step is to experimentally implement this proposed circuit in and test the predictions made by the model. The gene circuit has features in common with previous designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref027">27</xref>], but there are some important differences. The Aiia promoter would likely need to be redesigned to be activated by exclusively by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> instead of LuxR-AHL. Besides the use of <italic>ndh</italic>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation could also be increased by addition of a <italic>lux</italic>-induced <italic>sodA</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref027">27</xref>]. For the <italic>lux</italic>-like promoters (p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>3</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g001">Fig 1</xref>), the model shows that they should be distinct from each other, with leak and maximal production from p<sub>1</sub> being higher than those from p<sub>3</sub> (compare <italic>δ</italic><sub>1,2</sub>’s and <italic>α</italic><sub>1,2</sub>’s in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153679.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Alternatively, this could be achieved by putting ribosome binding sites on <italic>luxI</italic> that are stronger than those on <italic>ndh</italic>. It may also be necessary to remove the ArcAB sites on these promoters to eliminate crosstalk with the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> part of the circuit, but preliminary analysis shows that crosstalk as high as 20% can still lead to patterning (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153679.s004">S1 Equations</xref>) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153679.s005">S3 Fig</xref>. One could also consider using alternative quorum sensing systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref048">48</xref>] and volatile signaling molecules such as nitric oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref049">49</xref>], ammonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref050">50</xref>], hydrogen sulfide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref051">51</xref>], or ethylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Pattern formation speed is relevant to producing spatial structures in time scales allowed by experiments. This speed is reflected by the magnitude of <italic>Re</italic>(λ) &gt; 0, that determines how fast unstable solutions diverge from the fixed point. Although the high dimensionality of our model makes it challenging to derive analytical expressions for the pattern formation speed (as was done in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref053">53</xref>] for two-dimensional models), computing dispersion relations for different parameters demonstrates that pattern formation speed around the nominal parameter set is inversely related to <italic>α</italic><sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g002">Fig 2b</xref>), but proportional to <italic>D</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153679.s002">S1 Fig</xref>), <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153679.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Although pattern formation speed will typically be very slow near the transition to Turing instability, our simulations within the Turing parameter space demonstrate formation of patterns within two hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g003">Fig 3c and 3d</xref>), making the system quite accessible to experimental observation.</p>
<p>Bacteria engineered with this gene circuit could be tested on agar plates or inside microfluidic chambers, both of which are amenable to spatiotemporal data collection with an epifluorescence microscope. In one spatial dimension, one could use microfluidic devices like the long trap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref026">26</xref>], or an annular trap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref054">54</xref>] to study periodic boundary conditions. Agar could be patterned into one-dimensional spatial structures, but these are likely to exhaust nutrients or lose moisture too quickly. Spatial patterns in two dimensions are easier to generate on agar plates (as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref024">24</xref>]), because use of microfluidics would likely be complicated by diffusional anisotropies resulting from constant perfusion of liquid media through the channels. If this were not a challenge then one could exploit the gas-permeability of polydimethylsiloxane (commonly used to fabricate microfluidic devices) to allow for selective diffusion of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref027">27</xref>]), or sequester the gas using vacuum channel in the microfluidic device (another use for the vacuum channel that was originally built for shear-free loading of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref055">55</xref>]).</p>
<p>Another potential challenge to implementing these results experimentally arises from the assumptions made about diffusion. First, transport through and between the cells is only approximated by the diffusion equation. Limited membrane permeability and cell crowding can slow transport of signaling molecules, resulting in a smaller effective diffusion coefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref056">56</xref>]. The effective diffusion coefficients of AHL and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> have not been measured directly for bacterial monolayers in microfluidic devices. However, Danino and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref026">26</xref>] measured conduction velocity of AHL-mediated activation to be <italic>V</italic> = 8.5-35 <inline-formula id="pone.0153679.e010"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0153679.e010g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0153679.e010" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M10"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi> <mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow> <mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi> <mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, which combined with the model prediction of <italic>V</italic> = 0.17 <inline-formula id="pone.0153679.e011"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0153679.e011g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0153679.e011" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M11"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi> <mml:mi>L</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, results in <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> = 2.5-42 × 10<sup>3</sup> <inline-formula id="pone.0153679.e012"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0153679.e012g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0153679.e012" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M12"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi> <mml:msup><mml:mi>m</mml:mi> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow> <mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi> <mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>.

In addition, decreasing <italic>D</italic> as much as fourfold from <italic>D</italic> = 100 can still allow for patterning to occur (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153679.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). If required, further disparity between gas and lactone diffusion could be attained by using crowding agents like polyethylene glycol, or engineering circuits with slower diffusing quorum sensing molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref048">48</xref>].</p>
<p>The mathematical model presented could be further investigated by incorporating several additional layers of detail. This includes a more biophysical description of AHL production (LuxI catalyzes the conversion of SAM to AHL), as well as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production (NDH-2 catalyzes formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and regulation of the <italic>aiiA</italic> promoter (for example, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidizes ArcA to relieve repression of <italic>lux</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref027">27</xref>]). All of these processes have been lumped together (represented by dashed arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g001">Fig 1</xref>) in the current model, but may turn out to have a non-negligible effect on dynamics. Our model also lumps the processes transcription, translation and protein maturation. Thus it would also be interesting to include these processes and also compare this system to one reduced to a spatially-extended delay differential equation. Previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref058">58</xref>] suggested that delays can predispose that system to oscillatory patterning, which is consistent with what we found upon the inclusion of slower AiiA dynamics (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g002">2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153679.g004">4a</xref>). Another feature that the current model ignores is the effect of protein dilution due to cell growth. While this may hinder implementation in exponentially growing cells, there is also work suggesting that an expanding domain can help make the Turing patterning regime more robust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref057">57</xref>]. Furthermore, the dilution problem can be fundamentally resolved by engineering the chemical reactions in an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription-translation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
<p>Considering that protein numbers are low at the steady states analyzed (the nanomolar range corresponds to tens of molecules per <italic>E. coli</italic>), it would be prudent to further examine this system using stochastic simulations. Hsia and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref029">29</xref>] found that such stochastic effects changed the patterning parameter parameter space, but did not destroy the ability to produce Turing patterning. Although external fluctuations tend to destabilize the Turing parameter regime in a continuum setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref057">57</xref>], it has also been shown that when space is discrete, either intrinsic or extrinsic noise can cause patterning over larger parameter ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153679.ref061">61</xref>]. Testing these additional considerations is a good direction for future modeling studies.</p>
<p>Despite these theoretical and experimental challenges in further studying the proposed circuit we believe it is well worth the effort, as these types of gas and quorum sensing circuits could be quite useful for studies of bacterial morphogenesis and several synthetic biology applications. The present work provides a conceptual foundation and guidance for the development of gas mediated spatial patterning in multi-cellular and cell-free gene expression systems.</p>
