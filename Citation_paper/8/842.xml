<p>Quorum sensing is a process of chemical communication that bacteria use to monitor cell density and coordinate cooperative behaviors. Quorum sensing relies on extracellular signal molecules and cognate receptor pairs. While a single quorum-sensing system is sufficient to probe cell density, bacteria frequently use multiple quorum-sensing systems to regulate the same cooperative behaviors. The potential benefits of these redundant network structures are not clear. Here, we combine modeling and experimental analyses of the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> quorum-sensing networks to show that accumulation of multiple quorum-sensing systems may be driven by a facultative cheating mechanism. We demonstrate that a strain that has acquired an additional quorum-sensing system can exploit its ancestor that possesses one fewer system, but nonetheless, resume full cooperation with its kin when it is fixed in the population. We identify the molecular network design criteria required for this advantage. Our results suggest that increased complexity in bacterial social signaling circuits can evolve without providing an adaptive advantage in a clonal population.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Quorum sensing is a mechanism through which bacteria communicate by producing, releasing, and detecting signal molecules encoding information about cell population density. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to synchronize their behaviors and act as collectives. Often, quorum sensing controls cooperative behaviors that benefit the entire community, such as the production and secretion of costly metabolites. Some bacteria release multiple signal molecules which, once detected, funnel information into the same cellular response. Thus, the benefit of using multiple rather than a single signal is mysterious since the signals seem redundant. Here, we combine modeling and experiments to show that the evolutionary accumulation of multiple quorum-sensing systems can be attributed to social exploitation and kin recognition. When in low abundance, a strain that has acquired an additional quorum-sensing system can avoid cooperating and can exploit its ancestor strain, which contains one less quorum-sensing system. The cheater containing the additional system returns to a cooperative behavior when it is abundant. We also identify the molecular mechanisms necessary for the acquisition of an additional signaling system. Our work demonstrates that increased complexity in bacterial social signaling circuits can evolve without providing an adaptive advantage in a clonal population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Quorum sensing is a mechanism of bacterial cell—cell communication that relies on the production, release, and group-wide detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. Quorum sensing enables populations of bacteria to coordinate changes in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Bacteria often use quorum sensing to orchestrate the release of public goods (e.g., enzymes or surfactants) whose functions benefit the entire community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref002">2</xref>], and to direct other cooperative behaviors such as transitions to more efficient modes of growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref003">3</xref>]. The cooperative nature of quorum sensing is susceptible to exploitation by mutant genotypes that do not contribute to cooperation but benefit from it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref006">6</xref>]. Despite their immediate advantage over the wild-type, exploiting “cheater” genotypes will be eliminated in structured populations due to their negative effect on the average fitness of the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref011">11</xref>]. In bacteria, population structure can naturally arise in biofilms, where bacteria can grow without significant mixing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref010">10</xref>], or during the formation of growth bottlenecks upon invasion into a new environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Many bacterial species employ multiple quorum-sensing systems that impinge on the activity of a shared transcriptional regulator. Each of the quorum-sensing systems encodes a specific receptor and autoinducer production gene with no or limited crosstalk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref015">15</xref>]. In several species such as <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref016">16</xref>], <italic>V</italic>. <italic>harveyi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref017">17</xref>], and its pathogenic relative, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref019">19</xref>], the quorum-sensing systems are arranged in a parallel, seemingly redundant, architecture. That is, all the quorum-sensing autoinducer receptors funnel information into the same signal transduction pathway.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the adaptive benefit is of harboring multiple, rather than a single, quorum-sensing autoinducer—receptor pair when the pairs function in parallel. Here, we combine modeling and experiments in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>harveyi</italic> to show that a strain that has accumulated an additional quorum-sensing system reduces its cooperative investment in the presence of its ancestor, but resumes full cooperation in a clonal population. We show that this facultative cheating strategy requires a specific system integration design criterion; the novel receptor must have a dominant repressive effect on the ancestral quorum-sensing response in the absence of the novel autoinducer. We show that, additionally, this particular network design often leads to synergistic activation of the quorum-sensing response by the different autoinducers.</p>

<title>Social Selection for an Additional Rap-Phr and against an Additional ComP-ComX Quorum-Sensing System in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic></title>
<p>We hypothesized that social interactions between different genotypes may contribute to the adaptive role of redundant quorum-sensing networks. This hypothesis can be approached by comparing the social behavior of a wild-type species possessing multiple quorum-sensing systems to the behavior of mutant strains harboring varying numbers of quorum-sensing systems. To explore this idea, we first examined the ComA-directed quorum-sensing network of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref022">22</xref>]. This network is composed of a single ComP-ComX system and multiple paralogous Rap-Phr systems, each encoding its own specific autoinducer. The ComP receptor phosphorylates ComA when ComP is bound to the ComX autoinducer, while Rap receptors repress ComA only when their corresponding Phr ligands are not bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). All the autoinducers therefore positively control ComA activity, but through different regulatory interactions.</p>

<title>Social selection for accumulation of redundant quorum-sensing systems in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>.</title>
<p>(A) The <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> quorum-sensing network controlling ComA is composed of four paralogous Rap receptors, each responding to a specific Phr autoinducer and a single ComP receptor activated by the autoinducer called ComX. Upon binding its cognate ligand, ComP activates ComA. By contrast, Rap receptors are inhibitors of ComA in their unliganged states. (B) Design of two strains carrying additional quorum-sensing systems—ExtraRap harboring the additional orthogonal RapP-PhrP system, and ExtraCom possessing the additional orthogonal ComP-ComX<sub>RO-H-1</sub> system. The ComP-ComX<sub>RO-H-1</sub> system inhibits quorum-sensing-controlled gene expression elicited by the endogenous ComP<sub>168</sub> receptor (red dashed line). (C) Cellular yield, measured by optical density (OD), of the various strains after 48 h of growth on swarm plates. (D) Fitness advantage over the wild-type as a function of the frequency of the competing strain, in a coculture with <italic>ΔcomA</italic> (gray), ExtraRap (red), ExtraCom (magenta), and as a control, wild-type against itself (brown). The cocultures were grown on swarm plates for 48 h. The fitness advantage is the ratio between the relative frequency of the competitor and the wild-type after swarming to that before swarming. Fitness is shown on a logarithmic scale. The data used to produce all figures are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s009">S2 Data File</xref>.</p>

<p>The Com and Rap systems also differ with respect to their population genetics patterns. The ComP-ComX system exhibits significant genetic variability within the population and different alleles form distinct orthogonal signaling pherotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref020">20</xref>]. These different pherotypes often display partial cross-inhibition, such that an autoinducer from one strain inhibits the response of another strain to its cognate autoinducer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref023">23</xref>]. Nonetheless, only a single ComP-ComX system is encoded in each <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> isolate. By contrast, all <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> strains encode multiple Rap-Phr systems. The exact number varies between strains, likely due to the association of some Rap-Phr systems with mobile elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>It was previously shown that deletion of any Rap-Phr system has only a small effect on ComA activity, while deletion of the <italic>phr</italic> genes or overexpression of the <italic>rap</italic> genes led to repression of quorum sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref025">25</xref>]. It is therefore unclear why so many quorum-sensing systems regulate ComA, and specifically, why Rap-Phr paralogs proliferate in the genome, while ComP-ComX is unique. To address this question, we constructed strains in which we added to the wild-type strain a novel ComP-ComX system (ExtraCom strain, <italic>comQXP</italic><sub><italic>RO-H-1</italic></sub><sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref020">20</xref>]) or we either added (ExtraRap strain, <italic>rapPphrP</italic><sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref026">26</xref>]) or we deleted (MinusRap strain, <italic>ΔrapFphrF</italic>) a Rap-Phr system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s008">S1 File</xref> for strain construction details). The autoinducing signals produced by the introduced ExtraRap and ExtraCom systems differed from those made by the paralogs present in the parent strain with no cross-activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We note, however, that the comX<sub>RO-H-1</sub> autoinducer cross-inhibits the endogenous ComP<sub>168</sub> receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>We examined the behavior of these strains under surface-swarming motility conditions, which strictly require the production and release of a ComA-dependent surfactant called surfactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">methods</xref> for details on swarm motility protocol). Unlike the Δ<italic>comA</italic> mutant, the above quorum-sensing variant strains exhibited robust swarming, reaching a similar cell yield as the wild-type after 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s001">S1A Fig</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 1×10<sup>−5</sup>, F(4,12) = 8.1, <italic>n</italic> = 16; two-way ANOVA for difference between genotypes when including <italic>ΔcomA</italic>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.26, F(3,9) = 8.1, <italic>n</italic> = 12 without <italic>ΔcomA</italic>). Altering the number of quorum-sensing systems therefore does not significantly affect the fitness of the bacteria in clonal populations.</p>
<p>Surfactin may function as a costly public good during swarming, allowing “cheater” strains to exploit the wild-type in coculture. In agreement with this possibility, we found that the <italic>ΔcomA</italic> mutant strain regained its ability to swarm when cocultured with the wild-type, and in so doing, dramatically increased its relative frequency in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s001">S1B Fig</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 10<sup>−4</sup>, two sample <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>n</italic> = 42, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">methods</xref> for details of the competition experiments and the wild-type competition against itself in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g001">Fig 1C</xref> that was carried out as a control). When we performed similar coculture experiments between the wild-type and the different quorum-sensing variants, we found that the strain carrying an additional Rap-Phr system was strongly selected for over a strain lacking it. In contrast, the ExtraCom strain was out-competed by the wild-type. Moreover, the fitness advantage of the ExtraRap strain over the wild-type was similar to that of the “cheater” <italic>ΔcomA</italic> mutant at low frequency (<italic>p</italic> = 0.21, t(4,32) = 0.8, linear regression comparison of the intercepts at zero frequency) and approached neutrality as its frequency increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.13, t(2,16) = 1.06, linear regression comparison of the intercepts at zero at a frequency of one). Similar results were obtained for wild-type exploitation of the MinusRap strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s001">S1C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the selection of the ExtraRap strain, the ExtraCom strain remained close to neutral with respect to the wild-type at low frequency, but its competitive disadvantage increased with increasing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 10<sup>−8</sup>, t(2,16) = 11, linear regression of slope). Our results are therefore in agreement with the observed population genetics data for the two systems—selection for genomic proliferation of Rap-Phr systems and against proliferation of the ComP-ComX system.</p>

<title>Mathematical Model Predicts That Facultative Cheating Underlies Social Selection</title>
<p>To gain further insight into our results, we mathematically modeled cellular growth and quorum-sensing signaling dynamics during swarming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In the model, we assume a simplified ancestral strain encoding a single ComP-ComX and a single Rap-Phr system. We explored the growth and social dynamics of this ancestor and its corresponding ExtraRap- and ExtraCom-derived strains during swarming (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s008">S1 File</xref> for description of the model and its assumptions). Strikingly, the model was able to capture qualitatively the experimental results we obtained above both in clonal and social conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>).

<p>The model also provides simple explanations for the frequency dependence of the ExtraRap system and the difference in selection for and against the ExtraRap and ExtraCom strains, respectively. When a derived “Extra” strain is at low frequency, the concentration of the novel autoinducer it produces is very low compared to those of the ancestral autoinducers, which are produced by all the members in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, left insets). In this scenario, the level of quorum-sensing response of the “Extra” strain depends on the activity of the unliganded form of the novel receptor. In the ExtraCom system, the novel ComP receptor is inactive in the absence of its cognate autoinducer. The ancestral network will therefore not be affected by the presence of the novel ComP system, which leads to equal quorum-sensing activation of the ancestral and ExtraCom strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>). In contrast, in the ExtraRap strain, the autoinducer-free novel Rap receptor represses ComA. Repression is dominant and overpowers activation of ComA by the shared ancestral quorum-sensing system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Activated ComA levels will therefore be lower in the ExtraRap strain than in the ancestral strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), leading to selection of the ExtraRap strain due to exploitation of the ancestral strain.</p>
<p>As the frequency of the derived “Extra” strain increases, so does the concentration of its corresponding novel autoinducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, right insets). In the case of the ExtraRap strain, accumulation of the novel autoinducer leads to partial de-repression of ComA to a level that approaches that of the ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), and this condition occurs as the ExtraRap strain approaches fixation. Therefore, the ExtraRap strain acts as a cheater at low frequency but returns to full cooperation when fixed in the population. In the case of the ExtraCom strain, accumulation of the novel autoinducer leads to a corresponding increase in its quorum-sensing response. In the specific experimental case we examined, the novel ComX system (ComX<sub>RO-H-1</sub>) in the ExtraCom strain cross-inhibits the ancestral ComP<sub>168</sub> receptor, leading to a strong reduction in ComA activity in the wild-type, ancestral strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The ancestral strain therefore acts as a cheater with respect to the ExtraCom strain. Our modeling framework also allows us to explore a theoretical case in which no cross-inhibition occurs. In this situation, the ancestral strain maintains a constant level of ComA activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The net selective effect, with or without autoinducer cross-inhibition, is against the ExtraCom system, although selection is stronger when autoinducer cross-inhibition occurs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref009">9</xref>]. Thus, while autoinducer cross-inhibition naturally exists in the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> system we are studying, this feature is not strictly required for selection against accumulation of a novel quorum-sensing system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Our model also predicts how the novel autoinducer will act with respect to the ancestral autoinducer in that the model provides us with information about what type of regulatory input—output gate is established. An additional ComP-ComX system leads to formation of an OR-like (additive) regulatory gate for the two ComX autoinducers with respect to their control of ComA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Thus, a single autoinducer is sufficient to elicit a strong quorum-sensing response. In contrast, the repressive activity of an additional Rap system leads to formation of an AND-like (multiplicative) gate between it and the ancestral Phr or ComX system. Thus, the simultaneous presence of both autoinducers is required to elicit a strong response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s004">S4A Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Experimental Verification of Facultative Cheating and Autoinducer Input-Output Gate Structures in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic></title>
<p>Our model predicts that the different architectures of the two quorum-sensing systems lead to differential investment in cooperative behavior by the ancestral and derived strains as well as to distinct regulatory input—output gate structures. These features result in the observed patterns of selection. To address these predictions experimentally, we introduced a YFP transcriptional reporter for ComA activity (P<sub><italic>srfA</italic></sub>-YFP) into the wild-type, the ExtraCom, and the MinusRap strains. We cocultured each reporter-containing strain with a reporter-free counterpart and measured gene expression as a function of frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). To minimize the effect of changes in frequency and spatial distribution, we performed these assays in minimal medium using a surfactin production-deficient mutant of the <italic>sfp</italic> gene (<italic>sfp</italic><sup>−</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref027">27</xref>]), which has reduced quorum-sensing-associated cost. Similar results were obtained when gene expression was measured during swarming (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). The absence of surfactin in the minimal growth medium did not significantly affect expression of the P<sub><italic>srfA</italic></sub>-YFP reporter construct in the cocultured strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). We found that, when the MinusRap and wild-type strains are cocultured, the MinusRap strain maintained a constant ComA activity, irrespective of its frequency in the population (F(1,16) = 0.41, <italic>p</italic> = 0.53, <italic>n</italic> = 18, linear regression of the slope).

<title>A General Design Criterion for Accumulation of Quorum-Sensing Systems</title>
<p>The experimental results support the role of social interactions in selection for accumulation of Rap-Phr systems coupled with selection against accumulation of ComP-ComX systems in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>. In order to generalize these results, we formulated a generic model of selection with respect to quorum-sensing-dependent public goods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s008">S1 File</xref>). This model suggests that two design criteria are necessary and sufficient for the invasion of a strain carrying an additional quorum-sensing system into a population lacking it: 1) Dominant repression: The ligand-free novel receptor should act negatively to overpower the quorum-sensing response of the ancestral system, and 2) Facultative operation: The addition of the novel autoinducer should restore the quorum-sensing response to levels similar to that of the ancestor. The combination of these two features allows the invading strain to perform facultative cheating—cheat the ancestor in coculture (criterion #1) but resume cooperation when it is fixed in the population (criterion #2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>In the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s008">S1 File</xref>, we show that if repression by the novel quorum-sensing system is strong, the two autoinducers will regulate the response in an AND-like manner. We further demonstrate that formation of an AND-like gate is sufficient but not mandatory to select for acquisition of a novel quorum-sensing system. Likewise, an OR-like gate between autoinducers is sufficient but not required to select against the acquisition of a novel quorum-sensing system. The AND-like and OR-like gate structures provide an intuitive, albeit simplified, explanation for selection (AND) or counterselection (OR) of an evolved strain. If both autoinducers are necessary to activate the quorum-sensing response in the evolved strain (AND gate), while the ancestral strain produces and responds to only one of the autoinducers, then the evolved strain will cease to cooperate when present as a small minority together with its ancestor. In contrast, if either autoinducer is sufficient, then the evolved strain will continue to cooperate even when it is present as a minority.</p>

<p>We next examined whether our results also apply to another well-studied model organism in which multiple quorum-sensing systems exist and control a common output. The bioluminescent marine bacterium <italic>V</italic>. <italic>harveyi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref015">15</xref>] has a quorum-sensing network composed of three parallel systems that regulate expression of the quorum-sensing master transcription factor LuxR, which controls multiple traits including bioluminescence emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

While the deletion of any of the receptors does not affect the quorum-sensing response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref018">18</xref>], deletion of any of the autoinducer synthase genes represses LuxR-activated genes, demonstrating the dominant repressive effect of each ligand-free receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref017">17</xref>]. In addition, two of the autoinducers have been shown to act multiplicatively in their regulation of LuxR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref030">30</xref>] and to synergistically control bioluminescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref031">31</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we propose that bacteria possessing multiple quorum-sensing networks that control the identical response, which are commonly found in nature, are selected through a facultative cheating process. Facultative cheating has been described in the past as a strategy by which microorganisms exploit nonkin but return to cooperation in the presence of kin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref032">32</xref>]. Such behavior has been described in fruiting body-forming amoeba and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref033">33</xref>], but the underlying molecular processes that lead to it are unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref034">34</xref>]; however, links to cell—cell signaling and facultative cheating have been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>We predict that accumulation of multiple quorum-sensing systems requires a specific set of network design criteria, the functioning of which we explored in two diverse but well studied organisms. Specifically, the introduced novel receptor must repress the quorum-sensing response in the absence of the novel autoinducer, as occurs in the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> Rap-Phr and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>harveyi</italic> Lux quorum-sensing systems. In contrast to these systems that depend on repression, other quorum-sensing systems exist that act positively, in that the receptor functions as an activator upon autoinducer binding. Our model and experimental results explain why accumulation of parallel positively acting systems is selected against. Indeed, we do not know of any bacterium that possesses multiple activation-based quorum-sensing systems that function in parallel. Rather, activation-based systems are commonly organized in a hierarchy, in which one quorum-sensing system regulates the expression of a second system. A hierarchical network design is not fully redundant because the two quorum-sensing systems can control different genes. Further work will be required to define the benefits and possible evolutionary routes giving rise to quorum-sensing systems that function positively and are arranged as hierarchies.</p>
<p>Beyond facultative cheating, other possible adaptive functions for possessing multiple quorum-sensing systems have been suggested. These include gains in information acquired about cell density, information about the frequency of phenotypes in the vicinal population, and access to information about physical flow conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref041">41</xref>]. Our social selection model does not contradict those alternatives and may promote them by driving the initial fixation of the redundant network design, which can, subsequently, be further modified for other adaptive advantages.</p>
<p>Several processes may limit the accumulation of quorum-sensing systems. First, each system contributes a signaling cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref042">42</xref>]. Second, the facultative return to cooperation may not be complete, leading to reduced benefit during exploitation in structured populations. Third, social selection of facultative characters is weak and can lead to variable mutation selection balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref034">34</xref>]. Finally, rareness of available systems and the need to integrate them appropriately into the existing network may limit the rate of accumulation. Further work will be required to define the importance of each of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Exploitation can also occur between species; not only between variants within species. For example, cooperative secretion of antibiotic degrading enzymes has been shown to lead to coexistence of secreting and nonsecreting genotypes, at both the species and interspecific levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref044">44</xref>]. Accumulation of additional quorum-sensing systems could also be used to exploit species that produce fewer signals. This ecological factor may contribute to the continuous selection for maintenance of multiple systems. More generally, our results point to the roles facultative cheating and kin recognition may have in the ecology of complex microbial communities.</p>

Unless otherwise noted, 0.5% glucose was used as carbon source. Petri dishes for routine procedures were solidified using 1.5%agar (Difco).</p>
<p>Antibiotic concentrations: Macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS; 1 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> erythromycin, 25 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> lincomycin); Spectinomycin (Sp, 100 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>); Tetracycline (Tet, 10 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>); Kanamycin (Km, 5 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>); Chloramphenicol (Cm, 15 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>); Ampicillin (Amp, 100 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>); Carbenicillin (Carb, 300 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>). Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Sigma) was added to the medium at the indicated concentration when appropriate.</p>
<p>Premeasurement Bacillus growth protocol: Prior to all measurements, an overnight colony from an LB agar plate was inoculated in 1 mL SMM liquid medium and grown for 7 h until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1–0.3 was reached. The cultures were diluted by a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> and grown overnight at 37°C. Overnight cultures were centrifuged, resuspended in PBS, and diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.01. We find that this long incubation in minimal medium both reduced the effects of quorum sensing prior to growth and reduced the arbitrary difference in growth between two cocultured wild-type colonies.</p>
<p>For coculture experiments, cells of different strains were mixed in appropriate ratios after overnight growth in SMM, based on relative optical density (OD). The exact ratios were subsequently measured using flow cytometry.</p>

<title>Flow Cytometry</title>
<p>Samples were analyzed on a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter), equipped with four lasers (405 nm, 488 nm colinear with 561 nm, 638 nm). The emission filters used were: BFP– 450/50, YFP/GFP– 525/40, mCherry– 620/30. Events were discriminated using the forward-scatter parameter. For each run, discrimination enabled a single, well-defined population to appear in the forward-scatter (FS) by side-scatter plot. Gating on the fluorescent populations and inspection of the nondiscriminated forward by side-scatter plot indicated that over 99.9% of the fluorescent cells are present in the discriminated population. In all analyzed samples, only single cells were considered by gating on correlated time-of-flight and FS events. Gating of the different fluorescent populations was performed by inspection of the log-log FLx by FLy plots (where <italic>x</italic> &amp; <italic>y</italic> represent the appropriate filter number for each fluorescent marker), where two distinct populations were clearly visible, resulting in type-I and type-II errors of less than 0.05%.

<title>Swarming Experiments</title>
<p>Cells were grown as described in the premeasurement growth protocol. Five microliters of diluted cultures were placed at the centers of 0.7% agar plates containing 25 mL of SMM medium supplemented with trace elements and 0.05% glucose. The plates were prepared 1 h prior to inoculation, allowed to solidify in room temperature, and dried for 5 min in a laminar flow chamber. The plates were incubated at 30°C for up to 72 h. The swarms were collected after suspension in 5 ml of PBS, the OD was measured, and the final ratios or the gene expression was determined using flow cytometry as described above. For spatial analysis of swarming, samples were taken from the centers of the plates, in addition to several samples 1 cm and 2 cm from the center. We find that a glucose concentration of 0.05% compared to 0.5% reduced the residual swarming of the <italic>comA</italic> mutant, increasing the difference in growth between the mutant and the wild-type, likely because residual production of surfactin by the mutant colony was reduced.</p>

<p>Three separate experiments were performed to measure the P<sub><italic>srfA</italic></sub>-YFP expression levels as a function of dual combinations of different autoinducers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In each of the experiments, the relevant strain was grown to a set OD, when different concentrations of the relevant autoinducers were added to different aliquots and incubated for 90 min, after which YFP was measured using flow cytometry. For the PhrF-PhrC gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), cells of strain AES2636 were grown to OD of 0.6 when different concentrations of the two synthetic peptides were added to different aliquots.

Different 250 μl aliquots were then complemented with 250 μl of a composite conditioned media. Composite conditioned media was composed of varying fractions of conditioned media prepared from three strains: AES2202 (producing ComX<sub>RO-H-1</sub>), AES2277 (producing ComX<sub>168</sub>) and AES2135 (not producing ComX), which were grown to OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0 prior to preparation of the conditioned media.

The 24 h differences are not statistically significant given the sample size. (B) Spatial structure of invasion. Cocultures of the indicated strains at the indicated frequencies were inoculated onto swarm plates. 48 h after inoculation, the frequencies of the strains were measured at different positions on the plates—center (one sample per plate) and at a distance of 1 or 2 cm from the center (four samples per plate). Each experiment was repeated twice. Shown are the averages and standard deviations of the apparent fitnesses at the different positions and for the different strain compositions. Apparent fitness is defined as the relative frequency at the position of sampling divided by the initial relative frequency of the two strains. The lower apparent fitness at a distance of 2 cm agrees well with the known <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> swarming mechanism—cells initially swarm as a thin monolayer, and then they grow. The reduced apparent fitness stems from the lower number of doublings.

PhrF autoinducer peptide was directly added in varying amounts. ComX autoinducer was added at varying amounts by supplying a constant volume of conditioned medium made from particular fractions of wild-type- and <italic>ΔcomQXP</italic>-conditioned media. The response was measured using the P<sub><italic>srfA</italic></sub>-YFP reporter. Note the logarithmic scale of the <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic> axes. (C) Interpolation of the raw data is presented as a two-dimensional heat map. White lines indicate equal response curves at the designated response levels. The curves fit nicely to a straight line of angle ~45°, as expected from a multiplicative function. (D) Synergy of the ComX-PhrF regulatory gate. For any given level of the autoinducers, the similarity to an AND gate can be assesed by the level of synergy of the response, which is defined as the value of the response for that specific combination of autoinducers, divided by the sum of the two responses when only one of the autoinducers is supplied at the identical concentration. Shown are the synergy levels as a function of the strength of the response for the data presented in panel B (red) and for a repeat of the experiment in which the raw data are not shown (purple). The dashed line at a synergy value of 1 indicates the expected level from an additive model, <italic>f</italic>(<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>) = <italic>f</italic>(<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, 0) + <italic>f</italic>(0, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>). See further discussion on synergy and its relation to the establishment of particular regulatory gates in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s008">S1 File</xref>. We note that in some of the experiments, we did not measure the response for zero concentration of some of the autoinducers. In such cases, we used the response with minimal level of autoinducer as an estimation for the response with zero autoinducer. The calculated synergy levels in these cases are therefore underestimates of the actual synergy.</p>

<p>Predicted LuxR levels (in arbitrary units) for the addition of different concentrations of the AI-2 and AI-1 autoinducers (in nM) for a strain expressing both receptors (main graph), or for mutants lacking the LuxPQS system (top) or the LuxMN system (right). This analysis is based on refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref050">50</xref>], as explained in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s008">S1 File</xref>. Compare the main panel here to the corresponding experimental panel in Fig 4B of ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002386.ref030">30</xref>]. See further details on the analysis in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002386.s008">S1 File</xref>. (B) Shown are the bioluminescence levels of cocultures of bioluminescent (<italic>lux</italic><sup>+</sup>) and mutated (<italic>lux</italic><sup>−</sup>) strains, as a function of the frequency of the <italic>lux</italic><sup>+</sup> strain. This includes the cocultures of the wild-type and the <italic>ΔluxMN</italic> strains which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002386.g004">Fig 4E</xref> of the main manuscript (magenta and green). Note that the coculture in which the <italic>ΔluxMN</italic> is <italic>lux</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> (green), is an increasing function, as the <italic>x</italic>-axis represents the <italic>ΔluxMN</italic> frequency and not the wild-type frequency. Also shown are two controls in which the wild-type (blue) and the <italic>ΔluxMN</italic> (orange) <italic>lux</italic><sup>+</sup> strains where cocultured with a <italic>lux</italic><sup>−</sup> variant of the same genetic background. The bioluminescence patterns of the two controls and the coculture of <italic>ΔluxMN</italic>, <italic>lux</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> and wild-type, <italic>lux</italic><sup>−</sup> are indistinguishable (<italic>p</italic> = 0.24, F(54,2) = 1.43, for three lines to be the same assuming parallel lines, using ANCOVA analysis on genotype by frequency). This result indicates that the small change in the frequency of the strains is due to the effect of the <italic>lux</italic> locus and not of the <italic>luxMN</italic> locus.</p>
