<abstract>
<p>The phototrophic bacterium <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> induces several small RNAs (sRNAs) when singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) levels are elevated, a situation also referred to as photo-oxidative stress. An RNA-seq study identified the RSs0019 sRNA, which is renamed Pos19 (<underline>p</underline>hoto-<underline>o</underline>xidative stress induced <underline>s</underline>RNA 19). Pos19 is part of the RpoE regulon and consequently induced upon <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and peroxide stress. The 219 nt long Pos19 transcript contains a small open reading frame (sORF) of 150 nt, which is translated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Over-expression of Pos19 results in reduced mRNA levels for several genes, of which numerous are involved in sulfur metabolism. The negative effect on the potential targets is maintained even when translation of the sORF is abolished, arguing that regulation is entailed by the sRNA itself. Reporter studies further revealed that regulation of the most affected mRNA, namely RSP_0557, by Pos19 is Hfq-dependent. Direct binding of Pos19 to Hfq was shown by co-immunoprecipitation. Physiological experiments indicated Pos19 to be involved in the balance of glutathione biosynthesis. Moreover, a lack of Pos19 leads to elevated reactive oxygen species levels. Taken together our data identify the sRNA Pos19 as a coding sRNA with a distinct expression pattern and potential role under oxidative stress in the phototrophic bacterium <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The accumulation of molecular oxygen in the earth’s atmosphere at around 2.4–2.3 billion years ago changed the fate of biological evolution dramatically. Organisms that developed under anaerobic conditions suddenly had to cope with oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Those organisms which survived the "Great Oxidation Event" developed protection mechanisms to handle this specific threat. Among the ROS produced throughout metabolism, singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) is unique because its formation does not rely on electron but rather energy transfer to molecular oxygen. Since light is pivotal for this energy transfer, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress is often referred to as photo-oxidative stress. Another prerequisite for its generation is the existence of a photosensitizer that is capable of transferring light energy to molecular oxygen. In phototrophic organisms naturally occurring photosensitizers are chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules as well as their porphyrin precursors (for review on <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref001">1</xref>]). In the anoxygenic, phototrophic bacterium <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> triplet state BChl <italic>a</italic> molecules of the reaction centre generate <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in perceivable amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref002">2</xref>], while carotenoids carry out a protective function by quenching either excited BChl <italic>a</italic> or <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref004">4</xref>]. In addition to the existence of carotenoids in photosynthetic membranes, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> harbors a complex regulatory network to manage the photo-oxidative stress response and to finally adapt to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. The photo-oxidative stress response is initiated by the release of the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor RpoE from its inhibitory anti-sigma factor ChrR which is degraded upon stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref007">7</xref>]. The set of genes that are directly targeted by RpoE is rather small (~15 genes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref008">8</xref>] but also includes another alternative sigma factor gene, <italic>rpoH</italic><sub><italic>II</italic></sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref010">10</xref>]. The RpoH<sub>II</sub> regulon itself may comprise up to 100 genes and additionally shares an overlapping regulon with the heat shock sigma factor RpoH<sub>I</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref011">11</xref>]. Genes within the RpoH<sub>II</sub> regulon provide functions in glutathione (GSH) dependent defense against <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, detoxification of methylglyoxal and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> quenching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref012">12</xref>]. When present in elevated amounts, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is highly toxic and causes severe damages of macromolecules, albeit proteins are the primary targets. Products of the so called indirect photo-oxidation of proteins comprise tryptophan, tyrosine and histidine peroxides as well as methionine sulfoxides and disulfides formed from cysteines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref013">13</xref>]. In subsequent reactions toxic hydroperoxides in proteins and lipids can evolve as secondary damages. A further source for oxidative stress in photosynthetic organisms is iron limitation which strongly increases the intracellular ROS levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref015">15</xref>]. These increased ROS levels occur since iron is essential for enzymes involved in ROS detoxification such as catalases and Fe-containing superoxide dismutase and for oxidative stress sensing enzymes such as SoxRS. Therefore <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> and other photosynthetic organisms have a need for sophisticated response and protection mechanisms in order to survive oxidative stress.</p>
<p>In former studies we have shown that <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> expresses several sRNAs upon <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress, which are under control of RpoE, RpoH<sub>II</sub> and/or RpoH<sub>I</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref011">11</xref>]. So far the function in stress responses of sRNAs in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> could be verified for at least three examples: the sRNA SorY (former RSs1543), which by limiting the malate import contributes to the balance of metabolic fluxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref017">17</xref>], and the sRNAs CcsR1-4 (former RSs0680a-0680d), which affect C1 metabolism upon oxidative stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref018">18</xref>]. Recently, we described the 3’UTR-derived sRNA SorX (former RSs2461), which counteracts oxidative stress by regulating spermidine uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref019">19</xref>]. From other bacterial models it is known that sRNAs have a central role in stress regulatory networks by modulating mRNA stability and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref021">21</xref>]. An impressive example is the modulation of the outer membrane by manifold sRNAs in enterobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref022">22</xref>]. The RNA chaperone Hfq regularly supports functionality of sRNAs by facilitating sRNA-mRNA interactions and by impairing turnover of transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref024">24</xref>]. Since Hfq interacts with plenty of sRNAs, it represents a global regulator. In <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> Hfq affects several cellular processes, amongst others the photo-oxidative stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref025">25</xref>]. The three RpoH<sub>I</sub>/RpoH<sub>II</sub>-dependent sRNAs (SorY, CcsR1, and SorX) could be co-immunoprecipitated with Hfq and consequently might have caused the higher <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides hfq</italic> deletion mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we describe the diverse characteristics of the sRNA RSs0019 and rename it as Pos19 (<underline>p</underline>hoto-<underline>o</underline>xidative stress induced <underline>s</underline>RNA 19) for its primary noted appearance upon photo-oxidative stress. The sRNA is furthermore induced by peroxide stress and iron limitation. The small open reading frame (sORF) within the Pos19 sequence was shown to be translated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Pos19 over-expression combined with microarray analysis identified Pos19-regulated genes and mutational analyses further revealed that regulation does not depend on translation of the sORF. Albeit the interaction with Hfq appears to be rather weak, Pos19 can be co-immunoprecipitated with Hfq and relies on Hfq for regulation of RSP_0557, encoding a hypothetical protein. Regarding a Pos19 function in oxidative stress responses, it was demonstrated that it alters the intracellular GSH level most likely by affecting the mRNA level of several sulfur metabolism genes. Moreover, a lack of Pos19 resulted in increased cellular ROS levels and caused a slight growth defect under iron limitation, a condition also leading to increased ROS levels. These findings lead to the assumption that Pos19 is involved in a complex regulatory circuit needed to balance metabolic processes such as GSH biosynthesis and ROS detoxification upon oxidative stress. Furthermore, our data suggest Pos19 to be a regulatory sRNA with a coding function.</p>

<title>Pos19 is an RpoE- and oxygen-dependent sRNA with a coding function</title>
<p>Pos19 was first identified as RSs0019 in a global screen for sRNAs in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> by differential RNA-sequencing (dRNA-seq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref016">16</xref>]. The primary 5’ end of Pos19 was unambiguously determined by the dRNA-seq approach. In addition, we mapped the 3’ end by 3’ RACE, which validated a size of 219 nt. The detected 3’ end correlates with a predicted Rho-independent terminator (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g002">2A</xref>). Interestingly, the terminating structure misses the typical 3’ polyU stretch that is found in many bacterial sRNAs. It was already demonstrated that <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, but not superoxide radicals (O<sub>2</sub><sup>‒</sup>), induce Pos19 and that the alternative sigma factor RpoE is responsible for this induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref016">16</xref>]. Pos19 is preceded by a perfectly conserved RpoE-dependent promoter (TGATCC(N<sub>15</sub>)GCGTA; Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g002">2A</xref>), which can be targeted by RpoE when the inhibitory interaction with its cognate anti-sigma factor ChrR is released upon <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress. Additional stress factors lead to RpoE activation: peroxides like hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and organic hydroperoxides act as signals for RpoE activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref007">7</xref>]. In line with these observations, Pos19 is clearly induced after treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the organic hydroperoxide tBOOH (<italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide) in an RpoE-dependent manner but independently of RpoH<sub>I</sub> and RpoH<sub>II</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). In strain TF18, lacking the <italic>rpoE-chrR</italic> locus, there is no induction of Pos19 under the tested stress conditions, while in the RpoH<sub>I</sub> and RpoH<sub>II</sub> mutant strains the expression of Pos19 is not altered upon <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress compared to the wild-type.</p>

<p>(A) Detailed illustration of the <italic>pos19</italic> gene. Relevant features are shown in bold. The -35 and -10 motifs of the RpoE-dependent promoter are marked. The 219 nt long sRNA (shaded in grey) contains two potential ORFs with lengths of 150 (Start1) and 135 nt (Start2). The Rho-independent terminator (italic letters) was predicted by TransTermHP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref027">27</xref>] and correlates with the 3’ end mapped by 3’ RACE. The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, the two start codons as well as one internal codon (Codon16) were mutated according to the chart below the sequence. (B) <italic>In vivo</italic> translation of the Pos19-sORF was monitored by translational <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions. A 300 bp fragment containing the RpoE-dependent promoter and the first 178 bp of the <italic>pos19</italic> gene (including codons 1–48) was fused to the promoter-less <italic>lacZ</italic> gene on reporter plasmid pPHU236. The wild-type (wt) sORF was subsequently mutated as shown in (A). The fusion plasmids and control plasmid pPHU236 were transferred to <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> ΔPos19 or strain TF18, which lacks the <italic>rpoE-chrR</italic> locus. The corresponding strains were subjected to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress for 60 min with samples collected at the indicated time points. ß-galactosidase activities were measured from biological triplicates with technical duplicates. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. (C) <italic>In vivo</italic> translation of the Pos19-sORF was monitored by translational eCFP fusion. The Pos19 peptide, C-terminally fused to eCFP (Pos19<sup>up+ORF</sup>), was detected with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody on a Western blot.

<p>When inspecting the Pos19 sequence, we found two putative sORFs with lengths of 135 and 150 nt, depending on the particular start codon (Start1 and Start2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To address the question whether translation occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>, a translational fusion to <italic>lacZ</italic> on reporter plasmid pPHU236 was constructed and subsequently mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The wild-type fusion gave a β-galactosidase activity of 116 Miller units (MU) before stress, which was increased to 408 MU after 60 min of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress. In strain TF18, which lacks the <italic>rpoE-chrR</italic> locus, reporter activity of the wild-type fusion was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). As negative control, we used a strain carrying the control plasmid pPHU236 with the promoter-less <italic>lacZ</italic> gene, which completely lacked activity. Mutations in the first start codon (Stop1 and Thr1) as well as mutations that introduce an internal stop codon (Stop2 and Stop16) nearly abolished β-galactosidase activity. In contrast, mutating the second start codon to ACG (Thr2) did not affect reporter activity. These findings rather argue for the first start codon to be essential for translation initiation. A potential Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence was found shortly upstream of the first start codon, however, SD mutations (M4 and M8) did not completely abolish translation and reporter activities remained at fairly high levels especially under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In summary, translation initiation of the Pos19-sORF occurs at the first start codon and partly relies on an intact SD sequence. To verify the <italic>in vivo</italic> translation, a translational fusion of the Pos19-sORF, carrying its own promoter, to eCFP on the reporter plasmid pBE_eCFP::eCFP was constructed (pBE_Pos19<sup>up+ORF</sup>::eCFP). Western blot analysis verified the expression of the Pos19 peptide upon <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress and validated the β-galactosidase activity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The Pos19 sequence with SD and sORF is conserved in different <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163425.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) but was not found in other species.</p>

<title>The Pos19 regulon comprises genes involved in sulfur metabolism</title>
<p>To learn more about the function of Pos19, we constructed an over-expression strain. For this purpose, the <italic>pos19</italic> gene together with its native RpoE-dependent promoter was inserted into the middle-copy plasmid pBBR1 (pPos19) and expressed in the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> wild-type background. The corresponding strain consequently exhibits a <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-induced Pos19 over-expression compared to an empty vector control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Total RNA from the over-expression (pPos19) and empty vector control (pBBR1) strain was extracted after 7 min of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress and used for microarray analysis to investigate Pos19-induced changes on transcriptome level. All mRNAs which showed an up- or down-regulation with a log<sub>2</sub> ratio ≥ 1.0 or ≤ -1.0 are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0163425.t001">Table 1</xref>. Among the up-regulated mRNAs we found <italic>fliC</italic> (flagellar filament protein), the <italic>cox</italic> operon (RSP_2876–79) and three genes for hypothetical proteins (RSP_2590, RSP_3469, and RSP_6085). Among the down-regulated mRNAs, RSP_0557 (encoding a hypothetical protein) was most strongly affected by Pos19 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In addition, mRNAs from genes/operons with a function in serine (<italic>serC</italic>, <italic>serA</italic>) and sulfur metabolism (<italic>cysH</italic>, <italic>cysI</italic>, RSP_1943, <italic>cysG/cobA</italic>) showed decreased mRNA levels. Since serine can easily enter cysteine metabolism pathways we carefully re-inspected the microarray data for down-regulated mRNAs (log<sub>2</sub> ratio ≤ -0.6) with a function in sulfur or cysteine metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In total, 30 genes were down-regulated with a log<sub>2</sub> ratio ≤ -0.6, 14 of which had a direct or indirect function in sulfur metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163425.s007">S1 Table</xref>). Besides the above-listed mRNAs from the <italic>cys</italic> operon (RSP_1944–39), which is involved in assimilatory sulfate reduction, we found <italic>cysP</italic> from the <italic>cysAPTW</italic> operon (RSP_3696–99), which encodes an ABC sulfate/thiosulfate transporter, to be down-regulated. Moreover, <italic>cysK</italic> (cysteine synthase), <italic>sopT</italic> (sulfate adenylyltransferase) and TST (Rhodanese-related sulfur transferase) were decreased in mRNA level (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163425.s002">S2 Fig</xref> for their particular functions in sulfur metabolism). Finally, the <italic>metNIQ</italic> operon, encoding an ABC D-methionine transporter, was down-regulated. This is of interest because methionine is a sulfur-containing amino acid. The microarray data for Pos19-affected mRNAs involved in sulfur metabolism and the most affected gene RSP_0557 were compared to microarray ratios calculated from experiments with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> wild-type 2.4.1 cultures before (0 min) and after 7 min of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref028">28</xref>]. Intriguingly, the mRNAs which are repressed upon Pos19 over-expression are slightly or clearly up-regulated under <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress in the wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To exclude the possibility that changes observed in the Pos19 microarray were solely due to the action of the small peptide translated from the Pos19 transcript, we constructed over-expression strains for Pos19 containing sORF mutations that abrogate translation (Stop16, Stop1, Thr1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Like pPos19, the pPos19 mutant constructs produced increased sRNA levels compared to the pBBR1 empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We then monitored the induction of selected genes after 7 min of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress in three strains by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The pBBR1 control strain revealed that RSP_0557 and five selected genes from sulfur metabolism (<italic>metI</italic>, <italic>serC</italic>, <italic>cysH</italic>, <italic>cysI</italic> and <italic>cysP</italic>) are induced upon <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic>. Since the control strain reflects the wild-type situation, this validated the microarray results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3B</xref>. When Pos19 was over-expressed the induction disappeared and mRNA levels remained unchanged or were even slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This was also the case when over-expressing Pos19 with the abolished sORF translation (Thr1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). As a control we monitored induction of <italic>gloB</italic> (RSP_0799), which is known to be induced upon <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref012">12</xref>] and was not changed in the Pos19 microarray. As expected, induction was observed in all three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). From these experiments, we conclude that the effect of Pos19 on the selected genes is independent of the small peptide and displays a regulatory sRNA function. Surprisingly, mRNA levels of the selected genes were not further increased when deleting Pos19 and there was no significant difference compared to the wild-type (data not shown). Moreover, there was no effect when constitutively over-expressing Pos19 (pRK16S::Pos19) under non-stress conditions (data not shown).</p>

<title>Pos19 affects cellular glutathione and ROS levels</title>
<p>Since sulfur metabolism genes were affected upon Pos19 over-expression, we took a closer look at the intracellular levels of the sulfur-containing antioxidant GSH. A Pos19 deletion mutant (ΔPos19), a strain constitutively over-expressing Pos19 (pRK16S::Pos19), and a strain carrying the respective empty vector (pRK16S) were compared. GSH assays revealed a significantly reduced amount of GSH in the Pos19 over-expression (76%) and an increased amount of GSH (119%) in the Pos19 deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Regarding these changes in the antioxidant GSH, we expected an effect on oxidative stress resistance in the corresponding strains. Surprisingly, we found only very minor differences in resistance that were not consistent with GSH measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

<title>Pos19 is Hfq-dependent</title>
<p>To further elucidate the regulatory potential of Pos19, we made use of an <italic>in vivo</italic> reporter system, in which mRNAs are translationally fused to the promoter-less <italic>lacZ</italic> gene on reporter plasmid pPHU235 and transcribed from a 16S rRNA promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref023">23</xref>]. On a second plasmid, Pos19 is over-expressed from its native RpoE-dependent promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). A fusion of <italic>takP</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref017">17</xref>] was used as negative control and, as expected, was not regulated by Pos19 in neither wild-type nor Δ<italic>hfq</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In addition to the microarray results, data from a target prediction by <sc>IntaRNA</sc> analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref030">30</xref>] pointed to the possibility of RSP_0557 and <italic>cysH</italic> to be targets of Pos19 with interactions predicted for the translation initiation region, which we, therefore, tested in the reporter system. RSP_0557 expression was decreased to 32–37% in all tested Pos19 over-expression constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). These data support the observations from qRT-PCR experiments, where diminishment of mRNA levels was independent of an intact sORF. When the plasmid pPos19 was transferred to an <italic>hfq</italic> deletion mutant (Δ<italic>hfq</italic>), the negative effect on the <italic>0557-lacZ</italic> reporter was not observable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Former results suggested that Pos19 is not an Hfq-binder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref025">25</xref>] and the abolished function of Pos19 in the Δ<italic>hfq</italic> background was therefore surprising. Assuming that Pos19 might weakly bind to Hfq and has not overcome the detection limit in the former study, co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) with 3xFLAG-tagged Hfq was repeated with a strain carrying pPos19, demonstrating that Pos19 clearly binds Hfq when present in elevated amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Since the <italic>0557-lacZ</italic> reporter carries parts of the RSP_0557 upstream region containing a potential promoter, an effect of Pos19 on the transcription of RSP_0557 could not be ruled out. The upstream region of RSP_0557 containing the potential promoter was transcriptionally fused to the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene containing its own ribosomal binding site. The activity of the RSP_0557 promoter did not differ in the empty vector control and Pos19 over-expression strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163425.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

There is growing evidence that the major regulator of the photo-oxidative stress response in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic>, RpoE, is activated by both <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and diverse peroxides, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and tBOOH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref007">7</xref>], with similar observation made for <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref031">31</xref>]. The expression pattern of the here presented sRNA Pos19 supports this view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). It is known that <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generates lipid and protein peroxides as secondary damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref013">13</xref>] and it is, therefore, possible that part of the RpoE regulon has a function in defending peroxide stress. The presented data provides evidence for a connection between oxidative stress and modulation of glutathione metabolism. Intriguingly, this connection is realized by an sRNA that was formerly found to be induced by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and which we renamed here as Pos19. Although the exact mechanism needs to be unraveled, Pos19 uniformly represses a set of 14 genes with a direct or indirect function in sulfur metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163425.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). A drop in sulfur availability will also restrict the biosynthesis of the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine. Moreover, two of the 14 genes directly affect cysteine metabolism <italic>(cysI</italic> and <italic>cysK</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163425.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This leads to the assumption that the reduction of GSH, as seen for the Pos19 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), might be due to a reduction in cysteine, which is a major determinant for GSH production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref032">32</xref>]. It is, therefore, more than surprising that Pos19 is induced as part of the RpoE regulon and in turn represses sulfur genes, thereby decreasing GSH levels. It seems intuitive that sulfur and cysteine metabolism should be triggered under oxidative stress conditions in order to provide maximal levels of GSH because GSH together with glutaredoxin (Grx) has a major contribution to oxidative stress resistance in <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref033">33</xref>]. In fact, our data show that sulfur genes are clearly induced by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> when Pos19 is not over-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We, therefore, conclude that Pos19 slightly counterbalances this induction and thereby avoids overshooting sulfur levels in the cell. There are different aspects why this fine-tuning of sulfur genes and consequently the cysteine metabolism could have physiological benefits for the cell. Despite being used for GSH synthesis, cysteines can function as efficient reductants of Fe<sup>3+</sup> and thereby drive the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref034">34</xref>]. Moreover, cysteines are directly damaged by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> to form disulfides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref013">13</xref>]. The key to understanding the balancing effect of Pos19 on sulfur gene expression is rather the risk of having too much cysteine than not having enough GSH. Indeed physiological assays, such as the zone of inhibition and ROS measurements, revealed that in the Pos19 over-expression strain the resistance towards oxidative stress was not affected in comparison to a control strain, even though GSH levels were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g004">Fig 4</xref>). A more general explanation why Pos19 would counteract expression of genes under oxidative stress addresses cellular resources. Stress defense systems have to be carefully regulated in order to avoid their unnecessarily high expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref035">35</xref>]. This ensures that resources that could be utilized for growth are not wasted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref036">36</xref>]. Surprisingly, even though sulfur genes are up-regulated in the wild-type under <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> stress, they do not exhibit a stronger induction in the Pos19 deletion mutant. Additionally, a constitutive over-expression of Pos19 under non-stress conditions does not lead to reduced mRNA levels of the sulfur genes (data not shown). This leads to the assumption that there are redundant systems, which compensate for both constitutive presence and absence of Pos19. The observation that Pos19 mutants have altered GSH levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) is conflicting and cannot be explained by regulation of sulfur genes. Maybe GSH biosynthesis is affected otherwise. One possible source for an altered GSH level in the Pos19 mutants might be regulation of the <italic>cox</italic> operon, encoding a putative carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. The <italic>cox</italic> operon was shown to be differentially regulated in our Pos19 microarray (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0163425.t001">Table 1</xref>). From a study investigating the CcsR1-4 sRNAs, it is known that the <italic>cox</italic> genes are part of a pathway that influences GSH levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref018">18</xref>]. A possible reason for an elevated GSH level in the Pos19 deletion mutant is an increased level of ROS, which triggers defense systems including the GSH biosynthesis. And indeed, a clear increase in ROS levels in the Pos19 deletion mutant was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Even though the Pos19 deletion mutant did not show changed resistance towards oxidative stress, we observed an impaired growth under iron limitation, a condition that harbors increased ROS and induced Pos19 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163425.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These data indicate that the role of Pos19 might be more complex and regulation of sulfur metabolism might only represent one aspect of this coding sRNA.</p>
<p>The function of the small peptide encoded by the sORF within the Pos19 sequence is still enigmatic. Our experiments however strongly indicate that regulation of several mRNAs does not depend on the sORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We considered <italic>cysH</italic> as a potential target of Pos19, but only found weak regulation in the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter assay, which was comparable to regulation of the photosynthesis genes <italic>bchN</italic> and <italic>puc2A</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163425.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Even though not further examined here, Pos19 might be directly or indirectly involved in photosynthesis gene regulation. We focused on the hypothetical protein RSP_0557 as a Pos19 target and a potential missing link between Pos19 and the oxidative stress defense. RSP_0557 showed the highest expression change in our microarray data and is preceded by a putative RpoH<sub>I</sub>/H<sub>II</sub>-dependent promoter. Furthermore, RSP_0557 is homologous to RSP_6037 which is transcribed as well from a RpoH<sub>I</sub>/H<sub>II</sub>-dependent promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref018">18</xref>] and is also down-regulated by Pos19 over-expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0163425.t001">Table 1</xref>). We could show a negative effect of Pos19 on RSP_0557 in various experiments, including a dependency of Pos19 on Hfq for regulation of RSP_0557 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g005">Fig 5</xref>) and exclude regulation of RSP_0557 on transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163425.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Despite these findings, a direct interaction between Pos19 and the RSP_0557 mRNA could neither be shown via compensatory mutations nor with the help of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown). Unfortunately, we cannot ascribe a function to RSP_0557 so far. Protein BLAST searches identified the primosomal protein DnaI from <italic>Roseobacter</italic> to be 55% identical. Secondary structure predictions and comparisons by the <sc>Phyre</sc><sup>2</sup> program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref037">37</xref>] revealed that RSP_0557 shows similarity to the RNA-binding protein Smaug with a confidence of 54.6%. RSP_0557 might have a regulatory function by binding to DNA or RNA. We hypothesized that RSP_0557 regulates sulfur genes and that the Pos19 effect on these genes is solely through RSP_0557. However, we could not validate this hypothesis in experiments with neither RSP_0557 deletion mutant nor over-expression strain (data not shown). Future studies are needed to elucidate the role of RSP_0557.</p>
<p>There are more intriguing questions. One addresses the small ORF within Pos19. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data show that the ORF is translated and that mutations in the putative SD sequence do not completely abolish translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163425.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This is in accordance with the growing evidence that the SD sequence in prokaryotes might not be as important for translation initiation as previously assumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref039">39</xref>]. Considering the Pos19 peptide has a function, Pos19 would represent another rare example of a dual-function sRNA. The most prominent members of this molecule class are RNAIII from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, SgrS from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and SR1 from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref040">40</xref>]). In case of SgrS in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, the small peptide SgrT inhibits the activity of the glucose-specific PTS transporter and therefore functions in the same regulatory pathway as the base-pairing sRNA SgrS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref041">41</xref>]. A function of the Pos19 peptide in regulating the activity of sulfate or cysteine transporters is attractive but remains speculative.</p>
<p>In summary, our study identified Pos19 to be an sRNA regulator of sulfur genes that contributes to GSH homeostasis upon oxidative stress in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic>. The remodeling of metabolic processes upon environmental changes is a mode of action becoming more and more prevalent for studied sRNAs (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref042">42</xref>]). Pos19 depicts, besides SorY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref017">17</xref>], CcsR1-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref018">18</xref>], and SorX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163425.ref019">19</xref>] the fourth sRNA from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> alerting metabolic processes while adapting to stress conditions.</p>

<p>For construction of fusion plasmids reporting on Pos19-sORF translation, the Pos19-sORF was amplified together with its native RpoE-dependent promoter via PCR using primers RSs0019_up and 0019-ORF-Hind.

Mutations in the Pos19 sequence were introduced by inverse PCR of the pDrive intermediate with primers containing the respective mutation (see Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163425.s006">S1 File</xref>). The Pos19-sORF fusion to eCFP (Pos19<sup>up+ORF</sup>::eCFP) was constructed using primers 0019_ORF_fw and 0019_ORF_rev, amplifying the Pos19 sORF without stop codon and a 154 bp upstream region.
