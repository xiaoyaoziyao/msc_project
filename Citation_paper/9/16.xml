<abstract>
<p>The enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) ribulose-5-phosphate-epimerase (RPE) is encoded by two genes present in the genome of <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> CL Brener clone: <italic>TcRPE1</italic> and <italic>TcRPE2</italic>. Despite high sequence similarity at the amino acid residue level, the recombinant isoenzymes show a strikingly different kinetics. Whereas TcRPE2 follows a typical michaelian behavior, TcRPE1 shows a complex kinetic pattern, displaying a biphasic curve, suggesting the coexistence of -at least- two kinetically different molecular forms. Regarding the subcellular localization in epimastigotes, whereas TcRPE1 is a cytosolic enzyme, TcRPE2 is localized in glycosomes. To our knowledge, TcRPE2 is the first PPP isoenzyme that is exclusively localized in glycosomes. Over-expression of TcRPE1, but not of TcRPE2, significantly reduces the parasite doubling time <italic>in vitro</italic>, as compared with wild type epimastigotes. Both TcRPEs represent single domain proteins exhibiting the classical α/β TIM-barrel fold, as expected for enzymes with this activity. With regard to the architecture of the active site, all the important amino acid residues for catalysis -with the exception of M58- are also present in both TcRPEs models. The superimposition of the binding pocket of both isoenzyme models shows that they adopt essentially identical positions in the active site with a residue specific RMSD &lt; 2Å, with the sole exception of S12, which displays a large deviation (residue specific RMSD: 11.07 Å). Studies on the quaternary arrangement of these isoenzymes reveal that both are present in a mixture of various oligomeric species made up of an even number of molecules, probably pointing to the dimer as their minimal functional unit. This multiplicity of oligomeric species has not been reported for any of the other RPEs studied so far and it might bear implications for the regulation of TcRPEs activity, although further investigation will be necessary to unravel the physiological significance of these structural findings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a metabolic route that starts with glucose-6-phosphate, the first glycolytic intermediate. It consists of two branches, the oxidative branch leading from glucose 6-phosphate to ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P), with the reduction of two molecules of NADP<sup>+</sup>, and the non-oxidative or sugar interconversion branch, which ultimately, when functioning as a cycle, leads back to glycolytic intermediates. The PPP usually plays two major roles, namely the reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH, a coenzyme necessary for biosynthetic reactions and for the protection of cells against oxidative stress imposed by reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as the production of ribose-5-phosphate to be used in nucleic acid synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Ribulose-5-phosphate epimerase (RPE), which catalyses the reversible conversion of Ru5P to xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P), is an enzyme of the non-oxidative branch of the PPP. RPEs are broadly distributed in the three kingdoms of life, including most eukaryotic organisms, fungi and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref007">7</xref>]. Little is known about RPEs kinetic properties, but RPE is generally considered a metalloenzyme in several of the studied organisms and has been shown to use divalent cations as cofactors or activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref011">11</xref>]. As a metalloenzyme, RPE in <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> is thought to be one of the principal targets of oxidative stress generated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref013">13</xref>]. RPEs belong to the ribulose phosphate binding superfamily, sharing a common (<italic>α</italic>/β) 8-strand barrel fold and a conserved phosphate binding motif located at the end of the seventh and eighth β-strands in most of the members of this family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref011">11</xref>]. As for its quaternary structure, RPEs are oligomers made up of an even number of subunits in most of the organisms studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, the parasitic protozoan that causes the American Trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) maintains a functional PPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref018">18</xref>]. The seven enzymes of the pathway are present in the four major developmental stages of the parasite: the intracellular amastigote and the bloodstream trypomastigote in the mammalian host, and the epimastigote and metacyclic trypomastigote, in the insect vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref019">19</xref>]. Subcellular localization experiments suggested that the PPP enzymes display a predominant cytosolic component, although in all cases they also seem to show a minor particulate localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In several protozoan parasites, enzymes belonging to the oxidative branch of the PPP have been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref027">27</xref>], but information is scarce on most of the enzymes of the non-oxidative branch, with the exception of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref029">29</xref>], <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref033">33</xref>] and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref034">34</xref>]; and transketolase from <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> and <italic>T</italic>.<italic>brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref037">37</xref>]. In the present work, we report research on the kinetic properties of the recombinant TcRPE isoenzymes from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>, as well as a molecular modeling study that highlights important functional features of their tertiary structure, and evidence on their quaternary arrangement obtained by light scattering. Through several different techniques, we were also able to analyze the subcellular localization of the native and recombinant (over-expressed) TcRPEs in the epimastigote developmental stage.</p>

Then the cell-free extracts were treated by sonication in a Branson 450 Sonifier, by three continuous pulses (30-s each) at 60% of maximal power. The suspensions were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10 min, and the supernatants were used for the determination of enzymatic activity and preparation of Western blots.</p>

<title>Construction of vector pET-22b(+)-TcRPE1 / TcRPE2, expression, and purification of recombinant TcRPEs</title>
<p>The <italic>TcRPE1</italic> and <italic>TcRPE2</italic> genes were excised as NdeI/XhoI fragments from the pGEM<sup>®</sup>-T Easy vector, gel purified and subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of the pET-22b(+) expression vector (Novagen). The resulting constructs presenting a poly-His tag at the C-terminus were transferred to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> BL21 codon Plus (DE3) cells. Transformations with pET-22b(+)-<italic>TcRPE1</italic> and pET-22b(+)-<italic>TcRPE2</italic> were performed according to procedures described in the instruction manual. For expression, a single colony was grown overnight at 37°C in LB medium containing 50 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> kanamycin and 10 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> chloramphenicol. Then, cells were diluted 1:25 in LB medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref039">39</xref>] containing antibiotics as described above, and grown at 37°C. When an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm was reached, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce protein expression. Then, growth was continued at 18°C overnight with shaking at 250 rev min<sup>−1</sup>. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C and resuspended in lysis buffer containing: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM PMSF, and lysozyme at a final concentration of 1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>. DNA was digested by treatment with DNase I (0.1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> final concentration). The cell-free extract was obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 25 min at 4°C.</p>
<p>The recombinant enzymes were purified in one step using Ni<sup>2+</sup> resin (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 500 mM NaCl. The column was washed sequentially with 50 column volumes (CV) of the equilibration buffer and 50 CV of the same buffer added with 50 mM imidazole. TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 were eluted with 2 CV of the equilibrium buffer added with 300 mM imidazole and 500 μl fractions were collected. All purification procedures were performed at 4°C and the elution profile was monitored by enzymatic activity. Purity of the recombinant TcRPEs was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The eluted fractions were then pooled and desalted by following the PD-10 desalting column protocol (GE Healthcare), using equilibrium buffer as desalting buffer.</p>

<title>Fractionation by differential centrifugation</title>
<p>Epimastigotes of the CL Brener clone were disrupted in a mortar using silicon carbide, in a ratio of 2 g per g of cells, wet weight. The cell paste was suspended in buffer 1 (see above) and the suspension was centrifuged for 3 min at 100 x g to remove the abrasive powder. The total homogenate (H) was submitted to fractionation by differential centrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref019">19</xref>] and three fractions were obtained, namely large granules (LG), small granules (SG) and the final supernatant (S).

<title>Sucrose linear density gradient centrifugation</title>
<p>Linear and continuous gradients from 0.5 to 2.0 M sucrose in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1mM EDTA, were prepared in polyallomer tubes of 16 mm x 67 mm (10.75 ml capacity) by the successive addition of layers of sucrose solutions of decreasing density, and the system was left to equilibrate overnight. Then, the SG fraction (0.25 ml) -obtained by fractionation by differential centrifugation—was softly homogenized to eliminate any association among particles, and loaded over the gradient surface. The volume of the tube was completed with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1mM EDTA, and then the tube was heat sealed. Immediately, the tube was placed in a NVT 65 rotor and centrifuged at 300,000 x g for 3 h. In the end, 23 fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected by suction, using an automatic collector. Fraction density was determined with an Abbe refractometer. All the operations were performed between 0 and 4°C. The activities of RPE and marker enzymes were determined in reaction mixtures containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and were represented in frequency histograms, as the total activity of a given fraction relative to the sum of total activities of all the fractions, as a function of the fraction number ordered by increasing density.</p>

A concentration of 0.02–2 mM or 0.1–10 mM D-ribulose-5-phosphate was assayed for recombinant TcRPE1 or TcRPE2, respectively. The TcTKT used as coupled enzyme, was assayed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref035">35</xref>]. The other coupled enzymes were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The values of the kinetic parameters K<sub>M</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> for TcRPE2 were obtained after non-linear regression of velocities in the substrate curves by the Gauss-Newton method, using the Solver application from Microsoft Office Excel. The data of four independent experiments performed with different batches of TcRPE2, were fitted using the Michaelis-Menten equation. In a similar fashion, the data of four independent experiments performed with different batches of TcRPE1, were plotted to determine the complex kinetic pattern shown by this enzyme. Hence, we decided not to apply any mathematical treatment to these data. The glycosomal marker hexokinase was assayed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref035">35</xref>]. The mitochondrial marker isocitrate dehydrogenase was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM NADP and 2.5 mM isocitrate in 25 mM triethanolamine-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The reaction was monitored by reading the increase in the absorbance at 340 nm.

As a first approach, the native recombinant TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 molecular mass was determined by gel filtration in a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences) with a gel bed of 24 ml. Tris–HCl (50 mM), pH 7.6, containing 500 mM NaCl was used as eluent. Column calibration was performed using as molecular mass standards: cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (12.4 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), α-chymotrypsinogen A (25.7 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). Blue Dextran (2000 kDa) was used as a marker of the exclusion volume. Protein samples were prepared in the same elution buffer and centrifuged (20,000 x g at 4°C for 5 min) before injection. Samples and standards (200μl) were resolved at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min<sup>−1</sup>. Similarly, for size exclusion chromatography—light scattering experiments (SEC-FPLC-LS), elution profiles of a Superose 12 column (GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated at room temperature with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 500 mM NaCl, were recorded following the UV absorption at 280 nm (Jasco UV2075 plus), the enzymatic activity and the multi-angle static light scattering (MASLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) signals from in-line modules (Wyatt Technology).

<title>Homology modeling</title>
<p>The primary sequences of TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 (GenBank Accession codes ABW88687.1 and ABW88688.1, respectively) were obtained from the NCBI protein database and were analyzed using PSI-PRED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref042">42</xref>] for the prediction of secondary structure. A Pfam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref043">43</xref>] search yielded conserved domains. SCOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref044">44</xref>] analysis was performed to detect domains based on similarity with experimental structures. Local alignments were built using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for proteins (BLASTP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref045">45</xref>] accessible at the NCBI-BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST</ext-link>). Homologous entries were obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref046">46</xref>]. At first, template selection criteria were based on three different aspects: (i) extent of identity with the target, (ii) coverage of the target and (iii) crystallographic resolution of the template. This resulted in a short list of 10 possible templates. Then, to choose the best templates, we considered the evolutionary closeness of the targets to the templates. Finally, the putative RPE from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (PDB ID: 1TQX) -displaying 48% and 38% sequence identity with TcRPE1 and TcRPE2, respectively- and the putative RPE from <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (PDB ID: 4NU7) -displaying 50% and 47% sequence identity with TcRPE1 and TcRPE2, respectively- were the templates of choice for the modeling of the monomer of TcRPE1 and TcRPE2. In this analysis we also included as a template the biochemically validated human RPE (PDB ID: 3OVQ) that displays 52% and 47% sequence identity with TcRPE1 and TcRPE2, respectively. The BLAST alignment was further refined by manual curation, and the final sequence alignment file was used as input to Modeller 9.14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref047">47</xref>]. Homology modeling of TcRPEs was performed by running Modeller from a Python terminal. One hundred models for each TcRPE based on each of the three templates (simple homology model) were built. The best model for each set was chosen, according to their DOPE and PDF scores. The best models were evaluated through DOPE profiles construction and different sets of parameters calculated by on-line servers. Finally, a refinement process based in energy minimization of the whole molecule was performed, using the 3DRefine server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref048">48</xref>], and the resulting refined models were compared with the starting models to assess their quality improvement. For the refined models of TcRPEs, a specific refinement process for loops was assayed. Neither procedure resulted in significant model improvement. The evaluation of the final models was performed through the analysis of different stereochemical parameters tested by the automatic servers Rampage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref049">49</xref>], ProQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref050">50</xref>], ERRAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref051">51</xref>], and QMEAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref052">52</xref>].

<title>Optimal pH and determination of kinetic parameters</title>
<p>Due to the high specific activity of TcRPE1 we had to use the enzyme highly diluted, but we found that this caused a progressive decay of the enzyme activity if the same diluted sample was used for all determinations. TcRPE1 lost about 40–50% of its initial activity 3 h after dilution. The presence of the substrate Ru5P at a final concentration of 1 mM or the addition of bovine serum albumin (1 to 2 mg ml<sup>-1</sup>) did not prevent this decay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

<p>Surprisingly, both isoenzymes differ markedly in regard to their kinetic behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). TcRPE1 showed a very complex kinetic pattern to increasing concentrations of Ru5P, displaying a biphasic curve, suggesting the coexistence of -at least- two kinetically different molecular forms. The linearity of the reaction with time (initial velocity) in all zones of the curves was checked, thus discarding the possibility of an experimental artifact. When the experiment was repeated several times by using different batches of the recombinant TcRPE1, the general pattern was consistently observed, but with a shift in the transition zone between both phases, which might be explained by different proportions of -at least- two kinetically different oligomeric species (see next Section) comprising each batch of recombinant enzyme. Although efforts to find a mathematical expression to calculate the kinetic parameters corresponding to the two phases of the curves were done, reproducible results could not be obtained, and therefore kinetic constants for TcRPE1 are not presented.</p>
<p>In contrast, TcRPE2 showed a typical hyperbolic response to increasing concentrations of Ru5P. After non-linear regression, the values of the kinetic parameters for this isoenzyme were determined at pH 7.5, by fitting TcRPE2 data from four independent experiments to the Michaelis-Menten equation, as described in Materials and Methods. We measured a K<sub>M</sub> value of 2.21 ± 0.23 mM, a kcat value of 0.32 ± 0.02 s<sup>-1</sup>, and a kcat/ K<sub>M</sub> of 0.16 ± 0.02 s<sup>-1</sup> mM<sup>-1</sup>. The K<sub>M</sub> value obtained for TcRPE2 was similar to that obtained for the recombinant cobalt metalloform RPE from <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic>, with a K<sub>M</sub> value of 2.40 ± 0.40 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Although we cannot compare the kinetic constants for both isoenzymes, inspection of the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g002">Fig 2C</xref> shows that TcRPE1 has a much higher specific activity than TcRPE2, and suggests that at least the kinetic component detected at the lower substrate concentrations must have also an affinity for Ru5P considerably higher than that for TcRPE2.</p>
<p>To test if the TcRPEs were metalloenzymes, various divalent metals were tested for their ability to activate these enzymes <italic>in vitro</italic>. None of the eight cations assayed (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>) at a concentration of 1 mM was able to activate TcRPE1 or TcRPE2 above background levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). In addition, purified TcRPE1 was pre-incubated for 1 h in the presence of different chelating agents (5 to 10 mM EDTA, 5 to 10 mM EGTA or 1 mM o-phenanthroline). Even after many independent replicates of the assay, inconsistent results were obtained. Since the method we used for RPE activity determination involves a magnesium-dependent TKT as a coupled enzyme, we had to work with TcRPE1 highly diluted after its preincubation with chelating agents, in order to prevent any inhibition of the coupled enzyme. Given that TcRPE2 shows low specific activity, we were not able to test the effect of chelating agents on the activity of this isoenzyme. Although these results suggest that recombinant TcRPE1 does not bear an exposed divalent metal cation essential for enzymatic activity, the aforementioned experimental limitations prevented us to reach a definite answer to this issue.</p>
<p>Finally, the treatment with 1 to 5 mM DTT or with 10 mM cysteine, and the treatment with 5 to 10 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) brought about no effect on the activity of either enzyme, suggesting that TcRPEs do not bear thiol groups essential for their activity. This finding is in good agreement with the absence of any conserved cysteine residue in the multiple sequence alignment analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s001">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s008">S8</xref> Figs).</p>

<title>Oligomeric composition of the recombinant TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 from T.cruzi</title>
<p>The subunit size of the recombinant TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 enzymes -as estimated by SDS PAGE- was 27 and 27.7 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), values that fall in good agreement with those predicted by the theoretical molecular weight computing tool of the Expasy web server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
<p>To determine the native molecular weight for both recombinant TcRPEs, we initially carried out size exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments. Given that more than one active peak eluted for each TcRPEs, and as the assignment of each peak to a defined molecular weight was unclear, we decided to run a SEC experiment using a Superose 12 column, equipped with an on-line light scattering detector (SEC-FPLC-LS) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and Methods</xref>). This approach is much more reliable and accurate for the determination of molecular masses than SEC alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref061">61</xref>], because it is able to provide independent and absolute (i.e. calibration-free) values of molecular mass. In addition, measuring the absorbance at 280 nm alongside each chromatographic run allowed us to yield a profile where for each eluted peak an associated molecular mass cloud could be estimated from the scattering signal. Surprisingly, through its application we found that both TcRPEs present multiple oligomeric species. This trait is unique among all the RPEs studied so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref014">14</xref>], that present only one oligomeric species apart from the monomer. LS reveals the presence of species in solution with molecular masses of 23, 53, 119, 160 and 216 kDa for TcRPE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) (corresponding to monomer, dimer, tetramer, hexamer and octamer, respectively) and molecular masses of 25, 62 and 109 kDa for TcRPE2 (corresponding to monomer, dimer and tetramer, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Remarkably, all the oligomeric forms found for each TcRPE result from associations of an even number of molecules. This new finding could be explained if dimers act as the minimal assembly units giving rise to the larger oligomeric structures observed. This interpretation is consistent with previous reports for some RPEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref014">14</xref>]. The different fractions eluted from the Superose 12 column were collected, and their activity was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). We found activity associated to each peak fractions showing scattering. However, for both isoenzymes the monomers presented only marginal activity. The TcRPE1 isoenzyme shows maximal enzymatic activity for the larger oligomeric species (119–160 kDa). By contrast, TcRPE2 does not show higher activity for the larger oligomers (the maximum occurs for the dimeric form of 61.5 kDa). The TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 isoenzymes not only organize themselves into different sets of oligomeric species -with TcRPE1 showing a higher proportion of oligomeric species rich in larger oligomers- but there is also a difference between isoenzymes regarding the distribution of activity associated to each oligomer. The more complex oligomeric profile and the RPE activity distribution among the different oligomers observed for TcRPE1 might be linked to the complex kinetic behavior of this isoform. However, since the different oligomeric species of TcRPEs might be involved in a dynamic equilibrium mixture that will necessarily be affected by dilution, unambiguous assignment of specific activity for any of these oligomeric forms is not straightforward.</p>

<title>Homology modeling of TcRPE1 and TcRPE2</title>
<p>To determine the tertiary structure of each TcRPE isoenzyme, non-automatic homology modeling was performed using Modeller, with the aid of a Python programming interface, so as to control each step along the process. In order to look for template candidates, the RCSB (Protein Data Bank) database was searched. The amino acid sequences extracted were compared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Basing our decision criterion on different features of the templates -as described in Materials and Methods- the same 3 templates were chosen for each TcRPE: the putative RPE from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (PDB ID: 1TQX), the putative RPE from <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (PDB ID: 4NU7), and the biochemically validated human RPE (PDB ID: 3OVQ). Three sets of 100 models were built for each TcRPE based on each chosen template. The best model for each set was selected, evaluated, refined and re-evaluated -as described in Materials and Methods- and final refined models were compared to choose only one for each TcRPE (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0172405.t001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0172405.t002">2</xref>). Results from these comparisons showed that the best models for TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 are those constructed with 1TQX and 3OVQ templates,respectively.</p>

<p>The structural quality control analysis of the final 3D models chosen for TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 was carried out using the following servers: ProQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref050">50</xref>], Rampage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref049">49</xref>], ERRAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref051">51</xref>], Q-MEAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref052">52</xref>] and the Verify 3D program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref048">48</xref>] installed in Structural Analysis and Verification Server tools (SAVES). The Ramachandran plot produced for the refined model of TcRPE1 by Rampage showed 98.3% residues in favorable regions, 4.5% in allowed regions and 1.7% in disallowed regions. Correspondingly, for the refined model of TcRPE2, 95.5% residues occur in favorable regions, 4.5% in allowed regions, and no residue was found in disallowed regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). This analysis indicates that the backbone dihedral angles psi and phi in each protein model are reasonably accurate. ERRAT plots indicate overall quality factors of 93.6 and 90.1 (very good quality) for the TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 models, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). In addition, the models were also analyzed with the ProQ server, a neural network based quality predictor, obtaining LG scores of 4.4 for TcRPE1 and 4.6 for TcRPE2. Thus, both meet the criteria for very good models. Furthermore, for both TcRPE models the quality of the fit of each amino acid sequence to the environment dictated by the protein fold was evaluated using Verify3D, obtaining 95.5 and 83% of the residues with an average 3D-1D score &gt; = 0.2 for TcRPE1 and TcRPE2, respectively, indicating good compatibility between the atomic model (3D) and the target amino acid sequence (1D). In general, the folding energy of proteins shows negative values, a fact consistent with the stability and native character of the molecules. We evaluated this energy using the Q-MEAN server, obtaining z-scores of -0.32 for TcRPE1 and -0.69 for TcRPE2. For both models this energy remains negative for all amino acid residues, indicating a consistently high level of quality. All in all, the analysis of these sets of parameters let us be confident on the reliability of the models created for TcRPE1 and TcRPE2. The spatial superimposition between the models for TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 and their corresponding templates 1TQX and 3OVQ shows that both models bear close similarity to their templates, with an overall RMSD value of 0.49 Å for TcRPE1 (for 215 paired Cα atoms <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and a RMSD value of 1.01 Å (for TcRPE2 for 220 paired Cα atoms <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Given that this homology modeling exercise yields similar results for each TcRPE, only the results for the TcRPE1 isoenzyme are shown and further discussed. The overall structure of the TcRPE1 monomer folds into a single α/β domain shaped as a variant of a classical TIM-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). A central eight-stranded parallel β-sheet makes up the cylindrical core of the barrel. This nucleus is surrounded by eight α-helices, inserted between consecutive strands and connected with them by αβ loops. Flexible loops spanning residues G60 to S67 and E168 to P172 are conserved between the model and the template. It has been reported that they fold over the active site, and are well positioned to sequester reaction intermediates during catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref009">9</xref>]. The active site of the TcRPE1 template structure (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> RPE) shows two bound ligands: a zinc and a sulfate ion, which are embedded in the model structure. Superimposition of the binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) shows that the canonic catalytic tetrad (H54, D56, H88, D195) is fully conserved. According to information available for the template that was used for modeling TcRPE1, these residues participate in divalent zinc ion coordination at the active site and have also been reported to do so in other known RPEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref011">11</xref>]. These divalent ions are putatively involved in catalysis, stabilizing a 2, 3-enediolate intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref008">8</xref>].

<title>Over-expression and subcellular localization</title>
<p>The intracellular localization of TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 was studied in cultured epimastigotes of <italic>T</italic>.<italic>cruzi</italic> CL Brener clone by immunofluorescence. While TcRPE2 presents a PTS1 glycosomal targeting signal (SHL) at the C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref062">62</xref>], the TcRPE1 amino acid sequence lacks conspicuous organelle targeting signals, suggesting a possible cytoplasmic fate. To reveal the localization of these proteins, both TcRPEs were cloned in the tetracycline-inducible expression vector pTcINDEX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref053">53</xref>] and expressed as recombinant HA-tagged proteins in CL Brener pLEW13 epimastigotes by means of an induction assay with tetracycline. Samples for Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis were taken 72 h after tetracycline induction. The TcRPE1 isoenzyme was HA-tagged at its N (HATcRPE1 line) or C-terminus (TcRPE1HA line), while TcRPE2 was only HA-tagged at its N-terminus (HATcRPE2 line) to prevent any effect on its PTS1 glycosomal targeting signal (SHL) at the C-terminus. As expected, episomal over-expression resulted in production of a ~30 kDa protein for all the lines, in good agreement with the predicted value for both TcRPEs (taking into account the added 9 amino acid residues from the HA tag), as detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). No differences on the over-expression were observed when all the transfected lines were compared by means of a semi-quantification analysis of the Western blot images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). For HATcRPE1 and TcRPE1HA lines, there was a considerable leak in the absence of tetracycline, but -given our goals-, this did not represent an obstacle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). After the heterologous expression of the different HA tagged constructions was confirmed, we proceeded to investigate the growth of the transfected epimastigotes <italic>in vitro</italic>. pLEW13 (control), HATcRPE1, TcRPE1HA and HATcRPE2 parasites were grown in BHT medium and monitored for 8 days until the stationary phase had been reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).

<p>Fluorescent microscopy analysis shows that TcRPE1 is mainly localized in the cytosol, regardless of where the HA tag is placed. Instead, TcRPE2 shows a particulate localization pattern, in agreement with the presence of the PTS1 signal at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). In addition, fluorescent confocal analysis shows co-localization between TcRPE2 and the glycosomal marker phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), suggesting that TcRPE2 is indeed a glycosomal enzyme. Moreover, this co-localization is lost when the same analysis is run with the HATcRPE2SHLxAAA mutant bearing the substitution of the SHL putative glycosomal targeting signal for AAA, showing that the subcellular localization of TcRPE2 is dependent on its targeting signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172405.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). The over-expression of HATcRPE2SHLxAAA did significantly enhance the parasite doubling time <italic>in vitro</italic> (3.21 ± 0.07 days, p&lt; 0.005 unpaired <italic>t</italic> test) compared with the pLEW13 control, even when its over-expression was lower than that observed for HATcRPE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172405.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). This phenomenon is in agreement with the observations made for <italic>T</italic>.<italic>brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref063">63</xref>] where the over-expression in bloodstream trypanosomes of the glycosomal enzyme PGKC (phosphoglycerate kinase C), lacking the final 5 amino acids which are responsible for glycosomal targeting, resulted in a toxic effect that causes cell death.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>At variance with all the other PPP enzymes from <italic>T</italic>.<italic>cruzi</italic>, TcRPE presents two isoenzymes sharing 53% identity with each other: TcRPE1 and TcRPE2. In this study, both isoenzymes were expressed as His-tagged recombinant proteins, which resulted functionally active for the interconversion of Ru5P into Xu5P. Despite high sequence similarity, TcRPE1 shows a very different specific activity: 80-100-fold greater than TcRPE2, and a strikingly different kinetic behavior. Whereas TcRPE2 shows a typical hyperbolic response to increasing concentrations of Ru5P, TcRPE1 shows a complex kinetic pattern, displaying a biphasic curve, suggesting the presence of -at least- two different kinetic components. This kinetic pattern is similar to the one previously reported for the malic enzyme II of <italic>T</italic>.<italic>cruzi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref064">64</xref>] and for anthranilate synthetase from <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref065">65</xref>], but it has never been reported for any of the enzymes of the PPP pathway in <italic>T</italic>.<italic>cruzi</italic>, <italic>T</italic>.<italic>brucei</italic>, <italic>Leishmania</italic> or other trypanosomatids. For the TcRPE1 isoenzyme, circumstantial evidence points to the null effect of divalent cations on its activity. However, a definitive answer to this point will require further analysis. In the case of RPEs from other sources for which crystallographic structures have been obtained, some of them present a divalent cation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref011">11</xref>] at the active site, whereas others do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>The tertiary structure for both TcRPEs was studied by a non-automatic homology modeling procedure that included control checkpoints along the modeling process, ultimately leading to the generation of very accurate structures. As expected for proteins sharing a high identity with each other (more than 40% according to established criteria), both TcRPEs constitute single domains exhibiting the classical α/β TIM-barrel fold, as shown for other enzymes with RPE activity. For both isoenzymes there is only one active site per monomer subunit. With regard to the architecture of the active site, we found that most of the important amino acid residues for catalysis and substrate binding are present in both isoenzymes, with the sole exception of M58 that is absent in the TcRPE2 active site. It is noteworthy that the triad of M residues (M58, M90, and M161) has been reported to participate in the stabilization of the reaction intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref016">16</xref>], and therefore the lack of one of them might affect catalysis. The superimposition of the binding pocket of both TcRPE1 and TcRPE2 models shows that catalytically essential amino acids adopt identical orientations in space (a residue specific RMSD &lt; 2Å for all of them), with the exception of S12 displaying a residue specific RMSD of 11.07 Å. Interestingly, this residue has been proposed to participate in the relay of charge in the enzyme-substrate binding complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref011">11</xref>]. The subtle differences mentioned above in regard to the organization of the active site might contribute to explain the striking difference in specific activity between the two isoenzymes, and the apparently considerably lower affinity of TcRPE2 for the substrate Ru5P.</p>
<p>An approach to the quaternary arrangement of these enzymes carried out by light scattering reveals a distinctive feature of TcRPEs. Both isoenzymes present a mixture of various oligomeric species made up of an even number of units, probably pointing to the dimer as the minimal entity capable of exerting catalysis. This multiplicity of oligomeric species has not been reported for any other RPE studied so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref014">14</xref>]. Suggestively, involvement of these oligomers in a dynamic equilibrium might be linked to the progressive loss of stability observed for TcRPE1 as the enzyme is diluted. Equilibrium perturbation by dilution of the equilibrium existing among different TcRPE1 oligomeric species might bring about a change in oligomeric composition and -consequently- in specific activity. Moreover, this feature might play a role in explaining the complex kinetic pattern observed for the TcRPE1 isoenzyme. In this scenario, TcRPE1 shows a maximum of enzymatic activity for large oligomeric species (119–160 kDa) whereas for TcRPE2 the maximal activity is centered around the dimeric form (61.5 kDa). This fact might help explain why increased complexity in oligomeric composition in the case of TcRPE1 might find a correlate with increased complexity in the kinetic pattern. Although further investigation will be necessary to unravel the physiological significance of these findings, this trait differentiates TcRPEs from RPEs from all the other sources studied so far and it might bear implications for the regulation of TcRPE activity. Different cellular conditions could promote a change in TcRPEs oligomeric composition, allowing the regulation of these isoenzymes under different physiological circumstances, in a fashion similar to that reported for the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase of <italic>T</italic>.<italic>brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref066">66</xref>], another enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway.</p>
<p>Regarding the subcellular compartmentalization of TcRPEs we found that in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> epimastigotes, whereas TcRPE1 adopts a cytosolic location, TcRPE2 shows a perfect co-localization with the glycosomal marker PEPCK, pointing to the effective migration of this protein to glycosomes, as expected from its PTS1 C-terminal signal. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of TcRPE2 is absolutely dependent on the presence of its targeting signal, since the over-expression of a truncated mutant -HATcRPE2SHLxAAA- lacking the putative glycosomal targeting signal, not only remains in the cytosol, but also negatively affects parasite growth, extending its doubling time <italic>in vitro</italic>. Collectively, this evidence points to the physiological importance of TcRPE2 compartmentalization, as has been previously shown for the case of phosphoglycerate kinase C from <italic>T</italic>.<italic>brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref063">63</xref>]. On the other hand, the over-expression of HATcRPE1 and TcRPE1HA shortens the epimastigotes doubling time <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas the over-expression of HATcRPE2 does not significantly alter the parasite growth curve measured under normal conditions. The positive effect in epimastigotes growth as a consequence of TcRPE1 over-expression might be attributed to an increased metabolic flux towards the non-oxidative branch of the PPP generated by TcRPE1 over-expression, enabling a better satisfaction of nucleotide biosynthesis requirements for cell proliferation, through the incremental production of ribose 5-phosphate.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, TcRPE2 is the first reported PPP isoenzyme that is exclusively localized in glycosomes in <italic>T</italic>.<italic>cruzi</italic> epimastigotes, where most of PPP enzymes share only a minor glycosomal component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref019">19</xref>]. For <italic>T</italic>.<italic>brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref068">68</xref>] and <italic>Leishmania spp</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref070">70</xref>] only a partial glycosomal component for some of the PPP enzymes has been previously reported.</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings on the kinetics, structure and localization of both TcRPEs from <italic>T</italic>.<italic>cruzi</italic> CL Brener clone describe striking differences between both isoenzymes. The very unique features of these enzymes might add a further regulation layer of importance for the physiology of the parasite, specifically for the physiological role of the PPP in the cytosol and the glycosome. However, there is, so far as we know, no information about the role of the pathway in these two locations in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>. The enzymes of the PPP are encoded in the genomes of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> and <italic>Leishmania spp</italic>, and all of them are expressed in all parasite stages, both in the mammalian host and in the insect vector, with one notorious exception: RPE and TKT are not expressed in the bloodstream trypomastigotes of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref071">71</xref>] reviews the information on the PPP enzymes in the three trypanosomatids, and the possibility that some of them might become targets for chemotherapy. The oxidative branch of the PPP has been shown to be functional in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> epimastigotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref019">19</xref>] and in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>mexicana</italic> promastigotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref035">35</xref>], and most probably is also functional in all the other parasite stages, as well as in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, since it is essential for the generation of NADPH, required both to protect the parasites against oxidative stress and for biosynthetic processes, and also to provide ribose 5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis. It is remarkable that, although the non-oxidative branch cannot be operative in bloodstream trypomastigotes of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, ribose phosphate isomerase is present, and has been recently shown, by RNAi experiments, to be required for growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and for the bloodstream forms infectivity in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172405.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Further studies will be required to assess the functionality of the whole non-oxidative branch of the PPP in Trypanosomatids. In the case of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>, the evaluation of the essentiality of the different enzymes will be difficult to determine, since it lacks the RNAi gene silencing mechanism, and gene knockout is difficult in this parasite.</p>
