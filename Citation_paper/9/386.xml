<abstract>
<p>This study describes the species diversity of fishes of the Narmada River in India. A total of 820 fish specimens were collected from 17 sampling locations across the whole river basin. Fish were taxonomically classified into one of 90 possible species based on morphological characters, and then DNA barcoding was employed using COI gene sequences as a supplemental identification method. A total of 314 different COI sequences were generated, and specimens were confirmed to belong to 85 species representing 63 genera, 34 families and 10 orders. Findings of this study include the identification of five putative cryptic or sibling species and 43 species not previously known from the Narmada River basin. Five species are endemic to India and three are introduced species that had not been previously reported to occur in the Narmada River. Conversely, 43 species previously reported to occur in the Narmada were not found. Genetic diversity and distance values were generated for all of the species within genera, families and orders using Kimura’s 2 parameter distance model followed by the construction of a Neighbor Joining tree. High resolution clusters generated in NJ trees aided the groupings of species corresponding to their genera and families which are in confirmation to the values generated by Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery bioinformatics platform. This aided to decide a threshold value for the discrimination of species boundary from the Narmada River. This study provides an important validation of the use of DNA barcode sequences for monitoring species diversity and changes within complex ecosystems such as the Narmada River.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many questions in evolutionary biology, ecology, conservation biology, and biogeography depend on knowledge of species as a biological unit. This makes it essential to critically evaluate methods for determining both the identification of species and species boundaries. Also, in practice, many conservation programs do not adequately address issues relating to intraspecific diversity, in part because of the difficulty in discriminating such variation through morphological analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Laikre1">[1]</xref>. Increasingly, however, both genetic and DNA based tools are making it possible to obtain more detailed and accurate assessments of biodiversity levels both within and between species and to resolve cryptic species complexes. This information will also be essential for identifying conservation units within species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Bickford1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Valentini1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>The natural ecology of many river systems makes them an ideal setting for biodiversity studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Khedkar1">[4]</xref>. Also from an ecological perspective, many of the world’s major rivers are under pressure due to human activities. Asian rivers, in particular those in India, have been heavily impacted in this way. In addition, the impact of climate change and increasing human population density have led to urgent calls for comprehensive biodiversity assessments to provide baseline data on species distributions.</p>
<p>Rivers in India are known to harbor a very diverse fauna. This includes 868 species of freshwater fishes. Of these, 192 are endemic species and 327 species are listed as threatened by the IUCN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Lakra1">[5]</xref>. This diversity of fishes reflects in part the presence of great riverine systems such as the Narmada, the third longest river in India. Studies on the fish fauna of the Narmada River basin have been conducted by researchers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Dubey1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Rao1">[8]</xref> and by government agencies (CIFRI) during the years 1985 to 1991 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-CIFRI1">[9]</xref> using traditional methods of identification based on morphological traits. The first published checklist of fish species by the CICFRI unit from Hoshangabad (1958–66) contained 77 species and the second, conducted by the department of fisheries, Madhya Pradesh, India (1967–71), recorded 46 species. Other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Dubey1">[6]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Doria1">[7]</xref> recorded totals of 76 species, and a third survey of the Western zone of Narmada fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Rao1">[8]</xref> reported 84 species. Finally, the CICFRI Barrackpore (1991) desk report of the Narmada River listed 95 fish species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Singh1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, species identification using these methods can result in misidentification due to high degree of phenotypic plasticity in such characters leading to enlist different species and fluctuations in species numbers. In these cases, alternative tools such as genetic and DNA based markers could help taxonomists to resolve ambiguities to a great extent.</p>
<p>One of these methods, DNA barcoding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Ratnasingham1">[11]</xref>, relies on the sequencing and comparison of a standardized portion of the genome to aid in specimen identification and species discovery. The DNA barcoding method now represents the largest effort to catalogue biodiversity using molecular approaches. Although initially regarded as controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Rubinoff1">[12]</xref>, numerous cases have been reported where the analysis of DNA sequence variation in the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase subunit 1 (COI) region of mtDNA has proven highly effective for the delineation and identification of animal species in general (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Hebert1">[13]</xref> for a review) and fish in particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Teletchea1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Some of the controversies reflect the fact that early barcode studies often examined only a few individuals of each species and were limited in terms of geographic representation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Funk1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Wiemers1">[17]</xref>. Although this approach did extend the inclusion of species in databases, it often left gaps in understanding the extent of regional variation in barcode sequences within species, and deciding species boundary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Fregin1">[18]</xref>. In addition, phylogeographic studies have shown that past geological and climatic events have resulted in population differentiation for freshwater organisms such as fishes because of their limited dispersal ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Fausch1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Avise1">[20]</xref>. Thus, sampling schemes and reference databases must account for these phenomena to permit reliable delineation of species or major lineages. In such situations, new tools such as Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) algorithm have been developed to allow the partitioning of DNA sequence dataset into clusters of like taxa, i.e. candidate or ‘primary’ species by utilizing a range of potential barcode gap thresholds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Puillandre1">[21]</xref>. This approach has been applied to the analysis of specimens from widely dispersed locales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Bergsten1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Paz1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>This study aims to first develop a comprehensive DNA barcode library for the fish fauna of the Narmada River. This can improve the quality of future monitoring programs by linking barcode sequences with carefully identified voucher specimens. This study will also provide a better understanding of the genetic variation in fish fauna and the impact of ecological aspects of the river to provide baseline information for creating improved conservation strategies for the Narmada River ecosystem. Furthermore, the information should be more readily available to non- taxonomists, researchers and policy makers to aid in their efforts to establish effective management of this ecosystem.</p>

<title>Sample collection</title>
<p>This study examines fish species within the portion of the Narmada River basin that lies between Vindya and Satpura ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101460-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0101460-t001">Table 1</xref>). The River has its source near Amarkantak (22°40′0″N to 81°45′0″E) in Madhya Pradesh, and travels 1312 km before it discharges into the Gulf of Cambay in the Arabian Sea (21°39′3.77″N to 72°48′42.8″E). The River is comparatively straight with deep water and hard rocky substrate supporting a rich benthic fauna. Fishes were collected between July 2009 to December 2012 at 17 sites along the main river and its tributaries with ∼100–200 km distance between successive stations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101460-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101460.s001">Table S1</xref>).

<p>Sequence alignment and assembly was carried out using Codon code Aligner v.3.0.1 (CodonCode Corporation) and MEGA 5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Tamura1">[24]</xref>. Sequence divergence values within and among species were employed the Kimura two parameter (K2P) model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Kimura1">[25]</xref> using analytical functions on BOLD v3.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.boldsystems.org" xlink:type="simple">www.boldsystems.org</ext-link>). A neighbor joining (NJ) tree based on K2P distance, nearest neighbor analysis (NN), and nucleotide composition values were also obtained using BOLD. The analysis of genetic distances was complemented by downloading of related sequences from GenBank for comparison with specimens of <italic>Labeo dyocheilus, Puntius sarana, Liza subviridis, Nematalosa japonica and Mystus spp</italic>. These species have deep divergence values that can lead to puzzling identifications. In these and other cases, we have used the ABGD (automated barcode gap discovery) interface web tool available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/abgd/abgdweb.html" xlink:type="simple">http://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/abgd/abgdweb.html</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Puillandre1">[21]</xref>.

<p>A total of 820 fishes belonging to 90 species, 63 genera, and 34 families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101460.s003">Table S3</xref>) were collected at the 17 sites. We generated a total of 314 COI sequences for 83 species (attempts to extract good quality DNA from two species were not successful and did not produce barcodes).

<p>All amplified sequences were &gt;500 bp (mean, 625 bp) with no insertions, deletions, stop codons and NUMTs. The overall GC content was 45.04% (SE = 0.18) and highest in perches (46.27%; SE = 0.02), followed by cyprinids (44.85%; SE = 0.01) and catfishes (44.27%; SE = 0.02). The mean GC content at codon positions 1–3 was 56.74% (SE = 0.08), 42.9% (SE = 0.03) and 35.17% (SE = 0.29) respectively. Nearly all species exhibited unique barcode haplotypes or cohesive clusters of very closely related haplotypes, which permitted the differentiation of 94% (SE = 0.01) of species. All sequences were submitted to the BOLD project DBFN (<bold>dx.doi.org/10.5883/DS-NFDB</bold>). Four of these represent new records for NCBI Genebank and 12 species for BOLD Systems.</p>

<title>Pairwise distances and Automatic Barcoding Gap Discovery (ABGD)</title>
<p>The analysis using the ABGD tool with standard settings at first did not return any results. After lowering the X value (X = relative width of the barcoding gap) to 1.2, the ABGD analysis showed a clustering of the sequences into 8 molecularly defined operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) for the COI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101460-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Here, we used a prior intraspecific divergence value of (P = 0.0215, SE = 0.02) which is congruent with the primary species concept. The ABGD results were confirmed independently of the chosen model (Jukes-Cantor and Kimura) and were unaffected by changes of prior limits for intraspecific variation and threshold. The prior maximal distance of P = 0.0215; SE = 0.02 is sufficient to distinguish the fish species in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101460-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Here, the values below the threshold are treated as false positives since they split real species into two or more partitions. On the other hand greater values (&gt;P = 0.0215, SE = 0.02) are treated as false negatives since these drop the species to a no barcode gap. For example, at a prior maximal distance of P = 0.0215 the <italic>L. dussumier</italic> (NF236) results show congruence with the remaining individuals of this species, but when the prior maximal distance values is lowered (P = 1.29, SE = 0.02), it splits into separate partitions. Considering individual NF236 as a different species to genus Labeo when analyzed, the K2P distance values show a clear overlap between intraspecific (2.19%) and intrageneric (2%) divergences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0101460-t002">Table 2</xref>). This confirming that, individual (NF236) does not represent a species distinct from <italic>L. dussumier</italic>. This supports the robustness of barcode based delineation of fish species in this study as well as the appropriate use of threshold value.</p>

The conspecific divergence values between the sampling stations show a uniform distribution (≥0.01; SE = 0.01) while the sampling stations on tributaries had wide range of conspecific divergence values ranging from 0 to 0.16% (SE = 0.01). The divergence values within genera and family were higher at the Bharuch sampling station located at the mouth of river in the Gulf of Cambay (Lower stretch of the river). Congeneric divergence values within the rest of the sampling stations ranged from 8.98% (SE = 0.03) to 15.32% (SE = 0.04), while confamilial values ranged from 16.05% (SE = 0.02) to 17.31% (SE = 0.02). Overall, the upper and lower stretch of the river represent a wide range of divergence values at the genus and family level among the sampling stations located in this part of the Narmada compared to the lower stretch. The decline in the range of genetic divergences on the lower part of the river may be due to fragmentation of the habitat and effects of limiting the fish migration due to large dams such as the Sardar Sarovar and Indira Sagar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101460-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study represents the first molecular survey of diversity using COI barcode data of freshwater fishes for whole Narmada River system in India. This includes generation of COI barcodes for 83 fishes out of 85 samples (∼98%) and the inference of five putative new species based on genetic data. These new species represent almost 6% of the known fish diversity of the Narmada. Using these sequences, we showed that the average conspecific K2P genetic divergence was 0.36% (SE = 0.008). This increased to 12.29% (SE = 0.06) at the congeneric level, 17.87% (SE = 0.02) at the confamilial levels and finally to 22.43% (SE = 0.02) within the order (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0101460-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101460-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The increase in the levels of genetic divergence observed here with increasing taxonomic levels and can be compared with the ranges obtained in other studies of Indian freshwater fish (1.6%, 7.16%, 16.66% and 25.32% respectively) as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Chakraborty1">[27]</xref>, and for Carangid fishes from the Kakinada coast (0.78%, 17.2%, 24.18% and 25.97% respectively) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Persis1">[28]</xref>, Indian marine fishes (0.30%, 6.06%, 9.91% and 16% respectively) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Lakra2">[29]</xref>, and Canadian freshwater fishes (0.27%, 8.37%,15.38% and 20.06% respectively) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Hubert1">[30]</xref>. We also observed a ∼40-fold greater level of divergence among congeneric species relative to that of conspecific individuals as compared to an 18 fold increase observed in other studies of Indian freshwater fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Chakraborty1">[27]</xref>. In addition, in our study we observed that the divergence pattern (K2P) varies along the river basin scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101460-g007">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that for a particular taxonomic group, studies of a complete habitat may bring clearer insights for interpreting such inter and intraspecific divergence values.</p>
<p>In these and other previous studies, considerable effort has been applied to the use of DNA barcoding alone for delineating species boundaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Rubinoff1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Hebert1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-April1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Meier1">[33]</xref>. Attempts have also been made to establish a standard limit between intra- and inter-species divergence (e.g. 3% of divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Smith1">[34]</xref> or the 10x rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Hebert2">[35]</xref>). However, these could not be generalized to many groups of organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Fergusson1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Gmez1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Meier1">[33]</xref>. Furthermore, as shown in these studies, intra- and interspecific distances frequently overlap, and visually defining a threshold becomes difficult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Meyer1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Wiemers1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Elias1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Smith2">[41]</xref>. Also it has been recognized for some time that for cases where there is variation in the mutation rate among genes and species, the use of sequence divergence estimation alone for phylogenetic reconstructions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Aquilino1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Johns1">[44]</xref> has considerable limitations, and this may further hinder the use of the DNA barcoding for cataloguing species diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Stoeckle1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Smith3">[47]</xref>. Furthermore, because the data obtained from the COI gene is known to possibly be affected by several biases, ideally it should be combined with the analysis not only of other independent genes, but also with other information such as morphological, geographical or ecological data to clearly delimit species in an integrative framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Will1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Yeates1">[58]</xref>. Here we show how barcoding results, combined with the use of the ABGD tool, may act as an independent method for delineating species and boundaries.</p>
<p>In our study 83 species were correctly identified without any overlap for intra and interspecific distances. The data we obtained also showed clear clusters in the NJ tree with sufficient bootstrap support to represent true species. In the case of <italic>Labeo dyochelius</italic> and <italic>Puntius sarana,</italic> the conspecific divergence values were 2.98% and 2.19 respectively, but here the average values are much lower than the 10x threshold of average K2P divergence for congeneric species that has been suggested by Hebert et al. to be able to delimit species using barcode data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Hebert2">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of “barcoded” fishes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Ward1">[59]</xref> noted that about 17% of the genetic divergence values among congeneric species were less than the 3% value. They also suggest that if the unknown specimen is more than 2% divergent from a known species, it is very likely that this is a different species (probability greater than 95%). Additionally, hidden diversity and overlooked species have often been detected in various situations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Lakra2">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Hubert1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Ward1">[59]</xref>. In summary, it is clear that the threshold limit proposed by Hebert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Hebert2">[35]</xref> as an indicator of cryptic speciation should be carefully considered for each group. For example, from our data five taxa (<italic>Labeo doychelius, Puntius sarana, Liza spp., Nematolosa spp</italic> and <italic>Mystus spp.)</italic> showed slightly higher divergence values (&gt;2%), but using the ABGD online tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Puillandre1">[21]</xref> based on a threshold of P = 0.0237 (SE = 0.02), the previously unclear species relationships are nicely partitioned here. This further implies that these previously described “cryptic species” may be evolving independently and radiating from an ancestral population in this river. As in other cases, however, the number of representative sequences in the dataset here was small and may need to be reassessed after collection of additional data.</p>
<p>Overall, when we used our barcode data and the ABGD algorithm with an optimal threshold value to infer any barcode “gap” and to partition the data set to discriminate between all 83 species, groups were formed that corresponded well with those based on morphological species identification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101460-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In the use of this algorithm, lowering of the threshold value may cause the splitting of known species into multiple groups, and conversely, increasing this value can completely eliminate any barcode gap. For the taxa from the Narmada River, threshold values lower than P = 0.0237 may create false positives while values greater than P = 0.0237 appear to be false negatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101460-g005">Figure 5</xref>). From this it is clear that the use of barcode based analyses, combined with the use of the ABGD tool, can be used to accurately identify and demarcate species boundaries and to assign unknown individuals to known species.</p>
<p>In our study we initially classified up to 90 species of the Narmada fishes based on morphological characters. These were cross verified by DNA barcoding and analysis using the ABGD tool, and this reduced the species number to 83. We were not able to generate barcodes for two morphological described species (<italic>Parachaeturichthys ocellatus</italic> and <italic>Terapon jarbua</italic>), despite numerous attempts using multiple samples. Of the species we recorded, a number had already reported (43 in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Dubey1">[6]</xref> and 30 in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Arya1">[26]</xref>). Therefore, 43 species we recorded had previously not been documented in this river. These species, along with those reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Arya1">[26]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Dubey1">[6]</xref>, account for 16% of total diversity of freshwater fishes in India <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Gleick1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Kottelat1">[61]</xref>.</p>
<p>The limited numbers reported in some of these studies may be due to taxonomic ambiguities based on morphological identifications. Also, out of the three species (<italic>Tor tor, T. putitora, T. khudree</italic>) listed as endagered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101460-Arya1">[26]</xref>, we could identify only one, <italic>Tor tor</italic>, in our study. This suggests the possibility of one or more of them being extinct or close to exintiction, although inadequate sampling cannot be ruled out. However, two species listed as threatened (<italic>Notopterus notopterus, Labeo fimbratus</italic>) in the same study were found in abundance in our study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101460.s004">Table S4</xref> and Figure2).</p>
<p>Our study confirms that employing COI barcoding can help in the identification of the majority of fish species in diverse river systems. Increasing use of DNA barcoding can overcome the limitations of morphology based identifications and help identify previously unidentified species by documenting the diversity of COI sequences within currently recognized species. In these cases the identification of taxa may be aided by the partitioning possible through the use of the ABGD online tool to decide on threshold values for identification of putative new species. This use of molecular data should be complementary to morphological analsysis in such endeavours, and the establishment of reliable global COI barcode databases for fishes will help to be able to accurately identify any fish at any stage of the life cycle (such as eggs or larva) or even from small pieces of tissue. This will be a valuable tool in the hands of fisheries managers, ecologists and fish conservators.</p>
