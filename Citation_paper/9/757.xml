Behavioral research indicates four salient features of insightful problem solving: (i) mental impasse, followed by (ii) restructuring of the problem representation, which leads to (iii) a deeper understanding of the problem, and finally culminates in (iv) an “Aha!” feeling of suddenness and obviousness of the solution. However, until now no efforts have been made to investigate the neural mechanisms of these constituent features of insight in a unified framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In an electroencephalographic study using verbal remote associate problems, we identified neural correlates of these four features of insightful problem solving. Hints were provided for unsolved problems or after mental impasse. Subjective ratings of the restructuring process and the feeling of suddenness were obtained on trial-by-trial basis. A negative correlation was found between these two ratings indicating that sudden insightful solutions, where restructuring is a key feature, involve automatic, subconscious recombination of information. Electroencephalogram signals were analyzed in the space×time×frequency domain with a nonparametric cluster randomization test. First, we found strong gamma band responses at parieto-occipital regions which we interpreted as (i) an adjustment of selective attention (leading to a mental impasse or to a correct solution depending on the gamma band power level) and (ii) encoding and retrieval processes for the emergence of spontaneous new solutions. Secondly, we observed an increased upper alpha band response in right temporal regions (suggesting active suppression of weakly activated solution relevant information) for initially unsuccessful trials that after hint presentation led to a correct solution. Finally, for trials with high restructuring, decreased alpha power (suggesting greater cortical excitation) was observed in right prefrontal area.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our results provide a first account of cognitive insight by dissociating its constituent components and potential neural correlates.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Supported by the JST.ERATO Shimojo Implicit Brain Function Project and OENB-Jubilaeumsfond Project (Nr. 11497) to JB.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Having a cognitive problem may be defined as the gap between where we are now (initial state) and where we want to be (goal state, solution), yet we do not know how to find a way to cross this gap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Hayes1">[1]</xref>. Often a problem is solved by proceeding along a continuous smooth solution path. For instance, algebraic problems usually involve a distinct but fixed number of sequential steps between initial state and goal state which form a smooth solution path. On the other hand, if there is a discontinuity in thinking or solution path <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Weisberg1">[2]</xref>, an insight or transformative thinking is needed, which primarily involves a mental restructuring that often leads to a subjective “Aha!”-an experience in which the problem solver becomes suddenly and unpredictably aware of the solution. There exist numerous anecdotes of such moments of insight, such as Archimedes' discovery of the law of buoyancy, Newton's finding of the law of gravitation or Kekulé's discovery of the ring structure of benzene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Horvitz1">[3]</xref>. Our intuitive understanding of this insight phenomenon or insightful problem solving seems to be quite distinct, but psychologists have not yet agreed upon a single definition of insight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Dominowski1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Duncker1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Wertheimer1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Csikszentmihalyi1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Mayer1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Ansburg1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Siegler1">[10]</xref>. However, there are general agreements that insightful problem solving can be characterized by four salient features as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><underline>Mental impasse:</underline> There is a high probability that the problem solver experiences an impasse in the process of solving the problem, wherein the solver is mentally stuck on an unsuitable construct of the problem and fails to progress further <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Schooler1">[11]</xref>. The mental impasse may be a force directing problem solving efforts and providing resistance to finding new interpretations of the problem that must be overcome or it may merely be a temporal blockage of information retrieval needed for reaching the goal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Dominowski1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Smith1">[12]</xref>. A number of researchers have reasoned that an excessive focus on inappropriate or irrelevant cues hinder the problem solver to recognize the possibly obvious solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Isaak1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Smith2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Gick1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Finke1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Lockhart1">[17]</xref>. The solution space constrained by the problem solver can also be prejudiced if a word or an object is used only in its most habitual usage and association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Duncker1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Mayer1">[8]</xref>. Due to this set effect and/or exhausting the available options and resources, the problem solver is likely to experience a mental impasse since she is unable to make further progress and subsequently she gives up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Gick2">[18]</xref>. From an information processing point of view, the system has reached a limiting point at mental impasse: any new possible options or interpretations from long-term memory are blocked from further processing within working memory. Attentional processes usually serve as a “general gatekeeper” for manipulating information within working memory by exerting top-down control over which information is the most relevant and may occupy the limited space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Awh1">[19]</xref>; thus, mental impasse may be caused by an “attentional overload”.</p></list-item><list-item><p><underline>Restructuring</underline>: This is a mechanism by which the problem solver breaks out of mental impasse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Ohlsson1">[20]</xref>. It is a transition from an initial inappropriate and thus misleading representation of a problem and state of not knowing how to proceed in solving a problem to a state of knowing how to solve it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Mayer1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Ansburg1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Siegler1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Mayer2">[21]</xref>. Restructuring is made possible either by internal retrieval processes which search long-term memory for concepts which can be utilized to reinterpret the available knowledge in the problem space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Ohlsson2">[22]</xref> or by the availability of external cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Gick1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Knoblich1">[23]</xref>. There is, however, an ongoing debate on the underling mechanisms of restructuring involved in insight problem solving, with different researchers proposing two oppositional processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Ash1">[24]</xref>. According to the first hypothesis, restructuring is a controlled, conscious and attention-intense process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Ohlsson2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Kaplan1">[25]</xref>, and the second hypothesis suggests an automatic and subconscious recombination where relevant pieces of information in long-term memory are automatically and subconsciously recombined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Ash1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Metcalfe1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Bowden1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Knoblich2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Seifert1">[29]</xref>.

However, only the post-solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Luo1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Luo2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Qiu1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Mai1">[42]</xref> or pre-problem presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Kounios1">[40]</xref> periods were investigated, rather than the actual process of problem solving, i.e. the pre-solution period. Thus from these studies no conclusion can be drawn about the neural processes underlying the solution pathway. One study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-JungBeeman1">[39]</xref> investigating the pre-solution period classified insight if the problem solver reported an “Aha!” experience with solution. But the other key features of insight such as restructuring and mental impasse were not addressed. The simple fact that a problem solver experiences an “Aha!” tells us little about the cognitive processes which brought about solution (and that experience). That is, if one does not obtain a fine-grained behavior pattern or thought progression as the problem solver solved the problem, then one can offer rather limited information about the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying insight.</p><p>So, there is a paucity of knowledge about the neural correlates of various features of cognitive insight phenomena analyzed in a unified framework. Therefore, the main aims and objectives of this study were to investigate the following questions related to the four salient features characterizing insightful problem solving: (1) Mental impasse: Can we find potential neural correlates, that reflect an “attentional overload”, which blocks further processing of new information from long-term memory, and the effort to search for available options and resources prior to mental impasse? Further, can any neural precursor to a successful break of functional fixedness on an unsuitable problem representation be detected? (2) Restructuring: What is a potential neural correlate of restructuring? Can we identify the brain responses which would support a controlled, conscious and attention-demanding process or rather an automatic, unconscious recombination mechanism? (3) Deeper understanding: Are there any differences in the EEG signals immediately prior to a correct versus a false positive “more appropriate” understanding of the solution? (4) Suddenness: Can the EEG results from Jung-Beeman and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-JungBeeman1">[39]</xref> be confirmed, who reported gamma activity at right temporal region beginning at 300 ms before the insightful solution? Are there any further characteristic neural signatures of the problem solver's feeling of suddenness and obviousness? (5) Finally, can we reveal any relationship between the process of restructuring and “Aha!”?</p><p>As stimuli, we used the compound remote associate problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Bowden2">[43]</xref>, where each problem consists of three test words (e.g., back, clip, wall) and the subject needs to generate a solution word (paper), which forms a valid compound word or phrase with each of the three test words (paperback, paperclip, wallpaper). These problems have been frequently used in studies on insight and creativity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-JungBeeman1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Kounios1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Bowden2">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Bowden3">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Bowden4">[45]</xref>. Though they are much simpler than the classical insight problems, they do share the key properties of these problems, thus calling for the involvement of similar cognitive processes in solving more complex and information-rich insight problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Bowden4">[45]</xref>. Further, there are also some specific advantages of using the compound remote associate problems since they (i) can be solved rapidly thus enabling the experimenter to record multi-trial data from a single session, (ii) can be solved without any domain-specific knowledge or expertise, and (iii) exist in a wide variety yet are structurally homogeneous. Finally, one can easily create hints, that again are all of the same structure and that may inform the subject at a meta-level that a reinterpretation of the problem is needed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Gick1">[15]</xref>. Behavioral data was obtained by registering ratings of the constituent features on a trial-by-trial basis.</p><p>The most relevant neural activities underlying complex cognitive processes including problem solving occur at the level of tens to hundreds of milliseconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Friston1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Mima1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Schack1">[48]</xref>. Modern imaging studies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are found to be very useful to localize brain functions, but at the cost of low temporal resolution, which is in the range of a few seconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Momjian1">[49]</xref>. Since insight and its constituent features are dynamic and short-lived in time, EEG seems perfectly suitable to address these questions due to its excellent millisecond range temporal resolution and still offers reasonable spatial resolution for signals in the cerebral cortex. Further, neuronal oscillations are aptly represented by the EEG signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Buzski1">[50]</xref> and it is widely documented that large scale brain oscillations in various frequency bands is modulated by a diverse range of tasks in human cognition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Kahana1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Klimesch1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Ward1">[53]</xref> for reviews). Thus, in order to address our objectives in a common framework and with systematic fashion, we conducted a multivariate EEG experiment in which human participants repeatedly solved verbal problems that could create a small scale experience of insight. EEG signals were extensively analyzed in the space×time×frequency domain with a multivariate nonparametric cluster randomization test.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Behavioral performance</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001459-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes the behavioral performance of the participants solving the compound remote associate tasks.

In the compound remote associate task the problem solver is not always able to retrieve all known words from long term memory within the allotted time period.

These results are consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated the critical role of the right hemisphere in overcoming fixation and finding non-obvious, non-dominant interpretations of words and information in insight problems, that at first glance seem merely remotely relevant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Bowden1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Fiore1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Beeman1">[72]</xref>. Specifically, Fiore and Schooler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Fiore1">[71]</xref> showed that hints to insight problems are more effective when presented to the left visual field (i.e. right hemisphere) than when presented to the right visual field (i.e. left hemisphere).</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated the preparatory and immediate post hint presentation phase of initial timeout trials (not involving a mental impasse) and found corroborating evidence to an interesting behavioral visual hemifield study by Beeman and Bowden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Beeman1">[72]</xref>. By adopting a similar compound remote associate task paradigm but with solution related priming, they found that the initial processing pertaining to the solution is active in both hemispheres but fades faster in the left hemisphere because of a fine semantic focus on a misleading interpretation of one of the test words, yet remains persistently active in the right hemisphere due to a broad semantic solution-relevant activation. However, this right hemispheric activation is not likely to reach the level of awareness because it is weak, diffuse and possibly suppressed by stronger, yet misleading, processing in the left hemisphere.</p><p>However, what is the neuronal correlate of this sustained suppression of the solution-related right hemisphere activation? Can we find any difference in the neuronal processes between solving attempts that successfully utilized the hint and those that could not? Interestingly, we found for timeout trials that would lead to a correct solution after hint presentation, a strong alpha ERS (10–12 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001459-g002">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). Increase in alpha activity is usually associated with a relaxed, less active brain, because alpha power was largest in states with eyes closed, i.e. states without focused attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Adrian1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Berger1">[74]</xref>.

The strong alpha ERS observed over right temporal area just before hint presentation indicates an inhibition of right temporal area, which has been associated with the integration of distantly related semantic or lexical information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-JungBeeman1">[39]</xref>. However, this inhibition is only needed when competing neuronal processes exist. We suggest that the alpha ERS may be related to a weak, unconscious processing of the solution in the right temporal area, consistent with previous research showing that a solution to a verbal problem can be weakly activated in the right hemisphere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Bowden1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Bowden3">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Bowers1">[78]</xref>. With the aid of the hint the initially weakly activated solution related information became intensified and reached the level of awareness. The alpha ERS effect was not found in timeout trials that failed to produce any solution; since no solution-relevant information was active at the first place, nothing had to be suppressed, and so the hint could not help to find the final solution.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Deeper Understanding</title><p>The gamma frequency band activity at parieto-occipital regions was stronger for correct (40–50 Hz) than for false positive solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001459-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Interestingly functional fixedness or mental impasse was also associated with increased gamma frequency band activity (40–48 Hz) at right parieto-occipital regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001459-g002">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). A hint presentation was less successful during stronger gamma frequency band activity (38–52 Hz) in parieto-occipital brain areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001459-g002">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). This may indicate that attentional processes (i.e. selective attention) are important to produce and identify a correct solution, but on the other hand excessive amount of selective attention could overload the information processing capabilities and cause impaired performance. Thus, this could explain (i) why the gamma band power of a mental impasse is still higher in comparison to timeout, which possibly reflects the problem solvers excessive focus on an inappropriate problem representation and thus “attentional overload”, which blocks further processing of selecting target words from verbal memory, leading to mental impasse, and (ii) why excessive attention during mental impasse prevents that an external hint can successfully be utilized by the problem solver. One could thus speculate that the degree of gamma band oscillations must remain at an optimal (i.e. sub-maximal) level to maximize the performance.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Restructuring of the Problem</title><p>In the present study the neural correlate of conscious restructuring (full vs. no) was mainly found in the alpha band (8–12 Hz) and in right prefrontal brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001459-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). This result is in line with earlier studies. In a large patient study, Miller and Tippett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Miller1">[79]</xref> demonstrated that patients with a focal right prefrontal cortex lesion performed poorly while solving problems requiring some sort of restructuring. The prefrontal cortex is also crucially involved in planning in open-ended tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Burgess1">[80]</xref>. Further, in a single-case study, Goel and Grafman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Goel1">[81]</xref> demonstrated that a right prefrontal cortex lesion severely impairs the capability to generate solutions for ill-constrained problems and also the capability to restructure or break the mental fixedness.

Altogether the present results strengthen the critical role of right prefrontal cortex in conscious restructuring.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Suddenness of the Solution</title><p>A number of studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Metcalfe2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Bowden4">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Davidson1">[84]</xref> assumed Aha!, the feeling of sudden emergence of the solution, as a hallmark of an insight. The present results indicate the neuronal correlate of suddenness (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001459-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) at parieto-occipital areas in the gamma (38–44 Hz) frequency band from −1.5 to −1 s and from −0.75 to 0 s before solution response. Earlier with similar compound remote associate task paradigm, Jung-Beeman and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-JungBeeman1">[39]</xref> found (i) higher gamma band activity (center frequency ( <italic>f<sub>c</sub></italic>) at 39 Hz) at right superior temporal electrode T8 (and surrounding electrodes) from −300 to −20 ms before solution and (ii) increased alpha band activity (<italic>f<sub>c</sub></italic> = 9.8 Hz) over right parietal-occipital electrode PO8 from −1.31 to −0.56 s. In the present study we also found a strong gamma effect albeit at more posterior regions but no alpha effect. We suggest that there are two primary reasons for these differences. Firstly, we modified the two-alternative forced choice between “Aha!” and no-“Aha!” of Jung-Beeman and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-JungBeeman1">[39]</xref> to a 4-point scale rating of suddenness and only compared the solutions with extreme values (i.e. rating of suddenness = 0 versus 3). Thus the results in this study reflect a neural correlate of suddenness, whereas, Jung-Beeman and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-JungBeeman1">[39]</xref> investigated the “Aha!” feeling. Secondly, we have used different data pre-processing techniques: raw power values were used in Jung-Beeman and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-JungBeeman1">[39]</xref> whereas baseline normalized values were used in this study.</p><p>We suggest that the observed gamma effect in the right-hemisphere just before the response reflects retrieval processes when the problem solver successfully retrieves a new solution word. Gamma (and also theta) frequency band activation in right parieto-occipital regions has earlier been associated with retrieval processes from long-term declarative memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Osipova1">[85]</xref> and gamma oscillations in general have been related to memory match and utilization processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Herrmann1">[86]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Relationship between Restructuring of the Problem and Suddenness of the Solution</title><p>Another interesting issue is the relationship between the restructuring and suddenness of the solution. Behaviorally the problem solvers reported for more than half (55.6%) of the solutions without hint a simultaneous high feeling of suddenness and low involvement of restructuring (chance level lies at 25%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001459-g001">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Actually, the subjective ratings of restructuring and suddenness are negatively correlated (ρ = −0.39). On the one hand, sudden emergence of the solution without any predictable forewarning leading to an “Aha!” is often considered the signature of an insight. On the other hand restructuring the problem in a new way by retrieving relevant but previously unattended information from memory which would eventually lead to a successful solution is considered a necessary component of insight. So how can these two key features of insight be negatively correlated? We have two hypotheses for this intriguing finding on post-hoc basis. The first states that the problem solver would classify a solution to a problem as sudden if the solution was immediately obvious after problem presentation; so restructuring would not be needed and short reaction times would bias the subjective ratings towards high feelings of suddenness. This account was supported by the large and positive linear effects of restructuring rating and negative linear effects of suddenness rating on reaction time. We observed indeed high ratings of suddenness and low involvement of restructuring for trials with shortest reaction times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001459-g001">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Alternatively, when a problem solver experienced a strong feeling of suddenness, the underlying metacognitive processes may be weak and likewise the capability to report about the prior restructuring since the solver was not consciously aware of the ongoing events. Metacognition is an active monitoring process of one's own knowledge and thoughts which is involved in problem solving such as assessing the difficulty of the problem, planning of strategies to approach solution, reviewing or evaluating one's progress, realizing an impasse, recognizing and building new mental representations of the problem or reconsidering one's own thoughts. The metacognitive process got even stronger after hint presentation, since the problem solver was informed on a meta-level that a more appropriate representation was needed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Gick1">[15]</xref>. The problem solvers were required to quickly grasp and process the hint to build a new mental representation and would eventually reconsider their own strategies. Actually, the present behavioral data did support this hypothesis. After hint presentation we observed for 84.3% of all correct solutions a high restructuring rating (≥2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001459-g001">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), indicating a strong conscious awareness of the ongoing restructuring processes. This explanation also predicts that the frequency of sudden solutions with hint should decrease because of the increased metacognitive processes that are involved after hint presentation. Behavioral results also supported this prediction as the ratings of restructuring and suddenness were uncorrelated for correct post-hint solutions and the rating of suddenness was uniformly distributed between the four possible ratings.</p><p>In summary, both of the hypotheses on the underlying mechanisms of restructuring may coexist and are not contradictory. Therefore, we can predict that solutions which evoke a strong feeling of suddenness involve minimal metacognitive processes and unconscious restructuring or better an automatic, subconscious recombination of information which stands in contrast to conscious restructuring which is an attention-demanding process involving executive control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this study we characterized data by the mean and SD, if data was normally distributed, and reported median and range otherwise.

The initial time limit for each problem was 45 s. The participants were asked to press the left mouse button as soon as they found the solution that they were relatively confident with, however, without mentally checking it. In case the subject experienced within this initial time period a mental impasse or mental block (which we described as “you feel that you cannot proceed” or “you just don't know what else to think of”), she/he pressed the right mouse button as soon as she/he reached this state. Then a clue or a hint appeared on the monitor. Hints disclosed only the first letter (e.g. ’p - - - -’) or uncovered 60 to 75% percent of the letters-always including the first letter (e.g. ’p - - e -’ or ’p a - - r’). The letters that were disclosed were randomized. Following hint presentation the subject had another 6 s to solve the problem. Hints were also provided for trials when the participants could not solve the problem within the allotted time of 45 s [termed as timeout trials].</p><p>After receiving solution, we first asked the subject to verbalize the solution and then to provide the following subjective ratings: (1) Rating of Restructuring: Restructuring is a type of event in which one comes to see the problem in a new way. We explained to the subject the following criteria for full restructuring of the problem (rating = 3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Ohlsson1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Fleck1">[87]</xref>: (i) “Elaboration”: one finds a new function of use for a word; (ii) “Re-encoding”: one rejects the use of a word and uses another meaning or application of that word which was not considered previously; (iii) “Constraint Relaxation”: one changes his/her problem representation. The subject rated the extent of restructuring involved in generating the solution on a scale from 0 (no restructuring) to 3 (full restructuring). (2) Rating of Suddenness: The participants were then asked to give a rating of suddenness of the emergence of the solutions on a scale from 0 (the solution appeared gradually as like “slowly dimming up a light bulb”) to 3 (the solution appeared abruptly without any conscious forewarning as like the “flashing of a light bulb”). (3) Rating of Confidence: Finally, we asked how confident the subject was of the solution. The rating of confidence ∈{0, 1, 2, 3} pictures the number of words that the subject is confident with that match with the solution word. In this study trials were only considered when the confidence rating was greater than or equal to 2, thus minimizing the trials that involved significant guessing.</p><p>As a control task, compound remote associate problems were presented together with a possible single solution word. The subject had to decide the correctness of the given solution. The time limit for this task was 7 s.</p><p>To minimize the required eye movements during each trial (i) participants had to fixate on a fixation cross in the middle of a monitor (Sony Multiscan G520) before initiating a trial by a left mouse button press, and (ii) compound remote associate problems were compactly presented in the middle of the screen with text size 20 and a 24 point line spacing. Trials began with the presentation of three dummy words (‘compound’, ‘compound’, ‘compound’) in place of the actual problem words. This initial pre-trial interval was randomly varied between 1 and 2.5 s. The order of the test words within each problem and the order of the problems within each experiment were randomized, as was the type of problem. Thus the same problem could be a usual compound remote associate task for one subject and a control task for another subject.</p><p>Prior to recording, the participants were familiarized with the whole procedure by 5 practice trials. In the actual experiment, the participants solved 100 compound remote associate problems and 33 control trials (of which 22 presented the correct solution word and 11 an incorrect solution). Breaks were provided if necessary and special attention was paid to monitor mental fatigue of the participants. The entire recording was limited to 2 hours for each subject including breaks.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Behavioral data analysis</title><p>Behavioral data was obtained by registering performance and ratings of the constituent features of insightful problem solving on a trial-by-trial basis. Two participants were excluded from further data analysis, because they solved only 50% and 54.5% of all control trials, where the incorrect solution should have been detected and rejected. Thus their data was not trustworthy. Additionally, one particular subject showed a peculiar profile of distribution of response times for mental impasse. This was mainly because this subject pressed the button indicating mental impasse too early (median time 17.3 (9.4–32.9) s) and too often (60% of its trials led to a mental impasse). Thus we excluded two thirds of the shortest mental impasse trials, because short response times and the great mental impasse frequency conjectured unseriousness or laziness of the subject in trying to think of all options to solve the problem. Furthermore, 10% of the shortest mental impasse trials of all participants were excluded-resulting in a cutoff of t = 19.3 s (also for the behavioral data analysis). Statistical testing of possible restructuring and suddenness interaction effects on reaction time, i.e. time to generate solution, was performed by utilizing a linear mixed-effects model [function <italic>lme</italic>() from package nlme in R] which was estimated by Restricted (or Residual) Maximum Likelihood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Laird1">[88]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Pinheiro1">[89]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Pinheiro2">[90]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Lindstrom1">[91]</xref>.

These changes have been called event-related synchronization (ERS) for higher task-related power or event-related desynchronization (ERD) for lower task-related power as compared to the baseline; ERS and ERD are due to an increase or a decrease, respectively, in local synchrony of the underlying neuronal populations oscillating in the same frequency band. For each condition, only those participants were included that produced at least two artifact-free trials. We calculated <italic>S<sub>%</sub>(t, f)</italic> for each condition and subject and then transformed ERS values in percentage to a ratio expressed in decibel by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001459.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>By this instantaneous differencing, the distribution of ERS values was rendered approximately Gaussian, which made the subsequent parametric t-tests on log-transformed differences valid and exact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Kiebel1">[100]</xref>. The subsequent statistical analysis was performed with mean <italic>S<sub>dB</sub></italic> values for time-windows spanning 200 ms for the time-locked (to hint presentation) comparisons and 500 ms for all other comparisons and two successive windows overlapped by half of the window length. Time-frequency data was also averaged within standard frequency bands as follows: theta (4–8 Hz), alpha1 (8–10 Hz), alpha2 (10–12 Hz), beta1 (12–20 Hz) and beta2 (20–30 Hz). For gamma band, the frequency boundaries were chosen on the basis of visual inspection of the averaged ERS values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Osipova1">[85]</xref>.</p><p>To avoid the multiple comparisons problem and to be able to effectively control the type I error rate, we used a nonparametric cluster randomization test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Osipova1">[85]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Tuladhar1">[101]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Nichols1">[102]</xref> for establishing the significance of the time-frequency power difference between any two compared conditions. For each time, frequency and electrode combination, paired two-sided t-test statistics were calculated. We only considered significant values in the subsequent analysis that were smaller than a pre-specified threshold of <italic>p</italic> = 0.01 (two-sided), or <italic>p</italic> = 0.05 if mentioned. Next we searched for both positive and negative t-statistic clusters in time, frequency and electrode space, where we considered electrodes with a distance of less than 7 cm as neighbors (yielding on average 6.8 neighbors per channel). This approach seems justified since neighboring electrodes record from overlapping neural sources. We assumed that a robust cluster should encompass at least 4 neighboring channels. In case the cluster was localized at the edge of the scalp, 3 neighboring channels within one cluster were presumed as sufficient. For each cluster we calculated the sum of the t-test statistics as the test statistic. Subsequently, Monte Carlo randomization was used to obtain a distribution function of the test statistics. Thus, the entire analysis (t-tests, thresholding, finding clusters, computing the test statistic) was repeated for each randomization, and maximum and minimum t-sum values were repetitively saved. The total number of randomizations was 1900, with which we accomplished that the coefficient of variation of the test statistic varied less than 10% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001459-Efron1">[103]</xref>. If this number exceeded the maximum possible number of permutations an exact permutation test was conducted (for <italic>N<sub>S</sub></italic>≤10). The significance <italic>P</italic> of an original cluster was estimated according to the proportion of the randomization null distribution exceeding the observed maximum/minimum t-sum test-statistics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0001459.s001" mimetype="application/rtf" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001459.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>List of used compound remote associate problems and their solvability in the study.
