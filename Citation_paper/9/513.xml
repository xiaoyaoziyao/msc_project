      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>There are probably close to 30 000 fish species worldwide, constituting about 50% of all vertebrate species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fishbase.org" xlink:type="simple">www.fishbase.org</ext-link>). They are systematically very diverse, ranging from ancient jawless species (Agnatha) to cartilaginous fishes (Chondrichthyes) and bony fish (Osteichthyes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Ward1">[1]</xref>. Cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, skates, and chimaeras) are the phylogenetically oldest group of living jawed vertebrates. They are an important out-group for understanding the evolution of bony vertebrates such as teleost fishes and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Venkatesh1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The identification of species constitutes the first basic step for biodiversity monitoring and conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Dayrat1">[3]</xref>. Fish species identification mainly relies on morphometric and meristic characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Strauss1">[4]</xref>. However, there are pitfalls in relying primarily on morphology when attempting to identify fishes during various stages of their development not considered in original treatments or when examining fragmentary, partial or processed remains. Even when intact adult specimens are available, the morphological characteristics used to discern species can be so subtle that identification is difficult even for trained taxonomists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Ward2">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been recently proposed that the use of DNA methods can circumvent such a problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Hebert1">[6]</xref>. The reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships based on molecular data in addition to the classical methodologies has helped to resolve taxonomic uncertainties for fishes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Hanel1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-delaHerran1">[9]</xref>. The rise in molecular biological techniques in marine forensic science has facilitated the development of accurate taxonomic identification of shark species by sampling biological tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Heist1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Holmes1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>DNA barcoding, i.e. the sequencing of a short standardized region of DNA, has been proposed as a new tool for animal species identification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Hebert2">[15]</xref>. The technique uses universal primers to amplify an approximately 650 bp-long region of the mitochondrial <italic>cytochrome c oxidase I</italic> (<italic>COI</italic>) gene. This region is sequenced to provide the DNA barcode for the specimen under study, and is compared to barcodes from reference specimens to obtain a species identification. Within-species variation for this gene is low compared with between-species variation. As a consequence, species are regularly delineated by a particular sequence or by a tight cluster of very similar sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Ward2">[5]</xref>. DNA barcoding has enabled discrimination of 98–99% of fish species examined to date, and its power to discriminate closely related species is largely attributable to the abundance of synonymous nucleotide changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Ward4">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Several studies have been done on the composition of shark species in different regions of the Mediterranean Sea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Renon1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Iglsias1">[19]</xref>. However, shark species composition in the Egyptian Mediterranean waters is still scarcely known. To our knowledge, the first study was done by Mazhar (1974), who studied the taxonomy and anatomy of the sharks and rays in the area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Mazhar1">[20]</xref>. Then, the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries in Alexandria revised the shark taxonomy of some shark families [Marine biological reference collection project (1978–1979)]. The most recent study in the area was by Hosny (1981), who studied the biological aspects of the Triakidae family and shark species composition off Alexandria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Hosny1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our investigation intended to provide an update on shark composition in the area since the latest study to date was performed 30 years ago. In addition to classical taxonomical methodologies, we used barcoding tools and initiated a new barcoding database concerning shark composition in the Egyptian Mediterranean waters.</p>

        <title>Ethics statement</title>
        <p>All experiments were carried out on dead shark specimens caught by local fishermen during fishing campaigns. Therefore, the local ethics committee deemed that approval was not necessary.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2b">
        <title>Specimens</title>
        <p>Fifty-one (51) shark specimens belonging to 6 families were collected from the commercial catch received in the two major fish markets in Alexandria, namely Abu Qir Fishing Centre and Ras-el-Tin Fishing Centre (Anfoushi). The fishing boats were operating in Alexandrian waters from longitude 29°40′E to 30°20′E, and the period of sample collection was from May to November 2008.</p>

        <title>Classical approach</title>
        <p>In order to identify and classify sharks using the traditional standard methods, we followed the recommendations proposed in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Compagno1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Froese1">[24]</xref>. Morphometric measurements were performed for each shark specimen and expressed as absolute values and ratio indices of total length (TL) or head length (HDL). Meristic measurements included gill slit count, dorsal fin number and spines (if found) and total number of vertebrae. However, only the following measurements are presented in this paper; Fork length (FL), Precaudal-fin length (PCL), Predorsal-fin length (PD), Prepectoral-fin length (PP1), Prepelvic-fin length (PP2), Preanal-fin length (PAL), Body depth (BD), Head length (HDL), Preorbital length (POB) and Eye diameter (ED).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2d">
        <title>Molecular approach</title>
        <p>Muscle tissue samples were dissected from shark specimens and were kept frozen at −80°C until DNA extraction experiments. Approximately 2 cm<sup>3</sup> of muscle tissue sample was sub-sampled for DNA extraction. For PCR amplification of mitochondrial <italic>COI</italic>, we used previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Ward1">[1]</xref> primers (Fish F1, Fish R1, Fish F2, Fish R2). Then, DNA was re-extracted from the gel using QIAEX (Qiagen, Germany), or PCR reaction products were purified using Agencourt® AM Pure® Protocol. The resulting DNA was then checked for its amount and purity using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop ND-1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Products were labeled using the Big Dye® Terminator v.1.1 Sequencing Kit (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, USA), and sequenced using an automated sequencer ABI 33130x1 (Applied Biosystems, HITACHI, Japan). Sequencing was performed in triplicate for each specimen (Test no. 1, 2 and 3).</p>
        <p>Various software was used to analyze sequences: Finch TV Version 1.4.0, Geospiza In.; BioEdit Sequence alignment Editor, Tom Hall, and MEGA5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Tamura1">[25]</xref>. All new data were deposited in GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/</ext-link>) and BOLD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.barcoding" xlink:type="simple">http://www.barcoding</ext-link>) databases.</p>
        <p>For subsequent procedures, a consensus sequence was determined for each specimen. Sequence divergence values within species, within genera, within orders and within classes were calculated using MEGA5 free software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Tamura1">[25]</xref>, where the Kimura 2 Parameters (K2P) model was chosen as distance model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Kimura1">[26]</xref>.</p>
        <p>A neighbor-joining (NJ) tree of K2P distance was constructed to provide a graphical representation of the patterning of divergence between the specimens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Saitou1">[27]</xref>. The NJ tree was then confirmed by bootstrapping to assign confidence levels to each branch in the tree.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Fifty-one (51) shark specimens were collected and studied using classical and molecular approaches. Difficulties in collecting samples were reflected in the low number of specimens under study. This is mainly due to the irregular supply of sharks in the fishing centres because of their low commercial value.</p>

        <p>Order Squaliformes, family Squalidae, genus <italic>Squalus</italic> was represented by <italic>Squalus acanthias</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027001.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The average of first best similarity for this species using BOLD identification engine was 99.74%. Only one specimen out of 8 could not be clearly identified at the species level with the BOLD engine and the suggested identifications were <italic>Squalus blainville</italic> or <italic>Squalus acanthias</italic>. In such cases, morphological analysis was helpful to confirm specimens as being <italic>Squalus acanthias</italic>. Divergence distance average within species (conspecific distance) was 0.35% (ranging from 0.00 to 0.53%).</p>
        <p>Within the same order Squaliformes, family Oxynotidae, genus <italic>Oxynotus</italic> was represented by one species (<italic>Oxynotus centrina</italic>) and only one specimen was collected from the eastern coast of Alexandria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027001.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). GenBank matching misidentified this sample, establishing a maximum identity of 92% with <italic>Centroscymnus coelolepis</italic>. However, the BOLD identification engine clearly determined this specimen as being <italic>Oxynotus centrina</italic> with 100% similarity (described as solid identification results).</p>
        <p>Order Squatiniformes, family Squatinidae, genus <italic>Squatina</italic> was represented by 3 specimens, belonging to <italic>Squatina squatina</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027001.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Captured specimens were collected from a commercial catch landed at Ras-el-Tin (western Alexandria). These specimens gave a maximum identity of 95.33% when matched with the GenBank database, and 99.38% using the BOLD identification engine. All results of this species were described by the BOLD engine as solid.</p>
        <p>Order Carcharhiniformes, family Scyliorhinidae, genus <italic>Scyliorhinus</italic> was represented by two species: <italic>Scyliorhinus canicula</italic> and <italic>Scyliorhinus stellaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027001.s001">Figure S1D</xref>, E). Specimens of both species were collected from the Ras-el-Tin fishing centre. GenBank matching appropriately identified <italic>S. canicula</italic> and <italic>S. stellaris with</italic> a maximum identity of 97.88% and 98.3% respectively. The BOLD engine gave a solid identification for all samples expected to belong to <italic>S. stellaris</italic>. In contrast, BOLD misidentified 6 out of the 22 specimens belonging to <italic>S. canicula</italic>. Conspecific distance within <italic>S. canicula</italic> showed a divergence distance of 0.34% while those belonging to <italic>S. stellaris</italic> showed a distance of 0.00%. Congeneric distance between <italic>S. canicula</italic> and <italic>S. stellaris</italic> was 7.83% (ranging from 7.67 to 8.07%).</p>
        <p>Within the same order Carcharhiniformes, family Triakidae, genus <italic>Mustelus</italic> was represented by <italic>Mustelus mustelus</italic> and <italic>Mustelus punctulatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027001.s001">Figure S1F</xref>, G). When matched with the GenBank database, specimens belonging to <italic>M. mustelus</italic> species gave 98.22% maximum identity on average. In contrast, specimens belonging to <italic>Mustelus punctulatus</italic> could not be identified at the species level with GenBank (average identity of 98.31% with <italic>Mustelus sp.</italic>). The BOLD engine confirmed the results of GenBank for the samples belonging to <italic>M. mustelus</italic> (average first best matching of 99.71%). Moreover, for the rest of the specimens belonging to genus <italic>Mustelus</italic>, BOLD gave first best similarity matches with <italic>M. punctulatus</italic>, with an average of 99.84%. Using divergence distance, we found that <italic>M. mustelus</italic> and <italic>M. punctulatus</italic> had a conspecific distance of 0.16% and 0.09% respectively. Congeneric distance between <italic>M. mustelus</italic> and <italic>M. punctulatus</italic> was 8.86%.</p>
        <p>Finally, within the same order Carcharhiniformes, family Carcharhinidae, genus <italic>Carcharhinus</italic> was represented by 2 specimens that were difficult to identify (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0027001.s001">Figure S1H</xref>). When matched in the Genbank database, both specimens showed a 99% maximum identity with <italic>Carcharhinus altimus</italic>, followed by <italic>Carcharhinus plumbeus</italic> with the same percentage. However, when matched using BOLD identification, both specimens gave <italic>C. plumbeus</italic> as first and second best similarities. In addition the BOLD database stated that species level identification could not be performed. As an alternative identification, BOLD suggested <italic>C. altimus</italic>. These two species are considered as highly related and therefore difficult to distinguish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Ward2">[5]</xref>. In order to identify these two specimens at the species level, we used the traditional morphological approaches which identified them both as <italic>C. altimus</italic>.</p>

        <title>III- Neighbor-Joining tree</title>
        <p>The Neighbor-Joining tree method is conceptually related to clustering, but without assuming a clock-like behavior. Although this study sought only to delaminate species boundaries, there is clearly a phylogenetic signal in the <italic>COI</italic> sequence data. In the resulting NJ tree, the major branches of the tree represent the Superorder Squalimorphi including the orders Squaliformes and Squatiniformes and the Superorder Galeomorphi including the order Carcharhiniformes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027001-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, each of the major clusters in the constructed K2P/NJ tree are composed of individuals from the same species.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>DNA barcoding is a novel system designed to provide rapid, accurate and automatable species identifications using short, standardized gene regions as internal species tags. This was achieved here, where molecular approaches confirmed classical morphological and biometric (morphometric and meristic) methods. The lack of stop codons is consistent with all amplified sequences being functional mitochondrial <italic>COI</italic> sequences. These sequences were about 667 bp in length, suggesting that nuclear DNA sequences originating from mtDNA sequences (NUMTs) were not sequenced (vertebrate NUMTs are typically smaller than 600 bp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Zhang1">[30]</xref>). Matching sequences with online databases has been considered to date as the simplest way to identify an unknown specimen. In the present study, the GenBank database was useful in giving reliable matching results, which were confirmed by our classical morphological and morphometric approaches. On the other hand, matching using the BOLD identification engine was specific, since it compares each sequence with that of the same gene region in the database.</p>
      <p>The Fish Barcode of Life Initiative (Fish-BOL; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fishbol.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.fishbol.org</ext-link>) is a concerted global effort to assemble a standardized reference sequence library for all fish species, i.e. one that is derived from voucher specimens with authoritative taxonomic identification. Many of the barcoded fish species uploaded concern marine fish from Australia and Asia, whereas in Europe 440 out of 2028 species had been barcoded until November 2010. Our study is the first to barcode sharks in the Egyptian Mediterranean waters. We used classical taxonomic approaches combined with molecular methods to barcode eight shark species and initiate a new barcoding database called the Barcoding of Egyptian Mediterranean Sharks [BEMS].</p>
      <p>The species <italic>Squalus acanthias</italic> has been used as a model for elasmobranch in some DNA sequencing studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Stock1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Salaneck1">[33]</xref>. Ward <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Ward1">[1]</xref>, used the DNA barcoding technique to study genetic differentiation among species of the genus <italic>Squalus</italic>, where the <italic>COI</italic> data clearly supported the biological evidence for <italic>Squalus acanthias</italic>.</p>
      <p><italic>Oxynotus centrina</italic> was represented by only one specimen, confirming a previous study mentioning the rarity of this species in the Mediterranean Sea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Kabasakal1">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, the <italic>Squatina squatina COI</italic> gene was used as mitochondrial marker in a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction study of 17 <italic>Squatina</italic> species, where the phylogenetic reconstructions were used to test biogeographic patterns. In addition, a molecular clock analysis was conducted to estimate the divergence times of the emerged clades. All analyses showed <italic>Squatina</italic> to be monophyletic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Stelbrink1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Scyliorhinus canicula</italic> and <italic>Scyliorhinus stellaris</italic> were clearly distinguished using molecular approaches. The main characteristics that were used to morphologically distinguish between these two related species were the distribution pattern of the colored spots on the skin, and the distinct shape of the anterior nasal flap.</p>
      <p>Concerning two other closely related species, <italic>M. punctulatus</italic> and <italic>M. mustelus</italic>, the presence of black spots on the skin is thought to be a distinct characteristic of <italic>M. punctulatus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Compagno1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Serena1">[23]</xref>. However, none of our specimens displayed it, but we noticed that the black bars at the margins of the dorsal fins could be used as a specific characteristic of <italic>M. punctulatus</italic>.</p>
      <p>Concerning the genus <italic>Carcharhinus</italic>, we had some difficulty in using matching engines to distinguish between the two closely related species <italic>C. altimus</italic> and <italic>C. plumbeus</italic>. The genus <italic>Carcharhinus</italic> comprises 30 species, 27 of which are barcoded, and some of these such as <italic>C. altimus</italic> and <italic>C. plumbeus</italic>, are known to be very closely related <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Ward2">[5]</xref>. This was confirmed by Heist and Gold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Heist1">[10]</xref>, who demonstrated that there is more substitution in the cytochrome-b of the mtDNA observed between Atlantic and Pacific specimens of <italic>C. plumbeus</italic> than between Atlantic specimens of <italic>C. plumbeus</italic> and <italic>C. altimus</italic>. In such instances, <italic>COI</italic> may not enable rigorous species discrimination so an additional marker with a higher rate of evolution might be required.</p>
      <p>Although identification trees based on <italic>COI</italic> sequence divergence are not primarily a phylogenetic tool, they do signal some deeper relationships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027001-Ward1">[1]</xref>. This was confirmed here since species in a genus and genera in a family generally formed cohesive clusters.</p>
      <p>In the present study, all clades including individuals belonging to the same species had a 100% bootstrap value. There was only one exception, specimen number 51, which was represented by 67% bootstrap. Such a low percentage might be due to the fact that the species was represented by only one specimen.</p>
      <p>This study is the starting point of a new barcoding database related to shark composition in the Egyptian Mediterranean waters (Barcoding of Egyptian Mediterranean Sharks [BEMS], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.boldsystems.org/views/projectlist.php?&amp;#%20Fish%20%28FishBOL%29" xlink:type="simple">http://www.boldsystems.org/views/projectlist.php?&amp;#%20Fish%20%28FishBOL%29</ext-link>). It can also be considered as an update of the shark composition list in the area since the latest study to date was performed 30 years ago. Thus, we barcoded and confirmed the presence of the following species: <italic>Squalus acanthias</italic>, <italic>Oxynotus centrina</italic>, <italic>Squatina squatina</italic>, <italic>Scyliorhinus canicula</italic>, <italic>Scyliorhinus stellaris</italic>, <italic>Mustelus mustelus</italic>, <italic>Mustelus punctulatus</italic>, and <italic>Carcharhinus altimus</italic>. Further insights on relationships will be obtained as taxa coverage expands. Future studies over a longer period of time and with more collected specimens are needed to fully describe the shark composition in this area.</p>
