<abstract>
<p>When exact values of model parameters in systems biology are not available from experiments, they need to be inferred so that the resulting simulation reproduces the experimentally known phenomena. For the purpose, Bayesian statistics with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a useful method. Biological experiments are often performed with cell population, and the results are represented by histograms. On another front, experiments sometimes indicate the existence of a specific bifurcation pattern. In this study, to deal with both type of such experimental results and information for parameter inference, we introduced functions to evaluate fitness to both type of experimental results, named quantitative and qualitative fitness measures respectively. We formulated Bayesian formula for those hybrid fitness measures (HFM), and implemented it to MCMC (MCMC-HFM). We tested MCMC-HFM first for a kinetic toy model with a positive feedback. Inferring kinetic parameters mainly related to the positive feedback, we found that MCMC-HFM reliably infer them with both qualitative and quantitative fitness measures. Then, we applied the MCMC-HFM to an apoptosis signal transduction network previously proposed. For kinetic parameters related to implicit positive feedbacks, which are important for bistability and irreversibility of the output, the MCMC-HFM reliably inferred these kinetic parameters. In particular, some kinetic parameters that have the experimental estimates were inferred without these data and the results were consistent with the experiments. Moreover, for some parameters, the mixed use of quantitative and qualitative fitness measures narrowed down the acceptable range of parameters. Taken together, our approach could reliably infer the kinetic parameters of the target systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In computational systems biology, mathematical models of gene regulatory networks or signal transduction networks are often represented by ordinary and partial differential equations. In these equations, there are kinetic parameters which characterize strengths of interactions or rates of biochemical reactions. However, all the values of kinetic parameters in the model are not always available from previous experiments and literatures. In these cases, unknown kinetic parameters need to be inferred so that the model simulation reproduces the known experimental phenomena. Parameter inference is very important for the mathematical modeling of biological phenomena, because it is known that network structures (network motifs) alone do not always determine the response or function of that network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Ingram1">[1]</xref>. To infer unknown parameters, there are various methods used in systems biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Ashyraliyev1">[2]</xref>. Evolutionary strategy is one of the methods for parameter inference by iterative computation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Whitley1">[3]</xref> and has already been used to estimate kinetic parameters of the mathematical models of metabolic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Moles1">[4]</xref>, circadian clock system of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Zeilinger1">[5]</xref> and mammal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Mirsky1">[6]</xref>. Simulated annealing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Kirkpatrick1">[7]</xref> is an optimization algorithm and has already been used for parameter estimation of a biochemical pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Mendes1">[8]</xref>. Although these methods are useful, they do not give us the information about credibility and uncertainty of unknown parameters with the distributions of unknown parameters.</p>
<p>In this respect, Bayesian statistics is a powerful method for parameter inference giving us the information about credibility and uncertainty of unknown parameters as a credible interval of posterior distribution. However, posterior distributions in Bayesian statistics are often difficult to obtain analytically. In these cases, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Metropolis1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Hastings1">[10]</xref> can be used to obtain samples from posterior distributions. In conventional MCMC, explicit evaluation of a likelihood function is needed to evaluate a posterior distribution. Otherwise, when the likelihood function is analytically or computationally intractable, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Beaumont1">[11]</xref> MCMC can be used. ABC-MCMC can evaluate posterior distribution without explicit evaluation of a likelihood function, but with simulation-based approximations in its algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Marjoram1">[12]</xref>. ABC was implemented not only in MCMC but also in sequential Monte Carlo methods (SMC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Sisson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Toni1">[14]</xref>. ABC-SMC has already been applied for parameter inference and model selection in systems biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Toni1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Barnes1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Biological experiments are often performed with cell population, and the results are represented by histograms. For example, delay time and switching time of caspase activation after TRAIL treatment in apoptosis signal transduction pathway were represented by histograms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Albeck1">[19]</xref>. Here, we call this kind of experimental result or data as a quantitative condition. On another front, experiments or observations sometimes indicate the existence of a specific bifurcation pattern. For example, experiments about RB-E2F pathway in cell cycle regulatory system and mitochondrial apoptosis signal transduction pathway indicate that those pathway work as bistable switches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Yao1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Sun1">[21]</xref>. Bistability indicates the existence of saddle-node bifurcation in mathematical modeling. Here, we call this kind of experimental result or data as a qualitative condition. In this study, to utilize those conditions for parameter inference, we introduce and call the functions which can evaluate the fitness to those conditions as quantitative and qualitative fitness measures respectively. Although conventional MCMC and ABC-MCMC evaluate posterior distribution with and without explicit evaluation of a likelihood function, respectively, none of these MCMC algorithms evaluate posterior distribution in the case that the experiments for parameter inference are a mixture of quantitative and qualitative conditions.</p>
<p>To overcome this problem, we formulated Bayesian formula for hybrid fitness measures (HFM) and implemented it to MCMC. We named the method MCMC-HFM which can deal with the mixture of qualitative and quantitative fitness measures. We first tested the MCMC-HFM to a kinetic toy model with a positive feedback. Starting with an assumed set of parameters that satisfies qualitative condition, we generated kinetic data with some noise. Using the generated data and qualitative condition, we tried to infer the kinetic parameters mainly related to the positive feedback. As the result, MCMC-HFM could reliably infer the kinetic parameters with use of both qualitative and quantitative fitness measures. Next, we applied the MCMC-HFM to a mathematical model of apoptosis signal transduction network, which was proposed before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Legewie1">[22]</xref>. We tried to infer the kinetic parameters which are especially related to the implicit positive feedback because it is known to be important for characteristic system properties such as bistability and irreversibility of output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Legewie1">[22]</xref>. As the result, MCMC-HFM could also reliably infer the kinetic parameters, especially those of which have experimental estimates without using these data and the results were consistent with experiments. We also examined 95% credible intervals of inferred parameter distributions, and tried to gain deeper understanding of the implicit positive feedback for bistability, irreversibility, and characteristic dynamics of output in the apoptosis model. This analysis allowed us to specify the important kinetic parameter and corresponding biochemical process for characteristic system properties. These results indicate that MCMC-HFM is a useful method for parameter inference and system analysis.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We explain the derivation of MCMC-HFM algorithm. In Bayesian statistics, under given a likelihood function P(x<sub>o</sub>|θ) and a prior distribution π(θ), a posterior distribution π(θ| x<sub>o</sub>) is represented as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Here, θ is parameters and x<sub>o</sub> is observed data. For computation of a posterior distribution, MCMC can be used and it generates samples from a posterior distribution. Conventional MCMC Metropolis-Hastings algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Metropolis1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Hastings1">[10]</xref> is as follows:</p>
<p>MCMC algorithm</p>
<p>MC1. Initialize θ<sub>i</sub> i = 0.</p>
<p>MC2. Propose a candidate value θ*∼q(θ|θ<sub>i</sub>) where q is a proposal distribution.</p>
<p>MC3. Set θ<sub>i+1</sub> = θ* with probability following α.<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>otherwise set θ<sub>i+1</sub> = θ<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p>MC4. If i&lt;N, increment i = i+1 and go to MC2.</p>
<p>MCMC algorithm is designed as the stationary distribution is consistent with the target posterior distribution π(θ|x<sub>o</sub>). As shown above, conventional MCMC needs explicit evaluation of a likelihood function P(x<sub>o</sub>|θ) to judge whether a candidate value θ* is acceptable or not in step MC3. Conventional MCMC can be used in the case that the deviation between the experimental time series data and the simulated time series data is evaluated by probability distributions. For example, Eydgahi et al. used Gaussian distribution to evaluate the deviation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Eydgahi1">[23]</xref>. They set the negative logarithm of the likelihood is correspondent to the chi-squared function which equals to the sum of squared differences between experimental data and simulated data at each time point. In contrast, ABC-MCMC evaluates a posterior distribution without explicit evaluation of a likelihood function, but with simulation-based approximations. Thus, ABC-MCMC is useful when the likelihood function is analytically or computationally intractable. ABC-MCMC algorithm is as follows:</p>
<p>ABC-MCMC algorithm</p>
<p>ABC1. Initialize θ<sub>i</sub> i = 0.</p>
<p>ABC2. Propose a candidate value θ*∼q(θ|θ<sub>i</sub>) where q is a proposal distribution.</p>
<p>ABC3. Simulate a data set x*∼P(x|θ*).</p>
<p>ABC4. Set θ<sub>i+1</sub> = θ* with probability following α.<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>otherwise set θ<sub>i+1</sub> = θ<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p>ABC5. If i&lt;N, increment i = i+1 and go to ABC2.</p>
<p>Here, I(C) is an indicator function which I(C) = 1 if a condition C is true, and 0 otherwise. ρ is a distance function and ε is a tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Marjoram1">[12]</xref>. In ABC-MCMC algorithm, likelihood ratio P(x<sub>o</sub>|θ*)/P(x<sub>o</sub>|θ<sub>i</sub>) is approximated to I(ρ(x<sub>o</sub>, x*)≤ε))/I(ρ(x<sub>o</sub>, x<sub>i</sub>)≤ε)). Thus, likelihood ratio is coarsely approximated by 1 if simulated data and observed data are sufficiently “close”, and 0 otherwise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Sisson1">[13]</xref>. ABC-MCMC can be used when an experimental data is a time series of protein concentration or gene expression level. The algorithm judges whether a simulated time series data with a model under θ is close enough to the experimental time series data or not. Toni et al. applied ABC-SMC algorithm for parameter inference of the repressilator model comparing time series data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Toni1">[14]</xref>. The idea and manner of ABC-MCMC, which judge the acceptance of parameters by all-or-none manner, might be intuitively applied when an experimental result support the existence of a specific phenomenon. In this case, unknown parameters are judged whether they reproduce the observed experimental phenomenon or not by all-or-none manner. An example is the case that an experimental result supports the existence of some specific bifurcation patterns such as saddle-node bifurcation or Hopf bifurcation in a mathematical model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Tyson1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Tyson3">[27]</xref>. In this case, existence of a specific bifurcation pattern is judged by all-or-none manner. However, both MCMC and ABC-MCMC algorithms cannot, at least in these forms, deal with a mixture of quantitative and qualitative conditions. Thus, extensions and heuristic assumptions of these algorithms are needed to overcome this problem.</p>
<p>For this purpose, firstly, we consider the case that we have qualitatively different experiment data obtained in the same system. When we want to obtain a posterior distribution of parameters θ by n qualitatively different experiments, X<sub>1</sub>,…,X<sub>n</sub>, the posterior distribution are represented as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Here, n indicates the number of different experiments. Likelihood P(X<sub>1</sub>,…,X<sub>n</sub>|θ) can be decomposed into a multiplication of conditional probabilities. In this manner, we can utilize a number of different experimental data. In this study, we want to use both quantitative condition i.e. experimental data represented by histogram and qualitative condition i.e. experimental data which indicate the existence of specific bifurcation pattern. Then, we utilize the above idea, a multiplication of conditional probabilities, and employ an assumption to deal with both quantitative and qualitative conditions. A posterior distribution conditioned by a multiple quantitative and qualitative conditions is assumed as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Here, we assumed and changed a likelihood term to a multiplication of a number of quantitative fitness measures (f<sub>quant</sub>) and qualitative fitness measures (f<sub>qual</sub>). In the equation, Z indicates a quantitative condition and C indicates qualitative condition. f<sub>quant</sub>(Z) is a quantitative fitness measure to a quantitative condition Z and f<sub>qual</sub>(C) is a qualitative fitness measure to a qualitative condition C. Rigorously speaking, fitness measures are not conditional probabilities. They are defined functions to evaluate the fitness of simulated data to experimental data. For a concrete evaluation of fitness, above equation is changed as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e006"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Here, quantitative fitness measures are changed to functions of z(θ). z is a concrete value calculated by numerical simulation under θ. Depending on a value of simulated z(θ), f<sub>quant</sub> compare it to the experimental data represented by a histogram and returns a specific value. In this setting, we set f<sub>quant</sub>(z (θ)) is the value of “Frequency” at the corresponding class in a histogram of experimentally observed z. Quantitative fitness measures are changed to functions of condition C. Depending on a satisfaction of a condition C under parameters θ, f<sub>qual</sub> returns a specific value. As a default, we assumed f<sub>qual</sub>(C) equals to I(C(θ)), indicator function. For example, when Hopf bifurcation is observed in numerical simulation under parameters θ, I(C(θ)) equals to 1, otherwise 0. In this example, a condition C equals to “existence of Hopf bifurcation”. We implemented this formula to the MCMC algorithm and then we could obtain MCMC-HFM algorithm as follows:</p>
<p>MCMC-HFM algorithm</p>
<p>HFM1. Initialize θ<sub>i</sub> i = 0.</p>
<p>HFM2. Propose a candidate value θ*∼q(θ|θ<sub>i</sub>) where q is a proposal distribution.</p>
<p>HFM3. Simulate whether C<sub>j</sub> (j = 1∼m) are satisfied or not under θ*.</p>
<p>HFM4. Set θ<sub>i+1</sub> = θ* with probability following α.<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e007"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Otherwise set θ<sub>i+1</sub> = θ<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p>HFM5. If i&lt;N, increment i = i+1 and go to HFM2.</p>
<p>MCMC-HFM algorithm is designed as the stationary distribution is consistent with the target distribution f<sub>quant</sub>(z<sub>n</sub>(θ))…f<sub>quant</sub>(z<sub>m+1</sub>(θ))I(C<sub>m</sub>(θ))…I(C<sub>1</sub>(θ))π(θ), with all qualitative conditions C<sub>1</sub>,…,C<sub>m</sub> are satisfied. This was demonstrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s018">Text S1</xref>. By MCMC-HFM, we can deal with mixture of quantitative and qualitative fitness measures. Actually, about qualitative fitness measures, assumption of fitness measure may not be needed by setting a prior distribution to a distribution which satisfies qualitative conditions. However, for clarity of our idea and method, we introduced qualitative fitness measures.</p>

<title>Flow of parameter inference</title>
<p>In this section, we explain the flow of parameter inference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g001">Figure 1</xref>) before detailed explanations. To show the efficiency of the use of hybrid fitness measures for parameter inference by MCMC-HFM, we applied the method to one test and one application. The test is done about a simple kinetic toy model and the application is done about an apoptosis signal transduction network.</p>

<p>In the test, we set the model and qualitative condition used for parameter inference by ourselves (box with dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, we prepared quantitative fitness measures f<sub>quant</sub>(z) by following procedures (dotted arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We set a vector of “true” parameters θ<sub>answer</sub> satisfying qualitative condition. Then we generated distribution of observables by simulating the toy model with some noise into the model. We set the distribution of observables to f<sub>quant</sub>(z). Given the toy model, assumed qualitative conditions, and a simulated quantitative fitness (box with bold line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we performed MCMC-HFM and obtained distributions of parameters used for inference (bold arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The inferred parameters are compared with the “true” parameters.</p>
<p>In the application, we employed the apoptosis model of Legewie et al. 's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Legewie1">[22]</xref>. Their model exhibits bistability and irreversibility, which we set as the qualitative conditions for parameter inference. As a quantitative fitness, we used the experimental data, instead of generation by simulations. Thus, in the application, we inferred distributions of parameters that fit with experiments by MCMC-HFM (flow from box with bold line to bold arrows).</p>

<title>Mathematical model of a kinetic toy model</title>
<p>As a test, we first applied MCMC-HFM to infer kinetic parameters of a simple kinetic toy model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This system contains only one variable “Y” that corresponds to a protein. In the model, the protein is synthesized by zero-order reaction, and degraded by first-order reaction. In addition, the protein can enhance its own expression, forming a positive feedback represented by a Hill function. The ordinary differential equation of the model is<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e008"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

<p>In the right hand side, the first term corresponds to synthesis of Y, the second term corresponds to degradation of Y, and the last term corresponds to the positive feedback. The synthesis rate constant, k<sub>s</sub>, is the input to the system. When other constants are set to the values θ<sub>answer</sub> = (k<sub>d</sub>,k<sub>p</sub>,K) = (1.0,1,0,0.5), and the Hill coefficient is set to n = 5, the concentration of Y (represented as [Y]) shows bistability and irreversibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Here, θ<sub>answer</sub> is the three dimensional vector of parameters. We note that we did not specifically define the unit of time, [Y] and parameters for simplicity. Those two features, bistability and irreversibility, were used as qualitative conditions for the parameter inference. In the application of MCMC-HFM to this model, we inferred the three constants, k<sub>d</sub>, k<sub>p</sub> and K. Here, the Hill coefficient was fixed to n = 5 for simplification of the problem.</p>

<p>To show the efficiency of the use of hybrid fitness measures, in addition to qualitative conditions i.e. bistability and irreversibility, we needed to prepare experimental results used as quantitative fitness measures. When the input is set to k<sub>s</sub> = 1.0 over a whole time-series simulation, [Y] is produced and reaches to the almost saturated level by time  = 10 with θ<sub>answer</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Based on this result, we decided to generate quantitative fitness measures i.e. histograms related to time series of Y production and amount of Y. In concrete terms, we decided to generate and use the data “execution time of Y production” and “concentration of Y at time  = 100” as quantitative fitness. The concrete definition of “execution time of Y” is that the time when [Y] reached the 90% of its maximum value in dynamics simulation or bifurcation analysis (“T<sub>e</sub>” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The concrete definition of “concentration of Y at time  = 100” is that the value of [Y] at time  = 100 in dynamics simulation. To generate histograms of these two observables from the kinetic toy model with the “true” parameters values θ<sub>answer</sub>, we performed simulations for 10000 times by adding Gaussian noise into the model. When mean and variance of Gaussian noise was set to 0 and 1 respectively, execution time and concentration of Y at time  = 100 showed variation as shown in histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2D and E</xref> respectively. In this case study, we used these histograms as quantitative fitness measures for parameter inference. This setting and usage of histograms for parameter inference will be reasonable because experiments often performed in cell population and their results are sometimes shown by histograms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Albeck1">[19]</xref>.</p>

<title>Application of MCMC-HFM to the kinetic toy model</title>
<p>For parameter inference, we used four types of information, “bistability of Y” abbreviated as “B”, irreversibility of Y abbreviated as “I”, execution time of Y abbreviated as “T<sub>e</sub>” and “concentration of Y at time  = 100” abbreviated as “[Y]<sub>time = 100</sub>”. For the application of MCMC-HFM, “B” and “I” are qualitative conditions. In contrast, “T<sub>e</sub>” and “[Y]<sub>time = 100</sub>” are quantitative conditions. Therefore, we assigned “B” as C<sub>1</sub>, “I” as C<sub>2</sub>, “T<sub>e</sub>” as Z<sub>3</sub>, and “[Y]<sub>time = 100</sub>” as Z<sub>4</sub> in MCMC-HFM algorithm (about the assignment to these symbols, see Methods section). Conditions C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> were judged by bifurcation analysis. The concrete definition of the condition C<sub>1</sub> is that, there are two stable steady states and one unstable steady state when k<sub>s</sub> = 0.2 (“ks<sub>0.2</sub>” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). There is one stable steady state when k<sub>s</sub> = 0.3 (“ks<sub>0.3</sub>” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). There is one stable steady state when k<sub>s</sub> = 1.0 (“ks<sub>1</sub>” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). When all of them are satisfied, f<sub>qual</sub>(C<sub>1</sub>) = I(C<sub>1</sub>(θ)) equals to 1, and 0 otherwise. Concrete definition of the condition C<sub>2</sub> is that, in addition of the condition C<sub>1</sub>, there are two stable steady states and one unstable steady state when k<sub>s</sub> = 0.0 (“ks<sub>0</sub>” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). When all of them are satisfied, f<sub>qual</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>) = I(C<sub>2</sub>(θ)) equals to 1, and 0 otherwise. In this case study, we used the histogram of “execution time of Y” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) as one quantitative fitness measure f<sub>quant</sub>(Z<sub>3</sub>) = f<sub>quant</sub>(z<sub>3</sub>(θ)), and the histogram of “concentration of Y at time = 100” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) as another quantitative fitness measure f<sub>quant</sub>(Z<sub>4</sub>) = f<sub>quant</sub>(z<sub>4</sub>(θ)). z<sub>3</sub>(θ) and z<sub>4</sub>(θ) were calculated by dynamics simulation under parameters θ. In this setting, f<sub>quant</sub>(z<sub>3</sub>(θ)) is the value of “Frequency” at the corresponding class of calculated z<sub>3</sub>(θ) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">figure 2D</xref>, and f<sub>quant</sub>(z<sub>4</sub>(θ)) is the value of “Frequency” at the corresponding class of calculated z<sub>4</sub>(θ) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">figure 2E</xref>. In bifurcation analysis, steady states concentrations of Y was calculated by solving the simultaneous equation obtained by setting the ordinary differential equation equals to zero with the standard Newton-Raphson method. Local stabilities of all the steady states were determined by evaluating eigenvalues of Jacobian matrices which were obtained by linearization of ordinary differential equation. In dynamics simulation, the ordinary differential equation was numerically solved by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a time step of 0.01. Total calculation time was 100 (10000 steps). Initial concentration of Y in dynamics calculation was set to [Y]<sub>time = 0</sub> = 0.</p>
<p>The prior distributions of parameters were set to follow the uniform distributions on a common logarithmic scale. Upper bound and lower bound were set to tenfold and one-tenth of the values of “true” parameter vector θ<sub>answer</sub> respectively. Uniform distribution of kinetic parameters on a logarithmic scale has been used in robustness analysis in systems biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Eiing1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the MCMC-HFM algorithm, the proposal distribution was set as the uniform distribution. Newly proposed parameter θ' is proposed by using unit random number “r” as follows.<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e009"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Here, θ is a vector consisting of common logarithm of kinetic parameters, and σ<sub>q</sub> was set to 0.5 in this case study. Perturbation of kinetic parameter on a logarithmic scale has also been used in robustness analysis in systems biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Zi1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>In each step of MCMC-HFM, one of kinetic parameters was randomly chosen and perturbed by the proposal distribution q(θ'|θ). We performed totally 3.3×10<sup>6</sup> Monte Carlo steps. The first 0.3×10<sup>6</sup> steps were thrown away as the so-called burn-in period. Of the remaining 3.0×10<sup>6</sup> steps, we recorded data every 3 steps, so that we collected totally 10<sup>6</sup> data points for the parameter inference. From them, we can draw discrete marginal probability distributions as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p>

<title>Parameter inference by posterior distribution for the kinetic toy model</title>
<p>To investigate the efficiency of the use of hybrid fitness, we conducted the parameter inference tests using different combination of fitness, comparing these results. First, we used only the both two types of the qualitative conditions, i.e., “BI”. Second, we used the two types of qualitative conditions and the one quantitative condition, “BIT<sub>e</sub>”. Third, we used “BI[Y]<sub>time = 100</sub>”. Lastly, we used all the four conditions, “BIT<sub>e</sub>[Y]<sub>time = 100</sub>”.</p>
<p>In the present MCMC simulations, we define the representative parameter values of inference by the values at the mode, the peak of each marginal distribution (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We also calculated 95% credible intervals of each inferred parameter. Upper bound and lower bound of 95% credible interval were defined as external regions of bounds contain 2.5% data respectively. The common logarithm of the ratio of upper bound and lower bound of 95% credible interval was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g004">Figure 4</xref>. A wider interval indicates lower credibility of the inferred value.</p>

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.g004" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>We first look into the parameter inference with “BI” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.A</xref> showed that MCMC-HFM with “BI” well inferred (red arrow) the “true” values (the red bar) in all three parameters. However, the distributions of parameters were very wide which indicates the credibility of parameter inference is very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In three parameters, k<sub>p</sub> favored relatively larger values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.A-b</xref>). This indicates that positive feedback needs to be strong to achieve bistability and irreversibility.</p>
<p>Next, we address the parameter inference with “BIT<sub>e</sub>” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.B</xref>). MCMC-HFM well inferred the “true” values of k<sub>d</sub> and K. The variability of k<sub>d</sub> and K clearly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.B-a, B-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g004">Figure 4</xref>), which indicates the credibility of k<sub>d</sub> and K inference get higher by the usage of quantitative condition, “T<sub>e</sub>”. However, MCMC-HFM could not well infer the “true” value of k<sub>p</sub> and the credibility of k<sub>p</sub> inference did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.B-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These results indicate that to reproduce the histogram of execution time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2.D</xref>, the degradation rate of Y (k<sub>d</sub>) and the working threshold of positive feedback (K) needed to be restricted, but not the strength of positive feedback (k<sub>p</sub>).</p>
<p>Next, we address the parameter inference with “BI[Y]<sub>time = 100</sub>” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.C</xref>). MCMC-HFM well inferred the “true” values of k<sub>d</sub> and K, and the variability of their distributions decreased, but not so much as “BIT<sub>e</sub>” did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.C-a, C-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g004">Figure 4</xref>). k<sub>p</sub> was still not so well inferred and had low credibility of inference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.C-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, independent usage of quantitative condition, “T<sub>e</sub>” and “[Y]<sub>time = 100</sub>”, did not well infer k<sub>p</sub>.</p>
<p>However, when both of quantitative conditions were used with qualitative conditions “BI”, MCMC-HFM could infer all three parameters well (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.D</xref>) with higher credibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g004">Figure 4</xref>) than independent usage of quantitative condition as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.B and 3.C</xref>. This result may be interpreted as follows. The information “T<sub>e</sub>” restrict k<sub>d</sub> and K as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.B</xref>, then additional information “[Y]<sub>time = 100</sub>” could restrict k<sub>p</sub>. Thus, to infer the strength of positive feedback k<sub>p</sub> with high credibility, the usage of both quantitative fitness measures is necessary.</p>
<p>If we changed the histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g002">Figure 2.D</xref> and E to the histograms generated by adding much weaker Gaussian noise (variance was changed from 1 to 0.01) into the model, better inference with high credibility was accomplished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3.E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, MCMC-HFM estimated the “true” values of kinetic parameters θ<sub>answer</sub> very well with use of hybrid fitness measures. In addition, we could confirm that kinetic parameters were inferred to reproduce the histograms of “T<sub>e</sub>” and “[Y]<sub>time = 100</sub>” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, MCMC-HFM could reliably infer the “true” values of kinetic parameters to reproduce the used histograms i.e. quantitative fitness measures for parameter inference. Generally, although the inferred range of parameter varies depending on the case, comparison of MCMC simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3</xref> clarified that, with more types of fitness, we can narrow down acceptable range of parameters more. Thus, ability of hybrid use of quantitative and qualitative fitness measures by MCMC-HFM is indeed useful.</p>

<p>In Legewie et al.'s model, input stimulus is Apaf-1 (represented as “A” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.A</xref>) and output is active caspase-3 (represented as “C3*” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.A</xref>). All biochemical reactions are represented by ordinary differential equations. In the application of MCMC-HFM to Legewie et al.'s model, we used the same ordinary differential equations described in their paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Legewie1">[22]</xref>. The model totally consists of 13 variables and 41 kinetic parameters. Legewie et al. revealed that so-called implicit positive feedback, which XIAP binds both caspase-3 and caspase-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.B</xref>), plays an important role for bistability and irreversible activation of caspase-3. Thus, we tried to infer especially five kinetic parameters, association rate constant (k<sub>asso</sub>) between XIAP and five caspases which are directly related to implicit positive feedback.

<title>Application of MCMC-HFM to the apoptosis model</title>
<p>For parameter inference, we used four types of information, “bistability of caspase-3” abbreviated as “B”, “irreversible activation of caspase-3” abbreviated as “I”, “switching time of caspase-3 activation” abbreviated as “T<sub>s</sub>”, and “execution time of caspase-3 activation” abbreviated as “T<sub>e</sub>”. For the application of MCMC-HFM, “B” and “I” are qualitative conditions. On the other hand, “T<sub>s</sub>” and “T<sub>e</sub>” are quantitative conditions. Therefore, we assigned “B” as C<sub>1</sub>, “I” as C<sub>2</sub>, “T<sub>s</sub>” as Z<sub>3</sub> and “T<sub>e</sub>” as Z<sub>4</sub> in MCMC-HFM algorithm.</p>
<p>Conditions C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> were judged by bifurcation analysis. The concrete definition of the condition C<sub>1</sub> is that, there are two stable steady states and one unstable steady state when Apaf-1 = 2.0 [nM], and active caspase-3 concentration of lower stable steady state is below 1.0 [nM] and higher stable steady state is over 1.0 [nM] (“A<sub>2</sub>” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.C</xref>). There is one stable steady state when Apaf-1 = 20.0 [nM] and activated caspase-3 concentration is over 1.0 [nM] (“A<sub>20</sub>” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.C</xref>). There are stable steady states when Apaf-1 = 0.001 [nM] and active caspase-3 concentration of lower stable steady state is below 1.0 [nM] (“A<sub>0.001</sub>” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.C</xref>). The criterion of activated caspase-3 concentration 1.0 [nM] comes from the fact that this concentration is considered to be high enough for caspase-3 to cleave 10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> molecules of cellular substrate within several hours when a cell volume is 1 picoliter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Cui1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Albeck2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Spencer1">[47]</xref>. When all of them are satisfied, f<sub>qual</sub>(C<sub>1</sub>) = I(C<sub>1</sub>(θ)) equals to 1, and 0 otherwise. Concrete definition of the condition C<sub>2</sub> is that, in addition of the condition C<sub>1</sub>, there are two stable steady states and one unstable steady state when Apaf-1 = 0.001 [nM], and active caspase-3 concentration of lower stable steady state is below 1.0 [nM] and higher stable steady state is over 1.0 [nM] (“C<sub>0.001</sub>” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.C</xref>).

<p>Quantitative conditions, “switching time of caspase-3 activation” and “execution time of caspase-3 activation” were calculated by dynamics simulation. The concrete definition of “switching time of caspase-3 activation” is that the duration from the time when active caspase-3 concentration reached the 2.5% of its maximum value to the time when active caspase-3 concentration reached the 97.5% of its maximum value. The maximum value of active caspase-3 was chosen as the maximum concentration in each dynamics simulation and bifurcation analysis. The mean values of switching time in cell population are 19 to 27 minutes and standard deviations are 7.7 to 13 minutes, slightly differ depending on the strength of apoptotic stimulus, TRAIL concentration, as experimentally shown in Albeck's study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Albeck1">[19]</xref>. The histogram of switching time was also shown in Albeck's study. However, they did not show the frequency of each class in the histogram explicitly. Thus, we needed to approximate the histogram of switching time. Because switching time is always larger than 0, log-normal distribution or gamma distribution can be used for approximation of the histogram. In this study, we adopted a log-normal distribution to mimic the switching time histogram. This is because it is known that skewed distributions often closely fit the log-normal distributions, and there are many examples across the sciences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Limpert1">[48]</xref>. Assumed quantitative fitness measures of switching time is as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e010"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Here μ<sub>s</sub> and σ<sub>s</sub> were set as the expected value of z<sub>3</sub> equals to 23 minutes and the standard deviation equals to 10 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.E</xref>). Numerically calculated switching time under parameters θ, z<sub>3</sub>(θ), is a variable of the quantitative fitness measure. The concrete definition of “execution time of caspase-3 activation” is that the time when active caspase-3 concentration reached the 90% of its maximum value in each dynamics simulation or bifurcation analysis. Experimentally, it is known that active caspase-3 level rises rapidly over a 10∼20 minutes period after MOMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Albeck2">[33]</xref>. However, there is no available histogram data of the distribution of execution time of caspase-3 activation. Thus, we adopted the log-normal distribution in the same way as the switching time. Assumed quantitative fitness measures of execution time is as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e011"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Here μ<sub>e</sub> and σ<sub>e</sub> were set as the expected value of z<sub>4</sub> equals to 15 minutes and the standard deviation equals to 3 minutes, as most of parameter vectors reproduce 10∼20 minutes for execution time of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Albeck2">[33]</xref>.

<p>In bifurcation analysis, steady states concentrations of all proteins were calculated by solving the simultaneous equations obtained by setting all the ordinary differential equations equals to zero with the standard Newton-Raphson method. Local stabilities of all the steady states were determined by evaluating eigenvalues of Jacobian matrices which were obtained by linearization of ordinary differential equations. In dynamics calculation, the ordinary differential equations were numerically solved by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a time step of 0.01. Total calculation time was 500 (50000 steps). Initial condition of the apoptosis model in dynamics calculation was shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s016">Table S1</xref>.</p>
<p>The prior distributions of parameters were set to follow the uniform distributions on a common logarithmic scale. Upper bound and lower bound were set to tenfold and one-tenth of the values used in Legewie et al.'s paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Legewie1">[22]</xref> respectively.</p>
<p>In MCMC-HFM algorithm, the proposal distribution was set as the uniform distribution. Newly proposed parameter θ' is proposed by using unit random number “r” as follows.<disp-formula id="pone.0074178.e012"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0074178.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Here, θ is a vector consisting of common logarithm of kinetic parameters, and σ<sub>q</sub> was set to 1.0 in this case study.</p>
<p>In each step of MCMC-HFM, one of kinetic parameters was randomly chosen and perturbed by the proposal distribution q(θ'|θ). We performed totally 5.5×10<sup>6</sup> Monte Carlo steps. The first 0.5×10<sup>6</sup> steps were thrown away as the so-called burn-in period. Of the remaining 5.0×10<sup>6</sup> steps, we recorded data every 5 steps, so that we collected totally 10<sup>6</sup> data points for the parameter inference. From them, we can draw discrete marginal probability distributions as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s003">Figure S3</xref>.</p>

<p>To investigate roles of each type of fitness on parameters, we conducted the parameter inference using one to four types of fitness, comparing these results.

<p>Specifically, we first look into the parameter inference of k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C3*). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g006">Figure 6 A and B</xref> showed that MCMC-HFM with “B” or “BI” did not well infer (the red arrow) the experimentally characterized value (the red bar). On the other hand, MCMC-HFM with “BIT<sub>s</sub>” and “BIT<sub>e</sub>” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g006">Figure 6.C D</xref>) inferred the value very close to the experimentally characterized value. Furthermore, MCMC-HFM with “BIT<sub>s</sub>T<sub>e</sub>” inferred the experimental value perfectly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g006">Figure 6.E</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we address the parameter inference of k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C9). The inference with “B” or “BI” by MCMC-HFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g007">Figure 7.A, B</xref>) resulted in the parameter values somewhat deviated from the experimentally characterized value. The MCMC-HFM with “BIT<sub>s</sub>” also showed similar deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g007">Figure 7.C</xref>). On the other hand, The MCMC-HFM with “BIT<sub>e</sub>” and with “BIT<sub>s</sub>T<sub>e</sub>” narrowed the parameter range and the mode (the red arrow) is very close to the experimental value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g007">Figure 7.D, E</xref>). For both of the above parameter inference, clearly, the use of quantitative fitness together with qualitative fitness is powerful and thus MCMC-HFM provides a useful framework.</p>
<p>Next, as for k<sub>asso</sub> (X-AC9), both of MCMC-HFM with “B”, “BI” and “BIT<sub>s</sub>” provided nearly uniform distribution without providing any information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g008">Figure 8.A, B, C</xref>). On the other hand, MCMC-HFM simulations with “BIT<sub>e</sub>” and “BIT<sub>s</sub>T<sub>e</sub>” disfavored values larger than ∼0.06 although they still accept any values lower than ∼0.06. The mode was smaller than the value assumed in Legewie et al's paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g008">Figure 8.D, E</xref>) although the precise mode value does not seem robust in the current simulations due to the flatness of the distribution and the intrinsic error in simulations. We note again that the value of k<sub>asso</sub> (X-AC9) was not determined experimentally and thus it is difficult to conclude if the inference was succeeded or not. At least, MCMC-HFM with “BIT<sub>e</sub>” and “BIT<sub>s</sub>T<sub>e</sub>” narrowed down the range of k<sub>asso</sub> (X-AC9).</p>
<p>k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C9*) were quite well inferred in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g009">Figure 9A–E</xref>). In all cases, the mode was consistent with the value assumed in Legewie et al's paper. Although the value of k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C9*) was not determined experimentally, the inference by the current MCMC-HFM simulations strongly suggest that 0.06, the value used in the previous work, would be a good choice.</p>
<p>k<sub>asso</sub> (X-AC9*) was inferred similarly by all the five simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g010">Figure 10.A–E</xref>). Although the inferences are not strong, they all favor smaller rate constants than the value assumed in the work of Legewie et al. The fact that all five simulations gave similar results suggests that the existence of “B” alone disfavors, but not completely rules out, values larger than 0.06. Other types of fitness did not work for narrowing the parameter range.</p>
<p>Taken together, MCMC-HFM estimated experimentally estimated kinetic parameters, k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C3*) and k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C9), perfectly in consistent with experimental values.</p>

<p>The 95% credible intervals of k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C3*) became narrower by additional information of “I”. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g006">Figure 6</xref>, smaller values of k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C3*) got unfavorable and higher values got favorable by additional information of irreversibility. This might be explained as follows. For irreversible activation of caspase-3, caspase-9 needs to activate caspase-3 constantly, and switch-on states of positive feedbacks needs to be sustained. For constant activation of caspase-3, a certain amount of caspase-9 has to be dissociated from XIAP. Thus, k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C3*) tended to favor higher values to attract XIAP and 95% credible interval became narrower.</p>
<p>The 95% credible intervals of k<sub>asso</sub> (X-AC9) and k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C9) became narrower by additional information of “T<sub>e</sub>”. This result indicates that, free AC9 and, more dominantly, free C9 determine the timing of caspase-3 activation after MOMP (MOMP is at time  = 0 minutes in our simulation). This is actually consistent with our intuition. After Apaf-1 input, firstly, C9 and AC9 activate C3 to C3*. Then two positive feedbacks, one is the implicit positive feedback, and the other is the positive feedback that C3* activates C9 to C9* and AC9 to AC9* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.A, B</xref>), are switched on and apoptotic stimulus is amplified. The switch-on timing of the positive feedbacks will determine the time when enough amount of caspase-3 is activated after Apaf-1 input, i.e. execution time of caspase-3 activation. Thus C9 and AC9 mainly determine the execution time of caspase-3 activation. Therefore, free C9 and free AC9 amounts need to be more strongly constrained, and thus the credible intervals became narrower.</p>
<p>In this manner, the current parameter inference process provides us lessons on which parameters are important for specific system properties. In addition, investigation about correlation coefficients and joint probability distributions between inferred parameters also provides us the relationships between parameters and specific system properties (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s019">Text S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s004">Figure S4</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s017">Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p>In the two experimentally determined parameters, k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C9) had narrow interval but k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C3*) had still wide intervals. A wide credible interval of posterior distribution indicates that the information for parameter inference was not enough only with the information of bistability, irreversibility, switching time of caspase-3 activation and execution time of caspase-3 activation. As experimental results on the target system properties increases, the credible interval will become narrower and better inference will be accomplished.</p>

<title>Discussions</title>
<p>In the present study, we introduced functions to evaluate fitness to experimental results, named fitness measures. Then we formulated Bayesian formula for hybrid fitness measures. We implemented it and developed MCMC-HFM algorithm to deal with a mixture of quantitative and qualitative fitness measures. We tested the MCMC-HFM algorithm for parameter inference in the kinetic toy model and the mathematical model of apoptosis signal transduction network. In the former, we inferred the kinetic parameters mainly related to positive feedback. As a result, MCMC-HFM could reliably infer the kinetic parameters with use of hybrid fitness measures. In the apoptosis model, we inferred the kinetic parameters which are related to the implicit positive feedback. As a result, MCMC-HFM could reliably infer the kinetic parameters, especially those of which values were experimentally estimated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Riedl1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Salvesen1">[50]</xref>. Inferred parameter sets reproduced the function approximating the distribution of execution time of caspase-3. In the current study, the function was assumed based on the experimental result <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Albeck2">[33]</xref>. This function can be replaced with explicit experimental data represented as a histogram in possible future applications in the same way as the switching time of caspase-3 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Albeck1">[19]</xref>. For inference, we define the representative parameter values of inference by the values at peak of each marginal distribution. This definition could reliably infer the kinetic parameters with use of hybrid fitness measures. Another definition of representative parameter values is the values at peak of joint distribution of all inferred parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Eydgahi1">[23]</xref>. We used the uniform distribution as the proposal distribution in MCMC algorithms. Actually, almost the same results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g013">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s001">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s005">5</xref> were obtained when we used the normal distribution as the proposal distribution in MCMC (partly shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s007">Figure S7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s014">14</xref>). These results indicate that MCMC-HFM is a useful and reliable method for parameter inference, and the results presented in the current study are reproducible.</p>
<p>In the apoptosis model, by the credible intervals of inferred parameters, joint probability distributions and correlation coefficients between inferred parameters, we could also specify the important relationships between kinetic parameters and corresponding biochemical processes, especially for irreversibility and execution time of caspase-3 activation. In the process of parameter inference by Bayesian statistics with MCMC, we can usually obtain many parameter sets, which can be used to understand and specify important biochemical processes in the target system as shown in the current study.</p>
<p>In the apoptosis model, inferred parameter sets reproduced well the assumed function of execution time of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g012">Figure 12</xref>), but did not well reproduced the assumed function of the switching time of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g011">Figure 11</xref>). This is not because of the restriction by two qualitative conditions, bistability and irreversibility. Because when we performed parameter inference only with a quantitative condition, “T<sub>s</sub>”, calculated histogram of T<sub>s</sub> was not consistent with the assumed function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s015">Figure S15</xref>). Thus, one possibility of inconsistency might be other experimentally-unknown kinetic parameters in the model are not correct. Legewie et al.'s model has a number of experimentally-unknown kinetic parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Legewie1">[22]</xref>. In our case study, we fixed most of those kinetic parameters except for k<sub>asso</sub> (X-AC9), k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C9*) and k<sub>asso</sub> (X-AC9*) in our parameter inference simulations. If we tried to infer all the unknown parameters in the model, the assumed function of the switching time of caspase-3 might be reproduced. Otherwise the mathematical model might need to be improved to be able to reproduce experimental results shown by Albeck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Albeck1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Albeck2">[33]</xref>. We note that our calculation could not well reproduce the switching time of caspase-3 activation in the distribution level, but most of parameter sets showed acceptable switching time around ten and a few minutes compared with the experimental result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g011">Figure 11</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the conditions used for parameter inference in the apoptosis model, “T<sub>s</sub>” did not largely narrow the distributions of any kinetic parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g006">Figure 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g010">10</xref>) or strengthen correlation coefficients, which differ from other conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s017">Table S2</xref>). This might indicate that other conditions have already had some information about the switching time of caspase-3. For example, we can easily see that “T<sub>e</sub>” has the information about “T<sub>s</sub>” because of its definition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g005">Figure 5.D</xref>). This kind of interaction among a number of conditions, i.e. a number of experimental results, will often appear in future applications.</p>
<p>Robustness analysis of kinetic parameters in systems biology sometimes assumes the size of the parameter space as the measure of robustness. For example, the volume of the ellipsoid containing 95% of the parameters generated by Monte Carlo method was calculated and assumed as the measure of robustness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Eiing1">[28]</xref>. In the same way, the 95% credible interval of posterior distribution obtained by parameter inference process by MCMC can be assumed to be the measure of robustness. For example, in the case study of the apoptosis model, k<sub>asso</sub> (X-AC9) showed wide credible interval and roughly uniform distribution in the case with information “B” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g008">Figure 8.A</xref>). This indicates the system is robust against perturbation of the strength of XIAP and AC9 association to maintain bistability of caspase-3. In contrast, the narrow 95% credible interval was k<sub>asso</sub> (X-C9*) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074178-g009">Figure 9.A</xref>). This indicates the system is sensitive to perturbation of the strength of XIAP and C9* association to maintain bistability of caspase-3. In this manner, parameter inference by Bayesian statistics with MCMC can give us the information about the robustness of kinetic parameters. This point is also an advantage of parameter inference by Bayesian statistics with MCMC compared to other optimization algorithms which does not infer kinetic parameters as probability distributions.</p>
<p>In the same way as the MCMC-HFM algorithm, the idea to deal with mixture of quantitative and qualitative fitness measures simultaneously can be applied to SMC or so-called population Monte Carlo methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Iba1">[51]</xref>. ABC-SMC has already been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Sisson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Toni1">[14]</xref> and applied to not only parameter inference but also model selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Toni1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Barnes1">[18]</xref>. One of the problems of ABC-MCMC is that the efficiency of the algorithm is reduced when the ABC-MCMC sampler is trapped in an area of relatively low probability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074178-Sisson1">[13]</xref>. In the current study, the MCMC-HFM sampler was not strongly trapped in a low probability area as shown in trace plots in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074178.s003">S3</xref>. However, implementation to SMC or population Monte Carlo methods may improve the efficiency of sampling and may enable us to perform model selection more easily dealing with mixture of quantitative and qualitative fitness measures.</p>
