				<p>The biodiversity assessment of different taxa of the genus <italic>Caulerpa</italic> is of interest from the context of morphological plasticity, invasive potential of some species and biotechnological and pharmacological applications. The present study investigated the identification and molecular phylogeny of different species of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> occurring along the Indian coast inferred from <italic>tuf</italic>A, <italic>rbc</italic>L, 18S rDNA and ITS rDNA nucleotide sequences. Molecular data confirmed the identification of 10 distinct <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species: <italic>C. veravalensis, C. verticillata, C. racemosa, C. microphysa, C. taxifolia, C. sertularioides, C. scalpelliformis, C. serrulata, C. peltata</italic> and <italic>C. mexicana</italic>. All datasets significantly supported the sister relationship between <italic>C. veravalensis</italic> and <italic>C. racemosa</italic> var. <italic>cylindracea</italic>. It was also concluded from the results that the specimen identified previously as <italic>C. microphysa</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>lentillifera</italic> could not be considered as separate species. The molecular data revealed the presence of multiple lineages for <italic>C. racemosa</italic> which can be resolved into separate species. All four markers were used to ascertain their utility for DNA barcoding. The <italic>tuf</italic>A gene proved a better marker with monophyletic association as the main criteria for identification at the species level. The results also support the use of 18S rDNA insertion sequences to delineate the <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species through character-based barcoding. The ITS rDNA (5.8S-ITS2) phylogenetic analysis also served as another supporting tool. Further, more sequences from additional <italic>Caulerpa</italic> specimens will need to be analysed in order to support the role of these two markers (ITS rDNA and 18S insertion sequence) in identification of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species. The present study revealed the phylogeny of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> as complete as possible using the currently available data, which is the first comprehensive report illustrating the molecular phylogeny and barcoding of the genus <italic>Caulerpa</italic> from Indian waters.</p>

			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>The siphonous green algal taxa, particularly those belonging to the genus <italic>Caulerpa</italic>, poses considerable difficulty in taxonomic identification at the species level due to the phenotypic plasticity in diagnostic characters. This can be further substantiated by the fact that out of 359 species (including forms and varieties) in the genus <italic>Caulerpa</italic>, only 85 are taxonomically valid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The previous reports have shown that the assimilators and ramuli that are used as taxonomic keys in identification seems to be under the control of environmental factors such as temperature, irradiance, water movement, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, conventional diagnostic characters alone have rather limited application when determining the correct identification and phylogeny of the species. </p>
			<p>The classical accounts of the species of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> were given by Agardh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and Weber-van Bosse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] based on morphological characteristics. Subsequently, Svedelius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] investigated the biodiversity of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> from Ceylon (Sri Lanka) following the work of Agardh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The first taxonomically identified species of this genus from the Indian coast were <italic>Caulerpa serrulata</italic> (as <italic>C. freycinetii</italic>)<italic>, C. lessonii</italic> and <italic>C. racemosa</italic> var. <italic>turbinata</italic> (as <italic>C. chemnitzia</italic>) by De Toni [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], although subsequent studies added several species. A new species, <italic>C. veravalensis</italic>, containing narrow, linear, non-overlapping, flat pinnules with a rounded apex was described from Veraval, Gujarat, India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Rao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] described <italic>C. mexicana</italic> f. <italic>indica</italic> from North Andaman. Duraiswamy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] prepared a comprehensive account of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> describing 21 taxa from the Indian shores based on morphological, cytological, anatomical and secondary metabolites (caulerpin, caulerpicin and β-sitosterol). However, these studies largely consisted of collections made from the southern part only. The biodiversity assessment study from the Gujarat coast reported the occurrence of 14 species including five varieties and three forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p>
			<p>The genus <italic>Caulerpa</italic> has attracted attention recently because of the invasive nature of some species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The secondary metabolites from the <italic>Caulerpa</italic> were also reported to have various biotechnological and pharmacological applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Some taxa belonging to the genus <italic>Caulerpa</italic> showed relatively well-defined morphological characters that can be easily differentiated. Nevertheless, validation of the reported <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species is necessary because of clear evidence of adaptive variation in their morphology, which has resulted in a series of varieties and forms. De Senerpont Domis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] suggested the need for detailed study of the <italic>C. racemosa</italic> complex, which harbours a number of varieties and forms. The recent molecular study on the <italic>C. racemosa</italic>-<italic>C. peltata</italic> complex revealed the presence of six different lineages that can be differentiated into species-level entities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, correct taxonomic identification of the species from this genus is of paramount importance in biodiversity assessment studies. </p>
			<p>Although certain chemotaxonomic markers based on secondary metabolites have been considered as an additional tool, their utility in taxonomy is limited. The recent development of molecular-marker-based characterization in several groups of seaweeds has opened up new opportunities for studying phylogenetics and resolving the taxonomic issues of cryptic species. A wide range of molecular markers has been employed in the past to decipher the identification and phylogeny of the genus <italic>Caulerpa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Phylogeny primarily reflects the evolutionary relationships among organisms. Moreover, the rate of evolution is variable for different molecular markers; therefore to resolve the phylogenetic relationship it usually requires extensive sequencing of multiple molecular markers. </p>
			<p>Herbert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] proposed the use of DNA barcodes, i.e. small DNA sequences amplified and sequenced from a standardized portion of the genome to identify and discriminate species. The Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) has proposed the RuBisCO large subunit (<italic>rbc</italic>L) and <italic>mat</italic>K as DNA barcodes for plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Some genus of brown (e.g. <italic>Fucus</italic>) and red (e.g. <italic>Dilsea</italic> and <italic>Mazzaella</italic>) algae, which have high morphological plasticity and are difficult to identify, were resolved successfully by utilizing the 5’end of the cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene (COI-5P) as a DNA barcode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The difficulty in amplification of COI-5P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and the absence of <italic>matK</italic> from green algae (except Charophyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]) make them inappropriate candidates for barcoding in <italic>Caulerpa</italic>. Therefore, there is a need to develop an efficient DNA barcode system based on small DNA sequence amplified and sequenced from a standardized portion of the genome that is able to identify the <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species, thereby helping to explore its cryptic diversity.  </p>
			<p>The relatively conserved <italic>tuf</italic>A gene is a preferred marker for identification and phylogeny of green algal taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Saunders and Kucera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] evaluated several markers for marine green macroalgae, albeit not <italic>Caulerpa</italic>, and proposed <italic>tuf</italic>A as the preferred barcode. The stability of the <italic>rbc</italic>L exon, with high amino acid sequence similarity, makes it another useful and reliable marker for such studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The 18S nuclear rDNA has been widely used in phylogenetic studies since it comprises highly conserved regions among the species and shows a high degree of functional constancy with a slow evolutionary rate. However, the highly conserved nature reduces the genetic distance between species in pairwise distance analysis if the complete locus is utilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, a characteristic intronic insertion sequence is present in the <italic>Caulerpa</italic> 18S rDNA sequence. These insertion sequences were reported by Kooistra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] in two Caulerpacean specimens, and were utilized by Durand et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] for phylogenetic analysis. We have utilized these 18S introns for character-based barcoding in the present study. The molecular marker ITS rDNA shows high variability in its sequence as well as in its length, which can be exploited for comparing the <italic>Caulerpa</italic> populations at the inter- and intraspecific levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. </p>
			<p>The use of molecular markers for identification and phylogenetic studies of the genus <italic>Caulerpa</italic> from India has not been reported to date. The present study thus investigates the utility of <italic>tuf</italic>A, <italic>rbc</italic>L and ITS rDNA by standard barcode methods (Neighbour-joining (NJ) analysis and nucleotide-sequence divergences) as described by Hebert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the monophyletic association of taxa in phylogenetic trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and 18S rDNA introns by character-based analysis as a DNA barcode to identify <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species. An extensive phylogenetic reconstruction was also accomplished to elucidate the relationships and the phylogenetic placement of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species from Indian waters. Additionally, possible congruence between morphology and molecular data was also analysed in the present study.</p>

				<title>Ethics Statement</title>
				<p>The Chief Conservator of Forest, Marine National Park Jamnagar, Government of Gujarat, India permitted the collection of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> specimens from Poshitra Rocks and the collection from Krusadai Island was permitted by the Chief Wild Life Warden, Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve, Government of Tamil Nadu, India. The other sampling locations are not the part of any national parks or protected areas and do not require any specific permits. It is further to confirm that the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.</p>

			<sec id="s2.2">
				<title>Collection of samples and morphological identification</title>
				<p>Repeated sampling was performed at 16 different locations, which seemed to cover nearly all <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species reported from India. The species diversity in the genus <italic>Caulerpa</italic> is concentrated along the northwest (Gujarat) and southeast (Tamil Nadu) coast of India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, intensive sampling was performed mainly from these areas. The detailed morphological descriptions, images and references used for identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] for collected specimens are given in the supporting information (<bold>Figures S1-S19 </bold>in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s001">File <bold>S1</bold></xref>). In total, 29 <italic>Caulerpa</italic> specimens (20 species including seven varieties and three forms and two unidentified taxa) were investigated based on the morphological differences for molecular barcoding and phylogenetic analysis. The collection sites for the specimens included in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s002">Figure <bold>S1</bold></xref>. Specimens used in the analyses, and the specimen voucher numbers, collection sites and accession numbers, are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s005">Table <bold>S1</bold></xref>. Samples were cleaned with sterile seawater to remove mud and epiphytes and finally rinsed with distilled water. Specimens were stored at -20°C before genomic DNA isolation. Voucher specimens for individual species were submitted to the Taxonomic Reference Centre for seaweeds at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSIR-CSMCRI).  </p>

The additional sequences were retrieved from GenBank in order to compare the inter- and intraspecific nucleotide divergences and to produce the phylogeny of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> as complete as possible using the currently available data. <italic>Caulerpella ambigua</italic> was used as an outgroup in <italic>tuf</italic>A and <italic>rbc</italic>L tree as it was found to be the most basal taxon to all the <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Multiple sequence alignment was performed with MAFFT version 6 with Q-INS-i strategy activated (which considers secondary-structure information of RNA for alignment) for ITS rDNA and 18S rDNA insertion sequence alignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. </p>
				<p>The estimation of nucleotide divergence between sequences was calculated using the Kimura 2- parameter (K2P) for ITS rDNA, Tamura-Nei (TN93) for <italic>rbc</italic>L and Tamura 3-parameter (T92) for the <italic>tuf</italic>A dataset. The rate variation among sites was modelled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter = 5). Model selection analysis was conducted to calculate the best-fit model of substitution by <italic>MEGA</italic> v.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. A neighbour-joining (NJ) tree was constructed by the bootstrap resampling method with 1,000 bootstrap replications in <italic>MEGA</italic> v.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].

				<title>Morphological identification</title>
				<p>The morphological characters of collected specimens were studied by following the traditional taxonomic keys for the genus <italic>Caulerpa</italic>. In total, 20 species including seven varieties and three forms were identified (<bold>Figures S1-S19 </bold>in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s001">File <bold>S1</bold></xref>). The cryptic nature of two taxa (<italic>Caulerpa</italic> sp. C03 and <italic>Caulerpa</italic> sp. C13) made it difficult to identify them at the species level. Two specimens of <italic>C. veravalensis</italic> (C10 &amp; C23) resembling the specimen described by Thivy and Chauhan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] were selected for molecular analysis. These specimens were characterized by a pinnately divided flat broad midrib, opposite to alternate flat ramuli with a rounded apex and occasional bifurcation in apices of ramuli (<bold>Figure S9 </bold>in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s001">File <bold>S1</bold></xref>). The <italic>C. scalpelliformis</italic> (C21), var. <italic>denticulata</italic> (C12) and forma <italic>dwarkensis</italic> (C01) were differentiated following the treatment given by Børgesen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. <italic>C. scalpelliformis</italic> var. <italic>denticulata</italic> was characterized by denticulation along the outer marginal lobes (<bold>Figure S1 </bold>in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s001">File <bold>S1</bold></xref>). The forma <italic>dwarkensis</italic> has an alternate arrangement of same-length ramuli throughout, except at the top, on regularly divided assimilators (<bold>Figure S1 </bold>in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s001">File <bold>S1</bold></xref>). The morphology of the specimen C29 agrees very well with <italic>C. racemosa</italic> var. <italic>racemosa</italic> f. <italic>remota</italic> Coppejans described by Coppejans et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] except the length of rachis, which ranged from 1.5 to 5 cm (<bold>Figure S17 </bold>in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s001">File <bold>S1</bold></xref>). Two specimens, C05 (collected from the western coast of India) and C20 (collected from the eastern coast of India), had cylindrical, sometimes laterally compressed, ramuli that were radially arranged on assimilators (<bold>Figure S4 </bold>in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s001">File <bold>S1</bold></xref>). There is a strong resemblance of these specimens to the description of <italic>C. racemosa</italic> var. <italic>laetevirens</italic> f. <italic>laxa</italic> by Børgesen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] and with <italic>C. racemosa</italic> var. <italic>cylindracea</italic> f. <italic>laxa</italic> described by Coppejans et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. The specimen C06 was identified as <italic>C. microphysa</italic> characterized by far fewer vesicles that are not clear in longitudinal series on the axis, short assimilators up to 3.0 cm and spherical ramuli up to 2.0 mm diameter (<bold>Figure S5 </bold>in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s001">File <bold>S1</bold></xref>). Specimen C14, however, with erect assimilators up to 10 cm long, and densely covered with spherical to sub-spherical ramuli and ramuli with constricted pedicels, was identified as <italic>C. lentillifera</italic> (<bold>Figure S11 </bold>in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s001">File <bold>S1</bold></xref>).</p>

				<p>A total of 82 <italic>tuf</italic>A sequences were aligned to generate the dataset of total length of 815 nucleotide positions in alignment to construct the NJ tree and to calculate pairwise distance. The NJ tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g001">Figure <bold>1</bold></xref>) revealed the presence of 19 distinct well-supported clades. The average corrected divergence over all sequence pairs was 0.063. The average intraspecific genetic divergence was 0.003 and the average interspecific divergence was 0.068. The divergence between morphologically different species <italic>C. serrulata</italic> and <italic>C. cupressoides</italic> was exceptionally low (from 0.003 to 0.004). The morphologically distinct species <italic>C. subserrata</italic> (AJ417935) and <italic>C. biserrulata</italic> (AJ417934) showed interspecific variation of 0.003. The pairwise distance analysis of <italic>tuf</italic>A gene data showed the intraspecific variation ranged from 0.0 to 0.011 whereas interspecific variation ranged from 0.003 to 0.173. The result clearly indicates the overlapping of maximum intraspecific and minimum interspecific genetic distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g002">Figure <bold>2</bold></xref>). The highest divergence was observed for the <italic>C. verticillata</italic> with a mean genetic distance 0.160 (0.147-0.173). The specimen identified previously as <italic>C. microphysa</italic> and <italic>C. lentillifera</italic> showed no sequence divergence for all the markers studied. In view of this, these two taxa were excluded from the interspecific variation range.</p>

				<p>A total of 45 sequences of the <italic>rbc</italic>L gene were used to generate the dataset of total length of 1076 nucleotide positions in alignment. The intron was removed from the <italic>rbc</italic>L gene sequences before analysis. In total, 10 clusters were recovered in NJ analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s003">Figure <bold>S2</bold></xref>). The cluster with <italic>C. mexicana</italic> (C27) and <italic>C. cuppressoides</italic> var. <italic>lycopodium</italic> (AJ512470) was poorly supported among these clusters. The average divergence over all sequence pairs was 0.043. The average intraspecific genetic divergence was 0.0033 and the average interspecific divergence was 0.053. The maximum intraspecific genetic distance (0.010) exceeds the minimum interspecific distance (0.004) in the present dataset. <italic>C. verticillata</italic> showed the highest divergence with a mean genetic distance of 0.127 (0.121-0.132). </p>
				<p>In addition to the above markers, we sequenced the ITS1-5.8-ITS2 region of the rDNA. We tried to align 62 ITS rDNA sequences, but the ITS1 region was virtually impossible to align and was removed before further analysis. In NJ analysis, 13 distinct clusters were recovered with high support values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082438.s004">Figure <bold>S3</bold></xref>). All species studied were clearly differentiated into distinct clades. The average divergence over all sequence pairs was 0.168. The average intraspecific genetic divergence was 0.025 and the average interspecific divergence was 0.17. The nucleotide divergence varied from 0.003 to 0.301 within species whereas interspecific variation ranged from 0.04 to 0.661. The highest divergence was observed for the <italic>C. verticillata</italic> with a mean genetic distance 0.510 (0.469-0.661).</p>
				<p>The length of insertion sequence in 18S rDNA sequence was found to be in the range of 113-115 nucleotides in <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species. The insertion and deletion pattern in insertion sequence was species specific and could be utilized for species-level identification by a character-based approach. The alignment of 18S rDNA insertion sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g003">Figure <bold>3</bold></xref>) clearly differentiated the taxa at the species level. <italic>C. microphysa</italic> (C06) and <italic>C. lentillifera</italic> (C14) shared an identical insertion sequence. <italic>C. racemosa</italic> var. <italic>cylindracea</italic> f. <italic>laxa</italic> and <italic>C. veravalensis</italic> were separated by a single diagnostic character.</p>

			<title>Discussion</title>
			<p>This study aimed to determine the identification and phylogenetics of the Indian <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species by employing multiple markers. This inclusive multi-gene approach has further improved the reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationship among <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species.</p>
			<sec id="s4.1">
				<title>Barcoding Analysis</title>
				<p>In this study, the overlap between levels of intraspecific genetic distance and interspecific genetic distance was observed for all the datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g002">Figure <bold>2</bold></xref>). The lower interspecific genetic distance was observed in some of the taxonomically well-established species. Therefore, it is difficult to define species boundaries using a distance-based approach in <italic>Caulerpa</italic>. Another approach of delineation of species is through monophyletic association of taxa in a Neighbour-Joining (NJ) tree, which does not depend on the distance-based threshold method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In NJ analysis of <italic>tuf</italic>A and ITS rDNA, most of the clades were recovered as being monophyletic with strong support with few exceptions. The Bayesian phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g004">Figure <bold>4</bold> and Figure <bold>6</bold></xref>) supported the differentiation of species, which was also depicted in NJ trees. ITS-rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis was found to be mostly congruent with the <italic>tuf</italic>A gene analysis. In the <italic>rbc</italic>L-gene-based analysis, the position of certain taxa did not resolve sufficiently and also showed incongruence with other datasets. The <italic>rbc</italic>L gene was also found to be least variable in comparison with <italic>tuf</italic>A and ITS rDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g002">Figure <bold>2</bold></xref>). Handeler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] and Saunders and Kucera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] supported <italic>tuf</italic>A gene as a barcode for green algae. Therefore, monophyletic association of taxa in the <italic>tuf</italic>A-gene-based tree can be utilized for species identification. The character-based identification of the species of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> by using the 18S rDNA insertion sequence was another useful identification tool that we found in this study. For example, <italic>C. peltata</italic> (C19 and C28) was clearly separated from <italic>C. racemosa</italic> and varieties in the 18S rDNA insertion sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g003">Figure <bold>3</bold></xref>). The ITS rDNA (5.8S-ITS2) analysis can be used as an additional supporting tool for identification purpose, but more sequences from species of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> will need to be analysed before defining the role of ITS rDNA in species identification. For example, <italic>C. serrulata</italic> and <italic>C. cupressoides</italic> showed paraphyly in <italic>tuf</italic>A analysis but formed a sister lineage in ITS rDNA analysis. However, there is a single valid ITS rDNA sequence available for <italic>C. cupressoides</italic> in GenBank dataset and more sequences will be required for differentiating the <italic>C. cupressioides</italic> and <italic>C. serrulata</italic> as monophyletic lineages. Similarly, more sequences from additional species of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> will need to be analysed in order to support the role of 18S insertion sequence in identification of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species. Following this molecular barcoding scheme, the identity of 10 distinct species of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> was confirmed from Indian waters.</p>

				<title>Phylogenetic analysis</title>
				<p>The <italic>tuf</italic>A-gene-based phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g004">Figure <bold>4</bold></xref>) was found to be congruent with those of the findings of Sauvage et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], Fama et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and Stam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The major addition to these phylogenetic analyses was <italic>C. veravalensis</italic>, which was recovered as a sister lineage to <italic>C. racemosa</italic> var. <italic>cylindracea. C. veravalensis</italic> was considered as a form of <italic>C. taxifolia</italic> and was later differentiated as a separate species based on morphological characters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. The species that was identified as <italic>C. racemosa</italic> var. <italic>cylindracea</italic> f. <italic>laxa</italic>, based on morphology, and two unidentified <italic>Caulerpa</italic> sp. C03 and C13, consistently placed in the same clade with <italic>C. veravalensis</italic> in all the phylogenetic trees. These taxa may be considered as part of a new <italic>C. veravalensis</italic> complex and need further detailed investigations.</p>
				<p>The <italic>rbc</italic>L phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g005">Figure <bold>5</bold></xref>) was not consistent with the phylogeny of other datasets. For example, the incongruity was observed in the position of <italic>C. flexilis</italic> as it formed a separate lineage in <italic>tuf</italic>A gene analysis and clustered with <italic>C. okamurae, C. microphysa</italic> and <italic>C. lentillifera</italic> in the <italic>rbc</italic>L gene phylogenetic tree. The position of <italic>C. serrulata</italic> also differed in <italic>rbc</italic>L phylogeny in comparison to <italic>tuf</italic>A and ITS rDNA phylogenetic analyses. In <italic>rbc</italic>L tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g005">Figure <bold>5</bold></xref>) <italic>C. serrulata</italic> was polyphyletic whereas, it was paraphyletic in <italic>tuf</italic>A analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g004">Figure <bold>4</bold></xref>) and formed sister lineage with <italic>C. cupressoides</italic> in ITS rDNA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g006">Figure <bold>6</bold></xref>). Similarly, De Senerpont Domis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] showed the topological differences between phylogenies inferred from <italic>tuf</italic>A and <italic>rbc</italic>L genes for the genus <italic>Caulerpa</italic>. De Senerpont Domis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and Fama et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] indicated the possible reasons of incongruence between these two genes such as hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting, and horizontal gene transfer (organismal- level cause) and rate heterogeneity, selection, and base/codon composition biases (genetic-level causes). Fama et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] reported the high levels of intra- and inter-individual polymorphism in the rDNA ITS1 region which can affect the phylogenetic reconstruction. The removal of the ITS1 region from the ITS rDNA dataset and the use of 5.8S-ITS2 in the phylogenetic analysis resulted in a robust and well-resolved phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082438-g006">Figure <bold>6</bold></xref>).</p>
				<p>The polyphyly of the <italic>C. racemosa</italic> complex was evident in the analysis of all the datasets. Sauvage et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] also reported the presence of six different lineages in the <italic>C. racemosa-peltata</italic> complex. Most of these lineages can be resolved into separate species. For example, phylogenetic analysis strongly favoured the separate species position of <italic>C. peltata</italic> (C19 and C28) having distinctly peltate ramuli, which was evident from the distant placement of taxa from other <italic>C. racemosa</italic> clades. Furthermore, the results confirmed that <italic>C. racemosa</italic> var. <italic>laetevirens</italic> (C25) is a part of the <italic>C. racemosa</italic> complex and is not a separate species <italic>C. laetevirens</italic> Montagne. </p>
				<p>The results of phylogenetic analysis were consistent with the study of Yeh and Chen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], as <italic>C. microphysa</italic> deviated from other species proving its taxonomic distinction. Coppejans and Beeckman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] considered <italic>C. lentillifera</italic> and <italic>C. microphysa</italic> as separate species. From the phylogenetic trees, it was inferred that both these taxa grouped together into a single clade. Furthermore, these two taxa showed no difference in <italic>rbc</italic>L gene sequence. These two taxa also shared a common 18S rDNA insertion sequence. Therefore, it can be considered that these two morphologically different specimens collected from India belong to the same species. The present results also agree with the study of Olsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] wherein the conspecific nature of <italic>C. taxifolia</italic> and <italic>C. mexicana</italic> were rejected. These species have formed separately placed clades in the phylogenetic trees. </p>

				<title>Morphology vs. molecular analysis</title>
				<p>Weber van Bosse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] classified <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species into 12 sections on the basis of morphology. Similarly, Calvert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] studied the phylogeny of these 12 sections based on chloroplast ultrastructure. Duraiswamy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] categorized the Indian <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species into five sections. Following this work, the taxa investigated in this study can be grouped into three sections, i.e. Filicoideae, Sedoideae and Charoideae. In the present study, it was observed that clades formed in the phylogenetic trees do not entirely follow the sectional scheme. Similar findings have been reported by Fama et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] for <italic>tuf</italic>A-gene-based phylogenetic analysis in <italic>Caulerpa</italic>.</p>
				<p>Stam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] reported the polyphyletic nature of <italic>C. scalpelliformis</italic>. In the present <italic>tuf</italic>A analysis, all <italic>C. scalpelliformis</italic> specimens from India (C01, C12 and C21) clustered with <italic>C. scalpelliformis</italic> var. <italic>denticulata</italic> (AJ417972) from Lebanon but away from the Australian specimen (AJ417971). On the other hand, morphologically different species <italic>C. racemosa</italic> var. <italic>cylindracea</italic> f. <italic>laxa</italic> (C05 and C20) and <italic>C. veravalensis</italic> (C10 and C23) clustered together. Thus, there was no consistent pattern observed in the relationship between morphological characters and placement in the phylogenetic tree of taxa based on the molecular markers investigated. Similarly, <italic>C. serrulta</italic> and <italic>C. cupressoides</italic> are clearly differentiable on morphological characteristics but formed paraphyletic lineages in <italic>tuf</italic>A analysis. Therefore, for truly understanding the placement in phylogenetic tree and proper identification of different populations of <italic>C. scalpelliformis, C. serrulta</italic> and <italic>C. cupressoides</italic> more detailed study with other molecular markers will be required. The weak supports at internal nodes in clades restrict further distinction at a lower taxonomic level.  However, these sub-specific ranks can be delineated by using longer nucleotide sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] or detailed transcriptome analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>].</p>

			<title>Conclusion</title>
			<p>In the present study, we present a comprehensive phylogeny of <italic>Caulerpa</italic> using most of the currently available data. The findings of this study showed the phylogenetic position of the Indian <italic>Caulerpa</italic> population vis-à-vis other parts of the world. The study supports the use of the <italic>tuf</italic>A gene as a preferred marker with the monophyletic association of taxa as the main criteria for identification at the species level. The ITS rDNA (5.8S-ITS2) analysis could also be used as an additional supporting tool for identification purposes, coupled with character-based identification by 18S rDNA insertion sequences at the species level. Our molecular analyses eventually led to establishment of 10 distinct <italic>Caulerpa</italic> species from Indian waters. Further, the taxa identified as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>racemosa</italic> var. <italic>cylindracea</italic> f. <italic>laxa</italic> and two unidentified taxa showed close proximity with <italic>C. veravalensis</italic> at a molecular level despite the distinct morphological variations indicating the presence of a new <italic>C. veravalensis</italic> complex, which needs further detailed investigation. </p>
