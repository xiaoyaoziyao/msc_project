<abstract>
<p>Cowpea is one of the most important food and forage legumes in drier regions of the tropics and subtropics. However, cowpea yield worldwide is markedly below the known potential due to abiotic and biotic stresses, including parasitism by root-knot nematodes (<italic>Meloidogyne</italic> spp., RKN). Two resistance genes with dominant effect, <italic>Rk</italic> and <italic>Rk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>, have been reported to provide resistance against RKN in cowpea. Despite their description and use in breeding for resistance to RKN and particularly genetic mapping of the <italic>Rk</italic> locus, the exact genes conferring resistance to RKN remain unknown. In the present work, QTL mapping using recombinant inbred line (RIL) population 524B x IT84S-2049 segregating for a newly mapped locus and analysis of the transcriptome changes in two cowpea near-isogenic lines (NIL) were used to identify candidate genes for <italic>Rk</italic> and the newly mapped locus. A major QTL, designated <italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, associated with resistance to <italic>Meloidogyne javanica</italic> reproduction, was detected and mapped on linkage group LG9 at position 13.37 cM using egg production data. Transcriptome analysis on resistant and susceptible NILs 3 and 9 days after inoculation revealed up-regulation of 109 and 98 genes and down-regulation of 110 and 89 genes, respectively, out of 19,922 unique genes mapped to the common bean reference genome. Among the differentially expressed genes, four and nine genes were found within the <italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>QRk-vu11</italic>.<italic>1</italic> QTL intervals, respectively. Six of these genes belong to the TIR-NBS-LRR family of resistance genes and three were upregulated at one or more time-points. Quantitative RT-PCR validated gene expression to be positively correlated with RNA-seq expression pattern for eight genes. Future functional analysis of these cowpea genes will enhance our understanding of <italic>Rk</italic>-mediated resistance and identify the specific gene responsible for the resistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cowpea [<italic>Vigna unguiculata</italic> (L.) Walp] is a widely cultivated diploid legume species with 11 pairs of chromosomes and a haploid genome size of approximately 620 Mbp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref001">1</xref>]. The species is native to Africa and is part of the warm-season legumes group, being closely related to common bean and soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref002">2</xref>]. It is usually cultivated under resource-poor conditions in hot and dry environments, mainly in tropical areas of Africa, Asia, southern Europe, South America and southern USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref003">3</xref>]. Because of its high protein content in grain (25–30%), cowpea is a major source of protein and minerals for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref004">4</xref>]. Despite its comparatively strong adaptation to adverse environmental conditions as compared to other legume species such as common bean, cowpea is susceptible to many biotic stresses caused by insects, bacteria, viruses, fungi and nematodes, especially root-knot nematodes (RKN, <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> spp.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>RKN are among the most important plant pests, causing annual crop losses accounting for billions of dollars globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref006">6</xref>]. They colonize plant roots and interfere with water and nutrients uptake by the root system, leading to poor development of the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref007">7</xref>]. Several species of RKN infect cowpea, including <italic>M</italic>. <italic>incognita</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>javanica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref008">8</xref>]. The use of resistant cultivars integrated into appropriate crop rotation schemes has been considered one of the most sustainable approaches for nematode management in cowpea.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that RKN resistance in cowpea is controlled by dominant genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref012">12</xref>]. Among these genes, a single dominant gene (<italic>Rk</italic>), effective against avirulent RKN isolates, was mapped on cowpea linkage group 11 (LG11) using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref013">13</xref>]. Another gene or locus (<italic>Rk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>), which mediates a higher level of resistance than the one mediated by <italic>Rk</italic> alone and confers a broad-based resistance to different RKN populations has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref011">11</xref>]. Despite the description of these two resistance genes and recent mapping of the <italic>Rk</italic> locus, the specific genes conferring resistance to RKN remain unknown.</p>
<p>In an effort to identify the genes underlying resistance response to RKN, we have mapped a resistance QTL localized on LG9 by analysis of a bi-parental recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, and used analysis of the transcriptome changes in two cowpea near-isogenic lines (NIL) to identify candidate genes for <italic>Rk</italic> and the newly mapped locus.</p>

<title>QTL mapping using a cowpea RIL population</title>
<p>A cowpea Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population of 84 F<sub>10</sub> lines from the cross 524B x IT84S-2049, was used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. The breeding line 524B with <italic>Rk</italic>–type resistance was developed by the University of California, Riverside from a cross between California Blackeye No. 3 and California Blackeye No. 5. The breeding line IT84S-2049 was bred by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and has a higher level of resistance than that conferred by the <italic>Rk</italic> gene alone and was determined to carry another resistance gene, <italic>Rk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>, an additional dominant allele of <italic>Rk</italic> locus or a separate gene locus tightly linked to <italic>Rk</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Cowpea plants were phenotyped for resistance reaction under controlled inoculations of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>javanica</italic> isolate 811 using seedling growth-pouches assay as described in Atamian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref014">14</xref>]. Briefly, cowpea seeds of each RIL and parental genotypes were grown in growth-pouches in a growth chamber with constant temperature of 27 ºC and 16 h of light per day. When adequate root systems were developed (about 15 days), each pouch was inoculated with approximately 1500 second-stage juveniles of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>javanica</italic>. Thirty five days after inoculation, each pouch was infused with egg mass dye solution (1 mg/L erioglaucine) and the egg masses on each root system were counted under a 10x-illuminated magnifier lens. The average number of egg masses per RIL was used to distinguish resistant from susceptible response. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Each block included one plant of each RIL and 4 plants of each parental genotype which were used as controls.</p>
<p>Each RIL and parent was genotyped for 51,128 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using the Cowpea iSelect Consortium Array (Illumina Inc., CA, USA). SNP calling was performed using GenomeStudio software (Illumina, Inc.) and SNP data were curated to eliminate monomorphic SNP loci, SNPs with &gt; 20% missing and/or heterozygous calls, and segregation-distorted markers (MAF &lt; 0.15). In addition, RILs with &gt; 10% heterozygosity or those carrying many non-parental alleles were removed. The genetic map of the 524B x IT84S-20149 population was constructed using MSTmap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref015">15</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mstmap.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://mstmap.org/</ext-link>) at LOD 10 and the linkage groups (LGs) were numbered and oriented based on the cowpea consensus genetic map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref016">16</xref>]. The following parameters were used to build the genetic map using the MSTmap software: Population type = RIL6; grouping LOD criteria = 10; no mapping size threshold = 2; no mapping distance threshold = 10 cM; try to detect genotyping errors = no; and genetic mapping function = Kosambi.</p>
<p>QTL mapping was performed using the Genome-wide efficient mixed model association algorithm (GEMMA) as described by Xu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref017">17</xref>]. The significance of the detected QTL was acquired using the Bonferroni correction threshold (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05).</p>

<title>Near-isogenic lines genotyping and QTL confirmation</title>
<p>Two sets of near-isogenic lines (NIL) (4 resistant and 4 susceptible) were genotyped using the cowpea iSelect platform with 51,128 SNPs to determine the presence and localization of the QTLs associated with resistance to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>javanica</italic> isolate “Project 811”. The resistant lines were derived from crossing the highly resistant RIL parent “IT84S-2049” (homozygous resistant, <italic>Rk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>Rk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>) to the recurrent parent California Blackeye 46 (CB46, homozygous resistant, <italic>RkRk</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref018">18</xref>]. F1 plants from this cross were back-crossed to the recurrent parent CB46 to generate BC1F1, and then blind crosses were made between BC1F1 plants and CB46. Selfed seeds (BC1F2) from each BC1F1 plant were screened with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>javanica</italic> isolate “Project 811” in seedling growth-pouches for evaluation of resistance response based on egg-mass production, in comparison with the parents. Subsequently, crosses were made between heterozygous resistant BCF1 plants to produce BC1F2 which segregated for resistance, and resistant plants were selected for the next backcross cycle. Backcrossing was repeated for six cycles followed by single seed descent and phenotyping at the F6 was conducted to select for homozygous resistant lines. This approach was used to add the <italic>Rk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> gene into the CB46 background. In parallel, CB46 and a highly susceptible cultivar “Chinese Red” (homozygous susceptible, <italic>rkrkrk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>rk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>) were crossed as described by Huynh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref013">13</xref>]. Resistant CB46 was used as the recurrent parent in a backcrossing scheme to remove the <italic>Rk</italic> gene resistance to provide a susceptible CB46 (CB46 Null(5)). In brief, the recurrent parent CB46 (homozygous resistant, <italic>RkRk</italic>) was crossed with a highly susceptible cowpea landrace ‘Chinese Red’ (homozygous susceptible, <italic>rkrk</italic>), and the F1 was backcrossed to the recurrent parent CB46 to generate BC1F1. Blind crosses were then made between BC1F1 plants with CB46, and selfed seeds (BC1F2) of each BC1F1 plant were screened with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>incognita</italic> isolate Project 77 in growth pouches for variation in RKN resistance based on egg-mass production, in comparison with the parents CB46 and Chinese Red. Subsequently, crosses made from heterozygous resistant BCF1 plants (<italic>Rkrk</italic>), whose BC1F2 segregated for resistance, were selected for the next backcross cycle. Backcrossing was repeated for six cycles followed by single seed descent and phenotyping at the F6 to select for homozygous susceptible lines.</p>
<p>Two NILs, CB46 Null(5) (S) and CB46 72-1-3(6) (R), differing in the presence or absence of resistance alleles of both QTLs, were used to perform the RNA-seq assay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Characterization of QTL QRk-vu9.1 effect on RKN resistance</title>
<p>Four NILs were developed to characterize the QTL effect on resistance. To generate plants carrying only QTL <italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, one F2 and one BC1F1 population were created by crossing two NILs, CB46 Null(5) and CB46 72-1-3(6). The two populations were phenotyped for response to the aggressive <italic>M</italic>. <italic>javanica</italic> isolate 811 in growth-pouches and the numbers of egg masses per root system were counted as described before. Subsequently, 146 F2 lines, 21 BC1F1 lines, CB46 and the parents CB46 Null(5) and CB46 72-1-3(6) were genotyped using 15 SNP markers with the Kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) assay (LGC Genomics Ltd., Hoddesdon, UK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref019">19</xref>]. Following marker trait association analysis to determine the effect of the QTL on nematode reproduction, the F2 lines were categorized into distinct phenotypic classes based on their response to egg mass production and SNP marker genotypes.</p>

<title>Identification of candidate genes in BAC sequences</title>
<p>The cowpea BAC sequences (NCBI accessions AC279865-AC275219) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref016">16</xref>] were used to determine the physical localization of candidate genes identified within the two QTL regions (<italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic>and <italic>QRk-vu11</italic>.<italic>1</italic>). To narrow down the BAC regions where the SNPs markers associated with the QTLs were contained, the online tool “HarvEST:web” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://harvest-web.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://harvest-web.org</ext-link>) was used. Briefly, using target SNP markers a list of cowpea genes with common bean annotation was generated and filtered using as cutoff genes with hit length ≥ 350 bp and E-score ≤ 0.0001. The final list of candidate genes was obtained from filtering the data for genes present in chromosomes 4 and 9 of common bean, syntenic to cowpea LG11 and LG9, respectively. The genes localized in these QTLs were used for comparison to the RNA-Seq data.</p>

<p>The same two NILs used for QTL validation, CB46 Null (S) and CB46 72-1-3 (R) were used to perform RNA sequencing. These two lines were inoculated with 3,000 freshly hatched second-stage juveniles of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>incognita</italic> (isolate Project 77) per plant in growth-pouches, as described before. The mock inoculation treatment consisted of 5 ml of deionized water. Root samples were collected at 3 and 9 days after inoculation and frozen until further processing.</p>
<p>For sample collection, root tissue from each treatment was excised using a sterile scalpel under a magnifying glass, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ºC. Similarly, root tissue was collected from equivalent root regions of the control plants (tissue near root tips of secondary and tertiary roots). Galled tissue was excised by cutting the region immediately adjacent to the root-gall to minimize the amount of non-infected tissue included in the assays. Each sample consisted of galls pooled from 10 plants. Extra roots were stained with acid fuchsin to evaluate nematode root penetration and migration as described by Byrd et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using Spectrum Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, Mo., USA) according the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was treated with RNase-Free DNase set (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) and purified using RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). Quality and concentration of RNA samples were determined using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Four multiplexed libraries for next generation sequencing were prepared using NEBNext Ultra RNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Paired-end sequencing was performed by Illumina HiSeq 2500, from which single-end (1 x 100 bp) sequence data were used for analysis. Raw sequence data from this study were deposited at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) as bioproject accession PRJNA387626. RNA-seq data were produced by the Institute for Integrative Genome Biology (Genomics Core Facility, University of California–Riverside).</p>

<title>Analysis of differentially expressed genes</title>
<p>The raw data were analyzed by the Institute for Integrative Genome Biology (Bioinformatics Core Facility, University of California–Riverside). Briefly, the raw reads were cleaned by removing adaptor sequences, empty reads, low-quality sequences, and short reads. The high-quality reads were aligned to the <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> genome (V1.0), available in Phytozome (Joint Genome Institute), using Tophat2/Bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref022">22</xref>]. Reads overlapping with the annotation range of interest were counted for each sample using the “summarizeOverlaps” function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref023">23</xref>]. Read counting was performed for exonic gene regions in a non-strand specific manner. The analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed by edgeR package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref024">24</xref>] from Bioconductor. The log<sub>2</sub> fold change (log<sub>2</sub>FC) of expression profiles (as RPKM) was computed between the inoculated and mock inoculated plants (control); and resistant and susceptible NILs (control) for each treatment. A false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.1 and log<sub>2</sub>FC ≥ ±1 was used as the threshold to judge the significance of each gene expression difference. GO analysis was performed using a web-based tool agriGO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref025">25</xref>], based on available <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> annotations.

<title>Validation of RNA-Seq data by qRT-PCR</title>
<p>Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to validate the RNA-Seq results for eight gene transcripts whose expression differed by more than 1.0-fold (up or down-regulated) between the CB46 72-1-3 and CB46 Null NILs after inoculation. Gene-specific primers for qRT-PCR were designed using PrimerQuest Tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.idtdna.com/-Primerquest/Home/Index" xlink:type="simple">https://www.idtdna.com/-Primerquest/Home/Index</ext-link>), OligoAnalyser 3.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer" xlink:type="simple">https://www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer</ext-link>) and UNAFold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.idtdna.com/unafold/Home/Index" xlink:type="simple">https://www.idtdna.com/unafold/Home/Index</ext-link>) tools. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Cat. 180080–051, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and real-time quantification was performed using a Bio-Rad MyIQ5 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and the Bio-Rad iQ SYBR Green Supermix Kit (Cat. 170–8882). An Elongation Factor (EF) gene from cowpea, based on <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> annotation, was used as a stably expressed internal reference. qRT-PCR was performed using three technical replicates for each sample from three biological replicates using a 15 μl reaction volume. The conditions for amplification were as follows: 3 min denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10s, 62°C for 30s, and 72°C for 30s.

<title>Protein domain characterization from candidate genes</title>
<p>To characterize the proteins encoded by the best candidate genes, the complete sequence of each gene was used to predict the full length of amino acids.

For this comparison, the transcriptomes of the resistant (R NIL) and susceptible (S NIL) NILs were compared at 15 and 21 days after germination (corresponding to the RKN inoculated plants at 3 and 9 DAI, respectively). A total of 1,163 DEG were identified in mock-inoculated plants at both time points.

Two of these transcripts, Vun_T16420.1 (99% coverage and 87% identity to Phvul.004G140400) and Vun_T16418.1 (87% coverage and 84% identity to Phvul.004G140400) presented a high bit score with 1312 and 573 bp, respectively. Vun_T6420.1 sequence encodes a NB-ARC domain with similarity to XP_017439631.1 (PREDICTED: TMV resistance protein N-like X3 [<italic>Vigna angularis</italic>]), XP_017439629.1 (PREDICTED: TMV resistance protein N-like X1 [<italic>Vigna angularis</italic>]), XP_017439630.1 (PREDICTED: TMV resistance protein N-like X2 [<italic>Vigna angularis</italic>]) (99% coverage and 90% identity). Vun_T16418.1 encodes a TIR domain, also with similarity to the cowpea gene homolog to Phvul.004G140400. Based on expectation (e-value) threshold, 70 transcripts had similarity to Phvul.004G140500, with Vun_T16712.2 and Vun_T22052.9 showing higher bit scores, 585 and 400 bp. Vun_T16712.2 sequence with a TIR domain was better aligned to BAU02586.1 (Hypothetical protein VIGAN_11213900 [<italic>Vigna angularis</italic> var. <italic>angularis</italic>]) with 99% coverage and 82% identity. Interestingly Vun_T22052.9, another transcript with a TIR domain, had better alignment with a <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> XP_007152563.1 (Hypothetical protein PHAVU_004G140700g [<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>]), but not with PHAVU_004G140500g. The gene Phvul.011G030000 had similarity to two transcripts in the cowpea transcriptome with bit scores of 54 bp. Both transcripts, Vun_T16420.4 and Vun_T16420.3, encode a NB-ARC domain and have high similarity to XP_014501488.1 (PREDICTED: TMV resistance protein N-like isoform X2 [<italic>Vigna radiata</italic> var. <italic>radiata</italic>]) and XP_014501487.1 PREDICTED: TMV resistance protein N-like isoform X1 [<italic>Vigna radiata</italic> var. <italic>radiata</italic>]). All these genes are mainly expressed in root tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189185.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).

Among the co-expressed transcripts, genes such as Disease resistance protein family (TIR-NBS-LRR class), WRKY family transcription factor, Leucine-rich repeat protein kinase family (LRR-RK), Auxin-responsive family protein and Plant invertase / pectin methylesterase inhibitor superfamily were identified as having 99% correlation and high expression.

<p>The gene homolog to Phvul.004G140400 in cowpea encodes a protein with TIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology) and NB-ARC (Nucleotide-binding) domains, commonly found in resistance genes. Additionally, the C terminal region of this protein has a Winged HTH binding domain (winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189185.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). The cowpea gene homolog of Phvul.004G140500 encodes a protein that seems to have two TIR-NBS proteins fused together, in the following sequence: TIR and NB-ARC domains followed by TIR, NB-ARC and Winged HTH binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189185.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Finally, the gene homolog to Phvul.011G300000 encodes a protein with a leucine-rich repeat domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189185.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). The first two proteins are predicted to be cytoplasm localized, while the last protein is predicted to have nuclear localization, according to amino acid sequence analysis performed using CELLO2GO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref031">31</xref>].</p>

<p>To characterize the relationship among the candidate genes and between these genes and others with high amino acid similarity, we built a phylogenetic tree using the complete sequence of amino acids of three predicted cowpea proteins and 11 proteins sharing similarity to each of them. As expected, the phylogenetic tree separated the three proteins into different clades, grouping each of them with their 11 related proteins. All three proteins showed high similarity with their respective homologues in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic> and <italic>Vigna</italic> species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189185.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Plant genetic resistance is the most sustainable way to reduce yield loss caused by RKN in many crops, including cowpea. Mapping QTLs and finding candidates genes responsible for nematode resistance provides a valuable tool for breeding programs through the identification of genetic markers for effective marker-assisted selection, thus enabling efficient incorporation of desirable traits into improved cowpea cultivars. In this study, we identified a major effect QTL on cowpea LG 9 associated with RKN resistance. The skewed or bi-modal phenotypic distribution observed for the number of egg masses per root system trait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189185.g004">Fig 4</xref>) supports the current mapping of the <italic>QTL QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic>. The RKN resistance QTL mapped in this study and the previously mapped <italic>QRk-vu11</italic>.<italic>1</italic> were confirmed by genotyping results of susceptible and resistant NILs derived from conventional backcrossing. The QTL <italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic> position does not correspond to the <italic>Rk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> locus described by Roberts et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref011">11</xref>]. In that earlier study, the authors examined the inheritance of the resistance in IT84S-2049 against two populations of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>incognita</italic> (virulent and avirulent to gene <italic>Rk</italic>) and concluded that the high resistance in IT84S-2049 was associated with the <italic>Rk</italic> gene locus, which was hypothesized to be a complex RKN resistance locus harboring both the <italic>Rk</italic> and the <italic>Rk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> genes in a tightly linked manner, because of the lack of any susceptible recombinants among a total of 1206 F2 and 1144 TC1 plants tested. The fact that the <italic>QTL QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic> was not mapped to the region of <italic>Rk</italic> locus indicates that the locus conferring the resistance to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>javanica</italic> in the current study is different from <italic>Rk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>. Possibly, this new locus, when combined with the <italic>Rk</italic> gene or its variants, also confers some resistance to virulent populations of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>incognita</italic>. The present work showed that the NILs containing favorable alleles only in <italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic> had a weak resistance response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>javanica</italic>. However, when <italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic> was combined with positive alleles at <italic>QRk-vu11</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, the plants displayed a much stronger resistance response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189185.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Previous investigations showed that <italic>Rk</italic>-mediated resistance did not suppress root penetration by infective juveniles of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>incognita</italic>, but the nematodes that established feeding sites in resistant roots exhibited arrested development by 14 DAI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref035">35</xref>]. Interestingly, our results showed that the resistance controlled by the combination of both <italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>QRk-vu11</italic>.<italic>1</italic> had an additive effect, interfering with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>incognita</italic> development in cowpea roots in early stages of feeding site establishment (3 DAI).</p>
<p>The candidate gene discovery strategy taking advantage of the synteny between cowpea and common bean allowed for the identification of candidate resistance genes, encoding proteins such as TIR-NBS-LRR, LRR Kinase, NB-ARC domain-containing disease resistance protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189185.s011">S4 File</xref>), all localized in the common bean syntenic regions of <italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>QRk-vu11</italic>.<italic>1</italic>. Fifteen of these genes were also differentially expressed between resistant and susceptible plants with three of these genes (homologous to TIR-NBS-LRR genes of <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>) showing a higher expression in the resistant plant. Currently, most of the cloned nematode R-genes encode proteins belonging to the largest class of R-proteins with central nucleotide-binding (NB) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. These R-genes include <italic>Mi-1</italic>.<italic>2</italic>, <italic>Mi-9</italic>, <italic>Hero</italic>, <italic>Gpa2</italic> and <italic>Gro1-4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref040">40</xref>]. Most of these genes encode N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain-containing NB-LRR proteins, with the exception of <italic>Gro1-4</italic>, which encodes a N- terminal Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) NB-LRR protein. Additional characterized R-genes with distinct domain conformation include <italic>Hs1</italic><sup><italic>pro</italic>-1</sup> from sugar beet and <italic>Rhg1</italic> and <italic>Rhg4</italic> from soybean. <italic>Hs1</italic><sup><italic>pro</italic>-1</sup>, the first cloned nematode R-gene, encodes a leucine-rich protein with a transmembrane domain, which has little similarity to other R-proteins, while <italic>Rhg1</italic> and <italic>Rhg4</italic> encode proteins with extracellular LRRs, a transmembrane domain and a cytosolic serine-threonine kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref043">43</xref>]. Notably, these resistance genes are constitutively expressed throughout plant tissues and their expression does not respond to nematode inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref044">44</xref>]. Consistent with the constitutive expression of R genes, the best candidate genes (Phvul.004G140400, Phvul.004G140500 and Phvul.011G030000) evaluated in the present investigation did not respond to RKN inoculation when compared to mock-inoculated control plants. Nevertheless, the basal level of gene expression in resistant plants was significantly elevated in comparison to susceptible plants, suggesting the resistant plants may display increased sensitivity to RKN detection.</p>
<p>The three best candidate genes with differential expression, besides having a high similarity with their homologs in <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>, also have high homology with TMV resistance protein N-like genes of <italic>Vigna radiata</italic>. The <italic>N</italic> gene is a member of the Toll-interleukin-1 receptor/nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NBS-LRR) class of plant resistance (<italic>R</italic>) genes and confers resistance to <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus</italic> (TMV) in tobacco plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref045">45</xref>]. Homologous genes of the <italic>N</italic> gene have been identified in other species of plants conferring resistance to diseases such as potato resistance to <italic>Synchytrium endobioticum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the candidate genes selected in this work are mainly expressed in roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref027">27</xref>]. Using the same source of information, we found other genes such as Disease resistance protein (TIR-NBS-LRR class) family, WRKY family transcription factor (known to interact with NBS-LRR proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref047">47</xref>]) and Leucine-rich repeat protein kinase family protein to be co-expressed with transcripts showing high similarity with our candidate genes.</p>
<p>The proteins encoded by the homologous genes Phvul.004G140400 and Phvul.004G140500 contain TIR and NB-ARC domains, with Phvul.004G140500 encoding these domains in duplicate. Interestingly, these genes do not seem to encode a protein containing a LRR domain. In the case of Phvul.011G030000 only the LRR domain was identified. The LRR domains are the most polymorphic part of the plant NBS-LRR proteins, which likely reflects their role in effector recognition. In addition to its role in effector recognition, the LRR domain also plays an important role in keeping NBS-LRR proteins in the “off” state. Studies have demonstrated that the LRR domain physically associates with the NB-ARC domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref049">49</xref>] and deletion of the LRR domain typically results in auto-activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0189185.ref050">50</xref>]. The absence of a LRR domain could justify the higher basal expression of the first two genes as detected in our results.</p>
<p>Future functional analysis of cowpea genes homologous to Phvul.004G140400, Phvul.004G140500 and Phvul.011G030000 will enhance our understanding of <italic>Rk</italic>-mediated RKN resistance and provide ‘perfect markers’ which would further improve marker-assisted breeding efficiency. In addition, this would determine exactly the gene responsible for RKN resistance under each QTL, allowing insertion of these genes through genetic transformation into other legume crop plants of major economic importance, such as common bean and soybean.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the present study, a major QTL (<italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) associated with RKN resistance was mapped on cowpea LG 9 associated with RKN resistance. This QTL does not correspond to the <italic>Rk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> locus which was previously found to be associated with strong RKN resistance linked to the <italic>Rk</italic> gene region, and therefore represents a novel RKN resistance locus. Possibly, this new locus, when combined with the <italic>Rk</italic> gene or its variants, confers some resistance to virulent populations of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>incognita</italic>. We showed that the NILs containing favorable alleles only in <italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic> responded with a weak resistance to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>javanica</italic>. However, when <italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic> was combined with positive alleles at <italic>QRk-vu11</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, plants displayed a much stronger resistance phenotype. Based on RNA-seq data and the synteny between <italic>V</italic>. <italic>unguiculata</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic>, we were able to select three promising genes (homologous to Phvul.004G140400, Phvul.004G140500 and Phvul.011G030000) encoding proteins belonging to the class of R-proteins with central nucleotide-binding (NB) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, localized in the regions of <italic>QRk-vu9</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>QRk-vu11</italic>.<italic>1</italic>. These three best candidate genes with high similarity to their homologs in <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>, also had high homology with TMV resistance protein N-like genes of <italic>Vigna radiata</italic>. Functional analysis of these genes will provide best markers to be used in marker-assisted breeding and will allow the transfer of these genes to other legume crops through genetic transformation.</p>
