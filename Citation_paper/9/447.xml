      <abstract>
        <p>Thailand, a part of the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, has many endemic animals and plants. Some of its fungal species are difficult to recognize and separate, complicating assessments of biodiversity. We assessed species diversity within the fungal genera <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and <italic>Hypoxylon</italic>, which produce biologically active and potentially therapeutic compounds, by applying classical taxonomic methods to 552 teleomorphs collected from across Thailand. Using probability of correct identification (PCI), we also assessed the efficacy of automated species identification with a fungal barcode marker, ITS, in the model system of <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and <italic>Hypoxylon</italic>. The 552 teleomorphs yielded 137 ITS sequences; in addition, we examined 128 GenBank ITS sequences, to assess biases in evaluating a DNA barcode with GenBank data. The use of multiple sequence alignment in a barcode database like BOLD raises some concerns about non-protein barcode markers like ITS, so we also compared species identification using different alignment methods. Our results suggest the following. (1) Multiple sequence alignment of ITS sequences is competitive with pairwise alignment when identifying species, so BOLD should be able to preserve its present bioinformatics workflow for species identification for ITS, and possibly therefore with at least some other non-protein barcode markers. (2) Automated species identification is insensitive to a specific choice of evolutionary distance, contributing to resolution of a current debate in DNA barcoding. (3) Statistical methods are available to address, at least partially, the possibility of expert misidentification of species. Phylogenetic trees discovered a cryptic species and strongly supported monophyletic clades for many <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> species, suggesting that ITS can contribute usefully to a barcode for these fungi. The PCIs here, derived solely from ITS, suggest that a fungal barcode will require secondary markers in <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and <italic>Hypoxylon</italic>, however.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Reliable species identification is fundamental to assessing biodiversity, geographical variation, and environmental changes, as well as to discovering novel drugs and many other experimental enterprises. Species identification in fungi is particularly challenging, because of their ephemeral nature. Moreover, fungal diversity in the tropics is particularly difficult to assess, because both taxonomic specialists and a complete understanding of the reliability of many taxonomic characters are lacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Tantichareon1">[1]</xref>. Based on our extended studies of fungi in Thailand, we assess the geographical distribution of the Xylariaceae, a family of the Ascomycota. The Ascomycota are less ephemeral than the fleshy fungi of the Basidiomycota, so the estimates of fungal diversity based on them are more robust than estimates based on Basidiomycota. The delimitation of Xylariaceae from other related pyrenomycete families has always been problematic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Rogers1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Rogers2">[3]</xref>, so we also improved protocols for species identification within them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Rogers2">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Whalley2">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Thailand has a rich diversity of Xylariaceae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Thienhirun1">[8]</xref>, containing many unknown species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Rogers2">[3]</xref>, along with 23 out of the 74 genera accepted in a standard reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Lumbsch1">[9]</xref>. Within the Xylariaceae, the genera <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> have received recent attention. <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> occur around the world, and they are very well represented in Thailand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Thienhirun1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Fournier1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Lsse1">[12]</xref>. Taxonomic recognition of both genera and species relies on traditional morphological characters: shape, size, color, surface features and microscopic details of the asci and ascospores. Studies using scanning electron microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Lsse2">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Whalley3">[15]</xref> and chemical and molecular data have sharpened the boundaries of both species and genera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Fournier1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Suwannasai1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Whalley3">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Tang1">[20]</xref>. Nevertheless, the separation of some closely related species remains difficult, and as in other group of fungi the number of cryptic or sibling species can be high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Taylor1">[21]</xref>. Our inability to identify these taxa accurately impedes the assessment of species diversity and has important practical consequences for recognizing plant pathogens or discovering novel drugs.</p>
      <p>Thailand is a tropical area in which many xylariaceous fungi are likely still unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Rogers2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Thienhirun1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Whalley3">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Okane1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Pinnoi1">[23]</xref>, so only a few reports on species of <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> are extant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Fournier1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Suwannasai1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Thienhirun2">[24]</xref>. Many species reported from different localities exist only in a single collection, so without more specimens of them to display suitable distinguishing key characteristics, their taxonomy remains unhelpfully vague. A reliable, accurate, and reproducible means of identification would elucidate the diversity, distribution, and role of these taxa in nature.</p>
      <p>DNA barcodes provide a possible technology for the requisite species identification. In its essence, a barcode is any standardized subset of DNA from a taxonomic specimen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Hebert1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Floyd1">[26]</xref>. To fix terminology, we use the term “marker” to connote any contiguous region of DNA (coding or non-coding).</p>
      <p>The Internal Transcribed Spacer of nrDNA (ITS) is one of the most extensively sequenced markers in fungi (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Brock1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Gardes1">[28]</xref>). Sequence analysis of ITS can provide precise information for identifying fungal species from disparate sources and for exploring their phylogenetic relationships. Although the phylogenetic trees constructed from ITS do not support the generic classification between <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> genera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Suwannasai1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-SanchezBallesteros1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Triebel1">[30]</xref>, ITS sequences have proved to be a powerful tool for identifying fungi in several problematic species complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Suwannasai1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Pinnoi1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-SanchezBallesteros1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Lee1">[31]</xref>. Moreover, recent papers related to DNA barcoding of true fungi support the entire ITS region of the nrDNA as one of the most appropriate barcode markers for identifying fungal species in the field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Begerow1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Nguyen1">[35]</xref>. Accordingly, ITS has recently been selected as an official barcode marker for fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Schoch1">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This article combines classical taxonomic methods with sequence analysis and statistics to evaluate the suitability of ITS as a barcode marker in the specific context of the <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic>-<italic>Hypoxylon</italic> clade, in particular, to examine whether ITS provides a good proxy for expert morphological identification and whether it aids phylogenetic study within the clade. To those aims, we systematically vary the components of the bioinformatics workflow required to exploit a marker in a barcode database like BOLD, e.g., using different alignment methods and sequence distances in our analyses below. The evaluation of a barcode requires a suitable measure of the accuracy of species identification. Barcode selection has proved problematic in some taxa, notably plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Chase1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-CBOL1">[40]</xref> and insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Meier1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Huang1">[42]</xref>, so fortunately there is now a consensus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-CBOL1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Meier1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Erickson1">[43]</xref> on a suitable measure of barcode efficacy, namely the probability of correct identification (PCI) (defined in the Results section).</p>
      <p>By comparing sequences from vouchered specimens with complete taxonomic information to sequences derived from GenBank, we explore the biases that incorrect GenBank taxonomy can introduce into scientific conclusions about barcode efficacy. By examining subsets of species where experts are likely to agree on their morphological species identification, we also evaluate possible biases introduced by incorrect morphological identification. By comparing the PCI derived from local sequence alignment (as used in the popular BLAST sequence alignment tool), to the PCI derived from alignment methods more appropriate to species identification, we explore biases that inappropriate alignment methods introduce into conclusions about barcode efficacy. Finally, before the selection of ITS as an official fungal barcode marker, all official barcode markers were protein genes like CO1, matK, etc. In slowly evolving organisms like plants, however, intergenic spacers (DNA regions flanked by two genes) have been under consideration as potential barcode markers, because they usually diverge faster than genes, but with conserved ends to provide primers for PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Erickson1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Kress2">[44]</xref>. One possible factor motivating their rejection as barcode markers is their potential intractability to multiple sequence alignment, a basic step in the bioinformatics workflow within BOLD, the Barcode of Life Database. We therefore explore the potential concern that ITS might disrupt a bioinformatics workflow, by comparing the PCI derived from multiple sequence alignment to PCIs derived from other alignment methods.</p>

        <title>The Sequences Analyzed</title>
        <p>This study is based on 552 <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> teleomorphs that we and others collected from different locations of Thailand (see Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054529.s003">Text S1</xref>). We classified and identified teleomorphs to species level, based on traditional morphological and anamorph characteristics, according to the holomorphic morphological species concept. For each species, we examined the relevant Thai collections, comparing to authenticated collections where necessary. Not all specimens could be cultured, not all cultures yielded successful DNA extractions, and not all extractions yielded ITS sequences under PCR, however. Large variations in morphological features and a lack of anamorph features also prevented identification of four specimens as a proper species, so they were reported as <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> spp. Phylogenetic and barcode analyses were applied to 265 ITS nrDNA sequences (see the SI), plus 4 sequences from the GenBank under <italic>Nemania serpens</italic>, a taxon transferred from <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> to the genus <italic>Nemania</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Ju1">[4]</xref>.</p>

        <p>The multiple alignment of ITS nrDNA had 1985 columns, reflecting many gaps in the alignment, some to accommodate a long ITS1 in occasional sequences. The alignment revealed a large variation in size ranging from 479 to 936 bp in <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and 384 to 851 bp in <italic>Hypoxylon</italic>. The ITS1 fragment is extremely long (477 to 588 bp) only in the <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> species. Remarkably, the sixteen ITS sequences from <italic>A. nitens</italic> in our study fell into two groups. ITS1 from specimens H154, H157, H189, H197, ST2313, ST2436, ST2473 and GB15; EF026138 had lengths 159 to 163 bp, but the remaining specimens (all from Thai collections) had much longer ITS1 sequences, 543 to 572 bp. We carefully rechecked the specimens with long ITS1 sequences on teleomorph and anamorph characteristics, but they fit to <italic>A. nitens</italic>. Sequencing of alpha-actin and beta-tubulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Hsieh1">[16]</xref> from both groups (H154, H157, and H189, with short ITS; H099, H181, and H215, with long ITS) supported the presence of “cryptic species” under <italic>A. nitens</italic>. We gave the temporary name “<italic>A.</italic> aff. <italic>nitens</italic>” to the specimens yielding a long ITS sequence, with plans to publish the new species elsewhere supported by a formal description and data from other genetic markers.

        <title>Barcode Analysis</title>
        <p>The ITS sequences for barcode analysis consisted of two datasets. (1) The “GenBank dataset”, derived from other studies, contained 128 sequences (27 sequences from 9 <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> species, where 7 species had only one sequence; and 101 sequences from 31 <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> species, where 19 species had only one sequence). (2) The “non-GenBank dataset”, derived from our studies, contained 141 sequences (56 sequences from 9 <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> species, where 2 species had only one sequence; and 81 sequences from 23 <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> species, where 5 species had only one sequence; and 4 sequences from 1 <italic>Nemania</italic> species). Our “complete dataset”, which combined the GenBank and non-GenBank datasets, contained 269 sequences (83 sequences from 13 <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> species, where 5 species had only one sequence; 182 sequences from 46 <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> species, where 20 species had only one sequence; and 4 sequences from 1 <italic>Nemania</italic> species). Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054529.s003">Text S1</xref> lists the samples in our complete dataset.</p>
        <p>After the extraction of a DNA sample from any culturable specimen, the computer identified the sample’s species from its sequence using different types of alignment (e.g., local alignment; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054529.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and sequence distances. For each method, we calculated the barcode gap PCI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-CBOL1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Meier1">[41]</xref>, the fraction of those species with at least two samples displaying a barcode gap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Hebert2">[45]</xref> (see the Methods section). The Wilson score interval <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Wilson1">[46]</xref> provided the error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2</xref>, which display 95% confidence intervals. The Methods section describes the calculation of p-values. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2</xref> displays 32 values pertinent to correct identification of fungal species, so statistical conclusions require a multiple-test correction. The 32 values are heavily correlated, however (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2d</xref> represent disjoint subsets of the data; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2b</xref> pertain to different scoring systems aligning the same sequences; etc.). In any case, all p-values below are two-sided, stated without any multiple-testing correction, so readers can correct the p-values at their discretion (e.g., using a factor up to 32). Below, we declare a result statistically significant only at uncorrected, corresponding to the maximum number, 32, in the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Holm1">[47]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2b</xref> show (barcode gap) PCIs for alignments under the NCBI BLAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Altschul1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Altschul2">[49]</xref> and UCSC BLASTZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Schwartz1">[50]</xref> default DNA scoring systems (distinguished below as “NCBI scoring” and “UCSC scoring”, respectively). Fixing the scoring system and the alignment type (either multiple sequence alignment, which imposes global pairwise alignments on each pair of sequences; or global, semi-global, or local pairwise alignment), the resulting PCIs did not depend at all on the specific evolutionary distance chosen at all, over all nine evolutionary distances examined. Under both NCBI and UCSC scoring, each PCI from global pairwise alignment never exceeded the corresponding PCI from multiple sequence alignment (MSA) by more than about 0.05, well within the sampling error of our study. The largest PCI for the entire dataset from all sequence distances was 0.37 (correct identification of 13 out of 35 species), for evolutionary distance under both global pairwise alignment and global MSA. This result is perhaps somewhat surprising, because MSAs of non-protein markers like ITS contain many gaps, degrading any evolutionary interpretation of the MSA positions. In the muscle3.6 MSA of our unique sequences, e.g., fully 208,349 of the 326,742 characters (about 64%) of the MSA consisted of gap characters.</p>

        <p>The largest PCI differences occurred between local alignment and other alignment types, for the evolutionary distance under NCBI scoring. The PCI decrease (0.34) was statistically significant (). Semi-global alignment produced PCIs identical to global alignment, suggesting that sequence length variation had no influence on our results.</p>
        <p>To assess the reliability of GenBank data, and to compare them to the data collected specifically for this study, we divided our dataset into “GenBank” and “non-GenBank” subsets. The best values of the PCI under both NCBI and UCSC scoring were similar, with NCBI scoring producing more varied PCIs than UCSC scoring. To examine the patterns of variation more closely, we used NCBI scoring for the remainder of the study. Thus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2d</xref> compare PCIs for the GenBank and non-GenBank subsets under NCBI scoring.</p>
        <p>The differences between the GenBank and non-GenBank sequences in number, composition, and length distribution were unremarkable (see Section “Summary statistics for the ITS sequence data” in the SI). The PCIs for the GenBank dataset are generally inferior to PCIs for non-GenBank dataset, the maximum PCI decrease being 0.56 to 0.29 for pairwise global alignment distance (not statistically significant, with ).</p>
        <p>To assess the influence of misidentifying species morphologically, we divided our species data into two subgroups, depending on a (necessarily subjective) assessment of whether or not experts are likely to disagree on the corresponding morphological identification. We assessed likely disagreement for <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> species <italic>annulatum</italic>, <italic>cohaerens</italic>, <italic>moriforme</italic>, <italic>multiforme</italic>, <italic>nitens</italic>, aff. <italic>nitens</italic>, and <italic>truncatum</italic>; and for <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> species <italic>anthochroum</italic>, <italic>crocopeplum</italic>, <italic>fendleri</italic>, <italic>macrocarpum</italic>, <italic>rubiginosum</italic>, and <italic>truncatum</italic>. The following PCIs for multiple sequence alignment summarize the presence of a barcode gap over all species in different datasets. Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054529.s003">Text S1</xref> details the PCI for the individual <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> species.</p>
        <p>For the complete dataset, 13/35 species (PCI = 0.37±0.15) display a barcode gap (for all samples); when only species assessed as having consistent expert morphological identification are examined, 10/22 species (PCI = 0.45±0.19). For the GenBank dataset, 6/14 species (PCI = 0.43±0.23) display a barcode gap; when only species assessed as having consistent expert morphological identification are examined, 4/8 species (PCI = 0.50±0.29). For the non-GenBank dataset, where expert taxonomists among the authors identified the species, 15/27 species (PCI = 0.56±0.18) display a barcode gap; when only species assessed as having consistent expert morphological identification are examined, 13/20 species (PCI = 0.65±0.19). For each of the datasets (complete, GenBank, and non-GenBank), a 2×2 table was constructed, by subdividing on the likelihood of morphological misidentification by experts and on misidentification with ITS. The Fisher exact test did not indicate a significant systematic relationship between expert and ITS misidentification in any dataset (complete, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0054529.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; GenBank, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0054529.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; non-GenBank, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0054529.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) (As always, lack of significance could reflect an insufficient sample size.).</p>

        <title>Barcode Analysis</title>
        <p>With rare but important exceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Bejerano1">[51]</xref>, MSAs of most non-protein markers like ITS contain many gaps, and the gaps do little to elucidate biological sequence relationships. In the muscle3.6 MSA of our unique sequences, e.g., fully 64% (208,349/326,742) of the MSA characters were gap characters. Unexpectedly, however, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2</xref> indicates that even without the computational expense of calculating a phylogenetic tree, the MSA contains most of the information required to identify species. For evolutionary distances, the PCIs from an MSA are competitive with the PCIs from global pairwise alignment. When feasible alternatives exist for barcode markers in a taxon (e.g., as was the case in fungi, plants, or insects), such competitiveness can have important implications, as follows.</p>
        <p>Presently, except for ITS, official barcode markers are exclusively protein-coding gene regions, perhaps partially reflecting a practical concern. The current bioinformatics workflow in BOLD (the Barcode of Life Database) creates MSAs with the program HMMer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Eddy1">[52]</xref>. If for a non-protein marker, PCIs from MSAs are noticeably inferior to PCIs from other computational methods, the choice of a non- protein marker might require BOLD to redesign its bioinformatics workflow. To the contrary, however, our results suggest that even for the non- protein marker ITS, computationally rapid species identification using MSAs competes with species identification using pairwise alignment. Thus, BOLD might well be able to use non-protein barcode markers and still preserve its present bioinformatics workflow for species assignment.</p>
        <p>Our results also reinforce the prior theoretical wisdom that global alignment is superior to local alignment in species identification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Erickson1">[43]</xref>. On one hand, local alignment (in its so-called “linear regime” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Arratia1">[53]</xref>) sometimes behaves like global alignment, aligning entire sequences. Indeed, under UCSC scoring, PCIs from local alignment were comparable with PCIs from global alignment. On the other hand, local alignment (in its so-called “logarithmic regime” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Arratia1">[53]</xref>) sometimes examines only very select subsequences within a sequence pair. Under NCBI scoring, when compared to global alignment, local alignment produced a noticeably inferior PCI when based on evolutionary distance (although the PCIs based on alignment distance remained comparable).</p>
        <p>These observations could have some relevance to barcode studies relying on the popular BLAST program for local alignment. Our results suggest that some species identifications based purely on BLAST might be more accurate if based on global alignment, particularly for non-protein markers whose alignments often contain long insertions and deletions. Note, however, that studies usually base species identifications on the BLAST similarity score (equivalent to the local alignment distance in the present context), not on evolutionary distance. The use of BLAST as a standard for comparison in bioinformatics studies assessing species identification algorithms might be suspect, however, and merits further study.</p>
        <p>Statistically, our study could not distinguish the PCIs from global and semi-global alignment. Although computer programs implementing the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment are readily available, our study therefore lends empirical support to substituting semi-global alignment for global alignment, if convenient.</p>
        <p>For global alignment under NCBI and UCSC scoring, PCI differences were not significant, suggesting that at least within limits, species identification is robust against changes in the scoring system used for global sequence alignment. Our results also bear on current debate over whether the choice of evolutionary distance influences the computational efficacy of species identification with barcodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Kwong1">[54]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Collins1">[56]</xref>. In our hands, the PCIs for all evolutionary distances were identical, indicating that the choice of evolutionary distance is immaterial to species identification with barcodes. The proportion in a pairwise alignment of nucleotide pairs consisting of different nucleotides (p-distance) is a particularly simple distance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Little1">[57]</xref>, so our results also support the methods of the Edinburgh conference on plant barcodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-CBOL1">[40]</xref>, which relied on p-distance without exhaustively examining alternative evolutionary distances.</p>
        <p>In our study, non-GenBank data produced larger PCIs than GenBank data, suggesting that the GenBank entries might have contained unknown biases or even incorrect taxonomy, making them less reliable than sequences collected specifically for a barcode study. Conclusions about barcode efficacy drawn from GenBank data lacking the keyword “barcode” might therefore merit some caution.</p>
        <p>To assess the influence of taxonomic misidentification on our analysis, we partitioned clade species on whether different experts are likely display consistency in morphological identification, i.e., on whether “experts agree” or “experts disagree”. (Like morphological identification, the partition itself is necessarily subjective.) After partitioning species by whether or not experts agree, each GenBank PCI remained less than the non-GenBank PCI. Perhaps surprisingly, the Fisher Exact test did not indicate a significant correlation between expert agreement and ITS misidentification in any of the GenBank, non-GenBank, or complete dataset (see the Results section).</p>
        <p>Our results do suggest, however, that morphological misidentification might have lowered the absolute magnitude of PCIs for ITS. Even in the subset of species where experts agree, however, only 10/22 species were correctly identified (PCI = 0.45±0.20) in the complete dataset, and only 13/20 species (PCI = 0.65±0.19) in the non-GenBank dataset. Moreover, even under a hypothetical perfect identification of “true” species, PCIs for species where expert disagree seem unlikely to exceed PCIs for other species. Thus, the “true” PCI for the subset of non-GenBank data where experts disagree seems unlikely to exceed PCI = 0.65±0.19, and it could easily be lower, even if the Fisher Exact test was unable to detect any systematic shift.</p>
        <p>To summarize, even the most optimistic of the PCIs we report within the clade are lower than the PCI of 0.73 reported across all fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Schoch1">[36]</xref>. Our assessment of the efficacy of ITS in the <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic>-<italic>Hypoxylon</italic> clade is therefore more pessimistic than conclusions in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-SanchezBallesteros1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Lee1">[31]</xref>. Possible causes for our more pessimistic assessment include our relatively large sample from the clade (265 sequences for barcode analysis, compared to about 30–40 unique sequences in each of the previous studies) and the use of PCI, a stringent and numerical criterion for the success of species identification.</p>
        <p>Within the <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic>-<italic>Hypoxylon</italic> clade, therefore, ITS yields PCIs considered slightly low for a DNA barcode. If PCIs for <italic>Annulohypoxylon</italic> and <italic>Hypoxylon</italic> prove typical of fungal PCIs, and PCIs decrease with deeper sampling, a fungal barcode will have rely on secondary markers, just as the tentative plant barcode combining rbcL and matK did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-CBOL1">[40]</xref>.</p>

          <p>A pairwise alignment (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054529.s001">Figure S1</xref>) can be: (a) global, matching the whole length of two sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Needleman1">[58]</xref>; (b) semi-global, matching one sequence to a subsequence of the other, and then vice versa; or (c) local, matching all subsequences of two sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Smith1">[59]</xref>. In addition, muscle3.6 aligned the sequences under its default parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Edgar1">[60]</xref>. The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) contains within it an implicit but complete set of global pairwise alignments. Our study examined both NCBI and UCSC default scoring systems for DNA alignment (given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054529.s003">Text S1</xref> Tables 2 and 3).</p>

          <title>The two basic types of distance</title>
          <p>For each of the four alignment types, two basic types of distance were considered. Each alignment type yielded an alignment distance (labeled “distance” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054529-g002">Figure 2</xref> lumps the corresponding results together as “evolutionary”.</p>
          <p>Thus, each of the four alignment types yielded results for the two types of distance. The same results were also computed for the GenBank and non-GenBank subsets of the complete data, using only the NCBI scoring system.</p>
          <p>Alignment-free algorithms are simple and promise faster computation than alignment-based methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Little1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Kuksa1">[61]</xref>, but presently, they have not been widely examined for species identification, so they were not explored.</p>

        <title>Supplementary Phylogenetic Analysis</title>
        <p>To evaluate whether the species were recovered as monophyletic group, the multiple alignment from muscle3.6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Edgar1">[60]</xref> was analyzed under maximum parsimony (MP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Larget1">[62]</xref> using the heuristic search option in PAUP*ver4.0b10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Swofford1">[63]</xref>. Two phylogenetic trees were generated, one rooted on the outgroup <italic>Nemania serpens</italic>, and one unrooted. Gaps were treated both as missing data and as a fifth character. Branch lengths equal to zero were collapsed to polytomies. Nonparametric bootstrap support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Felsenstein1">[64]</xref> for each clade was tested with the fast-step option, using 10,000 replicates, yielding a consistency index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Kluge1">[65]</xref>, retention index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Farris1">[66]</xref>, and homoplasy index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Farris1">[66]</xref>. The gaps as a fifth state degraded the phylogeny compared to gaps as missing data, so we do not present the tree corresponding to gaps as a fifth state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054529-Ogden1">[67]</xref>.</p>

          <p>A schematic diagram of three types of sequence alignments. For each of the three types of alignments diagrammed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054529.s001">Figure S1</xref>, the line segments represent pairs of sequences. The rectangles on the sequences represent similar pairs of subsequences. Alignments are indicated in red, with red boxes representing aligned similar subsequences; and red line segments, aligned dissimilar subsequences (which carry a penalty for the corresponding mismatches or gaps). The gray boxes represent unaligned but similar subsequences. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054529.s001">Figure S1a</xref>, global alignment (the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm) finds the best alignment for the entire length of the sequence pair, with penalties for gaps at the alignment ends. It therefore reflects similarity and dissimilarity throughout the full length of the sequences. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054529.s001">Figure S1b</xref>, semi-global alignment (a variant of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm) finds the best alignment of the whole of second sequence against a subsequence within the first sequence, without penalizing end gaps in the other sequence. Semi-global alignment then reverses the role of the two sequences (finding the best alignment of the whole of first sequence against a subsequence within the second sequence) and returns the better of the two best alignments. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054529.s001">Figure S1c</xref>, local alignment (the Smith-Waterman algorithm or the heuristic BLAST algorithm) finds the best subsequence alignment within the sequence pair. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054529.s001">Figure S1c</xref> shows that local alignment can fail to take all similarities and dissimilarities into consideration, particularly if the corresponding global alignment contains long insertions and deletions. Thus, (a) “global alignment” matches the whole length of two sequences; (b) “semi-global alignment” matches one sequence to a subsequence of the other, and then vice versa; and (c) “local alignment” matches all subsequences of two sequences.</p>
