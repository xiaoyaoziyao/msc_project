<abstract>
<p>Poor solute transport through the cartilage endplate (CEP) impairs disc nutrition and could be a key factor that limits the success of intradiscal biologic therapies. Here we demonstrate that treating the CEP with matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) reduces the matrix constituents that impede solute uptake and thereby improves nutrient diffusion. Human CEP tissues harvested from four fresh cadaveric lumbar spines (age range: 38–66 years old) were treated with MMP-8. Treatment caused a dose-dependent reduction in sGAG, localized reductions to the amount of collagen, and alterations to collagen structure. These matrix modifications corresponded with 16–24% increases in the uptake of a small solute (376 Da). Interestingly, the effects of MMP-8 treatment depended on the extent of non-enzymatic glycation: treated CEPs with high concentrations of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) exhibited the lowest uptake compared to treated CEPs with low concentrations of AGEs. Moreover, AGE concentrations were donor-specific, and the donor tissues with the highest AGE concentrations appeared to have lower uptake than would be expected based on the initial amounts of collagen and sGAG. Finally, increasing solute uptake in the CEP improved cell viability inside diffusion chambers, which supports the nutritional relevance of enhancing the transport properties of the CEP. Taken together, our results provide new insights and <italic>in vitro</italic> proof-of-concept for a treatment approach that could improve disc nutrition for biologic therapy: specifically, matrix reduction by MMP-8 can enhance solute uptake and nutrient diffusion through the CEP, and AGE concentration appears to be an important, patient-specific factor that influences the efficacy of this approach.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Low back pain is the most common and most costly musculoskeletal condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref001">1</xref>], and is significantly associated with intervertebral disc degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref002">2</xref>]. Current medical interventions for disc degeneration are surgical in nature and are often unsuccessful, which motivates development of noninvasive alternatives. Noninvasive treatments to regenerate the disc and alleviate pain are largely experimental and focus on implanting new cells to produce matrix lost during degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref005">5</xref>], or injecting growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref006">6</xref>], genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref007">7</xref>], or other small molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref009">9</xref>] to stimulate matrix synthesis or reduce catabolism and inflammation. Importantly, all of these biologic therapies require a rich nutrient supply to sustain higher cell numbers or metabolic rates. However, the avascular and degenerated disc has a poor nutrient supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref010">10</xref>], which may limit the utility of biologic therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref013">13</xref>]. Development of treatment strategies to improve disc nutrition may therefore expand the application and utility of biologic therapy as well as inform alternative approaches for slowing or reversing degeneration.</p>
<p>Proper disc nutrition involves nutrient and metabolite exchange between the nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and vertebral capillaries, and several factors can impair the normal patterns of solute exchange. For example, nutrients entering the disc and exiting metabolites must diffuse through the cartilage endplates (CEP), and diffusion could be hindered by age- or degeneration-related changes to the CEP matrix, including dehydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref014">14</xref>], mineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref017">17</xref>], and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref018">18</xref>]. In addition to altering the mechanical functionality of the CEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref019">19</xref>], which is also physiologically important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref021">21</xref>], these matrix changes impact CEP biotransport functionality too. Specifically, dehydration prevents solutes from diffusing freely within the CEP; and increased deposition of proteoglycan, collagen, and mineral limits the amount of pore space available to solutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref023">23</xref>]. Indeed, we recently found that CEPs with higher amounts of collagen, aggrecan, and mineral hindered nutrient diffusion, thereby impairing NP cell survival and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref017">17</xref>]. This suggests that discs with deficient CEP transport properties may be poor candidates for biologic therapies that increase nutrient demands; it also motivates strategies for enhancing solute transport through the CEP to improve nutrition and cell survival.</p>
<p>Strategies for enhancing solute transport through the CEP are underexplored. Since solute-hindering CEPs had higher amounts of collagen and aggrecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref017">17</xref>], one potential strategy involves matrix modification to reduce collagen and aggrecan. To this end, several human and bacterial enzymes have activity for these matrix constituents, including collagenases, aggrecanases, and gelatinases. Human matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are attractive candidates since they are naturally expressed in the intervertebral disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref025">25</xref>]. Among MMPs, MMP-8 has selectivity for type II collagen (the main collagen present in the CEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref026">26</xref>]) and aggrecan. Thus, we sought to test the concept of matrix modification for enhancing CEP transport properties by enzymatic removal of matrix constituents using human MMP-8. Although MMP-8 has been used to enhance the transport properties of tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref028">28</xref>], its effects on cartilage are unknown. We hypothesized that MMP-8 would liberate collagen and aggrecan from the CEP matrix and enhance CEP transport properties.</p>

<title>Cartilage endplate treatment</title>
<p>Intact human cartilage endplates were harvested from four fresh cadaveric lumbar spines (age range: 38–66 years old; mean age: 56 ± 10 years) belonging to donors with no history of musculoskeletal disorders or disc herniation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215218.s007">S2 Table</xref>). This study involving cadaveric tissues was exempt from institutional approval. From each L4 and L5 disc, full-thickness CEP samples including any calcified cartilage, were removed from the subchondral bone adjacent to the nucleus pulposus with a razor blade. The CEPs derived from the L4 and L5 discs were treated as independent samples because there was no pairwise association or agreement between the transport properties of the L4 and L5 CEP tissues. From these CEPs, circular biopsies (4 mm diameter) were prepared and bisected perpendicular to the CEP surface to create two semi-circular halves: one half for treatment and the other for site-matched control. CEP samples were placed in 100 μL of collagenase reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM sodium azide, pH 7.6) with or without 0.2 U/mL, 2 U/mL, or 20 U/mL recombinant MMP-8 (<italic>n</italic> = 8 site-matched half biopsies per group, comprised of 2 half biopsies per donor from all 4 donors).

CEP samples were washed 3X with PBS, blotted dry, and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes containing 200 μL of 0.1 mg/mL sodium fluorescein (376 Da) or 2 mM liposomes. After equilibrating overnight in the fluorescein solution, the CEP samples were extracted, blotted dry, weighed, and dehydrated by lyophilization at 80°C for 2 h.

The nucleus pulposus was removed from each disc, washed with sterile PBS containing 2% penicillin-streptomycin, and cut into approximately 0.125 cm<sup>3</sup>-sized pieces. The dissected tissue was digested inside 50 mL conical tubes containing standard cell growth medium supplemented with 0.8 mg/mL collagenase P (cat. no. 11 213 857 001). The standard growth medium was comprised of low-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), 1% non-essential amino acids (Thermo Fisher), 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1.5% osmolarity salts (5 M NaCl and 0.4 M KCl).

<title>Diffusion chambers</title>
<p>To determine if MMP-8 treatment improves nutrient diffusion through the CEP, we used diffusion chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref017">17</xref>], which mimic the nutrient environment of the disc <italic>in vivo</italic>. Briefly, NP cells cultured inside the chamber obtain nutrients that diffuse through full-thickness CEP tissues at the open sides of the chamber (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215218.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). By imposing culture conditions with identical chamber cell density (dictates nutrient demand), we determined how differences in transport properties between untreated versus treated CEPs affected NP cell viability. The design of the diffusion chambers was modified from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref037">37</xref>]. Each chamber was comprised of two parallel glass slides (25 x 75 mm) separated by 170 μm-tall impermeable spacers. After overnight treatment, OCT-embedded CEP samples were cryo-sectioned perpendicular to the CEP surface (180 μm section width). CEP sections were then washed for 90 min with sterile PBS containing antibiotics: 0.012% penicillin, 0.02% streptomycin, and 0.01% gentamicin. Next, two coronally adjacent sections from each CEP were placed with the deep layer of the CEP at the open sides of the chambers (<italic>n</italic> = 12 sections per group, with 4 each from donors 1–3). Next, the NP cell-agarose mixture was pipetted into the center of the chambers, the chambers were placed in 100 mm-diameter dishes with 25 mL of growth medium, and the dishes were incubated for 72 h at 37°C.

<title>Determinants of solute uptake with MMP-8 treatment</title>
<p>To understand the factors that influence solute uptake following MMP-8 treatment, we investigated the roles of collagen quantity and quality. Separating the MMP-8-treated samples into equal-sized groups with low versus high collagen contents hinted that samples with higher collagen contents pre-treatment had lower fluorescein uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215218.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), although the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.26). Instead, uptake post-treatment was more strongly related to the degree of non-enzymatic glycation: the treated CEP samples with the lowest AGE concentrations pre-treatment had 20% greater fluorescein uptake on average (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03) compared to treated samples with the highest AGE concentrations pre-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215218.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). AGE concentrations affected fluorescein uptake in the untreated CEP tissues too: CEP tissues with high AGE concentrations had 19% lower uptake on average (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0003, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215218.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Moreover, AGE concentrations and treatment effects were donor-specific. CEP tissues from donor 4, and to a lesser extent donor 1, had higher AGE concentrations compared to the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215218.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), and the elevated AGE concentrations in the CEP tissues from those donors coincided with lower uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215218.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). This was true despite donor 4 having similar sGAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215218.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) and less collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215218.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) initially, which would be expected to associate with greater uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref022">22</xref>].</p>

<title>MMP-8 activity on nutrient transport in the CEP</title>
<p>To determine the biologic relevance of matrix modification with MMP-8 treatment, we tested the CEP tissues from donors 1–3 in diffusion chambers containing bovine NP cells. A single dose of 2 U/mL was chosen because this dose showed the greatest reduction in matrix with the smallest loss in fixed charge density. MMP-8 treatment at 2 U/mL significantly increased the viable distance in the diffusion chambers by an average 13% (range: 4–28%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215218.g006">Fig 6</xref>), indicating improved nutrient diffusion through the CEP between the culture medium outside the chambers and the NP cells inside the chambers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These results show that MMP-8 treatment improves the uptake of a small solute into cadaveric human CEP tissues (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0004 to 0.06). This increase in uptake was mainly driven by a greater amount of pore space available to the solutes. For example, MMP-8 treatment led to dose-dependent reductions in sGAG in the CEP by up to 20%, which coincided with increases in the uptake of fluorescein by 16–24%. MMP-8 treatment also caused localized reductions to the amount of collagen and alterations to collagen structural order. Importantly, the effects of MMP-8 treatment depended significantly on the extent of non-enzymatic cross-linking of the CEP matrix: overall, treated CEP tissues with the lowest AGE concentrations showed 20% greater fluorescein uptake following treatment compared to treated tissues with the highest AGE concentrations. Moreover, AGE concentrations in the CEP were donor-specific, and the donor with CEP tissues having the highest AGE concentrations showed the lowest solute uptake, despite having a similar amount of sGAG initially and the lowest amount of collagen compared to the other donors. Finally, increasing solute uptake improved cell viability inside diffusion chambers, which supports the biologic relevance of enhancing the transport properties of the CEP and indicates increased nutrient diffusion. Poor nutrient diffusion through the CEP impairs disc nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref017">17</xref>] and may limit the efficacy of regenerative therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref017">17</xref>]. Yet, we are aware of no treatment approaches for improving diffusion. Taken together, our results provide new insights and <italic>in vitro</italic> proof-of-concept into a treatment approach that could potentially improve nutrition for biologic therapy: specifically, matrix reduction by MMP-8 can enhance solute uptake and nutrient diffusion through the CEP, and AGE concentration appears to be an important, patient-specific factor that influences the efficacy of this approach.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that MMP-8 treatment may reverse some of the age- or degeneration-related factors that could hinder nutrient transport. For example, in our prior study we reported that CEPs that hindered nutrient diffusion had multiple compositional deficits consistent with fibrotic changes, including higher amounts of collagen and aggrecan, more mineral, and fewer mature cross-links [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref017">17</xref>]. Other groups have reported similar relationships between solute transport and the amounts of various matrix constituents, including collagen, aggrecan, and mineral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref036">36</xref>]. It is not presently clear which of these deficits is most important, or if reversing only some of the deficits is sufficient. Notwithstanding, MMP-8 treatment reduced the amounts of collagen and aggrecan and improved nutrient diffusion. Together, the available data suggest that fibrotic changes play a significant role in poor disc nutrition and that MMP-8 treatment has mechanistic effects.</p>
<p>Examination of the effects of MMP-8 treatment revealed a tradeoff between liberating matrix to increase pore space versus maintaining CEP swelling pressure. Cartilage swelling is a balance between the negative fixed charge density of the proteoglycans and tensile stresses in the collagen network, which resist tissue swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref038">38</xref>]. Here, MMP-8 treatment induced damage to the collagen network and increased uptake, despite the loss in sGAG. This is consistent with results following collagenase treatment of articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref039">39</xref>]. However, raising the MMP-8 dose released increasing amounts of sGAG from the CEP, but the corresponding improvements in solute uptake did not scale with sGAG release (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215218.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215218.g003">3</xref>). This suggests that although collagen damage in combination with some loss of sGAG improves solute uptake, removal of too much sGAG is counterproductive since it lowers fixed charge density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215218.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and swelling pressure.</p>
<p>Removal of too much matrix from the CEP or inducing excessive collagen damage could also have biomechanical consequences. For example, the collagen network helps resist tissue deformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref040">40</xref>], and proteoglycans in the CEP are believed to help prevent the loss of proteoglycan aggregates from the nucleus pulposus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref022">22</xref>]. Additional work is required to determine if appreciable improvements in solute transport can be achieved without compromising CEP biomechanical function.</p>
<p>An important finding of this study is that solute uptake in both treated and untreated CEPs was lowest in tissues with high AGE concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215218.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215218.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). AGEs are formed through non-enzymatic glycation of the free amino groups of proteins by reducing sugars, and AGE accumulation in low-turnover proteins of the disc increases with ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref041">41</xref>] and is accelerated by metabolic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref044">44</xref>] and with AGE-rich diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref045">45</xref>]. High AGE concentrations could negatively impact solute uptake in several ways. First, AGEs decrease water content by lowering the hydrophilic charge of the GAGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref046">46</xref>], which could reduce the volume of water available for solute diffusion. Second, increased inter- and intra-molecular crosslinks may hinder the release of degraded protein fragments, which could limit solute penetration. Although a larger sample size with greater variation in AGEs is needed to elucidate their role, these factors could explain why solute uptake in CEPs with high AGE concentrations appeared to be lower than expected based on the amounts of collagen and sGAG alone.</p>
<p>Related, our finding that solute uptake was lower in treated CEPs with high AGE concentrations is also consistent with known effects of AGEs on proteolysis. Specifically, AGEs can directly impair the matrix-digesting activity of MMPs by altering the structure of the protein and thereby interfering with enzyme-matrix interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref049">49</xref>]. Altogether, these results suggest that application of matrix-modifying enzymes to improve nutrient transport may require tuning to patient-specific factors such as matrix cross-linking.</p>
<p>Although we focused on MMP-8, it is important to note that other enzymes with activity for CEP matrix constituents may achieve similar effects. It is also possible that a combination of matrix-modifying enzymes may allow for optimal removal of inhibitory matrix constituents while maintaining tissue integrity. These issues will be essential for future <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Regardless of the specific enzyme selected, special considerations will be required when using native forms of the enzyme with post-translational modifications that can affect enzymatic activity and regulation.</p>
<p>This study had several limitations. First, we evaluated the effects of MMP-8 in diffusive conditions that occurred under a free-swelling environment, while static or dynamic compressive loading of the CEP could increase transport via forced solute convection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref050">50</xref>]. The role of solute convection in disc nutrition is unclear, but we expect the present data to be representative of the relative effects of MMP-8.</p>
<p>A second limitation is that we treated CEP tissues <italic>in vitro</italic>, and treating CEP tissues <italic>in vivo</italic> warrants several considerations. Specifically, CEP tissues were denuded of cells, and studying CEP tissues with viable chondrocytes may be important in accounting for local nutrient gradients over time, or to address long-term changes in CEP matrix turnover. However, we presently sought to take a snapshot of the compositional characteristics of the CEP, and from that, identify how variations in those characteristics and their response to MMP-8 treatment impacts nutrient diffusion. In this context, we believe the lack of viable chondrocytes, which are estimated to be between 6- and 10-fold fewer in number compared to NP cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref051">51</xref>], is unlikely to change overall conclusions about the effects of MMP-8 on nutrient diffusion.</p>
<p>A related consideration is the effects of MMP-8 treatment on cellular signaling. For example, MMP-8 expression has been shown to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory factors by breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref052">52</xref>]. Also, the biologic effects of matrix fragments following proteolysis, which could activate toll-like receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref053">53</xref>], may also be important. Having now established that matrix modification can enhance the transport properties of the CEP by enzymatic removal of matrix constituents <italic>in vitro</italic>, our current results motivate future studies to explore these biologic effects of MMP-8 treatment and matrix modification <italic>in vivo</italic>. In support, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies utilizing collagenases to increase tissue permeability showed minimal toxicity and off-target digestion at doses that increased solute uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0215218.ref054">54</xref>]. From a practical standpoint, targeted delivery of MMP-8 to the CEP could be achieved via injection under fluoroscopic guidance, and engineering approaches such as linking the enzyme to bulky nanoparticles could be used to control unwanted migration within the disc and to limit off-target activity.</p>
<p>Poor solute transport through the CEP impairs disc nutrition and could be a key factor that limits the success of intradiscal biologic therapies, which by design, increase nutrient demands. Thus, enhancing nutrient supply may be required to expand the application and utility of these emerging therapies, as well as inform alternative approaches for slowing or reversing degeneration. One strategy for enhancing nutrient supply involves targeted removal of proteins that impede solute transport in the CEP. Our current results showed that removal of CEP matrix constituents with MMP-8 increases solute uptake and nutrient diffusion <italic>in vitro</italic>. This effect was sensitive to AGE concentration, which limited solute uptake and susceptibility to MMP-8 activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that matrix reduction can enhance solute uptake and nutrient diffusion through the CEP, and that AGE concentration appears to be an important, patient-specific factor that influences the efficacy of this approach.</p>
