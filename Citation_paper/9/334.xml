<abstract>
<p>Integrative taxonomy is an approach for defining species and genera by taking phylogenetic, morphological, physiological, and ecological data into account. This approach is appropriate for microalgae, where morphological convergence and high levels of morphological plasticity complicate the application of the traditional classification. Although DNA barcode markers are well-established for animals, fungi, and higher plants, there is an ongoing discussion about suitable markers for microalgae and protists because these organisms are genetically more diverse compared to the former groups. To solve these problems, we assess the usage of a polyphasic approach combining phenotypic and genetic parameters for species and generic characterization. The application of barcode markers for database queries further allows conclusions about the ‘coverage’ of culture-based approaches in biodiversity studies and integrates additional aspects into modern taxonomic concepts. Although the culture-dependent approach revealed three new lineages, which are described as new species in this paper, the culture-independent analyses discovered additional putative new species. We evaluated three barcode markers (V4, V9 and ITS-2 regions, nuclear ribosomal operon) and studied the morphological and physiological plasticity of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, which became a model organism because its whole genome sequence has been published. In addition, several biotechnological patents have been registered for <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>. <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> representatives are distributed worldwide, are free-living or in symbioses, and colonize terrestrial and aquatic habitats. We investigated more than 40 strains and reviewed the biodiversity and biogeographical distribution of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species using DNA barcoding. The genus <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> formed a monophyletic group within the Trebouxiophyceae separated into seven independent phylogenetic lineages representing species. Summarizing, the combination of different characteristics in an integrative approach helps to evaluate environmental data and clearly identifies microalgae at generic and species levels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microalgae and protozoa (protists) are traditionally classified according to morphological and cytological characteristics of vegetative stages in their life cycle. Phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal genes (SSU and ITS rDNA sequences) have demonstrated that this morphological concept is artificial for most of the microalgal genera and should be revised [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several studies have shown that the morphology could be dependent on environmental factors and can vary under different environmental conditions, which led to uncertain identification at the species level, especially in investigations of natural samples using light microscopy [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, green algae have been divided into two major groups according to their reproductive mechanism: sexual or asexual species. In species that exhibit sexual reproduction, crossing experiments can be conducted to test the biological species concept and identify organisms at the species level, but the situation for asexual species is more complex. Organisms such as coccoid green microalgae often lack characteristic morphological features and therefore cannot be classified at a higher taxonomic level without additional data. For example based on SSU rDNA sequences, species of the genus <italic>Chlorella</italic> (in traditional morphological sense) occur in different lineages of the Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae (see details in [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and references therein). Summarizing, two scenarios concerning morphological characteristics based on phylogenetic studies exist: (i) morphologically similar species belong to different phylogenetic lineages or (ii) species of different shapes and morphology are closely related and form a monophyletic lineage. Morphological characteristics, commonly used for the traditional classification of algae, need to be evaluated for each genus and species before being used as diagnostic characteristics in taxonomy. However, because these morphological evaluations are very time consuming and require experience, the molecular species concept seems to be the only method to distinguish organisms and define species and genera in a short period ([<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and references therein). The ‘molecular revolution’ resulted in an ongoing active discussion about the appropriate scale for species delimitation for a functional, meaningful taxonomy. Further difficulties arise from the nomenclatural rules for naming species. The International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi and Plants (ICN; Melbourne Code, [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) solely regulates the naming process of species without an evaluation of characteristics leading to the species identification. However, as previously mentioned this evaluation process for assigning a scientifically correct name to a species is often difficult and time consuming. The latest version of ICN allows the depositing of DNA and cultured material (in a metabolic inactive state) as type material for a species name, but it is not commonly used. Taxonomic revision using this approach is impossible for large scale environmental studies and has been recently replaced by DNA barcoding. The International Barcoding of Life Initiative (IBOL; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ibol.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.ibol.org</ext-link>) aims to find a single, universal, short DNA fragment that is easy to sequence and leads to a clear species identification. Zoologists and mycologists established the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (<italic>cox 1</italic> or COI) and nuclear internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal operon (ITS) respectively as general barcode markers [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A combination of two plastid markers (<italic>rbcL</italic> and <italic>matK</italic>) has been proposed as DNA barcode markers for land plants [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, a general marker for microalgae and protists has not been proposed because of the high diversity in different genes among those organisms resulting in different markers for each group. As a pre-barcode marker two variable regions of the SSU rDNA sequences called the V4 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and V9 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] regions have been suggested. The internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS-2) is often used for phylogenetic studies of microalgae at species level, but it has not been proposed as a barcode marker because of the difficulties with the alignment of sequences and the prediction of secondary structure. However, ITS-2 and its corresponding secondary structure provides a unique possibility to predict the mating ability of sexual organism; therefore, it is very useful for the discrimination of biological species [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Considering the presence of compensatory base changes (CBCs) in the secondary structures of ITS rDNA sequences, the genus and species can be defined and show additional genetic signatures [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, if two specimens differ in at least one CBC in the conserved region of ITS-2, they cannot mate [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Demchenko et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have used this region of ITS-2 as barcode marker for the green algal genus <italic>Microglena</italic> to support the species delimitation of this genus. The usage of ITS-2 as barcode marker among protists and microalgae, especially in asexual species is still unused at a larger scale and must be validated.</p>
<p>In a taxonomic context, DNA sequence information without other corroborating evidence can never be used by itself as an indicator for species delimitation [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, molecular phylogenetic studies often reveal cryptic species, which are also discussed as operational taxonomical units (OTUs). It is not clearly defined whether the detected sequence differences could result in the delimitation of different species. One explanation is that lineage sorting is in progress and has not been completed yet. However, it is also possible that the detected differences are meaningless for taxonomic purposes, and the resolution of genetic differences has been considerably too detailed. A reasonable approach to a meaningful identification of species and taxa at all levels must be connected to a specimen (a voucher in a herbarium or a culture in a collection) of the target organism. A consequence of that uncertainty is that sequence databases are filled with entries that can be assigned to neither a morphotype nor a species name (e.g. ‘environmental sample’) or an ecological context (e.g. ‘unidentified Trebouxiophyceae’).</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate for the first time a compromise using an integrative approach for characterization of cultured green algal material, and their distribution pattern in different habitats to evaluate culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. We used the model organism <italic>Coccomyxa subellipsoidea</italic> and its close relatives for this study, which is the first terrestrial green alga for which the genome was completely sequenced [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The genus <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> belongs to the green algal class Trebouxiophyceae (sister to the Chlorophyceae and Ulvophyceae), which can be subdivided by molecular approaches into the <italic>Chlorella</italic>-, <italic>Oocystis-</italic> and <italic>Trebouxia-</italic> lineages (<italic>sensu</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), the latter consisting of mostly terrestrial species. So far all known members of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> belong to the <italic>Elliptochloris</italic>-clade [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Representatives of the genus <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> occur as free-living in terrestrial green biofilms, as soil algae and associated with mosses [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as well as planktonic in limnic ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Further, this genus participates in symbiotic associations with asco- and basidiomycetes [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], with higher plants [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and is able to infest marine mussels [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> even occurs as a contaminant in chemical solutions or distilled water in laboratories [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or in the cooling water of a nuclear power plant [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, no evidence has been published about the distribution of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> free-living in marine environment. <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> has a worldwide distribution, can also form biofilms, can be dominant in certain ecosystems and displays a remarkable versatility in habitat and lifestyle [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Representatives of this genus are characterized by a small size (6–14 x 3–6 μm), an irregular elliptical to globular cell shape, a parietal chloroplast shape without a pyrenoid and the absence of any flagellated stages [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>-like organisms have been subdivided into three genera according to their morphology. Fott [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] transferred all species of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> lacking mucilage to <italic>Choricystis</italic> and all species with a one-sided mucilage cap (previously described by Jaag) to the genus <italic>Pseudococcomyxa</italic>. Therefore, only species with huge, partly layered mucilage remained in the genus <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Pröschold et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have shown that <italic>Choricystis</italic> represents its own phylogenetic lineage among the Trebouxiophyceae, but whether <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> and <italic>Pseudococcomyxa</italic> are two different genera is an open question because only iconotypes of the type species of both genera exist and no culture material is available. Fortunately, most strains investigated by Jaag [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] are available in public culture collections, and some are even the authentic material of described species.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to discover and characterize the variability of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> using an integrative approach with further implications for biodiversity investigations using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods for research on microalgae and protists. To demonstrate this approach, we focussed on the following questions: (i) How we can detect species boundaries in those asexual microorganisms? (ii) Can we find a suitable molecular barcode marker to discriminate species? (iii) Do <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>-like algae form a monophyletic group and how many species can be distinguished within this genus? (iv) Is the missing occurrence in marine habitats caused by highly sensitive physiological response to enhanced salinity? (v) Does the biodiversity of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> in culture represent its genetic diversity in nature, and are there any geographical distribution pattern, or ecological and lifestyle preferences?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, we studied all available strains of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> (including the strain NIES 2166; genome sequence) using an integrative approach (phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear SSU and ITS rDNA based on their secondary structures, phenotypic and physiological plasticity). Three barcode marker regions based on our sequences (V4, V9 and ITS-2) have been evaluated and used to uncover the distribution pattern of the species discriminated in this study by a BLAST search algorithm.

<p>The 41 strains used in this study were obtained from public and working culture collections (details in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). All algal cultures were grown in modified Bold´s Basal Medium (3N-BBM+V; medium 26a in [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]) with one exception of SAG 49.84, which only grew in 3N-BBM+V with 1% (w/v) glucose added. For the morphological observations, the strains were cultivated on liquid 3N-BBM+V under standard laboratory conditions and a light: dark cycle of 16:8 hrs at +20 ±1°C and 35 μmol photons/m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>1</sup> provided by daylight fluorescent tubes (Osram L 36W/954 Lumilux de lux daylight, Munich, Germany). To induce mucilage formation, which is regarded as a morphological feature useful for species identification, starvation experiments were conducted according to Vischer [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. 3N-BBM+V medium was modified by addition of 1% (w/v) glucose and finally diluted with distilled water (1:20 v/v). The species were identified using the identification keys of Ettl and Gärtner [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Komárek and Fott [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and compared with original descriptions of the species published by Schmidle [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], Acton [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], Chodat [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Jaag [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and Jaag and Thomas [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For the light microscopic investigations, an Olympus BX-51 was used (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

The resulting alignments were included in a concatenated dataset (2671 bp) of SSU (1784 bp), ITS-1 (402 bp), 5.8S (158 bp), ITS-2 (308 bp) and LSU (19 bp) rDNA sequences. The alignments for phylogenetic and secondary structure analyses are available as NEXUS and FASTA files in the Supplemental Material, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Datasets</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the evolutionary model that fit the dataset best (concatenated and separated according to their genes) the program Modeltest 3.7 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] was used. Considering the results of these tests, the best models were selected by the Akaike Information Criterion [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. For datasets, concatenated or partitioned according to their genes, the GTR model with a proportion of invariable sites (I) and a gamma shape parameter (G) was used for the phylogenetic analyses. The phylogenetic tree (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) was inferred by distance (neighbor-joining [NJ] using the GTR+I+G model), maximum parsimony (MP), and maximum likelihood (ML; using GTR+I+G) criteria using PAUP version 4.0b10 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], by randomized accelerated maximum likelihood using RAxML version 7.0.3 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and by Bayesian inference (BI) using MrBayes version 3.1 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and the PHASE package 2.0 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The RAxML analyses of the concatenated dataset were performed partitioned according to their genes. For PHASE analyses, four models were used according to their secondary structures and to their genes; the REV model [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] was used for the unpaired regions and the RNA7D model [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] was used for the paired regions. The Bayesian and bootstrap support for each branch in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> are summarized in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>. The tree topology presented in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> was compared with user-defined trees that were manually generated with the program TreeView 1.6.6 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The log-likelihood values of these tree topologies was calculated using PAUP and compared via approximately unbiased (AU), Kishino-Hasegawa (KH), and Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) tests using CONSEL version 0.1i [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].

<p>The phylogenetic tree shown was inferred using the maximum likelihood method based on a concatenated data set of 2671 aligned positions of 43 taxa using PAUP 4.0b10. For the analysis, the GTR+I+G model (base frequencies: A 0.2372, C 0.2575, G 0.2781, T 0.2272; rate matrix: A-C 1.3929, A-G 1.8871, A-T 1.0278, C-G 0.6574, C-T 3.7034, G-T 1.0000) with the proportion of invariable sites (I = 0.5745) and gamma distribution shape parameter (G = 0.3685) was chosen, which was calculated as the best model by Modeltest 3.7. Bayesian and bootstrap values of the branches 1–23 were calculated from the concatenated data set as well as from both genes separately using different methods, as described in Material and Methods, and these values are shown in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>.

<title>ITS2/CBC approach and species delimitation methods</title>
<p>To find molecular signatures that can be used as DNA barcodes for the identification of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species, the conserved region of ITS-2 was extracted manually from the alignment created by MARNA. According to the recommendation of Coleman [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the conserved region (highlighted in numbered boxes in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>; nos. 1–73), using the 14 bp of the 5.8S-LSU stem, the first 5 bp of Helix I, the first 11 bp of Helix II (including the pyrimidine-pyrimidine mismatch), and all base-pairs of Helix III were selected for the DNA barcode (highlighted in blue for each strain in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The resulting sequences were manually aligned again and proven automatically using MARNA. This alignment was used for finding compensatory base changes (CBCs; see <xref rid="pone.0127838.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>) using the program 4SALE version 1.7 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This sequence alignment was translated into the base-pair alignment by replacing each base-pair by a number (A–U = 1; U–A = 2, G–C = 3, C–G = 4, G•U = 5, U•G = 6, mismatch = 7, deletion or unpaired or single bases = 8; <xref rid="pone.0127838.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). In addition, a reduced SSU and ITS dataset (the taxa were represented by only one to four sequences that were removed from the complete dataset) was analyzed using the program ABGD [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] to identify barcoding gaps among the species. For another distance-based analysis (K/θ; [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]), the uncorrected p-distances were calculated by PAUP and compared following the instruction provided in Birky et al. 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The results of these analyses were compared with those of phylogeny-based methods, which were proposed in the guideline of Fontaneto et al. 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. For these analyses, the SSU and ITS data set was modified according to the instructions for each method. Identical sequences and sequences of both outgroup taxa were excluded for GMYC and PTP analyses. For GMYC [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], an ultrametric tree was calculated with BEAST 1.8.0 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] using the HKY model and a strict clock (MCMC: 10,000,000 generations; burnin 1,000,000). The consensus of the sampled trees was built with TreeAnnotator 1.8.0 of the BEAST package. The consensus tree was used as input file for the GMYC analyses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://species.h-its.org/gmyc/" xlink:type="simple">http://species.h-its.org/gmyc/</ext-link>) using both methods (single and multi threshold). For PTP [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], a maximum likelihood of the reduced GMYC data set was calculated by RAxML version 7.0.3 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and the resulting best tree was used as input file for analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://species.h-its.org/gmyc/" xlink:type="simple">http://species.h-its.org/gmyc/</ext-link>) with 500,000 MCMC generations.

<title>Salinity dependent growth response of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic></title>
<p>To investigate and evaluate the physiological variability within <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, we compared the growth rates of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species as affected by salinity. The cultures were inoculated in 3N-BBM+V adjusted to different salinities by the addition of various amounts NaCl to achieve final concentrations of 0.2 (3N-BBM+V), 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.5 and 3.3%. For SAG 49.84, 1% (w/v) glucose was added for each salinity.</p>
<p>These experiments were performed in two steps: (i) Pre-cultures were inoculated in 6-well culturing microplates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) for up to 10 days under the respective culture conditions to ensure complete adaptation of the algal cultures. These cultures were investigated by light microscopy; the length and width of ~ 100 cells of each strain was measured, and the length: width ratio was calculated (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). (ii) The pre-cultures served as the inocula for the growth experiments, which were performed in 24-well culturing microplates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) with 4 replicates per approach. Fresh medium (1 ml) was mixed with 100 μl of pre-culture to achieve a cell concentration of 0.1–0.2*10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>-1</sup>. The microplates were sealed with parafilm, and measurements were performed every 24 hrs for up to 10 days. All growth experiments were conducted under standard conditions of 20°C, 50 μmol m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> with a light:dark cycle of 16:8 hrs.</p>
<p>Growth measurements were performed using the Spectra Max M2<sup>e</sup> microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) by monitoring the increase of Chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> (chl-a) fluorescence over time as an indicator of microalgal growth according to Kitzing et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Chl-a was excited at 440 nm, and the fluorescence emission was detected at 680 nm with 21 points per well from the bottom-up. To avoid a false positive detection at 680 nm, a cut-off wavelength of 665 nm was set for the measurements. Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured every 24 hrs for up to 10 days. To evaluate the measuring range of the applied technique, a geometric serial dilution with six steps was prepared from a log-phase culture of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic> NIES 2166 in three replicates. In addition to chl-a fluorescence, we measured the traditional biomass markers cell count (by a haemocytometer) and chl-a concentration (via ethanolic extraction and photometric quantification; modified after Gustavs et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]) for every dilution step. The correlation between fluorescence and the traditional biomass markers was linear for cell counts from 0.2 to 3.1*10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>-1</sup> and chl-a concentrations from 0.06 to 0.53 mg l<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (data not shown). Maximum growth rates in the exponential phase were calculated for each of the four replicates independently by fitting the exponential growth curve with an iterative optimization procedure [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p>
<p>Salinity-dependent growth rates were calculated as median values of four replicates and the factor ‘salinity sensitivity’ results from the decline of maximal growth rate from 0.2 and 0.6% NaCl, respectively, to the pessimal growth condition at 1.8, 2.5 and 3.3%, respectively. The dataset was referenced to the most sensitive strain CAUP H5101, resulting in the highest sensitivity value for the respective strain and low sensitivity values for robust strains, e.g., SAG 2104 (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparison of different barcode markers using BLAST N search algorithm for identification of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species in environmental sequencing</title>
<p>To evaluate whether the strains sequenced in this study represented the biodiversity of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> in nature, we extracted three barcode regions from our sequences and compared those with the entries in GenBank using the BLAST N search algorithm (default settings; [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]). We used the V4 (Pos. 616–845 in our alignment) and V9 (Pos. 1631–1737) regions of the SSU rDNA sequences as well as the first three helices including the spacer regions of ITS-2 for this comparison the flanking 5.8S/LSU stem and Helix IV of ITS-2 were excluded for the BLAST search because many GenBank entries were incomplete and would result in fewer <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> records in GenBank). To detect the variability within the V4 and V9 regions, we analyzed these regions according to their secondary structures (the V4 and V9 structure are demonstrated in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref> for NIES 2166 <italic>Coccomyxa subellipsoidea</italic>) and detected the CBCs and Hemi-CBCs (HCBCs) among the species of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> (see <xref rid="pone.0127838.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>The BLAST N search was conducted using the following criteria: the extracted V4, V9, and ITS-2 regions of our strains (designated as the population identifier V4-A1-G, V9-A-F2, and ITS2-A1-G5) were used for the BLAST search.

<p>Together with <italic>Elliptochloris</italic> and <italic>Hemichloris</italic>, the genus <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> forms a monophyletic group within the green algal class Trebouxiophyceae (<italic>Elliptochloris</italic>-clade) and is the sister group to the former two genera ([<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; see also <xref rid="pone.0127838.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses of a concatenated dataset (SSU and ITS rDNA sequences) showed that 41 strains previously assigned as <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, <italic>Pseudococcomyxa</italic>, and <italic>Choricystis</italic> belong to the <italic>Elliptochloris</italic>-clade (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

<title>ITS-2/CBC approach to define species in <italic>Coccomyxa</italic></title>
<p>To decide which branches in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> should be considered species, we analyzed the conserved region of ITS-2 for discriminating species using the approach previously described by Demchenko et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This approach used the conserved region of ITS-2 (5.8S/LSU stem, the stems of Helix I and II, and all paired bases of Helix III). The procedure is described in detail in Material and Methods and demonstrated as a consensus in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127838.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> for each strain. Considering these analyses twelve different haplotypes (BC1a-7b) were discovered among <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). The CBC/HCBC analysis (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>) revealed that each of the seven species is supported by several CBCs and HCBCs. Strains belonging to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> represented different haplotypes, but those do not differ in CBCs and show differences only because of missing base pairs (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Summarizing, the seven lineages representing species in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> could be clearly differentiated using the ITS-2 approach demonstrated here, but the subdivisions within <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic> (branches 21–23), <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic> (14–18) and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> (3–5) are not supported by any CBCs/HCBCs. The genetic variability among the ITS-2 sequences of these species were as follows: <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic>: 3.6% (= 13 variable bases), <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic>: 11.4% (= 41), and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>: 13.0% (= 54). To decide the location of the species boundaries, the evolutionary distances within these three species were calculated and compared using the program ABGD. No gap within the species could be observed, but the species are clearly separated by a gap (see <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The species delimitation was confirmed by the K/θ and GMYC (single threshold), but <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> could not be resolved using GMYC (multi threshold) and PTP (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

The other remaining strains could be either identified as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic>, or <italic>C</italic>. <italic>arvernensis</italic> using traditional identification keys. However, the authentic strain of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>arvernensis</italic> is genetically identical to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> according to the phylogeny (see <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Interestingly four strains previously assigned to <italic>Choricystis</italic> showed the same characteristics (one-sided mucilage cap of the cell, oblique cell division) as the other <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> strains, and were therefore incorrectly identified by the isolator. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, species assigned to <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> and <italic>Pseudococcomyxa</italic> are mixed in our phylogeny, which poses a question about the morphological differences between both genera. As mentioned above, both genera differ only in the production of mucilage. Whereas <italic>Pseudococcomyxa</italic> is characterized by a one-sided mucilage cap at one end of the cell, the cells of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> are surrounded by mucilage [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To prove whether mucilage production is a stable morphological character of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>/<italic>Pseudococcomyxa</italic> species, we investigated nine strains (NIES 2166, CAUP H5101, SAG 216-9a, ASIB V16, SAG 2254, SAG 49.84, SAG 216–1, SAG 216–4, SAG 2325) representing all the phylogenetic lineages presented in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> under starvation conditions. The strains were investigated after 6 weeks of cultivation in 1:20 diluted medium containing 1% glucose. Seven of the nine investigated strains showed no morphological changes during the starvation experiment. Only the strains SAG 49.84 (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>dispar</italic>) and SAG 216–4 (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>) showed a noteworthy reaction. The cells of the strain SAG 216–4 started to produce individual mucilage caps, which were at least four times bigger than under standard conditions (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A–5C</xref>). The chloroplast appeared bleached and poorly visible because most of the cells were strongly vacuolized. Due to the large mucilage caps, cells adhered in huge colonies forming thick layers. The strain SAG 49.84 completely changed its typical morphology during the starvation experiment (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D–5K</xref>). The cells were surrounded by a vast mucilage layer and showed similarities with the type description of <italic>Coccomyxa dispar</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The cells had very pale chloroplasts and many vacuoles in the cytoplasm. After staining with methylen blue the mucilage showed a light structure, an intensively stained part surrounding each cell and a more fine common mucilage surrounding all the cells. Algae grown on agarized medium produced a thick mucilagenous crust, whereas a softer type of mucilage occurred in liquid medium. After the documentation of their morphology, cells were transferred to the nutrient-rich 3NBBM+V medium and checked again after two weeks. The cells had completely lost their mucilage. The mature vegetative cells became spherical. Many small vacuoles were observed in the cytoplasm. The young cells looked <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>-like, but some mature vegetative cells produced some atypical autosporangia with 16–32 daughter cells. However, the typical reproduction with two to four cells formed by oblique division was also observed. Under these conditions the algae showed similarities to <italic>Elliptochloris</italic>. The starvation experiment was repeated three times with identical results.</p>
<p>To investigate the phenotypic plasticity of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, we studied the morphological changes of 34 strains at different salinities. Figs <xref rid="pone.0127838.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127838.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> illustrate the morphological plasticity of eight strains at different salinities representing six of the seven defined <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species. Generally the following reactions resulting from higher salinity have been observed: (i) the cell wall became thicker under salinity stress (ii) the cell size increased under 0.6 and 1.2% salinity (iii) the cell number of sporangia containing 4 to 8 daughter cells increased, which is not typical for natural and standard culturing conditions (3N-BBM+V medium), respectively; (iv) in saline media the lysis of the mother cell wall was inhibited, whereas it is usually very quickly dissolved under standard culturing conditions, but the typical mucilage caps, common for <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> under standard conditions, have not been observed during salinity stress, and (v) the cells became more vacuolized with increasing salinities.</p>

<p>Summarizing the reaction of all investigated strains to different salinities, it could be classified into three types: <italic>sensitive</italic>, <italic>intermediately sensitive</italic> and <italic>robust</italic>. To document the response to salt stress the cell size and shape were compared to those under standard conditions as control (Figs <xref rid="pone.0127838.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, and <xref rid="pone.0127838.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). The three types of reactions are documented in few examples for each types as follows: 1. <italic>Sensitive</italic>: CAUP H5101 (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>; <xref rid="pone.0127838.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A–6F</xref>), 2. <italic>Intermediately sensitive</italic>: CCAP 812/3 (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G–6L</xref>), CCAP 216/24 (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6M–6R</xref>), ASIB V16 (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>vinatzeri</italic>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6S–6X</xref>), CCAP 211/97 (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>galuniae</italic>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A–7F</xref>), and 3. <italic>robust</italic>: SAG 216–1 (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G–7L</xref>), SAG 216–4 (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7M–7R</xref>) and SAG 2325 (all <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>; <xref rid="pone.0127838.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7S–7X</xref>). These reactions were also confirmed via the measurement of length and width and the resulting calculation of the length:width ratio as shown in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>. The cells of the most sensitive strain CAUP H5101 (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>) became increasingly spherical starting at 0.6% salinity. This effect could also be also observed in other strains belonging to intermediately sensitive group. Only the robust group showed only minimal changes in their length:width ratio.</p>

<title>The usage of different DNA Barcodes to discover the ecological preference, habitat specificity and biogeographical distribution pattern among <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species</title>
<p>As demonstrated in this study, <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species can clearly be distinguished using the ITS-2/CBC approach. However, the number codes presented in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> for each species cannot be directly used for the BLAST searching approach described above. In addition, this approach is solely based on ITS-2 sequences, which were available in GenBank. Unfortunately, complete ITS sequences were not available from all the <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> entries in GenBank. Therefore, besides ITS-2, we used the two common barcode regions V4 and V9 of SSU rDNA for BLAST searching. At first we discovered the haplotypes of the V4 and V9 regions for each species, which could be used as population identifiers. Comparison of the V4 and V9 regions (SSU) among the investigated strains demonstrated ten and seven variants of V4 (V4-A1-G in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Tables) and V9 (V9-A-F2) within <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, respectively. To determine whether these variants differ in paired or unpaired bases in their sequences, the secondary structures of both regions were analyzed. All <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> strains have three CBCs and two HCBCs in the V4 and V9 region compared to those of <italic>Elliptochloris</italic> and <italic>Hemichloris</italic> (highlighted in white boxes in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Most of the seven lineages within <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> (see <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) were not supported by CBCs/HCBCs in the secondary structures (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>), showing that the variants mostly differ in only unpaired bases of V4; only <italic>C</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> could be differentiated by CBCs and HCBCs. In contrast, the V9 region showed CBCs/HCBCs, which could be used to discriminate the species of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>.</p>
<p>As demonstrated in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, the three species of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>) are represented by more than five strains in contrast to the others, which have been found only once or a few times. To determine whether this distribution pattern of common and rare species could also be detected in nature, we searched for GenBank entries for the seven <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species with the BLAST N algorithm described above. Using the variable regions (V4 and V9) of the SSU as well as the first three helices of ITS-2, 149 records were found in GenBank (summary in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Tables). These entries showed 97–100% identity to our seven species: 49.0% (73 entries) were absolutely identical with one of our sequenced strains, and the remaining entries (marked with a number after the accession number in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>) showed at least one base difference in their sequences compared to those. The occurrence of these base differences in the secondary structures was checked to determine whether those changes are real differences or results of sequencing mistakes. Most of the entries could also be identified at the species level. Only five entries (marked in pink in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>) found using the V4 approach showed 97% similarity to <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, but they have several CBCs and HCBCs in the secondary structure compared to our investigated strains. The phylogenetic analysis of the complete SSU rDNA sequences clearly demonstrated that these strains belong to another genus not closely related to <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> (data not shown). Interestingly, ten entries found with V4/V9 search also contained the ITS sequences, which were not recognized by the ITS2 search using the 97% threshold. Therefore, these ITS sequences have been aligned to ours according to the secondary structures and have been validated using the same ITS2 search algorithm used to determine their distribution. Nine additional records to our dataset were found. A comparison of all these sequences showed more than ten base differences from ours indicating that they might represent new lineages within <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>. To identify the phylogenetic position of these GenBank entries, the complete ITS rDNA sequences of all database entries found with ITS-2 search were aligned with those from this study. The phylogenetic analysis of this dataset is presented in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref> and confirmed the distribution pattern described above. In addition, the secondary structure of each additional ITS-2 sequence found via our BLAST search has been folded and the ITS-2 barcode was extracted and translated into a number code as described above (see <xref rid="pone.0127838.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The number codes for these entries were included into an alignment of the other <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> number codes. The distance phylogeny of this data set is also presented in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>. A comparison of both tree topologies showed a similar pattern at the species level but differed in the relationship among the lineages. However, the additional ITS sequences (highlighted in different grey colors) are possible new lineages and supported by new barcodes (BC-8-12) and CBCs/HCBCs (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>) in the barcode region.</p>
<p>Summarizing, the comparison with GenBank entries clearly demonstrated that three species represented by multiple strains in our study are distributed worldwide and common in nature. In contrast, records for the other four species could be found only a few times (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>). No records in databases were discovered for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>dispar</italic> (SAG 49.84) or <italic>C</italic>. <italic>vinatzeri</italic> (ASIB V16). Interestingly, several sequences represented additional new lineages within <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> and were confirmed via phylogenetic analyses and a BLAST search of the two outgroup taxa (only <italic>Elliptochloris</italic> or <italic>Hemichloris</italic> entries were detected with this search). For a better understanding of the distribution pattern the metadata of all GenBank entries (and its related publications, if available) were analyzed. For this purpose, the geographic origin, ecological preferences, and climate conditions have been summarized from those data (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>, and <xref rid="pone.0127838.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A–10C</xref>). Most of the records are from environmental studies in Europe and North America, and no records from Australia and Africa were found, most likely caused by a lack of investigations. The three common species (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>) seem to have a worldwide distribution (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref>). The other species (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>dispar</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>vinatzeri</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>galuniae</italic>) are rarely found in these investigations (Europe, North America, and Asia). All species can have different lifestyles and show no preferences to any climate. They occur free-living in aquatic and terrestrial habitats or as photobionts in lichens (Asco- and Basidiolichens); <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> is even parasitic in marine mussels (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B</xref>) and can be found in all climatic zones from cold deserts to tropical rain forests (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10C</xref>). However, using only the results of the ITS-2 search and applying the ITS-2/CBC approach demonstrated above, some preferences could be discovered despite the lack of comprehensive environmental studies (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). For example, the limited data from Antarctic and Asian samples showed that all records belong to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic> (BC-1a) and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic> (BC-3c), respectively. The photobionts of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> belong to the barcode groups BC-3c or BC-7a, respectively (symbiont in BC-7b is a <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> isolate from <italic>Gingko biloba</italic>), and those of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic> mostly belong to BC-1c (<italic>Omphalina</italic> photobionts). The newly found lineages show no special distribution pattern, ecological preferences, or climatic conditions and can be found in the same habitats similar to the others in our study. Only the strains belonging to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sp</italic>. 3 (BC-10) seem to have a preference for acidic habitats, but these strains should be investigated in detail to evaluate this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Variability in <italic>Coccomyxa</italic></title>
<p>Since the first description of the genus <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> by Schmidle [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], more than 50 species have been described according to morphology and lifestyle (free-living aquatic and terrestrial, symbiotic); however, a taxonomic revision using an integrative approach is still lacking. Considering only the morphology, delimitation at a generic or species level is difficult because many descriptions are based on studies of field samples without evaluation of these characteristics in culture experiments or are lacking distinct morphological features. Consequently, we investigated all strains originally assigned as <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> and <italic>Pseudococcomyxa</italic> that were available in public culture collections. Using an integrative approach (morphology and molecular phylogeny), the 41 strains could be clearly identified as <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>/<italic>Pseudococcomyxa</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The molecular phylogeny of the strains belonging to <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>/<italic>Pseudococcomyxa</italic> showed a subdivision into seven lineages representing species. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, the strains originally designated with different species names of both genera are mixed together within the seven lineages indicating the difficulties of identification at the generic and species levels. Traditionally both genera differ in only their mucilage formation. However, as our study has clearly demonstrated, this feature cannot be used for differentiation at the generic level because the mucilage production is strongly dependent on the culture conditions (see <xref rid="pone.0127838.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The rare production of mucilage in natural samples explains that the type species of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>dispar</italic> (= <italic>C</italic>. <italic>confluens</italic>), has been found only occasionally [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. According to our phylogenetic analyses, both genera belong to one monophyletic lineage. Consequently, the name <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> is proposed for all species as regulated by the principle of priority of the ICN. Because three lineages shown in <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> contain authentic strains (= ‘type cultures’) of described species, we designated them according to the oldest valid species name. Authentic strains of other species originally described by Chodat [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and Jaag [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] showed only few genetic differences to these species and therefore belong to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>, respectively (see <xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The lack of distinct morphological characteristics and their variability under different conditions as well as their simplicity resulted in a high number of described species. This fact was already recognized by Jaag [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], who tested the phenotypic plasticity under different culture conditions. For the symbiotic isolates he proposed the usage of the lichen name for designating new <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species. In our study, all strains from Jaag (except one) isolated from the ascolichen genera <italic>Peltigera</italic> and <italic>Solorina</italic> are very similar and belong to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic>. Only strain SAG 216–4, a photobiont of <italic>Peltigera aphtosa</italic>, represented <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>. In contrast, the strains isolated from the basidiolichens <italic>Omphalina</italic> and <italic>Multiclavula</italic> could be identified as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>dispar</italic>, respectively, indicating some species specificity to certain lichen genera. However, this must be verified by further studies especially because of the single record (SAG 49.84) for <italic>Multiclavula</italic> photobionts and general uncertainty whether the isolate is a photobiont or an epiphyte from a lichen [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. All strains investigated in this study showed a high genetic variability (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) and phenotypic plasticity (Figs <xref rid="pone.0127838.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Especially elevated salinity has an influence on cell morphology (Figs <xref rid="pone.0127838.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and the growth rate of the investigated strains (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). Considering these results, species of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> are highly adaptable to changing environments. Only high salt concentrations such as seawater have strong effects on the morphology and inhibit the growth rate of most species. This could explain why no strain isolated from marine habitats is available in public culture collection. The strain CCAP 216/18 described as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] grows in marine media. However, despite that the original description most likely represented a <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species, the strain CCAP 216/18 does not belong to <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, which was demonstrated by Rodriguez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] based on partial SSU rDNA sequences. In addition, the morphology of the strain CCAP 216/18 does not correspond with the original diagnosis of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> described by Stevenson and South [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This example clearly demonstrates that it is necessary to identify <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species using an integrative approach to avoid inaccurate records in culture collections and environmental studies.</p>

<title>DNA barcoding and its implications for environmental studies</title>
<p>As described above, the taxonomic revision of microalgal genera and species using an integrative approach is very time consuming and requires scientific expertise. This is almost impossible for large scale environmental studies. For those investigations, a faster and accurate identification tool is necessary to identify these organisms at the generic and species levels. DNA barcoding has been introduced to solve this problem [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although certain molecular barcode markers were proposed for animals, fungi, and higher plants (see above), the situation for microorganism (especially microalgae) is more complex because these organisms are genetically much more diverse. Phylogenetic analyses of microalgae are mostly based on SSU rDNA sequences; therefore two variable regions (V4 and V9) have been proposed as so-called pre-barcode markers [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For green algae, Hall et al. 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] have assessed several markers for DNA barcoding (SSU, UPA, <italic>rbcL</italic>, <italic>tufA</italic>, and <italic>coxI</italic>), and concluded that <italic>rbcL</italic>, ITS-2 and <italic>tufA</italic> are most promising for the usage as barcodes. In addition, the conserved region of the ITS-2 rDNA sequences often used for phylogenetic studies at species level has been proposed as barcode marker by Demchenko et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated three markers of nuclear ribosomal operon mentioned above for species identification of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>. The comparison of V4, V9, and ITS-2 showed that all markers can separate the seven species and therefore can be used for species identification as shown in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>. Only the V9 region of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic> are identical and cannot differentiate the species if used alone. Along with a simple sequence comparison, we checked the secondary structures of all barcode regions to detect unique CBCs and HCBCs for species characterization. The seven species are supported by only CBCs/HCBCs using the ITS-2 barcode and the CBC concept as proposed by Coleman [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] can be used for species identification of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>. The CBC concept needs to be critically evaluated in phylogenetic context before using for species delimitation [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The ITS-2/CBC approach used in this study is based on the highly supported phylogeny and therefore the detected CBCs among the strains support the split into species. Using V4 and V9, CBCs/HCBCs differentiate only <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> from the outgroup taxa and are therefore useful for the delimitation at the generic level (see <xref rid="pone.0127838.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). All these data confirmed that DNA barcoding using the proposed barcode markers can identify the genus <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> and its species and even populations (e.g. lichen photobionts) below species level. However, to identify the species boundaries, it is necessary to investigate species using an integrative approach as described in this study. Otherwise, the evidence of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> can only be recorded as OTU level without any species information.</p>
<p>To determine whether these barcode approaches are applicable for species identification of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> in environmental samples, we searched for the seven species using V4, V9, and ITS-2 by a BLAST algorithm (100% coverage, 97–100% sequence identity) in GenBank. We found approximately 150 entries, often not designated as <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> and sometimes even designated as genera of other algal classes (e.g. <italic>Monodus</italic> or <italic>Ellipsoidion</italic>, Eustigmatophyceae, Stramenopiles) or as unspecific, uncultured Trebouxiophyceae. Most entries could be assigned to a particular species, but to further validate the accuracy of the sequences, the secondary structure of the entries was folded; the results are summarized in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127838.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Tables. The range of sequence identity had to be adjusted depending on the barcode region. For example, with V4 only, sequences with 99–100% identity should be taken into account for species identification. A threshold of 97% can lead to a false identification even at the generic level as shown for five entries belonging to the genus <italic>Xerochlorella</italic>, which is not closely related to <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>. In contrast, this threshold is too high for the ITS-2 search. A combined search using V4/V9 and ITS-2 as previously described could identify only 13 records. However, these new records are found only if the threshold is set at the 80% level, but the use of this threshold for the ITS-2 search is problematic because entries belonging to other genera were also detected. To decide whether an entry belonged to <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> required a comprehensive investigation of the secondary structure. This is necessary if no sequence data of SSU rDNA are available from these entries. In conclusion, we provided a consensus secondary structure of ITS-2 (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) for easier analyses of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> sequences derived from environmental studies.</p>
<p>Summarizing, the three barcode regions used in this study are suitable for identification of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species, but the evaluation of these regions using secondary structure is absolutely necessary to avoid ambiguous results. A comparison of all records identified with V4 showed only base differences in the helices E23_1 and E23_2 among the 229 base pairs (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Using the 97% threshold only seven base differences (including ambiguities or sequencing mistakes) were enough to find ‘new’ species or OTUs as recorded. In our study, we demonstrated that V4 is a good barcode marker for delimitation at the generic and sometimes at the species level, but the sequences must be accurate. The base differences detected in V4 mostly occurred in unpaired regions of the helices E23_1 and E23_2, which makes evaluation difficult. In contrast, the few differences observed in V9 mostly represented CBCs/HCBCs, even though this region is almost half as long as V4 (106 bp). Using this short region, no misidentifications were observed, in contrast to the V4 region, for which records of other genera have been erroneously detected. With exclusive use of SSU rDNA sequences, species of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> can be identified only by combining V4 and V9. For the detection of possible new species of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, a combination of V9 and ITS-2 is the appropriate solution as demonstrated in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127838.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Tables and <xref rid="pone.0127838.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>The records found in GenBank using these approaches (V4/V9/ITS-2) have clearly demonstrated that the biodiversity of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> in nature is slightly higher, but dominated by the three abundant species (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>) presented in our phylogeny (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The five new lineages found in environmental samples could represent new species, as indicated by the phylogenetic analyses (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>) and CBCs in the ITS-2 barcode regions (BC-8 to BC-12), but this must be verified with an integrative approach using cultured material. Most <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> strains available in public culture collections are easy to cultivate; therefore the integrative approach can be used. Some studies have even shown that <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> can occur as contaminant in stock solutions of culture media or distilled water [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or in cooling water of nuclear plants [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which confirmed that <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> has no special requirements for certain nutrients for growth and is rather undemanding. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>simplex</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> are the common species in environmental samples; the rare species represented by only one or few strains in our study also remain as rare species in nature. Only less than ten records of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>galuniae</italic> have been detected in GenBank without an entry of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>dispar</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>vinatzeri</italic>. The analysis of the metadata clearly demonstrated that the <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species are distributed worldwide and confirmed their occurrence, especially of the three common species, in different habitats (<xref rid="pone.0127838.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127838.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). Whether the rare species occupy a special ecological niche or are distributed only locally cannot be decided at this stage. For example, the strain ASIB V16 (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>vinatzeri</italic>) has been isolated from soil collected from the Dolomites (South Tyrol, Italy), which is the only information provided by Vinatzer [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The ecological preferences and distribution pattern of this and other rare species cannot be derived from the published data or the entries in GenBank. Despite the evidence of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> in natural samples, very little is known about its ecological preferences, even for the common species. Several species names of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> that are invalid according to the ICN (lack of designation of a type; <italic>nomina nuda</italic>) have been published because of their occurrence in specific habitats. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>actinabiotis</italic> (CCAP 216/25), found in cooling water of a nuclear plant [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>onubensis</italic> (ACCV1), found in acidic water [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] represent new lineages of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>sp</italic>. 2, BC-9a/b and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sp</italic>. 3, BC-10, respectively in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Falagan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] isolated two <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> strains from two acidic pit lakes (Spain) that have identical sequences according to the authors. The V4 regions of both strains showed three differences compared to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>subellipsoidea</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>, which demonstrated the difficulties of species identification if V4 is used alone. Unfortunately, V9 and ITS-2 is not available for both strains, but using the entire 1500 bases provided from both strains and comparing them with ACCV1 showed that they are identical with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sp</italic>. 3, which indicates that this lineage possibly prefers acidic habitats. However, Verma et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] found an acid-tolerant isolate from Boomerang Lake (Ontario, Canada), which could be clearly identified as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic> using V4/V9 in our study (<xref rid="pone.0127838.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127838.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Tables).</p>
<p>Almost all habitats can be occupied by <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> species. Only free-living, marine species are unknown so far, which is confirmed by the lack of GenBank entries from environmental studies of marine phytoplankton. Rodriguez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], Vázquez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], and Syasina et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] found <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> as parasite of three mussels, <italic>Mytilus edulis</italic>, <italic>Panopea abbreviata</italic>, and <italic>Modiolus modiolus</italic>, which all belong to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>viridis</italic>, the most salinity-robust species in our study (see <xref rid="pone.0127838.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). However, the intracellular parasitic lifestyle in the mussel muscle does not mean that the algal cells are exposed to seawater, but the question remains open how their dispersal among the different hosts occurs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> is distributed worldwide and has a highly flexible lifestyle as shown in this study. Its occurrence in environmental samples of all types is very likely; therefore a clear molecular identification at the species level is necessary to understand its role in those ecosystems.</p>

<title>Beyond Coccomyxa</title>
<p>Integrative taxonomy and its applications for environmental studies as demonstrated in this study for <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, is a powerful tool for describing the biodiversity of microorganisms in different habitats. As we have shown, the combination of analyzing cultured material and DNA barcoding of environmental samples can provide insights into distribution patterns and ecological preferences.</p>
<p>Despite the common usage of V4 as barcode marker, we recommend a combined analysis using V9 and ITS for species identification of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> in environmental samples as follows: (i) the region of V9 and ITS (~ 900 bp) should be sequenced double stranded and assembled without ambiguities; (ii) the secondary structures of V9 and ITS-2 should be folded using different folding programs; (iii) based on the foldings the sequences should be checked for accuracy; (iv) the V9 and the conserved part of ITS-2 can be searched using the BLAST algorithm as previously described; and (v) entries with 100% identity by 100% coverage are clearly identified at species level, and the others can be analyzed using phylogenetic and/or ITS-2 barcode approaches as described in this study. With these methods, the hidden diversity can be recognized and new strains of <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> can be isolated for further investigations using the integrative taxonomy demonstrated here.</p>
<p>This guideline is applicable not only for <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, but also other groups of microalgae and even protists. The method of analyzing ITS sequences presented in this study cannot only be used for describing interspecific variability, but also for evaluating intraspecific differences (multiple copies within one organism) as demonstrated here for the entries highlighted in blue in <xref rid="pone.0127838.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>. A comparison of these sequences showed that the differences are located outside of the barcode region (conserved region of ITS-2; grey and black circled in the consensus structure; see <xref rid="pone.0127838.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) or represent sequencing errors. The analyses of ITS secondary structures can help evaluate data from environmental studies and provide additional information about species boundaries and delimitation for algae, protists and fungi. For the latter group of organisms, ITS is the official barcode marker [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and still under controversial discussion [<xref rid="pone.0127838.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127838.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the usage of ITS-2 as barcode marker, as demonstrated in this study, facilitates the identification of organisms at the species or OTU level.</p>
