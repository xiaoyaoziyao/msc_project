<abstract>
<p>Lung epithelial cell death is critical to the lung injury that occurs in the acute respiratory distress syndrome. It is known that FasL plays a prominent role in this lung cell death pathway and may work in part through activation of the receptor interacting protein-2 (RIP2). RIP2 is serine/threonine kinase with a C-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). This CARD contains a highly conserved, predicted tyrosine phosphorylation site. Thus, involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in the CARD domain of RIP2 may play a critical role in Fas-mediated apoptosis in the human lung immune system. To test this hypothesis, human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were induced to undergo cell death in response to the Fas agonist antibody CH11 with and without manipulation of endogenous RIP2 concentrations. We show that CH11 increases lung epithelial cell death in a dose-dependent manner as determined by LDH release and nuclear condensation. Fas-induced LDH release was inhibited by RIP2 knock-down. Reduced levels of RIP2 in BEAS-2B cells after treatment with RIP2 siRNA were confirmed by immunoblot. Overexpression of RIP2 in BEAS-2B cells synergized with Fas ligand-induced LDH release in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, mutation of the tyrosine phosphorylation site in CARD of RIP2 protected BEAS-2B cells from Fas ligand induced cell death. Thus RIP2's CARD tyrosine phosphorylation may represent a new therapeutic target to promote the survival of human lung epithelial cells in disorders that lead to acute lung injury and ARDS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) pathway has been demonstrated to contribute to severe epithelial damage that occurs in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a disease characterized by the death of lung epithelial cells with resultant loss of lung barrier function. Soluble FasL can be released as a biologically active, death-inducing mediator capable of inducing apoptosis of epithelial cells during acute lung injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-MatuteBello1">[1]</xref>. This concept is supported by the finding that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with ARDS can induce apoptosis of small airway epithelial cells, which are dependent on the Fas-FasL pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Albertine1">[2]</xref>. Therefore, inhibiting this pathway may provide novel treatment strategies to ameliorate acute lung injury.</p>
<p>In this context, receptor interacting protein-2 (RIP2), a 61-kDa adaptor kinase, may play an important role in the host defense at barrier sites such as the lung and the gut. RIP2 also called RIP-like-interacting CLARP kinase (RICK) and caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)-containing IL-1β converting enzyme (ICE)-associated kinase (CARDIAK), is capable of inducing both NF-kB activation and cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Inohara1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Hsu1">[7]</xref>. Disease associated polymorphisms in RIP2's upstream signaling partner, NOD2, have been described for early onset sarcoidosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Kanazawa1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Arostegui1">[9]</xref> and Crohn's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Hugot1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-King1">[13]</xref>. Since RIP2 function may modulate the inflammatory and apoptotic function of epithelial cells we decide to investigate the role that RIP2 may play in modulating lung epithelial cells responses to FasL.</p>
<p>The surface Fas receptor (also known as CD95), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, is widely expressed and plays a critical role in the regulation and homeostasis of the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Nagata1">[14]</xref>. Activation of CD95 by FasL, a trimeric cell surface protein, leads to rapid induction of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Nagata1">[14]</xref>. The intracellular domain of CD95 and related death receptors contains a death domain that was originally described in the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Nagata1">[14]</xref>. The death domain of CD95 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 are responsible for signaling cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Nagata1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>It has been shown recently that RIP2 undergoes autophosphorylation on Tyr 474 (Y474) in its caspase recruitment domain (CARD) which is critical in its interaction with NOD2. This phosphorylation event is necessary for effective NOD2 signaling and is blocked in the presence of the most common Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-TignoAranjuez1">[15]</xref>. Of note, this RIP2 tyrosine site is conserved across vertebrate species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-TignoAranjuez1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although RIP2 is best known as an upstream signaling kinase that is important for NFκB activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Inohara1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-McCarthy1">[4]</xref>, RIP2 has also been shown to be able to induce cell death in some settings. For example, overexpression of RIP2 induces apoptosis in cell lines such as human embryonic kidney cells and MCF7 breast cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-McCarthy1">[4]</xref>. Several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that RIP2 can associate with a variety of other CARD-containing molecules through CARD–CARD interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Inohara1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Thome1">[5]</xref>. Interaction with the CARD containing cIAP-1 could also implicate RIP2 in modulation of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-McCarthy1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Thome1">[5]</xref>. cIAP-1 binds to and potently inhibits caspase activity. One mechanism suggested that RIP2 physically interacts with CLARP, a caspase-like molecule, a protein containing two death effector domains (DED) capable of binding to Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8, mediated Fas-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Inohara1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, how RIP2 plays a role in cells death is still largely unclear. In this study, we show that knock-down of RIP2 in human lung epithelial cells protects and overexpression of RIP2 synergizes with Fas-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. We also find that, upon Fas activation, RIP2 is inducibly serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylated. The phosphorylation to Tyr 474 (Y474) is required for maximal RIP2-induced cytotoxicity and maximal signaling synergy with Fas ligand. RIP2's CARD domain tyrosine phosphorylation site presents a new therapeutic target to promote the survival of human lung epithelial cells in disorders that lead to acute lung injury and ARDS.</p>

<title>Cells and reagents</title>
<p>Human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were purchased from ATCC (ATCC CRL9609). BEAS-2B cells were cultured in DMEM (MediaTech, Inc) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Anti-Fas (human, activating), clone CH11 was purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solution, USA. Cells were regularly checked to confirm the absence of <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> contamination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Zakharova1">[16]</xref>. Cell culture medium was used for detection of LDH release as a cell death signature. Cell lysates were analyzed for proteins by immunoblots.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assay</title>
<p>Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaF, 1% NP-40 and 0.25% Na-deoxycholate) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), fresh 1 mM PMSF, 100 μM N-(methoxysuccinyl)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val chloromethylketone) and 1 μM Na3VO4. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 minute. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad Dc protein Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody; clone 4G10 from Millipore was used to pull-down total tyrosine phosphorylated protein in combination with protein G-agarose (Invitrogen). After SDS-PAGE gel separation, samples were transferred to a PVDF membrane, probed with the antibody of interest and developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against RIP2 was purchased from Cayman, and Phospho-RIP2 (Ser176) antibody from Cell Signaling.</p>

<title>Cell death detection by quantification of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in cell culture medium</title>
<p>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into cell culture medium was used as an indicator of cell death using NAD+ reduction assay (Roche Applied Science). Cells were plated in 12-well plate at the density 0.15×10<sup>6</sup>/ml and stimulated with CH11. Cell culture medium was collected, clarified by centrifugation, and used for LDH assay. Total LDH content in cells (positive control) was measured in cells lysed with Triton X-100 (1% final concentration). Cell culture medium alone was used as a blank and OD values were subtracted from readings of samples and positive control. LDH concentration in the medium was detected at wavelength 490 nm. Cell death was calculated by the formula: (cytotoxicity (%)  =  (sample/positive control) ×100), as described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Abdelaziz1">[17]</xref>.</p>

<title>Construction of Expression Plasmids</title>
<p>RIP2 plasmid was a gift of J. Tschopp (University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland). Wild type human RIP2 was re-cloned in eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3.1(+) and sequence verified. RIP2 site specific mutants (Y474A, Y474F and Y474D) were created by using standard site-directed mutagenesis protocol, where RIP2 plasmid was used as a template.

PCR conditions were: 95°C for 1 min, then 25 cycles 95°C for 30 s and 68°C for 5 min with temperature decreasing rate at 1°C/s and increasing rate at 0.5°C/s, followed by the final amplification step at 68°C for 15 min. After PCR reaction was complete, the reaction mix was treated with DpnI restriction enzyme (NEB) for 1 h at 37°C to destroy methylated plasmid template and used to transform competent bacteria. Next morning bacterial colonies were inoculated into LB media and later plasmids were isolated by mini kit from Promega. RIP2 mutated constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p>

<title>FasL phosphorylates RIP2 in bronchial epithelial cells</title>
<p>RIP2 is classically considered to be a serine kinase that itself undergoes significant post-translational modifications in response to activation of NOD2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Thome1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-TignoAranjuez1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Kobayashi1">[21]</xref>. Most of these changes involve serine or threonine phosphorylations, but it has recently been reported that RIP2 may also be tyrosine kinase that also undergoes tyrosine autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-TignoAranjuez1">[15]</xref>. Therefore, we attempted to determine whether RIP2 could be both serine or tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Fas activation. To determine this, BEAS-2B cells were first treated with the CH11 for different time intervals. We found that RIP2 could be both serine and tyrosine phosphorylated in response to Fas activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092731-g004"><bold>Fig 4</bold></xref>). Thus, in addition to the previous reports of RIP2 phosphorylation in response to NOD2 activation, the Fas-induced cell death signaling pathway also appears to induce RIP2 modifications.</p>

<title>Mutation of Y474 causes a decrease in RIP2's ability to FasL-induced apoptosis</title>

<p>Since RIP2 contains a conserved tyrosine site in its CARD domain and we observed that RIP2 is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to Fas activation, we tested the hypothesis that mutation of the predicted tyrosine phosphorylation site in CARD domain of RIP2 might be capable of decreasing RIP2's role in FasL-induced apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we generated site specific mutants of RIP2 (Y474) including Y474A, Y474D and Y474F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092731-g005"><bold>Fig 5A</bold></xref>). Transient transfection assays showed that the Y474 mutation decreases RIP2's effect on cell death in response to Fas ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092731-g005"><bold>Fig 5B</bold></xref>). Equal expression of transiently transfected RIP2 expression vectors (both wild type and mutant) were confirmed by immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092731-g005"><bold>Fig 5C</bold></xref>). Collectively, these data support that it is the tyrosine phosphorylation site in the CARD domain of RIP2 that is responsible for Fas-induced cell death.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main goal of this study was to determine whether the mechanism of bronchial epithelial cells death could be mediated by the involvement of RIP2 in response to FasL. Fas activation <italic>in vivo</italic> results in acute alveolar epithelial injury and lung inflammation, and may be important in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-MatuteBello2">[25]</xref>. Although the Fas/FasL pathway has been mainly implicated with respect to its death-inducing function, it also transduces signals through pathways that are still poorly defined.</p>
<p>In the current study, we have confirmed the involvement of RIP2 in Fas-mediated apoptosis, in addition to the well-known NOD2-RIP2 pathway. Presence of serine/threonine kinase and CARD domains of RIP2 suggested multifunctional roles of this adaptor cytosolic protein. In our experiments we have used immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells as representative of human lung epithelium. Expression of Fas receptors in BEAS-2B cells has been reported, which support the involvement of Fas signaling pathway in the death processes of BEAS-2B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Wang1">[26]</xref>. Moreover, BEAS-2B cells have been shown to undergo apoptosis in response to FasL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Lai1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>It has been reported that several factors contribute in Fas-signaling pathway. For example, IFN-γ enhances Fas-mediated apoptosis in A549 lung epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Coulter1">[28]</xref>. However, here we have shown that without addition of IFN-γ, treatment of BEAS-2B cells with only CH11 is dependent on RIP2. We have also analyzed the effect of IFN-γ in Fas-signaling pathway and observed that addition of IFN-γ followed by CH11 treatment in BEAS-2B cells enhances death through the up-regulation of Fas receptor expression (data not shown). But when we knocked-down RIP2 we did not see any effect of the loss of RIP2 in response to the addition of IFN-γ followed by FasL treatment, suggesting that IFN-γ utilizes a RIP2 independent pathway to induce death.</p>
<p>It has been revealed that RIP2 interacts with C-terminal domain of the CLARP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Inohara1">[3]</xref>, a caspase-related protein that interacts with FADD and caspase-8 and promote caspase-8 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Goltsev1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Srinivasula1">[34]</xref>, and eventually to induce CD95 death pathway. Our data suggest that RIP2 protein synthesis in BEAS-2B cells is necessary for the Fas pathway, we show that loss of RIP2 protein in the cells reduces FasL-induced death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092731-g002"><bold>Fig 2A</bold></xref>), indicating a specific role of RIP2 in Fas-mediated extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. In addition, RIP2 overexpression also enhances the overall apoptotic rate in response to FasL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092731-g003"><bold>Fig 3A</bold></xref>). In other cell lines, such as the human embryonic kidney cells and MCF7 breast cancer cells, RIP2 overexpression also results in enhanced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-McCarthy1">[4]</xref>. These reports demonstrate that RIP2 overexpression acts as an inducer of caspase-8 activity. Using RT-qPCR and immunoblotting we validated the expression of RIP2 in knock-down and in overexpression experiments confirming that RIP2 is involved in Fas-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092731-g002"><bold>Fig 2B, 2C</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092731-g003"><bold>3B</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, caspase-1 does not appear to be involved in the cell death of BEAS-2B cells. A caspase-1 specific inhibitor did not block the RIP2 mediated apoptosis. This is noteworthy since it has been shown that CARD-CARD association between RIP2 and pro-caspase-1 may promote the processing of pro-caspase-1 into its active form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Thome1">[5]</xref>. However, later <italic>in vivo</italic> work has shown RIP2 to be dispensable for caspase-1 activation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Mariathasan1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Though RIP2 was originally classified as a serine/threonine kinase, in this study we focused on tyrosine phosphorylation in the CARD domain of RIP2 due to its highly conserved predicted phosphotyrosine site. Moreover, the limited abundance of tyrosine phosphorylation compared to phosphorylations on serine and threonine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Hunter1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Olsen1">[37]</xref>, suggest that a tyrosine phosphorylation is likely to be biologically relevant. In this study, we show that RIP2 is both serine and tyrosine-phosphorylated after activation of the Fas pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092731-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). These findings support that posttranslational modification of RIP2 in response to FasL is required to exert RIP2's critical role in lung epithelium death. Of note, AG126, a known phosphotyrosine kinase inhibitor, also inhibits CH11-induced BEAS-2B cell death (data not shown). These results support that the Fas receptor tyrosine phosphorylates of several intracellular proteins, involved in Fas receptor-induced cell death in both human and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-Simon1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our results not only indicate that RIP2 overexpression enhances Fas-induced apoptosis but also show that mutating a conserved tyrosine site in the CARD domain of RIP2 inhibits apoptosis when overexpressed. Thus our finding invokes involvement of the CARD domain of RIP2 in apoptosis through the conserved tyrosine 474 site phosphorylation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation in the RIP2 CARD domain is an important step in the generation of the Fas receptor-linked transmembrane death signal in lung epithelium. These finding also supports a previous report that RIP2 induced extensive cell death via its CARD motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0092731-McCarthy1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the exact role of RIP2 in the activation of signaling molecules still remains to be elucidated, our results highlight the importance of maintaining adequate RIP2 protein levels to ensure the efficient transmission of Fas signals. We also analyzed signaling following Fas stimulation on RIP2 knock-down lung epithelial cells. BEAS-2B cells were stimulated with CH11 (1 μg/mL), and lysates were harvested at the indicated time points. Expressions of phospho-IκB-α and phospho-p38 were analyzed by immunoblotting. The results shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092731.s001">Figure S1</xref> indicate that under this condition, NF-κB and p38 activation did not take place completely in the RIP2 knocked-down cells as compared to siCtr cells. This data suggest that RIP2 is involved in Fas signaling at least in the NF-κB and p38 activation pathway.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to comment upon some weaknesses of our approach. In order to be able to specifically modulate RIP2 expression levels we have focused exclusively on a human BEAS-2B cell model using the standard CH11 antibody mechanism of Fas activation. It is conceivable that human lung epithelial cells may behave differently <italic>in vivo</italic> when analyzed in the context of the complex lung milieu. However, despite these limitations we believe that our work supports a role for RIP2 in controlling lung epithelial cell responses to Fas pathways.</p>
<p>In summary, here we have shown that FasL induces lung epithelial cell death in a dose dependent manner. We have demonstrated that the loss of human RIP2 inhibits Fas-mediated lung epithelium cell death. We have also shown that RIP2 is serine and tyrosine phosphorylated in response to FasL, an event required for efficient Fas-mediated cell death. Moreover, we show RIP2 has been significantly involved in Fas-mediated cell death that is in part dependent upon 474 tyrosine phosphorylation at CARD domain. It is still not clear under which circumstances RIP2 tyrosine phosphorylation at 474 is necessary or facilitates Fas receptor mediated apoptosis. However, RIP2 tyrosine kinase activation seems to be required for the signaling induced by Fas, at least in some cellular systems such as human lung epithelium. Since FasL activation is known to play a role in lung injury, our findings suggest that RIP2's CARD tyrosine phosphorylation may be important in determining the fate of the lung epithelium in humans with lung injury.</p>
