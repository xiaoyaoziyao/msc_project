          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) is a pancreatic secretory protein belongs to the group VII of C-type lectin family. Emerging evidence suggests that PAP plays a protective effect in inflammatory diseases. In the present study, we newly identified a 16-amino-acid peptide (named PAPep) derived from C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) of human PAP with potent anti-inflammatory activity using both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We assessed the anti-inflammatory effect of PAPep on endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats and demonstrated that intravitreal pretreatment of PAPep concentration-dependently attenuated clinical manifestation of EIU rats, reduced protein leakage and cell infiltration into the aqueous humor (AqH), suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 production in ocular tissues, and improved histopathologic manifestation of EIU. Furthermore, PAPep suppressed the LPS-induced mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in RAW 264.7 cells, inhibited protein expression of ICAM-1 in TNF-α-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as well as U937 cells adhesion to HUVECs. Western blot analysis in ocular tissues and different cell lines revealed that the possible mechanism for this anti-inflammatory effect of PAPep may depend on its ability to inhibit the activation of NF-kB signaling pathway.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Our studies provide the first evidence that the sequence of PAPep is within the critically active region for the anti-inflammatory function of PAP and the peptide may be a promising candidate for the management of ocular inflammatory diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Uveitis is a relatively common intraocular inflammatory disease and one of the most damaging ocular conditions that its recurrent nature could lead to cataract, macular edema, glaucoma, and, ultimately, destruction of the intraocular tissues and blindness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-ChangJ1">[1]</xref>. Although age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy are more prevalent causes of blindness, the relative youth of patients diagnosed with uveitis makes it inevitably one of the ocular diseases with an important socioeconomic impact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Suhler1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Present pharmacological treatment for uveitis primarily includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Tellier1">[3]</xref>. However, these drugs do not completely control the disease in many patients and long term application of these drugs may result in multiple adverse effects such as cataract, glaucoma, susceptibility to microbial infection and nephrotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Adebayo1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Urtti1">[7]</xref>. Hence, there is a need for therapeutics with safer modes of action. Small peptides are emerging and promising agents in developing new therapeutics for different diseases. The advantages of some peptides as drugs over proteins include sufficient penetration capability, potential efficacy, less toxicity, lower immunogenicity and controllable production, which make them potential alternatives for ocular application. Thus, researchers began to show interests in the active fragments of large proteins that target inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Touchard1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Granado1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) is a 16.6 kDa pancreatic secretory protein belongs to the group VII of C-type lectin family. It is comprised of a short N-terminal domain and a large C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) that spans the rest of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Keim1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Robinson1">[15]</xref>. Emerging evidence supports the notion that PAP plays a protective effect against inflammatory damage in pancreatic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Zhang1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Viterbo1">[17]</xref> and extrapancreatic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Heller1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Gironella1">[19]</xref> inflammatory conditions, and CTLD is the main active region. In a rat model of acute pancreatitis, the infusion of anti-PAP1 antibodies worsened the pancreatic inflammatory response and PAP1 treatment prevented tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF–κB) activation in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Zhang1">[16]</xref>. In addition, PAP prevented fMLP-induced vasoconstriction and edema formation in the isolated rabbit lung and protected the lung from neutrophil-induced injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Heller1">[18]</xref>. Studies by Gironella et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Gironella1">[19]</xref> found that PAP is anti-inflammatory in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It was also reported that PAP inhibited macrophage activation by down-regulating the synthesis of TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-6, thereby promoting an anti-inflammatory state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Vasseur1">[20]</xref>, which are possibly mediated through the inhibition of NF-κB pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Nishimune1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-FerrsMas1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we chose three conserved sequence segments from CTLD of human PAP to construct three small peptides. We used bioinformatics methods to evaluate their biological activities and investigated these peptides' effects on ocular inflammation, using an established animal model, endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU), and finally focused on one of these three peptides with the sequence of ASLSRSTAFLRWKDYN (named PAPep). We found that PAPep peptide diminished the inflammatory reaction in EIU rats, suppressed the LPS-induced cytokine release in ocular tissues and macrophage RAW 264.7 cells, and inhibit adhesion molecule expression in stimulated endothelial cells. In order to gain a further mechanistic insight, we assessed whether PAPep modulates activation of NF-κB in ocular tissues and two different cell lines, namely, RAW264.7 cells and HUVECs, as models of the cell types that orchestrate the inflammation present in uveitis. These interesting results suggest that PAPep peptide is within the key active region of PAP CTLD and a potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic agent.</p>

        <title>Peptide Identification and Synthesis</title>
        <p>In order to identify the sequence segment that is most probably within the critically active region from CTLD of human PAP, we first did comparative alignment of the amino acid sequence of human PAP with mouse, rat, dog and sheep PAP isoforms using the ClustalW program and chose regions with higher homology amongst various species. Second, we investigated the second structure of PAP and found out that there are several helical and beta-strand regions within the protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029155-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It is reported that helical conformation is a feature of some antibacterial peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Powers1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Kolusheva1">[27]</xref>. So we selected sequence regions with helical conformation. Based on the results of the combined analysis, we ultimately chose three sequence segments derived from the CTLD of human PAP to synthesize three peptides 16 amino acids in length (P1: YALFLSPKSWTDADLA, P2: VLSGAEGSFVSSLVKS, P3: ASLSRSTAFLRWKDYN, P3 named PAPep here). Prior to synthesis, the biological activity of the three peptides were analyzed using bioinformatics methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Gasteiger1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Kyte1">[29]</xref>, which include physicochemical parameters, analysis of antigenicity, surface accessibility and mean hydrophilicity.</p>

        <p>The three peptides was synthesized and purified by ChinaPeptides Co., Ltd. in Shanghai, PR China with a high-efficiency solid-phase method using an automatic peptide synthesizer (Symphony; Protein Technologies, Tucson, AZ). These purified peptides were characterized by means of amino acid analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, analytical; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and mass spectrometry (MS, Finnigan TSQ 7000; Thermo, Waltham, MA) with the purity more than 95%. In order to identify whether the PAPep function of anti-inflammation is sequence-dependent, a scrambled peptide (PAPS) was simultaneously synthesized and used as a negative control for the following <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.

        <title>Induction of EIU and Drug Treatment Protocol</title>
        <p>Six- to eight-week-old Wistar rats (160–180 g) were obtained from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Animals were maintained in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. EIU was induced by a single footpad injection of 100 µl sterile pyrogen free saline containing 200 µg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO). A separate group received the same volume of sterilized saline in one foot pad for comparison with the LPS group (the control group). All animals were anesthetized and pupils were dilated before experimental manipulations. Different concentration peptides (P1–P3 and PAPS) were injected intravitreally to both rat eyes, using a pump microinjection apparatus under a dissecting microscope, an hour before LPS was administered, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Zhang2">[30]</xref>. LPS group also received intravitreal injection of PBS (vehicle) in a comparable volume at the same time points as the peptides. Dexamethasone sodium phosphate (10 µg/injection; Shanghai General Motors Pharmaceutical Industry Company Limited, China) was used as a positive control for anti-inflammatory activity on EIU. Twenty-four hours after LPS injection, rats were killed and processed for clinical, biological and immunohistochemical analysis. Five normal rats were injected intravitreally with PAPep (10 µg/eye) to detect any proinflammatory effect in the eye and examined with a slit-lamp biomicroscope for 3 days to determine the short-term safety of the treatment. The experiments were repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility.</p>

        <title>Number of Infiltrating Cells and Protein Concentration in Aqueous Humor</title>
        <p>Immediately after the biomicroscope examination, the animals were killed with an overdose of anesthesia. Aqueous humor (AqH) was collected immediately from both eyes by an anterior chamber puncture (30–40 µl/rat), using a 30-gauge needle under a surgical microscope. For cell counting, the sample was suspended in an equal amount of Türk stain solution, and the cell number was counted with a hemocytometer under a light microscope. The number of cells per field was manually counted by two independent researchers, and the number of cells per microliter was obtained by averaging the results of four fields from each sample. Total protein concentration was measured by a Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The AqH samples were stored in ice water until testing, and cell counts and total protein concentrations were measured on the day of sample collection.</p>

Protein levels of TNF-α, IL-6 in the aqueous humor were determined by the rat TNF-α and IL-6 ELISA kits (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The minimum detectable dose of rat TNF-α and IL-6 is about 5.0 pg/ml and 21.0 pg/ml respectively.Soon after collection of aqueous humor, both eyes were immediately enucleated. The iris ciliary body (ICB) and retina complex of each rat was carefully isolated and placed into 200 µl lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and then sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C. The protein levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in the supernatant were determined with the rat ICAM-1 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and MCP-1 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) ELISA kits, respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocols.

After dehydration and paraffin embedment of the eyes, five micrometer sagittal sections near the optic nerve head were obtained. For histopathological evaluation, tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene and stained using hematoxylin and eosin. Infiltrating inflammatory cells in ICB and posterior vitreous were counted and identified histologically in a masked fashion by an ocular pathologist using a counting grid at 400×magnification.

In LPS group, however, the protein levels and number of inflammatory cells in the AqH were 38.74±2.21 mg/ml and 59±11×10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml, respectively, significantly higher than those in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029155-g004">Fig. 4A and 4B</xref>).

        <title>PAPep Inhibited the mRNA Levels of TNF-α and IL-6 and the Translocation of NF-κB in RAW264.7 Cells</title>
        <p>To further confirm these observations in EIU rats, we investigated the effects of PAPep on the activation of macrophage-like cells, which plays a key role in the orchestration of the inflammatory response during acute uveitis. Activation in vitro of RAW264.7 cells by LPS (100 ng/ml) was monitored by measuring the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNAs, GAPDH mRNA being used as control. Resting RAW264.7 cells showed a low constitutive transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while LPS caused a significant increase in mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells after 6 h of incubation. Adding PAPep to the culture medium inhibited that induction in a dose-dependent manner, the minimum concentration having a significant effect being 1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029155-g008">Fig. 8A and 8B</xref>). However, no inhibitory effect was verified in cells pretreated with PAPS (50 µM). Dexamethasone (10 µM) also significantly inhibited LPS-induced mRNA expressions of TNF-α and IL-6. Importantly, PAPep (50 µM) and Dex (10 µM) had a similar inhibitory effect on LPS-induced mRNA levels of IL-6 (P&gt;0.05). These results suggest that the PAPep prevented TNF-α and IL-6 production through suppressing their gene expressions in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, in an immunofluorescence method, we found that 100 ng/ml LPS caused the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, and pretreatment with 50 µM PAPep significantly inhibited the LPS-evoked NF-κB nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029155-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). These results suggest that RAW264.7 cells' activation is mediated by the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and PAPep exerts anti-inflammatory effects probably through the inhibition of NF-κB translocation.</p>

        <title>U937 Cells Adhesion to HUVECs Is ICAM-1-dependent</title>
        <p>As the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells is a prerequisite for adhesion of leukocytes and monocytes, we investigated the effect of PAPep on TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression in HUVECs. Western blot analysis of cell lysates showed that levels of ICAM-1 were undetectable in unstimulated HUVECs, but were significantly increased by TNF-α treatment. PAPep significantly attenuated TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 upregulation in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029155-g012">Figure 12</xref>). However, no inhibitory effect was observed by pretreatment with PAPS. Since PAPep similarly interfered with TNF-α-induced up-regulation of NF-κB expression by HUVECs, we supposed that PAPep suppresses U937 cells adhesion to HUVECs via NF-κB signaling.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>PAP is a 175-amino-acid-long polypeptide containing a large C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain linked to a short N-terminal domain. Although there are increasing number of studies showing that the CTLD are involved in regulatory processes pertaining to various aspects of the immune system, such as inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Keim1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-FerrsMas1">[23]</xref>, immunity to tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Christa1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Valery1">[39]</xref> and virally infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Mukherjee1">[40]</xref>, it is unclear which fragment of CTLD is the key active region and the underlying mechanism of its anti-inflammation. In this study, we first preliminarily investigate the whole domain by sequence alignment, second structure analysis and bioinformatics analysis to theoretically screen out the most promising regions that might within the key active region of human PAP. Then we examined the potential effects of the selected three peptides on ocular inflammation in EIU rats to ultimately identify which peptide is most likely to possess anti-inflammatory effect. Finally, we showed for the first time a 16-amino acid peptide (PAPep) derived from CTLD of PAP with potent anti-inflammatory activity using both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. We demonstrated that intravitreal injection of PAPep effectively attenuates the clinical manifestation in EIU rats, diminishes the cellular infiltration, protein leakage into the anterior chamber, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines and molecules production, and improves histopathologic manifestation of EIU, while other two synthesized peptides and scrambled peptide had no such effects. Furthermore, PAPep suppresses the LPS-induced mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in RAW 264.7 cells, and inhibits adhesion molecule expression in stimulated endothelial cells, and these anti-inflammatory effects are probably associated with the inhibition of NF-κB activation. Hence, the amino acid sequence of PAPep studied might be a part of the critically active sequence of PAP CTLD in anti-inflammation and its function is sequence-dependent.</p>
      <p>EIU is an experimental model for acute ocular inflammation, produced by footpad injection of endotoxin, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of gram-negative bacterial cell wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Rosenbaum1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Bhattacherjee1">[42]</xref>. In the ocular tissue, exposure to LPS is known to induce the breakdown of the blood–aqueous barrier, which leads to protein transudate in the anterior chamber, infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into the eye, and production of multiple proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1 and ICAM-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-deVos1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Rosenbaum1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Ooi1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Tuaillon1">[44]</xref>. The overproduction of these cytokines is mediated through NF-κB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Yadav1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Kubota1">[46]</xref>. These clinical, biochemical, immunological and histological characteristics make EIU a suitable in vivo model to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of drugs for the treatment of inflammatory ocular diseases in humans.</p>
      <p>The first report suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of PAP, the protein that peptide was derived from, was based on an <italic>ex vivo</italic> model of isolated lung. In that model, PAP administration reduced the edema and synthesis of thromboxane A2 induced by fMLP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Heller1">[18]</xref>. There are also researchers proving that PAP could block inflammatory responses induced by TNF-α in different cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Gironella1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Vasseur1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-FolchPuy1">[22]</xref>). In the present study, we showed for the first time that PAPep, which was derived from PAP protein, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in ocular inflammation induced by LPS, a TLR4 agonist. We demonstrated that intravitreal injection of PAPep could significantly reduce EIU clinical scores, decrease the number of infiltrating inflammatory cells and the protein leakage into the anterior chamber, and suppress histopathologic changes of EIU. Moreover, the intravetreal administration of PAPep also significantly diminished TNF-α and IL-6 production in the AqH of the eye during EIU, and suppressed the LPS-induced mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in RAW 264.7 cell as well. These results are in accordance with previous work by Vasseur et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Vasseur1">[20]</xref> who reported that in rat macrophages in vitro, PAP could almost completely prevent the induction of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression. However, whether the peptide has anti-inflammatory effect on other TLR agonists remains unknown and need further studies.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that leukocytes are markedly attracted to inflamed ocular tissues such as the iris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Planck1">[47]</xref>, vitreous cavity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Noda1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-HafeziMoghadam1">[49]</xref>, and retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Miyahara1">[50]</xref> in the EIU model, with neutrophils and macrophages being major leukocyte constituents. MCP-1 is known as one of the important determinants of leucocyte recruitment, and is up-regulated during EIU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Tuaillon1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Satofuka1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Miyazaki1">[52]</xref>. Our study demonstrated that PAPep could directly affect the expression of MCP-1 in ocular tissues in a dose-dependent manner, thus counteracting the inflammatory response by inhibiting leukocyte recruitment into the eye. These results were consistent with what we showed in histopathology study that LPS-induced acute inflammation caused the increase of leukocyte recruitment into the eye, while PAPep treatment significantly reduced the infiltrated leukocytes into the ICB and posterior vitreous cavity.</p>
      <p>Increased expression of adhesion molecules is another important factor involved in the pathogenesis of EIU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Noda1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Satofuka1">[51]</xref>, and ICAM-1 is known to be a key molecule in which its reduction results in attenuation of leukocyte adhesion and/or transmigration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-HafeziMoghadam1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Withcup1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Lin1">[54]</xref>. Previous reports demonstrated that PAP significantly inhibited TNF-α induced adhesion molecule upregulation in HUVECs in a dose dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Gironella1">[19]</xref>. In our study, we found that PAPep significantly decreased the protein levels of ICAM-1 in the inflamed ICB and retina complexes. Moreover, it effectively blocked ICAM-1 expression in TNF-α–stimulated HUVECs by Western blot and inhibited the binding of U937 cells to TNF-α–stimulated HUVECs. These data suggested that PAPep is involved in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression and counteracts the inflammatory response by inhibiting leucocyte recruitment and adhesion in the ocular tissue as well as vascular endothelium, which was agreed with the previous studies.</p>
      <p>NF-kB is one of the most ubiquitous transcription factors that regulate gene expressions involved in cellular proliferation, inflammatory responses, and cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Novotny1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Wang1">[56]</xref>. Upon stimulation with a wide variety of stimuli including LPS and TNF-α, NF-kB translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and plays important roles in sustained inflammatory responses. Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Li1">[57]</xref> demonstrated a significant upregulation of activated NF-kB in the iris-ciliary body (ICB) during EIU. Previous studies have reported that the anti-inflammatory effects of PAP are mediated through the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Vasseur1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-FerrsMas1">[23]</xref>. Our data also indicate that intravetreal PAPep treatment prevents LPS-induced NF-κB translocation/activation in the ICB and retina tissue in EIU rats and in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells as well. In addition, PAPep also inhibited the TNF-α-evoked activation of NF-κB in HUVECs. These results indicate that PAPep exerted anti-inflammatory effect probably associated with the inhibition of NF-κB activation, and resulted in reduction of ocular inflammatory responses.</p>
      <p>In order to observed its safety during injection into the vitreous cavity. The intraocular tolerance of PAPep was tested in normal rats. No inflammation or adverse reaction such as cataract or vitreous opacity was observed in the injected eyes during evaluation by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, suggesting that PAPep is well tolerated in the eye in the short term. We thus preliminarily confirmed the short-term safety of PAPep when administrated intravitreally. However, long-term side effects of the peptide need to be evaluated by multiple injections of the peptide with longer observation period. Further specific toxicological studies should also be performed before any clinical application.</p>
      <p>Endotoxin-induced uveitis develops within 24 h of endotoxin challenge, with spontaneous regression within 48 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Rosenbaum1">[41]</xref>. Accordingly, we observed the efficacy of PAPep only up to 24 hours after injection, which is relatively short time frame of observation. Hence, long-term study is necessary to determine treatment efficacy of PAPep in chronic uveitis in the future.</p>
      <p>A key finding in this study is that PAPep is a newly discovered peptide derived from human PAP. Although its anti-inflammatory activity is not as strong as that of corticosteroids, it has significant merits compared to conventional proteins and large synthetic molecules as discussed above, which make it good candidate for ocular application. However, there are still disadvantages of small peptides as drugs, one of them being short half-life in vivo. Since the predicted half-life of PAPep is only 4.4 hrs, frequent and repeated dosing would be inevitably required for treatment. Therefore, future studies should focus on overcoming these disadvantages by chemical modification or conjugation to a macromolecule to increase its half-life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Werle1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Xie1">[59]</xref>. Measures could also be taken to improve its delivery system with safer and non-invasive route, such as intravitreous drug delivery system in a biodegradable polymer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Li2">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029155-Cheng1">[61]</xref>, to maintain a constant concentration of peptide in the vitreous cavity for an extended period of time to avoid repeated intravitreal injections. Moreover, topical treatment such as eye drops or ointment is another option under the condition that the peptide has the capability of penetrating cornea and anterior chamber, which will also be evaluated in future studies. These efforts might help to promote the development of novel peptide drugs and their clinical applications.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our results suggest that intravitreal injection of PAPep, a newly identified peptide derived from PAP, can significantly attenuate ocular inflammation in EIU rats and dampen the inflammatory damage by affecting diverse components of the inflammatory response, including cytokine production and adhesion molecule expression. The possible mechanism for this effect of PAPep may depend on its ability to inhibit the activation of NF-kB. The exact mechanism through which PAPep exerts its anti-inflammatory effect is under active investigation.</p>
